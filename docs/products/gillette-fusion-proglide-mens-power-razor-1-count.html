            <li>/&gt;+Extremely close shave--the best I&#x27;ve had with any manual</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the best grip that I&#x27;ve ever had on any razor in my life.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it makes for an easier shave is an awesome thing.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>I received the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li>Best of all, I have not cut myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the handle, but as for the power part, I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>

            <li>I was very happy to use the razor!</li>

            <li>The razor is awesome.  </li>
            <li>It has a very great grip on the sides and does not slip.</li>

            <li>AND THERE IS A GREAT GRIP FOR SHOWER USE!</li>
            <li>This razor shaves awesome!</li>
            <li>Awesome razor!</li>
            <li>The vibrating handle allows this thing to give a great shave!</li>
            <li>This is the best shave i have ever had.</li>
            <li>Mix it with the gillette shave gel and it is awesome</li>
            <li>I have had the best shaving experience with a mukti-blade razor than ever before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it was an excellent experience.</li>
            <li>This razor is the best ever.  </li>
            <li>This razor is great!!</li>
            <li>Also, the micropulses were AWESOME!</li>
            <li>/&gt;One of the best -- if not the best -- razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a great product!</li>
            <li>However, this razor is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>this is not the best choice.</li>
            <li>Best razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to have a close shave!!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still the best razor I used in years.</li>
            <li>excellent product and seller.</li>
            <li>excellent xmas gift for men.</li>
            <li>I bought this for $4 on Amazon in July&#x27;10, I must say that this is the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>Its the best partner.   </li>
            <li>Without doubt this product provides the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the best on the market, but it isn&#x27;t perfection.  </li>
            <li>FUSION PROGLIDE IS DEFINITELY BEST SHAVE</li>
            <li>I thought the FUSION was the best</li>
            <li>I recomment this shaver as the best on the market!</li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide is Gillette&#x27;s best razor since the Mach 3.    </li>
            <li>The proglide works great!</li>
            <li>for me, it truly is the best shave I have ever had and have been looking for for years.</li>
            <li>It works perfect with the power vibration.</li>
            <li>packaging is excellent ...</li>
            <li>This is probably the best shave you&#x27;ll ever have if you&#x27;re used to using disposable blades.</li>
            <li>It was awesome with closer shaving and the blades lasted one month for me!      </li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the BEST razor that I have used, ever!</li>
            <li>Ended up buying the 3-1 gillette and that is awesome too.</li>
            <li>To my amazement, the shave was still superb with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Shaving was done with the power feature on and off, but either way the shave is excellent.    </li>
            <li>I got this for a song and with 5 blades it works great!</li>
            <li>This was an excellent purchase.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best of the manual and electric shaving worlds.  </li>
            <li>Must admit I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>Priceless!</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>and I was impressed that they wanted to pass on my experience to their staff.</li>
            <li>I saw a great deal on the Schick Hydro 5 and just thought I will try that for a change and what a change it was!!</li>
            <li>it will be very happy for us</li>
            <li>but I inadvertently found it to be an excellent razor for the bikini</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, it&#x27;s not the best razor for legs.  </li>
            <li>This is the best razor I&#x27;ve used yet, and while I&#x27;ll probably stick to an electric for day-to-day shaving, this will work as a perfect substitute when I&#x27;m charging that one up.</li>
            <li>This razor is the best razor that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Best razor ever!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best razor I ever had.</li>
            <li>That is great customer support!</li>
            <li>This has been the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Best shave ever.</li>
            <li>The ergonomics are the best I&#x27;ve come across, well balanced, correctly angled head, substantial weight with battery installed.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll take that \\&quot;Best</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best.  </li>
            <li>The best up to this point from my experience is the Merkur Model 180.  </li>
            <li>the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>A great purchase even if it was an Amazon vine purchase!</li>
            <li>But I am thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very impressive.</li>
            <li>am highly impressed by the Fusion Proglide Power Razor.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was the best razor out there.</li>
            <li>This IS the best razor yet.</li>
            <li>Best Razor which I have.</li>
            <li>Where I see the greatest difference between this razor and razors like Mach 3 and the Gillete Power Fusion is when I shave my head.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li>, it was excellent.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best razor for sensative skin.</li>
            <li>and cant wait to shave again good job Gillette!!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it comes with the AAA battery.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>This razor is absolutely priceless!</li>
            <li>All in all, I have found the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to be an excellent razor handle.</li>
            <li>The razor blades are excellent, high-quality razor blades that I would recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle has to be the best handle on the market.</li>
            <li>They truly are \\&quot;The Best</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>One of the best shaves I ever had.  </li>
            <li>Its close, non-abrasion shave is best that I have had in 27 years of shaving.</li>
            <li>The design is perfect!</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>performance on my neck was also impressive.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with this razor!</li>
            <li>She says it works GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li>However, since I found the Fusion Power razor, I feel that I have the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>The power handle is AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>Best product packaging yet for a razor handle.</li>
            <li>was the best handle I have ever used.</li>
            <li>have to say, I was completely impressed.</li>
            <li>Keep up the great work!!</li>
            <li>Excellent shave and excellent product.</li>
            <li>The handle is sturdy, and the vibration feature is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>And the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razors are the best razors on the market.  </li>
            <li>They give you the best shave, with no nicks/cuts.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle has really impressed me.</li>
            <li>in all, I would recommend adding the Power Handle to the Power Blades for the BEST shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I have been very happy with the shave and will soon be buying refills for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.</li>
            <li>but I &#x27;m not to impressed by the vibrator.</li>
            <li>As to the closeness of the shave, the 3 blade product made by Gillette is still an excellent product</li>
            <li>it was perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>,IT MADE BY THE BEST COMPANY FOR MENS SHAVING PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a great product!  </li>
            <li>I recieved this razor as part of a promotion done by Gillette, and it is te best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t owned one before, but I was really impressed by the shaving experience after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But let me tell you, I was very happy with the shave.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is the best.</li>

            <li>Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor is great!</li>
            <li>the weight of the handle is perfect.</li>
            <li>This newest model of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor is the best yet.  </li>
            <li>This razor is awesome!</li>
            <li>It was one of the smoothest shaves that I have ever gotten from a disposable razor, and I was very impressed with the way it worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The power capability that this disposable razor provides you with one of the best hybrid razor shaves around.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The Proglide Power razor was excellent.  </li>
            <li>were excellent as well.  </li>
            <li>the handle for this razor is perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes out of the packaging with ease which is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I said, best razor</li>
            <li>The Fusion ProGlide is the best manual shaver I have used  to date.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Cannot be beaten by even the best electric razors (I&#x27;ve tried the series 7 Braun recently).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;m not as impressed as I hoped to be...</li>
            <li>My wife and I both have this razor and found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still not the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>and I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>The motor in the handle feels perfect without being overkill.  </li>
            <li>I would say it gave me the best shave ever.</li>
            <li>but it does the job great!</li>
            <li>The handle on this razor is awesome - it is not like the others when it comes to size.  </li>
            <li>These has got to be the best handle invented.  </li>
            <li>This feature brings together the best of two worlds: the smoothness of a blade shave with the vibration feature of an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>After using it now for about a week, it is the best razor I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>This razor gave me an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>I have been a user of their products for over 7 years and thought that I had found the Mach III Power to be the best that they made.</li>
            <li>My best yet!</li>
            <li>However, I was not overly impressed with the micropulses.  </li>
            <li>The side grips on the handle are great!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is the best razor on the market today!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my proglide razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all of Gillette&#x27;s manual razors and this is the best that&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the manual shave.</li>
            <li>This razor works flawlessly !</li>
            <li>I put some shaving cream on and I shaved my beard, and I will just tell you it is the best</li>
            <li>This has provided me with a great shave!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the ProGlide Power Razor to anyone in search of the perfect shave.</li>
            <li>I received the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li>Best of all, I have not cut myself.</li>
            <li>Really great!</li>
            <li>The ergonomic handle is the perfect size for your hand and helps you get the perfect shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of which, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle gave me one of the best shaves I have ever had!  </li>
            <li>This Gillett Fusion proglide was very impressive.  </li>
            <li>It works with the razor cartridge to glide over your face in perfect form to give you the cleanest, closest and perfect shave.</li>
            <li>This is, without a doubt, the best razor on the market today.</li>

            <li>It worked great!</li>
            <li>and I was impressed with how close the shave was.</li>

            <li>Very good razor</li>
            <li>I think that is a very fair price for the quality you get in this product.</li>
            <li>The grips on the underside give you very good control.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is very good, as I haven&#x27;t had to change them out in the six months I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Very good value.</li>
            <li>The razor has a very good grip.</li>
            <li>I thought the razor was the ideal lovechild between a handheld razor and an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The difference was incredible.</li>
            <li>The balance in the handle was just perfect for going around my chin and the blade was great.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s razor is incredible.  </li>
            <li>It gave me one of the best shaves I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>handle gets incredibly slippery.</li>
            <li>The razor feels great in your hand with its rubber grips and perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great blades, great razor!</li>
            <li>The blades are great and everything, but the best part for me was the feel of the razor itself in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the both the comfort and quality of the shave great product.  </li>
            <li>What this leaves you with a great shape and sized handle that fits perfectly in your hand.  </li>
            <li>This lightweight handle has great rubber grips that allow for perfect shaving control.</li>
            <li>end opinion is: if your already using a Mach 3, just stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;I think your best investment would be to find a good shaving cream/gel, that works best for you!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>BUT, if you are looking for a great shave, this razor is excellent!</li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICE AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT... WILL RECOMEND..</li>

            <li>The battery life is also incredible.</li>
            <li>Win win!</li>
            <li>I also used the trimmer blade around my sideburns and it was very effective at shaping the sides with excellent control.  </li>
            <li>Loved the razor!  </li>
            <li>I know how good theses work!</li>
            <li>This is as good of an at-home shaving experience as you can ask for!</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing Gillette did some &#x27;beta testing&#x27; or focus groups or something, because the handle is great.</li>
            <li>(gray hair, LOL).</li>
            <li>in all, it is a great combo product.</li>

            <li>But let me tell you this is a great razor.</li>
            <li>what a great shave.</li>
            <li>I have been ranting to my friends about what a great razor this is</li>
            <li>pivoting head provides great razor to face contact throughout the shave.</li>
            <li>It also has a great ergonomic, non-slip handle.</li>
            <li>This is a great option to have all in one product.</li>
            <li>The handle feels great.</li>
            <li>The handle worked great.</li>
            <li>All around great razor.</li>
            <li>so i get a great shave.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a great razor handle</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this truly is a great product.</li>
            <li>I received the razor via a program run by Gillette, and boy was I happy I did.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor and the electric function</li>
            <li>I think this razor is great</li>
            <li>GREAT job</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor handle does a great job as it is designed.</li>
            <li>This razor works great.  </li>
            <li>It was great</li>
            <li>The handle had a great feel to it and had a great grip so that it was not slippery.  </li>
            <li>This was a great product to try and now im hooked.</li>
            <li>It did a great job.  </li>
            <li>The ProGlide Blades themselves are great</li>
            <li>I like the power series a lot and think it does a great job</li>
            <li>GREAT for travel!&lt;br /&gt;+Blades pop on and off</li>
            <li>This is a great handle that you can buy at a superstore/grocery store.  </li>
            <li>DId I mention that is looks great.  </li>
            <li>When using the shaver the blades seemed to cut great.</li>
            <li>, I am always happy with these razors.  </li>
            <li>Gillettte always presents a great quality product and this was no exception.</li>
            <li>Great handle on the Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to give this handle a try.</li>
            <li>When changing blades this button works great.</li>
            <li>Once you push the power button, it makes all the difference combining a great blade with vibration gets you an even closer shave.</li>
            <li>What a great shave it was.</li>
            <li>Awesome look and trendy.</li>
            <li>Great product all around.</li>
            <li>I did expect it to be as great as it was.  </li>
            <li>I have never used a power razor before and it was great.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Mach 3 for years and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I must say the handle on this product is great.</li>
            <li>I found this razor a great substitute for an electric razor, which I have used for years.</li>
            <li>Great job Amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to overstate things, but this is the smoothest, easiest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I liked the fusion, but didn&#x27;t think it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Amazon has great info and instructions.</li>
            <li>great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>It is an all around great razor.  </li>
            <li>I give it four stars because it is a great razor</li>
            <li>GRIP FEELS GREAT IN HAND.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;power\\&quot; option with battery and all sounds great, but doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>matter HOW great my shaves have been using Gillette products, invariably I wince each &amp; every time I go into a store to purchase replacement blades.</li>
            <li>: did the Proglide shave great?</li>
            <li>Spend the $10 and buy this now it really is amazing and the best shave ive ever gotten.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s orange, that one used to work great.</li>
            <li>so I knew this was a great inexpensive razor.  </li>
            <li>I am a woman and never can understand why they market the great razors to men.  </li>
            <li>&quot;, I think this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the blades.</li>
            <li>If you have been a Gillette man like me give the Hydro 5 a chance its cheaper than Gillette and wont hurt, it could give you great shaves and save a lot of money over time.</li>
            <li>Great deal from Amazon so that helps with justifying the price.  </li>
            <li>The power and non power are both great but the vibration from the power is like a massage for your face</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It works great,</li>
            <li>While Gillette&#x27;s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great razor if you can handle buying the blades.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great product.</li>
            <li>but I would imagine it also produces a great shave.  </li>
            <li>how well it contours to curves, and that&#x27;s great and all, but I never had a problem with it before this version of the razor.</li>
            <li>It is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>It is a great improvement to an already great razor.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor i ever own, it gives you the baby finish</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Felt great.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>but this one does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great blade.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this razor.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d probably be just as happy without the vibrating handle.</li>
            <li>This gave me a great close shave.</li>
            <li>It gave me a great close shave each and every time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced from one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I need all the help I can get to keep my face from getting irritated, great product.</li>
            <li>Over all this is a great shaving handle for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was mind-blowing and because of that I have to say all in all, it&#x27;s been great and Gillette has made me a fan.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>It is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>But the handle was great.  </li>
            <li>But it truly gets great results.</li>
            <li>Thank you a great product.</li>
            <li>I got a great shave and the blades didn&#x27;t clog at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Altogether, the features of this handle and blade combo provided me with a great shave.</li>
            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried them yet, it&#x27;s a must have for a great shave.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>it has a great grip so if your using in the shower you will have no problems holding the razor.</li>
            <li>Thanx Gillette for the opportunity to test this great product.</li>
            <li>This razor is great.</li>
            <li>and you have a great razor handle.</li>
            <li>This on be too is sturdy and feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li>It is great for a close shave without irritation or nicks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the build and quality of the product is great, I don&#x27;t find myself wanting to switch to it as my go to razor.</li>
            <li>I think it does a great job shaving</li>
            <li>I have used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor quite a bit now, and the results are great.</li>
            <li>I always have a great shave when i use this product</li>
            <li>and i am a happy customer.</li>
            <li>In fact, id say the closest blade shave ive experienced.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor.</li>
            <li>This is a Great Razor.</li>
            <li>The handle felt great in my hand, not a bit bulky like I feared it might be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I thought this was a great product and one</li>
            <li>Great, great razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its great as a short-term power razor, maybe a year at tops.</li>

            <li>Great all around product.</li>
            <li>This razor is great.</li>

            <li>Well, I must say this razor provides a nice shave but its not the best.</li>
            <li>The button to turn the power on is a great improvement too.</li>
            <li>It does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great if you want to keep water marks off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The difference is not that great</li>
            <li>gillette fusion proguide styler is great</li>
            <li>that clouded my review but honestly, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>and it still did great.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m just shaving my cheeks and neck under the beard, but it does great.</li>

            <li>We just choose not to use the vibration feature and be perfectly happy.</li>

            <li>The razor does give a great shave</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy to report that it&#x27;s still holding strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor.  </li>
            <li>The handle has a great grip to it.</li>
            <li>The blades are great, haven&#x27;t cut myself yet.</li>
            <li>Since I have to shave every day, I don&#x27;t mind spending what it takes to get a great shave.</li>
            <li>The razor itself worked great.</li>
            <li>I have not received any nicks or cuts using this blade nor have I experienced any bumps or burns.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results it gave me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Proglide Power razor for a bit  now, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Yet I experienced zero irritation...</li>
            <li>A radical improvement on an already great product.</li>
            <li>It is a great razor and give me a great shave with no cuts</li>
            <li>Even without the gel or cream, I haven&#x27;t experienced any tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li>Over all great product.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a nice compliment to some of the best razor cartridges I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>these work great.</li>
            <li>My experience on the handle was great.</li>
            <li>Great length and size for shaving also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great product with a great outcome every time.</li>
            <li>The microComb does a great job of trimming my sideburns, no \\&quot;Lamb</li>
            <li>Overs one of the closest shaves out there and is a really great price.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to try out the Fusion Proglide Power through a Gillette promo.</li>
            <li>handle feels great in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed of how great the product worked..</li>
            <li>The blades are the smoothest that I have experienced.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide has a great handle.</li>
            <li>The rubbery handle is ergonomic and allows for great grip and control.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Gillette makes great razors, but the Fusion Proglide Power Razor is just not for me.</li>
            <li>I got this as part of a promotion from Gillette, and can definitively say this cuts great.</li>
            <li>Great razor handle.  </li>
            <li>in all the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is a great razor and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I love the closeness of this shaver!!</li>
            <li>Very nice, close, painless shave.</li>
            <li>I very nice razor</li>
            <li>The thing handles chins very nicely and does not cut you up at all.</li>
            <li>The razor fits and feels very nice in the hand.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I found that the handle was very nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent product Gillette, just go easy on the price!</li>
            <li>this product is very good, not imagined how good it is, I recommend the Gillette outdone, loved the product can now shave every day.</li>
            <li>it leaves the cleanest cut and the grip is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>IT IS AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>They both do an amazing job!</li>
            <li>The razor is amazing!</li>
            <li>and I am still receiving amazing shaves each and every day!</li>
            <li>This Gillette razor is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Best razor ever and thank you Gillette for giving it free!</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is one of the best around.</li>
            <li>The built in grips feel good and allow for great control.</li>
            <li>The shave is excellent, but even better is that the frustrations I just mentioned have been minimized.</li>
            <li>Love that it could be used in the shower and fits perfectly in my hands.</li>
            <li>The blades are also fairly forgiving on skin (I tend to shave without shaving cream and rarely experienced any razor burn with the fusion</li>
            <li>Fair price great service.  </li>
            <li>He also told me to leave it alone, and to buy my own!  </li>
            <li>Either way, if you have the money, buy what works for YOU and don&#x27;t let anybody tell you different.not justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best razor I have ever used in more than 25 years of shaving.</li>
            <li>Really, really nice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll begin by saying that I&#x27;ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>I love this razor and feel it is one of the best on the market!</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I have ever owned, and I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>Good shipping and works great in my walk-in closet</li>
            <li>They have a sixth blade on the top for shaving your neck, what an awesome feature!  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for people looking for a great razor at a good price point.</li>
            <li>I love Gillette as this razor created the perfect shave and no rash!</li>
            <li>What a nice razor!</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have used many razors, both manual and electric, and have to say that the Proglide gave me the best shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so close and nice!  </li>
            <li>Loving it!</li>
            <li>and I can safely say it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>But after a week of the Fusion Proglide, I am happy to report that my face feels as good as it did on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked the vibrating handle on this thing!</li>
            <li>I found that to be the most impressive part of the razor, and that&#x27;s why I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>but i am here to honestly tell you that I was blown away with the improvement that it made!  </li>
            <li>The grip is perfect and allows one to get a great shave with easy strokes.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this handle felt great and is an exceptional partner to the ProGlide razor blade.</li>
            <li>It gave me a really pleasant feeling that reminded me of using my electric shaver</li>
            <li>The Pro Glide Power Razor has me pleasantly</li>
            <li>However, when I tried the Pro Glide Power Razor I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is easily one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>The handle is the perfect size, easy to move around in your hands, and</li>
            <li>This is easily one, if not the best razor I have used for shaving my head/face.</li>
            <li>The battery is easy to install and the power button is in the perfect spot, your thumb just seems to hit it without thinking about it.</li>
            <li>The power button is perfectly positioned for easy activation.</li>
            <li>The razor handle made the razor easy to maneuver and get the best shave you can.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is awesome and still growing strong.  </li>
            <li>The sensation wasn&#x27;t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.</li>
            <li>The sensation wasn&#x27;t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.</li>
            <li>The handle is beautifully designed and feels nice in the hand,  The shave it provides was better than very good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gillette produces great shaving &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34;.. every one is better than the one before it!</li>
            <li>When I was shaving every day, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, very smooth and nice</li>
            <li>Along with a great shave, the handle was very comfortable, with a great grip.</li>
            <li>Very good razor, I will be buying more blades and making this my permanent razor.  </li>
            <li>This thing is loaded with great features to have a great shave with, but after getting used to the features at the top of the razor, I&#x27;ve been noticing</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best I&#x27;ve encountered so far, and Costco carries them so I can get the best deal on replacement blades.</li>
            <li>It feels good in your hand but did nothing to enhance my shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I received this razor free from a program run by Gillette and I am very happy I did.  </li>
            <li>The handle is serviceable and provides good grip and maneuverability.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Impressed, I got it for free via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>in all, this is a fantastic razor handle and would be perfect for those with</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s got a good weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Just used the razor and loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the Fusion ProGlide Power shavers around for a while, but I&#x27;ve thought that they were probably a good way to make faceburger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that the vibrating blades did not slice my face into ribbons, and I did get a nice close shave from it.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Another sign of good workmanship.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Gillette products, this one is good.</li>
            <li>good shave</li>
            <li>The Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power handle has a good feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li>so I figured it would be a good time to test this Powered ProGlide.  </li>
            <li>Good job</li>
            <li>It just glided over my skin the vibrations were soothing and the well designed handle felt good in my hand.</li>
            <li>he loved it.</li>
            <li>is a good position so that you aren&#x27;t turning it off during your shave.</li>
            <li>and it promises a good shave.</li>
            <li>With a good blade</li>
            <li>My free razor provided by a program run by Gillette was just perfect.</li>
            <li>I loved the razor.</li>
            <li>When I got the confirmation that the razor had shipped, I chose not to shave until it came in so that I could give it a fair try.  </li>
            <li>The handle had a superior grip.</li>
            <li>I got to try it for free from Gillette, and I am very happy that I got the opportunity.</li>
            <li>The razor has a good weight to it when the battery is inserted and it looks and feels like it could withstand just about anything.  </li>
            <li>fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the razor</li>
            <li>I think I would get just as good of shave without having the \\&quot;power feature\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a good handle that my hand can wrap around.  </li>
            <li>Good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I loved the handle grip and weight.</li>
            <li>The good news is that the handle is fully compatible with the Fusion Power cartridge and vice versa.</li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle free to try from Gillette and I am very happy with my experience.</li>
            <li>and this does not work good at all with the power handle or blades.</li>
            <li>It gives the best shave and makes the skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>but I shave my head as well and have loved the results.  </li>
            <li>Good job guys.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s actually a good thing when you&#x27;re throwing something in a travel bag and don&#x27;t want it to accidentally activate.  </li>
            <li>I get a close comfortable shave from this, and use it over my electric razor any time I need to look my best.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor.</li>
            <li>it is still a good shave</li>
            <li>* good grip&lt;br /</li>
            <li>good:</li>
            <li>They still have that wonderful, smooth feeling against my sheets when I climb into bed that night.</li>
            <li>The best shave ever, smooth and close.  </li>
            <li>But the proglide is so good</li>
            <li>You can buy a good quality boar bristle shaving brush for $15, or as part of a set, which you use to apply the soaps from inside the dishes.   </li>
            <li>I was very impressed by how smooth this glides over my face.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a good quality razor and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Good job this time around, Gillette.ith the old-fashioned shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li>Good job this time around, Gillette.</li>
            <li>Good job, Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Once he used it, he was delighted.</li>
            <li>Yes, it was THAT good.</li>
            <li>In fact it was a superior shave all around.</li>
            <li>I have since been getting good results from it.  </li>
            <li>The fusion was good</li>
            <li>it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was</li>
            <li>ALl we need is a good functional shaver.</li>
            <li>and that was good</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a really good razor when you consider the price.</li>
            <li>Really a good razor with no complaints.</li>
            <li>Superior in all ways.  </li>
            <li>They are really good.</li>
            <li>Couple this with a good shaving cream</li>
            <li>I have a good razor.</li>
            <li>My replacement unit I purchased seems to be good.</li>
            <li>so although its a good close shave with the Proglide</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite know what good it does, myself.</li>
            <li>before, so I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s why this razor is as good as it is.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this razor and I loved the quality and ease of ordering this product.</li>
            <li>Of course, unless you get a good deal on one that makes it cheaper than a replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li>the razor is almost as good as the hype  </li>
            <li>it gives a really good shave</li>
            <li>it covers angles good shave  berman</li>
            <li>After seeing the price of refills I may regret using it, but it was nice to get a great shave.</li>
            <li>The razor feels good to hold</li>
            <li>but this was good too.</li>
            <li>There are two things that I have always loved about it.  </li>
            <li>Good buy and goodbye.</li>
            <li>I do not know how this compares to their Fusion and blah blah, but I do know that this is a good razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you heard, but Gillette just gave away some of these perfect pieces of machinery for free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one before but this was offered at a good price</li>
            <li>GOOD VALUE.</li>
            <li>In terms of cartridge razor &#x27;systems&#x27;, this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>Well good news, the word is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using a fusion power for years and think this one is equally good.</li>
            <li>did not have any irritation at, which was good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a good razor</li>
            <li>(3-4 shaves a week) and the blade is just as good as when I opened it.  </li>
            <li>The grip felt good in my hand, didn&#x27;t slide around on me and moved everywhere</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with how close the shave is and how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>I did not use this feature, but think it is a good safeguard in case someone does accidently leave the power on.</li>
            <li>she was delighted.  </li>
            <li>I had a three day beard growing (waiting of shaver to arrive), and after I used it my wife said that my face was like a babies bottom (I assume that was a good thing).  </li>
            <li>works well, good price</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>This product is an excellent product, its design makes for a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a good handle that my hand can wrap around.</li>
            <li>The handle was of good quality; its sturdy feeling complemented an ergonomic grip.  </li>
            <li>The handle on this razor is superior to the Bic razors I have used.  </li>
            <li>but it was a good shave.  </li>
            <li>It has a great shut off feature which comes in handy to prevent it accidentally being turned on in a drawer or during travel.</li>
            <li>good razor.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this razor was an exceptionally good razor.  </li>
            <li>which is good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked gillette&#x27;s products and this is another great addition to the Gillette family of razors.</li>
            <li>The grip feel good and snug between the fingers and palm.  </li>
            <li>It is a good quality razor.</li>
            <li>All in all a good razor</li>
            <li>shave was good, but I blame the blades for the quality, not the sonic screwdriver that they were attached to.</li>
            <li>One of the smoother shaves I have had in a good while.</li>
            <li>The handle is attractive, efficient and  effective.  </li>
            <li>I has a Gillette Mack 3 and Gillette Fusion is a superior product.</li>
            <li>But as soon i bought this product and started using it , I just loved it.</li>
            <li>It feeld good in my hand and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>do like that the razor gave me a good shave and didn&#x27;t damage my skin.</li>
            <li>The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It felt good in my hand</li>
            <li>I always get really good shaves with this razor</li>
            <li>would recommend this product based on how good the blade cartridges are.</li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide Power is definitely a good razor</li>
            <li>The handle has a good grip and the blade does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor handle that cuts nice and close.  </li>
            <li>I find the Proglide a good improvement over the fusion blade.</li>
            <li>will say that this is a good razor, but the battery &amp; the vibration, I have tried it, and see no benefit.</li>
            <li>No problems at all, shaved as good as ever.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I loved this razor.</li>
            <li>It feels really good, almost an extension of my hand.</li>
            <li>It feels like it was perfectly designed to fit snugly in the hand</li>
            <li>The razor blades are good and do a good job.</li>
            <li>It was nice to see that it had a feature to shut off if on longer than 8 Minutes, great for travel.</li>
            <li>I loved the handle.  </li>
            <li>Good size</li>
            <li>vibration seems to help my skin react to the shave and gives me a good feeling during and after.</li>
            <li>handle fits nicely in my hand, which gives me great control during my shave.  </li>
            <li>The handle had a superior grip.</li>
            <li>For example, when shaving under my chin, the grip I used caused a fair bit of fatigue in my hand.</li>
            <li>Best thing they ever did was to send a free one in the mail when I turned 18.  </li>
            <li>It does just as good a job.</li>
            <li>It shaves good but the refills cost</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to guess 5 blades is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>This razor is quite good.  </li>
            <li>There is on the bottom, however, which doesn&#x27;t seem to do any good.</li>
            <li>it is overal a good product from close shave to the feel of the handle.</li>
            <li>I have always had good luck with Gillette&#x27;s blades and this one did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>It allows me to get a good line on my side burns and goatee.</li>
            <li>I get an excellent grip on the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor that I got from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I used this razor yesterday and loved it.  </li>
            <li>i wake up in the morning, pound some coffee, and hit the latrine for the good ole</li>
            <li>Gilette sent me a free razor to try out the power glide and it was an awesome shave as always!</li>
            <li>The vibrating handle seems to either help the blades through the cut, or masks the pulling sensation, but either way it was a good experience.  </li>
            <li>best compliment I can offer is this - I received a sample of this product free via a program run by Gillette and it made me a believer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>I used to use a two blade razor, but after trying this razor after receiving it for free from a program run by Gillette, I have to say I am extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin and does not cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have EVER had (and the vibration felt good on my skin).</li>
            <li>Loved the styler and the razor.</li>
            <li>The handle felt good in my hand</li>
            <li>while shaving the grip felt good even when shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>and I got a good amount of uses out of it.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, balanced weight and feels like something sturdy that would give you a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I got to try it for free from Gillette, and I am very happy that I got the opportunity.</li>
            <li>FEELS good against my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have as good of an experience.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Original Fusion for years and this was awesome!  </li>
            <li>I was able to achieve a superior shave than before, one that lasted all through the day!</li>
            <li>All in all a great tool for getting that clean shave you desire!!</li>
            <li>It feels very comfortable and smooth and has provided me with one of the best shaves I have experienced.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor for times when you need a good shave quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is a great razor handle and probably the best and most comfortable of any razor handle that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>really liked the design of the handle; it looked good, felt good</li>
            <li>The rubber gripping on the top of the handle is perfectly designed.  </li>
            <li>And the best part is that the blade is so great it just takes on pass over each area to provide a shave much smoother than my electric razor could ever do.</li>
            <li>It really feels great and provided me with a wonderful shave.  </li>
            <li>The power handle helps the awesome razor heads give a nice close shave while still be comfortable and</li>
            <li>I was very happy to be able to try this product for FREE via a program run by Gilllette!</li>
            <li>razor.&lt;br /&gt;+Nice ergonomics and feel to the handle, and looks nice too.&lt;br /&gt;+Comes with an awesome plastic case that securely holds the razor and can clip in a 4-pack of replacement blades underneath.</li>
            <li>Between the superb handle and the tremendous razor, I found myself with the closest, smoothest, easiest shave-job of my life.  </li>
            <li>How many more times can you upgrade a shaver, works great!!</li>
            <li>The handle fits perfectly in my hand allowing more control and a better shave.</li>
            <li>I use the the Razor with the power on for a nice smooth shave and it is great because it does not pull my skin which in return does not cut me!!</li>
            <li>I received a free Fusion Proglide power from Gillette give away program, and can honestly say I have had the best shaves of my life using this razor.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that I tried this razor, and even better that I got it for free!</li>
            <li>The rubber grips are nicely positioned and shaped to make for a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a great product and provide a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable to use and the blades are great.</li>
            <li>Quality isn&#x27;t an issue here: the razor looks great, and gives me a very smooth shave.</li>

            <li>Very good comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>handle was very enjoyable to hold.  </li>
            <li>I was more than happy to accept this razor from the program by Gillette.</li>
            <li>However the handle must have some magic to it as my face felt great after the shave.  </li>
            <li>It provides a great shave either way, and I love how the handle sits in your hand.</li>
            <li>I was happy to receive the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power via a program run by Gillette to review as I&#x27;m always looking for a better razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are always coming out with very innovative products.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor and the battery power makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the comfort and performance.  </li>
            <li>we are both very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>it be great if our face razors were made in usa and just costing alot instead of wasting time which is something we can&#x27;t replace and can cost more .this</li>
            <li>there are so many factors that go in to a great shave.</li>
            <li>Both my wife I have been a &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; time Atra Plus razor users and we were very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have just treated myself to one of the most smoothest and closest shaves I have EVER experienced.</li>
            <li>a razor with this many blades is great.</li>
            <li>At the very most - and I think I&#x27;m being a bit too generous here -</li>
            <li>I received this razor courtesy of a program run by Gillette, and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It works great, but I can&#x27;t use it continuously for more than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought 2 packs for this and gifted 1 to my dad and he was really happy using this.</li>
            <li>It is a very interesting concept between an electric and disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>The blades gave me an incredibly close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the handle.</li>
            <li>I love the power option too, I felt it contributed to a great shave.</li>

            <li>Good razor and nice blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor and the vibrating handle is nice</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice box that&#x27;s a good holder for day to day.</li>
            <li>I recommend everyone buy this product, it really is very good and the seller met, I bought it and it has been very useful</li>
            <li>The razor itself is nicely balanced and feels good in the hands.</li>
            <li>The handle feels good in my hands and lends itself to an effective close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is great and easy to get a good grip.</li>
            <li>The handle is great too - has a good grip and makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice looking, holds the razor cartridge appropriately, and has a &amp;#34;nifty&amp;#34; vibration motor in it...</li>
            <li>i think that the handle is very good more than satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It has a great grip and is the perfect length for precision detail and complete control.</li>
            <li>Gillette has excellent products and I&#x27;m glad I got in on their promotion to try the razor and blades for free.  </li>
            <li>I had the most comfortable shave I had EVER experienced!</li>
            <li>I just tried the power version, and it is awesome because it seems to gives an even more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an excellent product, very well made, and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how this handle performs, and as my first powered vibrating handle, I must say I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>The handle is absolutely amazing, the rugged yet smooth grip is incredible.</li>
            <li>The micro-vibrations of the handle combined with the excellent replacement blades gave me the smoothest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had - even week-old stubble.  </li>
            <li>A great clean shave!</li>
            <li>The Lubrastrip was a pleasant addition, and the handle was very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Downside</li>
            <li>I love the micropulses handle with the side grips!</li>
            <li>I tried it out, and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been impressed with this razor since I first used it.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I mostly love it because of the razors handle!</li>
            <li>The power button, I have to say, it pretty awesome and glow blues.  </li>
            <li>while I can start to notice a bit of difference from the first shave, I am still impressed.  </li>
            <li>LOve the idea!</li>
            <li>Another innovative concept from Gillette!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this razor!</li>
            <li>But I will say I haven&#x27;t had a better shave except from a barber!</li>
            <li>I do think the first shave out of the package was just marvelous.  </li>
            <li>Well the first shave is extremely awesome.. then the quality  of shave drops from there..</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I did!    </li>
            <li>This is my first vibrating razor and I am thoroughly impressed!</li>
            <li>I Love that it has the vibrations!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Too many blades!</li>
            <li>Glad I got the razor and will keep using it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to use this one!</li>
            <li>I already warned her I better not catch her using it on her legs - its mine!</li>
            <li>My first shave with this razor was excellent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I made this change!</li>
            <li>For the first shave, I intentionally skipped a day to see how well it did, and was I impressed.  </li>

            <li>and I love this razor!  </li>
            <li>I suggest this razor to anybody looking for a smooth face!!</li>
            <li>It seems to cut a bit better than a non-powered handle, so it works for me!</li>
            <li>This review is specifically for the handle, which I was pretty impressed with.</li>
            <li>Sure!  </li>
            <li>I received this through a program run by Gillette and I&#x27;m so glad I signed up for it!</li>
            <li>Glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li>I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor!  </li>
            <li>this much more pleasant?  </li>
            <li>It glided so easily, and did a great job.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle is easy to grasp and use and the shave is like nothing you&#x27;ve experienced before.  </li>
            <li>The handle is great and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>excellent, easy to use, very good shaving experience, it does not irritate your beard, and leave the skin soft and</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this to anyone as a great option for a manual razor!</li>
            <li>The light weight and balanced handle felt great in my hand.</li>
            <li>I found the handle to be a great fit for my hands.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the amazing razor I received, but when the battery runs out I will hesitate to replace it.</li>
            <li>This Gillette fusion proglide razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>It just seems amazing.</li>
            <li>Gillette did an amazing job in the design and features of this handle.</li>
            <li>I felt as smooth as silk and looked great.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the Power is just amazing.</li>
            <li>It was a great smooth shave</li>
            <li>wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all i would reccommend this shaver, it was a great shave, not a lot of vibrating and was a comfortable grip to hold on to.</li>
            <li>WHAT A GREAT WAY TO GET A TRUELY SMOOTH SHAVE</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing, but I had to get used to the fact that it vibrated, or as they call it \\&quot;Micropulses\\</li>
            <li>Thank you Gillette for sending me this amazing product to try.</li>
            <li>Affordable and amazing shave that anyone can get in my eyes</li>
            <li>The shave I received from it was beyond amazing.</li>
            <li>simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I must admit works amazing</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, and the shave is amazing.</li>
            <li>Simply an amazing razor.</li>
            <li>Just tried this Proglide Men&#x27;s Power Razor and it cuts amazingly.</li>
            <li>the vibrate feature is great - smooth shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>Paired with the amazing head, it did wonders.</li>
            <li>Shaving isn&#x27;t something we enjoy doing but this blade makes it easier to get it done and get on with your day looking great.</li>
            <li>It has a great feel, size, and is comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>The Micorpulses were amazing to the shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Was happy to try this free razor I received through a program by Gillette.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor that I received for free from a program by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I received a free razor from a program run by Gillette and was so happy I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what a difference the battery power makes on a close shave.</li>
            <li>Great close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>and I had an amazing shave.</li>
            <li>However, this is a great product to take on travels as the cost is relatively cheap and if you are yearning for some electronic aided shave.</li>
            <li>This razor provides an amazingly close shave.</li>
            <li>I got a great shave using the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power Handle along with ProGlide blades, which I received free through a promotion program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle was comfortable and had great \\&quot;gripping\\&quot; coverage; and the moisturizing strip also helps with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing,</li>
            <li>my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>power handle is amazing as well</li>
            <li>Does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>The power handle and vibration is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am happy because this was provided to me for free by a program ran by Gillette to try it out.</li>
            <li>But the amount of CLOSE and COMFORTABLE shaves makes this a great purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basing this off of a 2-blade experience, this is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how the micropulses help to give a smoother shave and the shave lasts for a longer period.</li>
            <li>I got to use the Fusion ProGlide Power handle to shave, I liked it quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>It continued to feel nice in the hand as I shaved my face and head.  </li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>The battery power works in the shower, so that&#x27;s a nice convenience.</li>
            <li>I really liked the shave I got from  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.  </li>
            <li>just honest</li>
            <li>It has a nice grip and fits well in my hand.  </li>
            <li>It has a very ergonomic grip and a non-slip hold perfect for those rushed in-the-shower shaves.  </li>
            <li>The handle was nice</li>
            <li>The razor has a nice weight and balance</li>
            <li>The vibrations on the razor was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I liked the power handle.</li>
            <li>i honestly didn&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
            <li>Within a minute, I was loving it.  </li>
            <li>Quite honestly I would not have ever had used a Fusion Pro-Glide Power if Gillete had not sent me one for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>slick.&lt;br /&gt;The battery powered handle vibrates nicely letting you get the close shave.  </li>
            <li>But all they did was take to okay things and put them together, call them great, and charger more for refills.</li>
            <li>I liked the razor</li>
            <li>It kind of irritated my skin and just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I have to say I really liked the razor</li>
            <li>It gives a nice shave too</li>
            <li>The razor gives a nice, close shave without any nicks or cuts and I did not have any problems with razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I also liked the vibrations.</li>
            <li>The vibration adds to the good shave, and makes it more efficient.</li>
            <li>This comes in handy when you are trying to get a close shave, while avoiding any nicks.</li>
            <li>i did receive this item from Gillette as part of a test program, but my review is honest about the product.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the fact that using the powered handle makes shaving much easier.</li>
            <li>The vibrating shave is nice.</li>
            <li>I had gotten away from Gillette in favor of the disposable razors and can honestly say I am wondering why I switched.</li>
            <li>I like the good ol reg razor better  for me</li>
            <li>I liked the way it felt in my hand.</li>
            <li>This gives you a very close shave and the power function is awesome.</li>
            <li>was impressed with the ability of the Proglide to give a smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It does not slip in your hand which is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li>The design and color scheme is very sleek looking for a razor and the best part</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the trimmer and it kind of freaks me out</li>
            <li>The handle grip is awesome, very confortable.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did (all things do work together for good...).</li>
            <li>The good medium compromise is the famous safety razor, which is making a comeback these days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;OK, I understand that Gillette cannot effectively inventory all the retailers with every generation of product they ever made.</li>
            <li>I liked it and you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li>But the shave was really nice.</li>
            <li>The battery power works in the shower, so that&#x27;s a nice convenience.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette razors always provide a nice shave but their ever increasing price of blades pushed me away years ago.  </li>
            <li>I always liked going against the grain cause</li>
            <li>My husband really liked this razor.  </li>
            <li>when I look at it turned on, but he said he liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li>but it is a nice gimmick</li>
            <li>The floating blades so effectively follow the contours of my skin that I get as close as shave as I ever have before.  </li>
            <li>There has always been some kind of trade-off between closeness, irritation, tendency to produce ingrown hairs, price, and speed of use.  </li>
            <li>The battery has lasted quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>Really, really nice.</li>
            <li>Also no razor burn which is always nice.</li>
            <li>, I own a Pulsonic (retired) and a Panasonic Arc 5, both vibrating electrics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>still, it&#x27;s a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had to replace the battery after a month which is also a nice surprise since I figured they must be in bed with Duracell and had created another way to help sell AAA&#x27;s to tech nerds.</li>
            <li>The razor pivots nicely along thw jaw and chin.</li>
            <li>The vibration felt nice</li>
            <li>I was kind of drawn into the advertisements.</li>
            <li>my $14 battery operated Braun (including batteries) travel shaver works as good or better.  </li>
            <li>It looks nice, but that&#x27;s about</li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad and he liked it.</li>
            <li>nice product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 because, honestly,  the vibrator is a novelty where form over function is a sales tool, not an improvement in shaving.</li>
            <li>I really believe the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li>you hold it however you dont really realize its fatter, and the shave it gives is excellent.</li>
            <li>With that being said I need a nice close shave without razor rash.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to a nice relationship with the Fusion Proglide Power Razor and saying goodbye to the Mach-3 Turbo.</li>
            <li>I have to say I really liked the razor</li>
            <li>Oh, and if you&#x27;re wondering whether I missed the protective wires of the Quattro, that&#x27;s an affirmative.  </li>
            <li>The package arrived with the razor, a nice holder, and one blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, very close shave.</li>
            <li>I also like that the handle has a nice feel to it-</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice feel and does not slip.</li>
            <li>Power Handle is also a nice bonus for those with</li>
            <li>Also the blade is absolute perfect shave</li>
            <li>I use in the shower, the grip is nice</li>
            <li>Things kind of go downhill from there and a blade change is required.</li>
            <li>While I do not feel as though I received a better shave do to the vibration, it does feel good on the hand while holding it.  </li>
            <li>One of the features that I really liked was the moisturizing strips.</li>
            <li>It gave me a great shave, and overall I was very impressed with it&#x27;s design and functionality.</li>
            <li>Excellent product; reasonably priced</li>
            <li>The battery is more of a gimmick though instead of a good addition.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave without any issues.  </li>
            <li>Liked the feel of the handle</li>
            <li>I really liked the Proglide Power.  </li>
            <li>and I also liked the vibration motion</li>
            <li>your looking for a good razor with 4 blades, you may love this razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, the shave is nice.  </li>
            <li>they are pricey and I&#x27;d have to think about spending this kind of money compared to the Mach 3</li>
            <li>Today as a test I shaved my three day stubble without any shaving cream just some warm water.</li>
            <li>My skin was not irritated after using the razor, which was a nice feeling for once.  </li>
            <li>The handle was nice to grip</li>
            <li>like I got a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Here, the vibrating pulses came in handy.  </li>
            <li>I got a nice close shave, with no nicks and/or skin irritation.</li>
            <li>This whole system is awesome.</li>
            <li>I liked the razors alone without the micropulse</li>
            <li>Before this I owned (and still own)</li>
            <li>This is a nice feature for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I liked it, a lot.  </li>
            <li>liked the power feature.</li>
            <li>But to be honest I will always buy the Gillette razor blades.</li>
            <li>My guy friends had to ask me to stop talking about it, because I was so thrilled about it.</li>
            <li>I know Gillette razors are kind of pricy</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice</li>
            <li>This will be nice if I wanted to take the razor with me when travelling.  </li>
            <li>I am loving this razor.  </li>
            <li>The grip is also nice which ensures that it doesn&#x27;t slip and cause harm to the skin.</li>
            <li>nice shave plus massages ur face  </li>
            <li>It has a nice feel in your hands and having the battery installed for the micropulses</li>
            <li>I own</li>
            <li>Also the weight distribution on the handle is good and helps control the razor better while shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Can believe how nice of a shave I get.  </li>
            <li>Really is the perfect shaver.</li>
            <li>but you kind of ignore that part after a while.</li>
            <li>liked the feel in my hand as it glided across my skin.</li>
            <li>Although the handle was well weighted and held the blade to my face i am not too sure how much good</li>
            <li>With the power on this thing glides thru hair like a knife thru warm butter.  </li>
            <li>I received a  from a program that Gillette was running, and to be honest</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say i would not have bought a battery powered razor on my own.  </li>
            <li>I am basically an electric razor user but I have to admit that I really liked this blade.  </li>
            <li>There was something nice about its heft.</li>
            <li>The power feature was nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stylistic looking shaver handle with a nice grip.</li>
            <li>A nice clip on blade cover would be nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I get a great shave with both, but something about the vibration of the power razor makes the shave more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, if your the kind of guy who likes to have the newest tech out there, i recommend this razor for you.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly it didn&#x27;t add anything to my experience.</li>
            <li>Perfect razor, I guess there is nothing better than this in the market right now.</li>
            <li>Want a clean smooth shave without nicks then use this razor and you&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li>Received the a free razor via a program run by Gillette and was impressed with the closeness and clean shave.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for an amazing shave at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>The price is high, so I want to be very happy with a product before spending that kind of money.</li>
            <li>Trust me, it is well worth it!!!</li>

            <li>It was a great value and the order was received quickly.</li>

            <li>The results are equally spectacular:  very smooth feel and NO cuts.  </li>
            <li>This razor does what it says, and the space between the blades stays remarkable clean as well.</li>
            <li>This razor does what it says, and the space between the blades stays remarkable clean as well.</li>
            <li>I thought that the handle was fine, I like the way it looks and feels, but I thought the shave was just as good</li>
            <li>The shave was great but nothing more than an original fusion shave.</li>
            <li>Everything about the package is great, easy to get into, no cuts on the hands, perfect way to remove the product from the back side.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that Gillette came up with the first electric slim handle on a razor!</li>
            <li>This is a very unique product and now its my favorite!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try the latest and greatest from the company.  </li>
            <li>can talk about the blades, but I&#x27;ll just sum them up by saying they offer a smooth, effortless shave with 0 irritation, as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical about how good this razor was until I recieved it free from a program sponsered by Gilette.</li>
            <li>The thin/fine blades glided across my face, leaving me smooth yet still feeling good.  </li>
            <li>This was a nice feeling. :)&lt;</li>

            <li>A comfortable shave, a good feel in the hand, a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The handle itself does have a good look to it though and it felt comfortable in my hands.  </li>
            <li>This razor is by far the best razor I have used in years!</li>
            <li>I also liked being able to use the powered razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The razor had a smooth glide over my skin (Fairly course stubble)</li>
            <li>The one thing that kind of did worry me off the bat is if I would be able to use this razor IN the shower, as nowhere on the instructions</li>
            <li>This razor is by far the best razor out there today, no doubt about it...</li>

            <li>I strongly recommend this to fight against razor bumps and ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li>It indeed makes it better, a closer, a more comfortable, and quicker shave!!</li>
            <li>- I had decided to really grow my hair out to give it a good test!</li>
            <li>This razor does a good job of what it is intended to do - give a clean, close shave and not cause razor burn in the process.</li>
            <li>If comfort and a close shave is more important than price then this is a good razor for you.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have noticed a slightly more comfortable glide with this over the Fusion Power.  </li>
            <li>I have also found that it helps create a nice smooth shave when combined with some  nice products.</li>
            <li>It has been a pleasure to have a good clean shave that is so effortless.  </li>

            <li>Overall, a great product, always look forward to the great products the Gillette puts out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a great smooth and comfortable shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the shave was good, I experienced some tugging by the blade even when shaving a day old beard.</li>
            <li>It is very light and easy to hold and use!</li>
            <li>First of all, it MUST be noted that Gillette has made a great effort to rethinking plastic blister pack design.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it i didnt think it was all that great.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend the money on one since I was happy with my electric, but after the first day - I&#x27;d buy one.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty great product.</li>
            <li>I tried the first fusion and it was not that great.  </li>
            <li>First off, I must say this is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>The power function combined with a great blade kept my face smooth and clean after shaving and did so in no time at all.  </li>
            <li>The 4 blades give a great shave and my wife, in particular, liked the FlexBall movement.</li>
            <li>This razor is easier to use then many razors because of the strong grip!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>It makes for a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>the handle is very comfortable however the power button placement could be improved by being on the bottom of the razor.</li>
            <li>I also got a very smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li>The end result was very smooth hairless skin even got compliments from the doctor and nurse.</li>
            <li>Very light and east to store.</li>
            <li>The handal is very comfortable and its simole to use.</li>

            <li>Shaving experience is very comfortable</li>
            <li>It provided a very smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a good experience with Gillette products and could probably save money with other razors, but I like to try the latest and greatest innovations.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like an amazing thing, but I found myself turning it on every day, even though it would be easy to just pick it up and shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great razor that demonstrates a significant improvement over the original product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like an amazing thing, but I found myself turning it on every day, even though it would be easy to just pick it up and shave.</li>
            <li>I loved it because it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and seemed to be adequately lubricated.  </li>
            <li>The razor handle was easy to grip and handle, and the vibrating handle made all the difference in the world for a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li>The handle was a nice size and easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that I have been becoming more adept with repeated use, so perhaps it is an acquired skill</li>
            <li>It has a slim neck with a nice and easy grip.</li>
            <li>The razor is a nice weight and easy to handle while your shaving.</li>
            <li>After I easily installed the battery, I noticed that this handle is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>First impression - looks very nice</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the battery in the hand razor to be very useful, but the vibration surprisingly helps during shaving and allowed me a very close and smooth shave that my wife loved!  </li>
            <li>Fits into your and easily, light weight and love the vibrating feature!  </li>
            <li>I received this razor free from a program from Gillette and i am so glad i did!</li>
            <li>It shaves smooth and my shave lasts atleast 5 days or more!</li>
            <li>I gave it a try and was impressed with the shave and the smooth finish but that would happen with any new blade.</li>
            <li>The grip design on the handle is outstanding and is very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>It is modern and easy to use, nice handle, great blades.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always use the power function, as it works fine without it, but it is a nice option to have.</li>
            <li>The vibrating handle is a nice touch and works with the cartridge just fine.</li>
            <li>If you want - though it defeats the benefit of the vibration - you can also use the Proglide as a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; razor, though I liked the vibrations just fine.  </li>
            <li>The weight feels good in you hand, the texture is easy to hold onto and the vibrating action makes for a great shave.  </li>
            <li>very good product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No wrestling with the plastic and almost severing a finger, a huge plus in my mind!  </li>
            <li>As most razors are, this handle was made rubber.  </li>
            <li>really enjoyed the design of this handle</li>
            <li>I feel like I get a better shave with this razor without no nicks.</li>
            <li>think the Fusion ProGlide Power handle looks quite a bit better than the Mach 3,</li>
            <li>and I think I may have found my favorite</li>
            <li>I prefer a bit more of an angle between the blades and the handle, but this straighter line seems to be where most newer handles are going.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love the weight and feel of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I have done this on more than one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found it distracting and obtained much better results after turning it off.</li>
            <li>This handle is so light!</li>
            <li>I was provided with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor to try and I was extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>but I got about twice as many shaves out of them than with others</li>
            <li>I also love the fact there was no irritation when shaving With this razor</li>
            <li>Love it, love everything about</li>
            <li>I was a nice smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have tried just about every razor on the market,most are ok, some better than the others.</li>
            <li>Receiving this razor to try for free was definitely amazing.</li>
            <li>have a Gillete Fusion (non-battery operated version) that I&#x27;ve used for more than a year now.  </li>
            <li>The battery-operated version is much more efficient than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li>do believe this is the best overall product for shaving on the market.  </li>
            <li>do believe this is the best overall product for shaving on the market.  </li>
            <li>just wish these were a bit more affordable and that there was some sort of subscription club from Gillete itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li>I started out using the Mach3 (3 blade) razor which I thought was ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this made me wonder if there was an even a better product out there and encouraged me to purchase the manual Gillette Fusion (5 blade) razor.</li>
            <li>(this was still way better than the Mach3 Turbo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the blades on this free razor I received as part of a Gilette program are top notch, I have to be honest: I have no idea what the vibration is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Since that time I have purchased more blades and will continue to do</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Handle gave me one of the best overall shaves that I can remember.</li>
            <li>free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and gave me the opportunity to try this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Gillette.</li>
            <li>My wife has used it in the bath tub as well, with the same flawless results.  </li>
            <li>I love the look and styling of the handling.  </li>
            <li>But the blade did give a nice close, smooth shave</li>
            <li>Its comfortable and has a nice grip to it.</li>
            <li>Fortunately,I received the ProGlide Power Razor free in a program run by Gillette!</li>
            <li>That being said, I really enjoyed this razor, and have purchased it since.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by by the ease of use simply by inserting the battery into the handle.  </li>
            <li>The Fusuion proglide provided a nice, smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I like he fact that even though the razor contains a battery, it is still safe to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The shave I get is so smooth!  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m getting a shave that is any better or closer</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and the shave is sooooooo close with zero razor burn!</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is all that it says and more.</li>
            <li>now I will use this one because it actually is the best out there.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Gillette products.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find anything that worked better for me.</li>
            <li>I always assumed the best shave came from the number of blades but nowadays, with razors having more and more blades than the last model, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Gillette for many years.</li>
            <li>The cartridges are better than any I have used before, leaving me with the closest, smoothest shave I have had in decades.</li>
            <li>The blades, the power, the combination of the two make this my favorite razor of all time.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it once I tried it though.</li>
            <li>I must say the Gilette is 10X better comparatively.  </li>
            <li>I will say that throughout my shave I felt nothing but amazing painless smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how well this product worked and suggest it to anyone who shaves on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The best part is the shaves actually seem to get better the longer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been VERY happy with the razor and will definitely continue to use this as my go-to razor from now on.  </li>
            <li>I received this razor for free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>The vibration from this razor makes the hair on my face stick up more</li>
            <li>after 2 shaves to be able to tell though.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>It is my favorite, my holy grail, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>There is an improved grip on the blade side of the razor that allows a better hold when the handle is wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did love the blade.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like I get a better shave with</li>
            <li>She liked the feel of the razor and the smooth shave she got.  </li>
            <li>The handle of the Gillette Fusion had just the appropriate amount of rubber to stay in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Even though this was given to me free from Gilette i will buy it in a heartbeat and will use the refills!</li>
            <li>my surprise, the shave was noticeably better with the ProGlide.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>The handle is shaped nice to fit into your hand and the power button is placed</li>
            <li>and I can shave more often without my skin paying for it.  </li>
            <li>This tended to make shaving take longer, as I found myself going over some spots more than ones</li>
            <li>even more so when you are using a powered razor,</li>
            <li>Glad that I had the opportunity to try this.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like it or of it would even make a difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to try this out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to go over any spot more than once.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I noticed it is even better than the Fusion ProGlide</li>
            <li>Yes :)</li>
            <li>I mostly use the cheapest razors I can find, but after getting a sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide power handle</li>
            <li>I sure everyone has that one area of your face, chin, or neck</li>
            <li>&quot; this handle helps provide is more mind over matter.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t love either.</li>
            <li>and the handle is comfortable and amazing to use...</li>
            <li>so nice and smooth</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I received it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>Prior to using the razor, the best shave I could get that was mostly painfree was with the Gilette Fusion (non-battery operated version).  </li>
            <li>I have to say, this razor is so much better than even that one.  </li>
            <li>I love the vibrating handle.  </li>
            <li>I was able to shave under my nose.  </li>
            <li>This battery-loaded handle, although it provides an interesting vibration feature, is none of those things.  </li>
            <li>Able to hold on to it and shave with confidence.</li>
            <li>The gillette fusion pro glide handle is ok.</li>
            <li>I love the way it shaves because I was able to shave without having any hair tugged out of my skin.</li>
            <li>(I wished I had more face to shave).</li>
            <li>I am in love with my ProGlide Power razor.  </li>
            <li>Well the proglide power has definitely proved itself among the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I think it evens cleans better under running water while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>I must say I really do love Gillette&#x27;s handles for their razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received the razor free through a Gillette program and this review is 100% my own.</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed a nice nick free shave.</li>
            <li>handle is better then the Gillette Power trimmer.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is an amazing device that enhances a truly smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The handle I feel is more of a gimmick.</li>
            <li>so for the most part I just used the cheapest i could find and tossed them after one use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>I received this as a freebie, and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t pay for it.</li>
            <li>I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Handle.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave 5 times without noticing any problems.  </li>
            <li>I was even able to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the fact that it requires a battery to operate though, I&#x27;m perfectly content with and actually prefer the battery-less options.</li>
            <li>I received this razor via a program run by Gillete and I liked the Gillete Fusion Proglide because it glided along my face smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The head of the Fusion razor is more compact and I feel like it gets closer to my skin and does a better job getting into the tricky part under my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love being able to use this in the shower and not feeling like it&#x27;s going to slip out of my fingers.  </li>
            <li>I ended up liking the power razor better than the manual.</li>
            <li>I seemed to have a better, closer shave with the power turned on.</li>
            <li>Manuel was way better in my opinion and cheaper.</li>
            <li>since the trend to powered razors has started I&#x27;ve tried several and haven&#x27;t been very impressed.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more about the shaving cream and the after shave, but</li>
            <li>Anyway, I gave this a try, and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I also love that this works so well on my underarms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>The best deal is when you buy it with the extra Cartridges.    </li>
            <li>Overall i am impressed, give me some more stars to add :)</li>
            <li>I was able to pivot the razor and change directions with ease, no cuts, no nicks, and no razor burns.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the Proglide Fusion which I received from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the vibration</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Gillette Mach 3 for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>The women will love you and your close, clean-smelling shave.</li>
            <li>The women will love you and your close, clean-smelling shave.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been shaving a beard for decades and has tried out many, many razors during that time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More than they asked for!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was the Gillette I stuck with for many years.</li>
            <li>I felt more in control and got a much better shave that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>and I can surely find cheaper brands that work just as well.</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>and I can surely find cheaper brands that work just as well.</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>gives the best shave that I&#x27;ve come across outside of barbershop.    </li>
            <li>It does what it says, it glides better on your face.  </li>
            <li>The micropulses still do not provide a greater degree of comfort over a razor that lacks this feature.  </li>
            <li>For the most part I think I&#x27;ll stick to safety razor for the bulk of my shaving and then finish up the \\&quot;scary\\&quot; areas with the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they have some lovely marketing but in the end</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY LOVE THE POWER VERSION.</li>
            <li>It seemed to float over his skin, and it left it in the best condition that I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li>for the rest of the features, I&#x27;m sure Gillette made some incremental improvements</li>
            <li>this translates to not only getting great shaves, but to saving a lot of money!</li>
            <li>my surprise, the Proglide Power was FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>I notice it on cleanup for sure.</li>
            <li>But as I began to take stock in all the models I have used over the years, I found something interesting...</li>
            <li>Interesting, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I simply cannot justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper.</li>
            <li>The Schick handles still feel MUCH better and heftier.</li>
            <li>more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I could have went a couple more days</li>
            <li>I was so glad to be offered something that my husband could use...</li>
            <li>Any more than that</li>
            <li>The battery is over the top.</li>
            <li>Too many blades and again a battery?</li>
            <li>The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:    1)</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Much more satisfying to use than anything made of plastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Merkur model 180 for five years now, and love it.</li>
            <li>, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working or not.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro is a bit more imprecise.</li>
            <li>While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn&#x27;t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.    </li>
            <li>The power version also has a feature that claims to guide the hairs in straighter for a more close, even cut.</li>
            <li>We have much more of our bodies to shave than they do.  </li>
            <li>or if it made it better in any way.  </li>
            <li>Using the Proglide I can confidently shave at a pace that is about 4 times faster without nick concerns.  </li>
            <li>In defense of double edges, they still remain the best performance/price ratio of any disposable razor.</li>
            <li>what the heck, the more blades the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve resisted the temptation to purchase Gillette&#x27;s \\&quot;shaver of the moment\\&quot; because I was satisfied with what I had.  </li>
            <li>I go more than 48 hours without shaving - 2 things happen.  </li>
            <li>- more than 1 of them will bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my latest bout with this issue I decided to give this baby a try.</li>
            <li>and love the design for my scalp, and tried the FaceBlade[[ASIN:B003LY2E3I HeadBlade FaceBlade Travel Razor]].</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a closer, easier, more efficient shave, even from my</li>
            <li>so I would have the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s surely what i didn&#x27;t get from this one.</li>
            <li>I truly don&#x27;t see how Gillette will be able to improve on this.    </li>
            <li>, I just think this product is really outstanding).</li>
            <li>Hi folks,  After more than a decade of electric razor use I decided to try a razor blade.</li>
            <li>I started out on the Gillette Mach 3, which went ok, and then saw a demo of the vibrating Fusion Proglide at a store.</li>
            <li>I also shave against the grain all the time to get the best shave possible.</li>
            <li>This razor does the job but is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case, shaving has never felt better, nor lasted longer than it has with this razor.  </li>
            <li>But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  </li>
            <li>I have had it just a week, but my usage has been outstanding.</li>
            <li>more that a dollar a piece.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The best shave will come from a double edged safety razor - and these blades can be recycled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the Gillette marketers make you think you are getting more because you paid more -</li>
            <li>I was planning on ordering couple more for my brother and dad.</li>
            <li>unless I find something better, I will continue to use this razor for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Flexball handle prevents a lot of irritation by providing a smoother, more contoured shave that hugs the face.</li>
            <li>I got this free from Bzzagent from Gillette!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a gimmick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shaving my lip with a lot more confidence now...</li>
            <li>I love how it feels to shave with.</li>
            <li>I received this razor free from Gillette,  to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Have been using Gillette razors for years and always got the latest one to try to eliminate cuts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many razors over my lifetime.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it....</li>
            <li>I have seen so many advertisements on TV and on YouTube for this razor.</li>
            <li>Of course, you will not be able to tell because of the smoothness of the shave.</li>
            <li>The duration of the blade is better than standar Fusion.</li>
            <li>There was no gliding at all, it was more like grinding.</li>
            <li>The truth is that I kept on buying into the newer razors that came out thinking they were better</li>
            <li>So all in all the Mach 3 manual and power were better than the Sensor excel 2 and 3 blade razors up to now.    </li>
            <li>I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved.</li>
            <li>Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help.</li>
            <li>not as many cuts, with this one :-)</li>
            <li>The five-blade cluster is more than just gimmickry, it provides a wider shaving area, which is more stable as you shave.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>it ok</li>
            <li>but there are better one i try</li>
            <li>Many others then came out with safety razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I give five stars for the interest of all mankind, I just had the closest shave EVER (and I have had many, including from straight-blade razors).</li>
            <li>Many people seem to complain about the vibrations.</li>
            <li>He still said that power version of this was better.</li>
            <li>don’t know whether it’s a placebo or what, but the vibrating handle does seem to make for a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li>and im satisfied</li>
            <li>It delivers most of the time; I just wish it were always.</li>
            <li>love this razor because of the close shave and no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more soon...</li>
            <li>It is also somehow more invigorating to shave with the power version.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have (as I did) or can still get blades for this.</li>
            <li>The battery powered viration feature lessens the friction for sure.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that for me it actualy caused more friction and micro cuts.</li>
            <li>When I tuend it off I got a much better shave.</li>
            <li>I am able to shave with the grain and against the grain on my neck and face without any irritation or razor burn.   </li>
            <li>Amazon \\&quot;Top Rated\\&quot; directed me to an old-school Merkur double-edged safety razor, and I read up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not convinced that they are anything more than a marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li>It has more power than most razors.</li>
            <li>When Gillette offered to give me a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to try - I figured sure - I&#x27;ll try it.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a great design and doesn&#x27;t slip like the old razor I used (one of the reasons i liked the electric better then).  </li>
            <li>The battery is safely sealed from water, so you don&#x27;t have to worry when using it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the LED light up power button.</li>
            <li>Overall this is the best razor ever!</li>
            <li>Overall the razor is the best razor that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My frame of mind is that the blades are sharper or at a better angle, or maybe it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had my Mach 3 handle for many years, and hopefully this lasts just as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must say this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>It also made shaving ore enjoyable.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the vibrating would make a difference</li>
            <li>I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power both with the power off and with the power on and with the power on the shave was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>and my expectations were it would not do me any better than the Fusion Pro I used .</li>
            <li>I have used it for several weeks and find the shave the best that I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll end up spending more</li>
            <li>Drop the price on these razors and you will sell more, Gillette.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed this razor.  </li>
            <li>it feels like i got a better shave</li>
            <li>I was provided this gilette razor through a promotion, and I could not be more pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The head shaving is what has kept me a Quattro user for so many years, as the Quattro has protective wires that keep me from inadvertently scalping myself.</li>
            <li>The Gillette razor has no such wires, but I&#x27;m a daring guy, so I gave it a shot, and was very impressed.</li>
            <li>I love the handle on this razor.  </li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve always liked Gillette products and they gave to me to try for free</li>
            <li>The experience was better</li>
            <li>LOVE the vibration</li>
            <li>Overall this is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li>If I skipped more than a day of shaving, forget it.  </li>
            <li>There was no tugging and pulling, just a nice smooth shave, after one pass.  </li>
            <li>This is simple the best.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this razor.</li>
            <li>The handle and grip is comfortable, has a nice design and looks &amp; feels sturdy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Am a Gillette user and love all their products.</li>
            <li>I think I will be using this more often now.</li>
            <li>power is more convenient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether or not mechanized handles are better than electric shavers?</li>
            <li>When I got the Razor I wanted to compare it to the others I have used with the thought that it  could not be that much better</li>
            <li>my favorite razor</li>
            <li>was better about it.  </li>
            <li>It felt like I had more control over my shave, just because of the shape/weight of the handle.  </li>
            <li>The razor with 4 blades and a vibrator is Ok</li>
            <li>4 blade approach is that much better.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of taking several shorter strokes to shave, I found the Proglide Power Handle worked best if I used one continuous stroke.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a number of their razors over the years and have always been satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>To start with I love the handle.</li>
            <li>I Love This product ..</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the shave.</li>
            <li>I received this razor free as part of a Gillette market study for honest opinions of the product.</li>
            <li>But that happens to me with most razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the flexibility of the razor to help adapt to the different contours of my face.  </li>
            <li>The gripping surfaces made it easier to maintain control of the razor while getting the look you want.  </li>
            <li>but I was thrilled when I received a free Fusion Proglide Power Handle through a program Gillette was running.</li>
            <li>Therefore, allowing you a better grip while shaving.  </li>
            <li>What can one say about what is probably one of America&#x27;s favorite razor that hasn&#x27;t already been said.</li>
            <li>The Proglide Power Razor performed outstanding on my day to day morning shave.  </li>
            <li>She uses men&#x27;s shavers anyway, she says they cut better than women&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Safe to say that this thing has come</li>
            <li>I love the auto shutdown (safety)</li>
            <li>I love the way this fits in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the handle.</li>
            <li>tell you what, too, I&#x27;m so glad I got the chance to try it.  </li>
            <li>It honestly gave me the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I do not think I will be replacing this razor with something else, because I am that pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Combined with the ProGlide blades (which I reviewed separately) and my preferred shaving gel (Currently using Anthony for Men), I get some of the best shaves</li>
            <li>I love the vibrating handle</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed my experience with the handle.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li>This shaver provides a smooth shave!  </li>
            <li>The handle is interesting because it vibrates.  </li>
            <li>More than I&#x27;m use to paying for blades</li>
            <li>best shave ever, battery lasting 5+ months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many razors that are targeted for women, and none of them measure up, including Gillette&#x27;s women&#x27;s version of this razor.  </li>
            <li>Using the vibration the result is even better.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this out via  a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>, I noticed when shaving it gives you a nice close and smooth shave with massaging comfort in from the handle to the blade.</li>
            <li>help me have more control over the handle</li>
            <li>What this smooth!</li>
            <li>I have tried it many times both ways, with it vibrating and without it vibrating.</li>
            <li>There is also more rubber on the underside</li>
            <li>Overall I get an excellent shave without worrying about nicks or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think a better use would be when you turn on the unit if the lights flash</li>
            <li>and I am thinking I will get a couple more shaves.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to get one.  </li>
            <li>I was given a Proglide as a promotion and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>The Proglide was just a tad better.  </li>
            <li>However, that said, if you use coupons and shop around you can get a good price, and this razor is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>the power is superfluous ，I used gillette 3 which i think is better than this one ，although this is the update</li>
            <li>I must say I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>Its stylish and sleek.  </li>
            <li>Razor and blade were provided free from Gillette!  </li>
            <li>It gave me a nice smooth shave with no irritation or razor burn.</li>
            <li>Another thing I really love is that it can be used it the shower, with no problem.</li>
            <li>Love this razor</li>
            <li>The razor is OK and I will probably purchase it in stores.</li>
            <li>I was able to try out this handle.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured Gillete would have built a product that conformed to the user&#x27;s hand better, but this razor is not it.</li>
            <li>I love the way the handle fits in my hand for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure about using this but really happy that I did</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this for sure</li>
            <li>Like everything else in life, there comes a time when you need to upgrade it to something better and newer</li>
            <li>By using the vibration feature I was actually able to get a closer shave than without the vibrations.  </li>
            <li>love my Gillette Fusion Power Proglide Handle razor.....</li>
            <li>I am able to get 5 uses out of the cartridge before I have to change it.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t anything that I can&#x27;t stand more, than having to fight to get your product out of its packaging to use it.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the packaging on this product being the easiest to open that I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>razor contours nicely to your face and offers a great shave.</li>
            <li>All in all, the blades on this razor are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Most times I use an electric razor followed up with a blade razor (no shaving cream).  </li>
            <li>Look/style: It looks stylish.  </li>
            <li>One to two passes at most.</li>
            <li>I never thought the vibrating handle would have made a difference in how it shaved, actually being worried about being cut by the vibrating blades, but instead I most impressed with the smoothness of the pull as you drew the blades across your face, and the result was a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the convenience of home delivery, but the quality of the shave wasn&#x27;t quite there and the comfort of the handle wasn&#x27;t even close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels so much better after using the  Fusion Proglide Power.  </li>
            <li>And my face looks a lot better too.  </li>
            <li>the grip seems feel more controllable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to go two days without shaving and not look like a hobo....</li>
            <li>And considering that I shave my head also, I have more area to cover :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>easily more than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the experience.</li>
            <li>I have had the same blade on this razor for almost 4 weeks now and I am happy to report no razor burn or bumps!  </li>
            <li>Glad I took a chance and made the switch.</li>
            <li>They provide a close shave and a safe shave.</li>
            <li>Although, as said, they are top of the line - the price still makes you think twice before buying.</li>
            <li>knowing this, I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it and am glad that I got it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the shape of the handle</li>
            <li>I received a free razor from a Program ran by Gillette!</li>
            <li>The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette!</li>
            <li>I slack on shaving more</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a chance it could make more of a difference when the blade becomes a bit more used</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fairly confident this improvement was from the power</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I do love it.</li>
            <li>For years I have tried many razors and systems that have come out on the market.</li>
            <li>The Power Handle feature is ok</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li>got slapped on the hand for claiming that these vibrating razors helped a person get a better shave by stimulating the hairs to stand up.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it once I tried it though.</li>
            <li>It would make more sense to have the button where the thumb ends up when gripping the handle.</li>
            <li>I also love the way the razor fits in my hand.  </li>
            <li>but if I ever miss a day, I have to use the Power ProGlide because it just works so much better.</li>
            <li>Compared to using a three blade I did notice a better looking and closer shave with the five blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle on the razor is superb and much more accommodating to larger hands and fingers than competitor handles.</li>
            <li>I love the closeness I got while using the power razor.</li>
            <li>it provides an effortless, close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li>5 blades is way better than the 3 I started off with with my mach 3.  </li>
            <li>but I would gladly have paid the 10 bucks for it.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>I still use that most days because it&#x27;s quicker to use than lathering up and shaving with the Proglide, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li>Not as bulky and fat, not that many blades, easier to shave under the nose and around the lips.  </li>
            <li>I just feel like the industry can do a lot better at making shaving more luxurious.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine has been extolling the greatness of this product for many months now.</li>
            <li>I must say that I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Still, I was satisfied just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is SOO much better than the razors I had become accustomed to using.</li>
            <li>Do they cost more?</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I just love this razor.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with it but am worried about the price of blade refills costing to much.  </li>
            <li>a much better shaver feel if the handle were to be made a bit more substantial feeling.</li>
            <li>The handle is ergonomically designed for a better grip in the shower and out, and helps with given a better, closer shave.</li>
            <li>and I think I may have found my favorite.</li>
            <li>I started using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor this week and love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for many years now and I haven&#x27;t used a better razor than the Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li>The ProGlide Power Blades are even better.</li>
            <li>When shaving more of the blade is not even being used.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the weight and feel of this razor</li>
            <li>If it sat at more of an angle, it would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes sure you get a close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  </li>
            <li>The vibration is supposed to help you get a better shave, but I do not notice a difference when it is turned on or when it is off.</li>
            <li>My shave experience was faster, easier on my skin &amp; more precise then ever before!</li>
            <li>Besides the blades providing a top notch shave, the handle was top of the line as well.</li>
            <li>and I will spread the word that it is a worthwhile razor to have.</li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide Power Handle which I received for free from Gillette is a keeper!</li>
            <li>I received this razor free from Gillette and it does give a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of change but am I glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to try, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for it.</li>
            <li>because how many times can it get better.  </li>
            <li>I wouldnt be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle now has more ergonomic grips for better control, it snaps snugly into the included plastic holder n stays in place</li>
            <li>Suffice to say when I tried it after not having shaved for a couple of days, it pulled and tugged even more.</li>
            <li>and I think it evens cleans better under running water while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>And more than once I&#x27;ve been subjected to &#x27;razor burn&#x27; from these</li>
            <li>I tend to use my blades longer than most, trying to get the most for my money.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure it did any better than the fusion.</li>
            <li>When asked by Gillette to try the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I thought that it was just another gimmick product to get you to spend more.  </li>
            <li>The shave always leaves my face feeling smooth everytime!</li>
            <li>I got this razor free to try from Gillette, and this is by far the best razor that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend the power handle - but will keep using it to see if I get better performance after more practice.</li>
            <li>The greater heft gave me the impression of more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the shave</li>
            <li>The blade gives a nice close, smooth shave and it doesn&#x27;t pull at all.  </li>
            <li>did it mention that it was safe.</li>
            <li>done, I was happy that I was not nicked anywhere and was very content with my shave.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best disposable razors around.</li>
            <li>The power button is on the handle so you are able to turn it on and off.</li>
            <li>The vibrating feature helps make your shaving experience much more relaxing.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s not something to use for many years, I would say that it&#x27;s handle</li>
            <li>provides better feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This might one of the better razors I have used.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I had the opportunity to try this product through the Gillette sampling program they just ran.</li>
            <li>Honestly of all the razors I have tried this one has proven to be the smoothest and most comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I prefer this blade for shaving my legs for cycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>- I felt like it helped the razor glide better on my skin.</li>
            <li>The handle is just the right size and fits in your hand nicely and the grips are nice to keep from dropping the razor when shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li>used it to shave my head and face would recommend this to everyone  great clean silky smooth shave and got it for free from gillette</li>
            <li>The shave was very good and smooth, but since my beard is not very tough to begin with, it was not noticeably better when I turned it on vs.</li>
            <li>head is fairly tender but provided me with a clean and smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle was very comfortable and easy to maneuver and it really gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to see the advantages of using the power razor.  </li>
            <li>First off the handle has a great shape and really gives u a good grip on it while shaving.</li>
            <li>Flat out the best razor you can buy under $25.  </li>
            <li>This is a great new shave!</li>
            <li>When I got the chance to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as part of a free program from Gillette, I was pretty happy to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this three stars since it did produce a nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li>I have always had issues getting a nice clean shave, but thats not the case anymore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the close clean shave</li>
            <li>A nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>This razor gave me a nice clean shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li>this particular model does a great job</li>
            <li>I did feel that the vibrations led to a nice, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am still impressed by how comfortable it is to use with no drag or pulling.  </li>
            <li>I went without shaving for 3 days to make sure I had a pretty good amount of hair grown out.</li>
            <li>I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle for free via a program run by Gillette, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to shave and was smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for great shave.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and we highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>For me the blade cost wouldn&#x27;t be high because it&#x27;s a great price/qualty/value.  </li>
            <li>in all, a great product - I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is another great high quality Gillette razor system.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for great shave.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle is a great new concept that makes my shave that much better.</li>
            <li>The handle is a nice fit and weight in my hand, and it is easy to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The razor provides a very clean and close shave without causing any nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the battery fits easily inside of the razor, so it&#x27;s very light to carry.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable in my hand and washes up easily.</li>
            <li>For normal use on your face it was great.</li>
            <li>But since the opportunity came up to give this a shot I figured it was worth trying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately impressed with how smooth the shave was and how much closer it felt.</li>
            <li>The weight of the handle and battery feels pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best bladed razor I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li>This razor is one of the best I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking at the price, this is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For a long time now, I&#x27;ve been using a Mach 3 razor (1st generation), and have been very happy with it also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my wife loved the gillette fusion proguide styler first time in a while that i could trim without redness .This</li>
            <li>Still a pretty good shave though.</li>
            <li>When i got my razor my first impression was good.</li>
            <li>After 6 shaves the strip still looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The weight of the handle and battery feels pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>First the pro&#x27;s:  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is light weight, easy to handle and maneuver and produces a great close shave with no nicks.  </li>
            <li>At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water.</li>
            <li>I normally use an electric razor, but this razor provides a great deal more precision for my shave and the vibration is helpful to make for a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The new fusion proglide power handle is great.  </li>
            <li>When trying this product they made it seem as though there was something new and great about it.</li>
            <li>When this on amazon and for a great price I picked up a new Razor.  </li>
            <li>The new blade arrangement and battery power make a great combination.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of hearing how great her new razor worked, I gave in and purchased the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The new design looks great as well.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a nice holder to keep it save from kids and even has a reflective mirror for quick shaves.  </li>
            <li>The handle made it easy to follow the contours of my face...giving me greater connection between face and blade.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Handle made it a pleasant experience and flowed across my skin with a very gentile feel.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I love this razor and its really easy shave.  </li>
            <li>Also, the blades do not bend easily or get out of shape which makes them work better for longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to try it for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>It feels much more comfortable to hold, probably do to the greater thickness.  </li>
            <li>Got a great shave, very close and smooth.</li>
            <li>After use, the razor fit snugly into its holder and provided the best position for drying the razor until the next use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Right off the bat, the \\&quot;micro pulse\\&quot; feature of the razor was quite interesting and the thinner blades made the shave more comfortable and smoother result.</li>
            <li>So now, I got my free razor from Gillette, love it and plan on getting more razors/blades...</li>
            <li>To top it all off, safety razors are more environmentally sound than the plasticky Gillettes.  </li>
            <li>great thing with this is that it&#x27;s a regular razor till you turn it on, so you can get a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>I will update this review after I have used it more as to blade/battery life, but so far it is great.</li>
            <li>After trying Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I was left very impressed at the smooth and close shave it provided.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to get a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have been able to try this for free.</li>
            <li>I loved that this handle was very sturdy and was able to control it with ease.</li>
            <li>Gave a great shave as my skin tends to be very sensitive to razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever experienced (and I have a very sensitive neck).</li>
            <li>But the best part of the RAZR is the single edge blade that makes it very easy to get clean to find lines in my beard.</li>
            <li>The five blade shave plus the single blade edger plus the electric handle equals the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>The five blade shave plus the single blade edger plus the electric handle equals the best shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It allowed for a quick, easy, and smooth shave, which was very satisfying because I am not always able to get the smoothest of shaves.  </li>
            <li>the most effective tool for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed right away was that nothing was rattling or shaking around.</li>
            <li>The first shave is always great on many razors but this was great for a long time.</li>
            <li>This razor is very comfortable to handle which is important in a razor.  </li>
            <li>Being in a job where I need to shave every day, having a quality razor, and one that&#x27;s economically sound is very important.  </li>
            <li>I used this razor, which I got for free from a Gillette program, and the shave it gave me was very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was very fortunate to receive a free Fusion Proglide Power Razor to try out.  </li>
            <li>This was a free razor provided by Gillette as part of a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle itself is very comfortable in your hand while in use.</li>
            <li>I was easily able to grasp it and fine tune my grip for maximum control.</li>
            <li>this handle works great, but did not feel superior to some of the other razor handles I have used.  </li>
            <li>The other thing I love about this razor handle, is that if fits perfectly into my razor holder which is attached to my mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s superior to the other multi-blade razors in its class, and with the month-long life of the edge of the blades, the impact on your wallet is greatly lessened as well.</li>
            <li>Schick then came out with the quattro 4 blade(the original first one) which was Ok and provided a good close shave</li>
            <li>This razor is super easy to use, and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice clean, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice, clean, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I can hold it more tightly, and confidently, and get the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Very cool, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Overall, its a very good handle for shaving.  </li>
            <li>overall great handle very easy to use i&#x27;m going to continue on using it.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li>I love this razor and handle and the power buttom makes a huge difference i didnt think it would</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin, no cuts or irritations.</li>
            <li>It works exactly like you&#x27;d want it to, feels nice in the hand and just for a cherry on top</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like the vibrations bring the hair closer to the skins surface for a closer more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>But if money is no object, or if you really need a more comfortable shave, this would be a good razor for you.</li>
            <li>this is probably the most comfortable grip I&#x27;ve had on any razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>razor did what it says and delivers a close smooth shave, I felt it was better than the hydro.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try the Fusion ProGlide Power free from a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>When I first received the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program by Gillette, I looked at the handle and laughed.</li>
            <li>I feel this product gives me a closer shave, and feels more comfortable when shaving.</li>
            <li>I found the handle comfortable to hold, though I suspect its size has more to do with the need to accommodate an AAA battery than with ergonomic design considerations.  </li>
            <li>The blades are smooth and with the vibrations, are able to eliminate the ingrown hair situation that I had been experiencing.</li>
            <li>This razor was free from a Gillette promotion.&lt;br /&gt;The blades on this razor a OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li>The vibrating gives you a slightly more comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>I received the razor free from a program by Gillette and boy was I glad.  </li>
            <li>It shaves more smoothly and faster than any razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Honestly, anything that scrapes the hair off my face and doesn&#x27;t leave me bleeding is pretty much OK in my book.</li>
            <li>received the Proglide Power Handle as a promotion from Gillette, but I would be more than willing to make this purchase on my own.</li>
            <li>I got it for free to try, from Gillete, but I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It gave me the smoothest most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>You can buy a cheaper razor, but I doubt you&#x27;ll find one that will give you a smoother, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I was able to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle free through a program Gillette was running.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a free Gillette Fusion Proglide through a promotion from Gillette and the results have been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power gave me the closest most comfortable shave that I have ever had at home.  </li>
            <li>in the end it was the most comfortable shave that I have gotten at home</li>
            <li>I was able to receive a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>Because it gives a close, smooth, and knick-free shave I absolutely love it--5 stars all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But as to the razor itself (or more precisely, its blades), I have to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>But as to the razor itself (or more precisely, its blades), I have to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more that I enjoy than lathering up my Rooney silvertip badger and shaving on a weekend morning.  </li>
            <li>You maybe able to get a 10/10 baby butt smooth shave with a Thiers</li>
            <li>But if money is no object, or if you really need a more comfortable shave, this would be a good razor for you.</li>
            <li>I am always trying to find shaving products to give me a closer and more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I was able to land this razor free.  </li>
            <li>The shave was close, smooth, and he actually enjoyed using the razor.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I lathered up and was amazed as the razor glided effortlessly over my face and through the stubble, giving the smoothest, most comfortable shave that I have had.</li>
            <li>This is the best 10$ I ever spent.</li>
            <li>More blades, more power, and whatever else their powerful marketing machine is able to drum up.  </li>
            <li>bulkier and seem to provide a cleaner more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for the 20 blade, vibrating, self lubricating, razor that compliments you on your technique as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;Because of that I&#x27;ve still been scavenging Mach 3 blades (still a great razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear</li>
            <li>He says it gives him a really great, close shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin (he says it feels soft afterward).  </li>
            <li>Gillette razors in general are just great, regardless of the latest gadget they&#x27;ve added to their newest razor.  </li>
            <li>and it was much more comfortable then</li>
            <li>If you want the most baby skin smooth head and face, you will want to try this razor.</li>
            <li>They never gave me a great shave, but I chocked that up to my sensitive skin and thought razor burn and bumps were unavoidable.</li>
            <li>I shave every day, and have tried everything to make it more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I used it both with the power turned on and off and the vibrations do give me a closer and more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I was able to go against the grain pain free and it was probably the closest shave that I have ever had.</li>
            <li>The pulses were smoother and made the shave more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>even more effortless smooth</li>
            <li>Got the free razor from Gillette and first impression was good on looks.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to apply any after shave lotions too since this worked out great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The most comfortable shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE is the most technologically advanced ever.</li>
            <li>SO SMOOTH THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was part of the free trial program, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vibrating head and blades make for one of the smoothest and most comfortable</li>
            <li>While i thought the vibration in the power handle was nothing more than a cheap gimmick</li>
            <li>Really glad I received this free from a Gillette program, it gave me another chance to try a razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really great if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor is my favorite of all of the widely available supermarket brand razors.  </li>
            <li>While the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, I would have gladly paid for it in a heartbeat</li>
            <li>Also it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I received this free razor via a program run by Gilette and have been pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>The first shave, as with most first shaves, was great.  </li>
            <li>I am used to the old convention of using the Blade and found this as a great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products all of my adult life (40+ years), and have always been happy with them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liked the light weight and overall great unit for the money.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can use it in the shower and the handle has a battery indicator light.</li>
            <li>The handle feels great in your hand, and is not heavy at all, even though it has a battery powering it.</li>
            <li>It is realy smooth shaving, My wife even love it .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Gillette fusion power glide handle is the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s able to mimic the smooth and effortless glide of an electric razor while shaving as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>The ProGlide Power handle is comfortable to use--way better than disposables.</li>
            <li>give you a closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this razor many times BEFORE receiving a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I was given a free razor which was provided via a program run by Gillette and am so glad I was.  </li>
            <li>the handle on this razor is incredibly well balanced and fits well in the hand, giving me ultimate control of the blade.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this free razor from a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>Love how smooth it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>The Proglide has a nice sturdy grip that can be held comfortably and the vibration allows for an easy and clean shave.</li>
            <li>The vibrating gives you a slightly more comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>The 5 blade razor has a pivoting head which flowed with the contours of my face providing me with a close, comfortable, and sexy ( my wife&#x27;s words) shave.</li>
            <li>far as the actual shave, this razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve used in giving a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this razor out for free, it did</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took part in this free razor program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>the rabid vibration paired with the power blade makes my morning go much more [smooth.]</li>
            <li>However even though I was able to try it for free, I still tell friends and family to go buy it because it works so well for me.</li>
            <li>I received this free to try from Gillette and am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Fusion Proglide Razor is already the most comfortable,</li>
            <li>The best handle I&#x27;ve used is on the Schick Xtreme - curved, lots of ridges to get a good grip (especially when using in the shower), and a convenient indent towards the end where your thumb naturally goes.  </li>
            <li>I have never had my skin feel this smooth from a shave except maybe when I had no hair on my face. :-)  </li>
            <li>As the day went on I was able to feel some roughness on the the fusion side of my face while the proglide remand relatively smooth.</li>
            <li>I received a fusion proglide power free through a program run by Gillette, and I have to say that this razor doesn&#x27;t perform any better than the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave with the additional trim blade on top.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a good close shave.</li>
            <li>I buy this one pay 2$, so is a good deal, the quality is very well.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a really good razor that doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;tag &amp; pull\\&quot; sensation and this razor really does the job.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I picked up kits for my sons.     </li>
            <li>I really liked this razor and it would be worth the money to buy it.</li>
            <li>OMG I LOVED how much faster it was at shaving than my now behated Quattro.</li>
            <li>Ive always been a Gillette fan, but this razor is powerful &amp; extremely effective...</li>
            <li>Well worth it for the nice shave.</li>
            <li>the M3 was the best I had tried before, but this new Fusion Proglide actually is pretty comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The blade across the top is actually pretty handy , it shaved close to my nose and made sideburns even and easy.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to grip and a cinch to clean, even in the shower!</li>
            <li>easy to clean and well built too!</li>
            <li>Firstly, when I started shaving the Gillette sensor excel 2 blade was excellent and provided a good shave with less to no irritation at all when used with a shave gel.</li>
            <li>The new handle is great and is comfortable to hold while I shave.</li>
            <li>The ProGlide blades are so good that even after 15 shaves, the blade is still better than new Mach III or TRAC II, I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that it does look nice when you press the power button on the handle and does light up a very nice blue!  </li>
            <li>how easy it was to use at any angle, how the vibration provided a closer, more comfortable shave and even that it lit up.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to grip which resulted in a closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The handle is light weight and well designed for easy gripping and handling.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight, easy to maneuver and delivers a better shave than my electric razor which is now gathering dust in the drawer.  </li>
            <li>I can say without bias that the Proglide Power is easily the closest shave and most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever received from a handheld replacement razor system.</li>
            <li>I had been a loyal Schick Xtreme3 user for many many years.  </li>
            <li>The handle is superb and it it is easy to hold even when it is wet (like in the shower).</li>
            <li>Very smooth, clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>This new razor is amazing!  </li>
            <li>The rubbery grip has a nice feel to it and the weight feels just right.</li>
            <li>No pulling, no scraping and no slight discomfort that I occasionally experienced with Mach 3.</li>
            <li>she liked it better than her traditional, non-powered razor, but didn&#x27;t say it was exceptional.</li>
            <li>This is possibly the best shave he has ever gotten, and it left his skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s face, and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this product and am glad I was able to receive it for free through Gillette.</li>
            <li>Although the razor itself gave a clean shave, the handle was easy to hold and very light.  </li>
            <li>Last days I received this razor via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the razor I only could say this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, The new ergonomic design is perfect, and it&#x27;s much better than the others in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for my purposes, this new Proglide seems to fit the bill very nicely.</li>
            <li>The best shaving experience, closest shave, less strokes, saves time, is clean, very easy to clean are just some of the many supreme advantages this razor has compared to others.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that I received any better results from the power handle than I did from the original.</li>
            <li>(I have one other Gillette that I use, too) and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Despite its bulkier width, I found that this handle was more user friendly.</li>
            <li>This thing is so cool!</li>
            <li>This razor looks and feels awesome, but at the end of the day it still shaves my face just like any other razor would.  </li>
            <li>it is most DEFINITELY worth it!</li>
            <li>COOL!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, due to my pattern of beard growth, manual razors tended to leave me with ingrown hairs all along my jawline, despite my best efforts to prevent them.  </li>
            <li>I can say with confidence that this razor delivers the best shave out of any other razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>the original fusion in my opinion glided better.</li>
            <li>This little magnificent beauty feels so sophisticated in my hand.</li>
            <li>The Mircopulses from the battery powered handle get the job done quick and easy!</li>
            <li>The power feature wasn&#x27;t something that I was all that excited about but have grown to love.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself matches the best of other products I&#x27;ve used and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that I was satisfied and certainly not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This razor ranks one of the best in my opinion and it outlasted any other disposable blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I easily got a good close, clean shave and didn&#x27;t nick myself, not even on my first time using this razor.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a great new product out on the market, it&#x27;s worth checking out!  </li>
            <li>I experienced a close, smooth shave with no irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>got this razor free from a program that Gillette was running, and it is great marketing on their part because I am no longer using my old razors.  </li>
            <li>I found this razor to give me a great smooth shave for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit bigger than what I had before, more suited to a man&#x27;s hand, and the contour is great.</li>
            <li>Gillette has made a quality handle that makes shaving easy.  </li>
            <li>The handle fits my hand and is easy to handle, almost as if it was designed just for me.  </li>
            <li>The time to set up the handle with battery and cartridge was very quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The power button is easy to find.  </li>
            <li>So I recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide non-power version as a more eco-friendly and wallet-friendly alternative with the same great shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the handle is easy.</li>
            <li>Its position on the handle easily allows you to trigger the power without needing to feel around the handle for the button.</li>

            <li>The grip makes it easy so not to slip when water and/or shaving cream drips.  </li>
            <li>I found it easy to maneuver, but what I didn&#x27;t understand was the battery-operated micro pulses that are supposed to make the shave even smoother.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality handle with an excellent blade that does a great (albeit expensive) job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Easy to use with well-balanced quality &amp; \\&quot;spring blades\\&quot; to eliminate nicks.</li>
            <li>I have been a longtime fan of Gillette, having used their razors for easily 95% of my shaving life.</li>
            <li>More tips:  Proraso shave cream in the green metal tube is the best.              </li>
            <li>The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was easy to use.    </li>
            <li>It is a great combination to safely cut against the grain in places where I dared not take my double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>Since it cuts the whisker so clean, I can also go more than 2 days without shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money for me but if you don&#x27;t need the best shave or don&#x27;t care enough about your face</li>

            <li>/&gt;I was already pretty happy with the Fusion ProGlide razor, and was interested to learn what the Fusion ProGlide Power handle would add to the experience.</li>
            <li>And the battery powered razor helps clean it better than any razor I have had.</li>
            <li>The handle allows you to easily maneuver the blade across all areas of your face and reach even the hardest spots around your nose or ears.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not always easy to put pressure on something.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs as easy.  </li>
            <li>I have a beard, and clean up all around it including my neck, and I am pleased that this prevented irritation and razor burn.</li>
            <li>As if I could expect that it might be damaged easily if it were to be dropped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I get razor burn incredibly easy.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy hold on to and a pleasure to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Easy grip handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a more quick, more clean, or more comfortable shave than with</li>
            <li>The handle is sleek and is comfortable and the overall shave is incredible.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Its handle is comfortable, easy to clean, and IT VIBRATES!</li>
            <li>I read the information that came with the razor and on the web and was impressed by Gillette&#x27;s audacity (for instance, a circuit board to keep an even flow of juice to the vibrator motor even as the battery runs down, and special groves to feed whiskers into the onrushing blades as the user draws the Fusion Proglide across a cheek!).    </li>
            <li>I feel the handle is light although it has a battery in it and the light weight makes the shaving experience very smooth and pain free.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great razor, with a comfortable  handle, very smooth shave, and has sped up my mornings quite a bit as a result.</li>
            <li>My husband liked this razor very much.</li>
            <li>My wife also liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>It shaves nicely in the large, easily accessed areas of the face, but around the nose, mouth and chin, I found it more cumbersome than precise.</li>
            <li>The best thing about the handle is the large grip that gives you good control of the shave and does not feel like it will fall apart after a few use.</li>
            <li>The handle was very cool looking and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Fast, smooth and easy to use!!</li>
            <li>I had pretty nice growth on my face and head.  </li>
            <li>With the nice sharp  razors and the added vibration works great.</li>
            <li>for good reason, since I&#x27;ve been using a normal Fusion Pro-Glide for years</li>
            <li>The shave was nice, and pretty close.  </li>
            <li>Traditional shaving soaps last months, are good for your skin, and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>But the cost savings, even over just a year, will be SIGNIFICANT for me -- almost $60/year vs. the Fusion Power... AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHAVE EVER???</li>
            <li>I liked the close shave I got, even without trimming my beard first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ever since it first came out and have been an enthusiastic fan.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to try this for free as part of a program by Gillette, I don&#x27;t think I would have purchased this without a significant coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I first took it out of the package, I noticed the nice grip on the handle.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was the gentle vibrations, or maybe the five blades, or more likely both together, but I was totally impressed with the closeness, efficiency, and ease of my shave.  </li>
            <li>First it has the teardrop shape at the bottom of the handle which fits nicely in the palm of you hand.  </li>
            <li>I also like to soak my razor in hot water before I use it, to warm it up, but I was scared to do that with a battery being in the handle.</li>
            <li>Its easy to get spoiled to the super close shave this razor system provides!  </li>
            <li>first impression on the razor is that it&#x27;s a nice look.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product, but the vibration did irritate my skin at first.  </li>
            <li>I assumed that it would be more of a gimmick than a true differentiator.</li>
            <li>This razor is hands down the best that money can buy.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This razor, from the handle to the blades is awesome,  my hubby got it from a Gilette promotion and has not put it down.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best shaving system.  </li>
            <li>, it does an amazing job, is very gentle (important to me since I have eczema).</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp and aid in getting that perfect shave.</li>
            <li>The weight feels good in my hands too, not like some new rinky-dink disposable....</li>
            <li>But, you won&#x27;t have to worry about anything, except maybe looking too good with this new razor from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>The handle itself is smooth and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>They both work fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to grip, fits comfortably in my hand, and allows me a closer shave then ever before.</li>
            <li>ProGlide Fusion Power is a perfectly fine product, and I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from buying it.</li>
            <li>shape of the Power Blade made it easy and comfortable to hold, but I pass on the vibrations.</li>
            <li>The handle feels comfortable in my hands and easily maneuverable around my face and neck.</li>
            <li>smooth shave with an easy to grip handle.</li>
            <li>The unit is light weight and has an easy to hold and maneuver handle that provides a smoother shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Speaking of which, the handles grooves and sleek designed helped me to easily and smoothly glide the razor across my neck and face.</li>
            <li>, each has been an improvement over the previous, with the newest generation being the best.    </li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t disagree that the Fusion cuts fine</li>
            <li>Smooth and easy on the face.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, gives a close comfortable shave and leaves my face feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li>This is just an improvement on what was already fine.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to operate, which I dig.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>It has rubber grips that both make it comfortable to hold on to and easy to manuver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, this is an incredibly comfortable, easy to grip handle.  </li>
            <li>It holds blades securely and releases them easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a fine razor package, and the powered handle does offer some marginal improvement over the manual</li>
            <li>shave itself is comfortable and easy on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Even shaving against the grain of my hair was easy and pain free.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be just fine.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this razor and recommend it for a smooth, easy shave.</li>
            <li>i was less impressed with as I still felt friction, which the claims are that the battery operated pulses reduce.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, it makes shaving so much less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for creating another Great product for Real Men!</li>
            <li>Manual razor would work just as fine in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product from fine hair but it struggles for course hair.</li>
            <li>The handle grips are comfortable; the handle doesn&#x27;t slip while shaving and it is easy to control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all what could a vibrating razor really do besides make your girlfriend happy, with the close shave you&#x27;ll get, of course.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably less than $2 a week for an awesome shaving experience.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable in the hand and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoyed using this razor and you can tell it is another great razor in the long line of Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>Like all Gillette products, I love the quality of the shave I get, and with this razor I can really trim up around my beard and have nice clean lines.  </li>
            <li>As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor.</li>
            <li>Oh and its super cheap too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get an incredibly close, clean shave with minimal effort and no irritation.</li>
            <li>This razor blades are extraordinary!</li>
            <li>The vibration was adequate at making it seem like my shave was better off than without the battery powered function.  </li>
            <li>Pressing the power button your welcomed with a bright blue power light and a very strong vibration that is focused on the head of the razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s 100% perfect, but it&#x27;s 100% better than most other straight edge razors.</li>
            <li>With the advent of more blades (3 or more), in general I&#x27;ve been much more satisfied with the quality and easy of shave.</li>
            <li>handle is extremely well engineered and weighted perfectly for a clean and neat shave.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free Fusion ProGlide Power handle from Gillette on a trial and was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable and you get more than you pay for!  </li>
            <li>I must first disclose that I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor free of charge from Gillette to write an honest non-bias review.</li>
            <li>The handle is a truly revolutionary design, and I am so happy to have had the opportunity to try this new and exciting way to shave.</li>
            <li>Really a smooth, easy and totally comfortable experience using whatever gel cream was on sale.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to be able to try a free sample Gillette sent me.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to get one for free through a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I feel the Fusion ProGlide provided a very smooth shave leaving my face feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>It was great to try and I will continue to use the Fusion products as I love the nice close nick free shave that I had by using this product just not sure the vibration added anything to the experience.</li>
            <li>I had no complaints with the last razor, but I was in need of new blades and figured I might as well get the latest and greatest.  </li>
            <li>and they fit on the Proglide razor just fine.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice large blade surface</li>
            <li>This little comb seems to straighten out the hair as you shave so the hairs hit the blade at the perfect angle...</li>
            <li>I received this razor from gilette to try , for which I was very pleased to try the product, the handle performs with high efficiency.  </li>
            <li>I received the Gillette power handle for free through one of their marketing programs and was a little impressed by it.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t mind the very bright power button, this would be well worth a try for a regular razor user.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best razors I have used hands down!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best razors I have used hands down!</li>

            <li>There&#x27;s grips to help you have a comfortable shave, and the razor handle contains a microchip that provides power every shave because the micro-pulse makes shaving effortless, smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>fact that it&#x27;s waterproof is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>But I have been a huge fan of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide brand,</li>
            <li>They got rid of the battery indicator that I never used nor did I think was accurate</li>
            <li>5 blades seemed like a bit much, but I tried it because honestly, it was free and why not?</li>

            <li>Its design is sleek and the blue light indicator is a great feature.</li>
            <li>I also find that the quality of shaving Gel that you use makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been keeping a bald head for about 6 weeks now and this razor is a huge improvement from the twin.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Gillette from Sensor XL to Mach 3 .</li>
            <li>I guess maybe my skin is too sensitive, but I thought that this was supposed to the best for sensitive skin...</li>

            <li>no annoying rubber fins/</li>

            <li>CLOSE SMOOTH AND COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li>In 30 plus years, I have never known his face to be so smooth and free of stubble.</li>
            <li>that area is smooth.</li>
            <li>The construction was also cheap, I had a Fusion break apart on me after a year.  </li>
            <li>Tried the cheap (U$70)</li>
            <li>but I like a smooth head</li>
            <li>Id have to go over it 2 or 3 times for my face to feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I shaved my head with this in the shower, and it was so smooth</li>

            <li>so it&#x27;s important</li>
            <li>I can not believe how smooth my face feels after a shave.  </li>
            <li>To say it is a smooth shave is an understatement.  </li>
            <li>My wife now calls me \\&quot;Baby Face\\&quot; because of how smooth my face feels after shaving.</li>
            <li>it is nowhere as comfortable as the Hydro 5 and hence the 2 stars.   </li>
            <li>so why go cheap and tear up your face if you do not have to..</li>
            <li>I can be completely smooth in the morning and by 7:00 at night, my face feels like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this is the reason the ProGlide feels to smooth.  </li>

            <li>but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh</li>
            <li>However I have to admit this razor gives a really comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>safety razor came into  being when a guy named Gillette devised a &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; to eliminate the need  to hold the razor at a precise angle to shave the face.  </li>
            <li>I would say it gives a feeling of so called &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; as it suppresses friction feel and makes it feel smooth.</li>
            <li>It glides over my face and takes with it unwanted hair, leaving a smooth aftermath that I thoroughly enjoy.  </li>

            <li>For starters, I do need to mention that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle was provided to me free through a Gillette campaign.  </li>

            <li>I work in an industry where it is important to maintain a clean-cut look.</li>
            <li>The lubristrip allowed for smooth strokes and as a result, the razor was gliding effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, they have addressed that issue in this product.</li>
            <li>In each situation, the result was a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>If you continue to use the cartridge after the lubristrip has worn out, you will lose some of the benefits of the product&#x27;s smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The 5-blades and microcomb allow for a smooth shave and remain resilient after repeated uses, but because the lubristrip wears out, the cartridge needs to be trashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been happy with my shave quality for several years.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a giant gimic and waited until I saw a great deal on this product to try it.  </li>

            <li>I received the ProGlide Power Razor free through a program offered by Gillette.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t be free, so that was a plus.  </li>
            <li>moLNN8UHVUWUC4]]I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor from Gillette as a promotion.</li>
            <li>When I received my free razor that was provided to me via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the ability to hold the handle firmly, especially when using straight from the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m fairly picky when it comes to razors.</li>
            <li>and after i have compared both of thoses i tried the schick hydro 3and that was the best of them all it is much smother and moist and the replacement razors are the cheapest of the three and my 5oclock shadow came in later than when shaving with fusion pro glide as for closeness</li>
            <li>and though I really like the fusion I don&#x27;t think it is perfect as occasionally</li>
            <li>The massage feature is more of a novelty than a bonus, but overall it is a good product that I will continue using.</li>
            <li>- I shave more whiskers in one stroke than most peach-fuzz Caucasians shave in a whole week...</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I love how there is no irritation and the vibration really stimulates the whiskers to make for one smooth shaving experience!</li>
            <li>but they do a complete job in giving a good shave.</li>
            <li>8 times now and the battery power does seem to hold good so far (battery does not feel drained).  </li>
            <li>I am sure that the power light is an useful feature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice an ergonomic, but I don&#x27;t need to shave for hours and found normal shavers to be more than adequate.</li>
            <li>The shave is very smooth and closeness of the blade gives a fresh and clean look with the power razor blades.</li>
            <li>The first 4 or 5 uses on a new blade are great.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for the right razor all my adult life and happily my quest has ended.  </li>
            <li>very easy and clean shave and very durable!</li>
            <li>I have to say I received this razor as part of  a Gillette program to try a new razor, but I was very glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at a great price, more affordable than any other store I&#x27;ve seen them at.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Gillette fusion proglide cartridge to everyone!!!!</li>
            <li>The power function is very useful</li>
            <li>overall a very nice razor</li>
            <li>The power function is very useful</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for better, more comfortable blade.</li>
            <li>The vibrating blade really does help and I liked precision trimmer for getting a clean shave below the nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle for the quick touch ups.  </li>
            <li>so when I got this handle for free to try, I was excited.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power gives me an incredibly close shave that lasts longer than any of my other shavers.</li>
            <li>I was provided this product for free through a program run by Gillette, and I must say that it has not disappointed me at all.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into buying the latest and greatest then Gillette doesn&#x27;t disappoint, but if you&#x27;re a creature of habit I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the price to try and see.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the despite my happiness with my old standby safety razor, this new cartridge really did a great job.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I managed to get a chance to try one of these for free from a special Gillette program.</li>
            <li>Wonderful fresh feeling clean shave - with extremely close precision</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first blade after 4 weeks and the shave is still very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I has 5 blades that cut pretty close and is very smooth, however, I did use shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I deliberately did not shave for two days to give this Gillette Fusion Proglide a run for its money and it passed the test with flying colors it gave me a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Being in the Army, having a clean shaven face is incredibly important.  </li>
            <li>The shave provided was smooth, clean and took no time at all.</li>
            <li>* Clean and smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power did provide a clean, close and comfortable shave -- regardless of whether the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; made a difference or not.  </li>
            <li>like my face to be clean and smooth but this is just too close of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Clean, close, comfortable shave but</li>
            <li>The razor cut so smooth and clean</li>
            <li>Clean, close shaves, without nicks and cuts, with a smooth, even feel are what these blades have delivered.</li>
            <li>and I still get that close, clean, razor burn free shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power system us a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It did provide a smooth, clean shave though.</li>
            <li>I ended up with a clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth clean shave, even without turning on the power.  </li>
            <li>Although I did get a clean and smooth shave</li>
            <li>The blade really does glide across your face and the handle is way more comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s no nicks, there&#x27;s no missed spots, just a clean, close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I gave a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I credit the close, smooth shave to the battery vibration and the super fine blades.</li>
            <li>the handle was super easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li>The handle is cool looking, it feels solid and has a great grip.</li>
            <li>The button that releases the blade is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but this razor makes it quick, easy, and painless.     </li>
            <li>The Gillette multiblade systems are very forgiving of rushed shaving, and truly do a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>Although quite pricey, the 5 or so blades on this razor make shaving a quick and easy job.</li>
            <li>After using the razor all week, my latest shave was just as comfortable as the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I figured at the very most I&#x27;d need to simply find a better shaving foam/gel, but I never did find it.</li>
            <li>The handle is pretty good, i did&#x27;t really see the benefit of a vibrator, but the razor worked well</li>
            <li>However, an easy twist allows the end to come off giving quick access to the battery when it needs to be changed.  </li>
            <li>I have used the normal Gillette Fusion when shaving for many many years.</li>
            <li>I feel, as I do with most Gillette products, that I am using a quality product and have confidence that it will give me a close, comfortable and consistent shave.</li>
            <li>and I find that Fusion blade will give me a more comfortable shave more than twice as many times of \\&quot;premium\\&quot; razors and at least 4 times as much as a good throw away razor.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and grow hair very rapidly, so a great razor is quite important to me.  </li>
            <li>I wish the blade was a little large to cover more area at once, but otherwise I was very happy with the razor.</li>
            <li>I found the razor very easy to manipulate and shave with thanks to this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent handling, well thought out, and my new favorite!  </li>
            <li>I think I found my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li>Both the Proglide and Fusion Power are nice handles and needed for the high quality Gillette blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>Its a nice looking razor, looks high quality, and like a well made product.  </li>
            <li>Due to the greater time-consumption of maintaining a straight razor, I suggest trying a safety razor outfit first.shaving soaps last months, are good for your skin, and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for a great new product.</li>
            <li>I got the razor free through a special offer from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>But... because a special program by Gillette gave me the opportunity to try out the  Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free, I decided to give it a try and have been using it for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li>I recieved this razor free from a special Gillette program.</li>
            <li>Through a special prgoram run by Gillette, I had the fortunate opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels great when using it, better than previous Gillette products.</li>
            <li>This Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is great and gets extra close, but it seems like the battery runs out kinda quickly.  </li>
            <li>I loved my old Gillette Fusion and have been loyal to it for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved several times with it and the battery is still going strong, so that&#x27;s a good sign as well.</li>
            <li>The power button lights up bright blue, so it is easy to remember to turn it off.  </li>
            <li>It quick, smooth, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That was the first thing that pleased me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I received noticed it was coming, I was really excited.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Vibration: I was excited by this.  </li>
            <li>I could feel a significant increase in my shaving comfort with the vibration on.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor so so much!</li>
            <li>plus they added a nice blue LED light which makes it more up to date with the LED craze.</li>
            <li>and I must say I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>with these blades it is not a problem and they significantly reduce the amount of razor burn.</li>
            <li>This razor shaves close and cleanly more so than the non-powered version on the first pass.</li>
            <li>After receiving the Gillette Fusion Proglide, which was acquired through a Gillette sponsored program for me to try out, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>After years of being a traditional Gillette blade shaver I have seen a remarkable difference in the quality of the shave provided by the Power Glide.</li>
            <li>I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I love that the first battery is even included, ive had mine for over a month and still haven&#x27;t had to change the battery either.</li>
            <li>Intially was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to step out of the norm and try this battery powered razor by gillete.</li>
            <li>When the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor was first released I was more than hesitant to give it try.</li>
            <li>First of all I love the blade.</li>
            <li>, I love it, and it really works!</li>
            <li>Nothing mind blowing, but definitely fun!</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette products in the past and have always been impressed</li>
            <li>razor was originally provided to me through a gillette program</li>
            <li>First, the side grips on the razor gave me a better handle on it when shaving in the razor.</li>
            <li>Not sure how that&#x27;s going to fly with the Budget Nazi!  </li>
            <li>3&lt;br /&gt;#2 original fusion</li>
            <li>With the claims of a revolutionary razor, I believe most of the hype to be exactly that, hype.     </li>
            <li>My shave feels much more comfortable, looks better, and even with 5 blades it works well against my sensitive skin which I already see improving.</li>
            <li>Well evidently their position is to now have millions more batteries going into our landfills.</li>
            <li>POWER BUTTON LIGHT IS COOL.</li>
            <li>If I were rich and spendthrift</li>
            <li>and I aslo discovered that the Proglide does not shave ANY closer than the original Fusion.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item when it was originally introduced and enjoyed it at first.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to see what it felt like</li>
            <li>would save my money on this razor and go for the original fusion or even the quattro.  </li>
            <li>I got the Gillette Fusion Power to try, not knowing what to expect, but wanting a better option for travel than my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Gillette Fusion today for the first time</li>
            <li>I compared them to the original Fusion, and saw a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>and I was excited about getting the pro glide version.</li>
            <li>I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how long my whiskers are it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I could feel the friction increase significantly.  </li>
            <li>I hope that the razor has a long life span because it&#x27;s a joy to shave with.</li>
            <li>&quot; I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when the power symbol lit up in a wonderful hue of blue light.</li>
            <li>I got the manual version a couple of month ago and was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the buck!</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>However, with the closeness of the shave obtained by the device, it may just be worth it!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the buck!</li>
            <li>I must say first of that I have used mostly electric razors.</li>
            <li>The razor all and all is pretty outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve had with it so far.</li>
            <li>if the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handle makes it cut any closer then the original fusion razor</li>
            <li>Still using the original blade.</li>
            <li>and I felt that I had a good control on the razor in general.</li>
            <li>This razor was provided through a program by Gillette and when it arrived I was excited to take it for a test drive</li>
            <li>She said that for areas like her knees (with funny angles), she&#x27;s never had a better shave.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power (what can I say,</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is a unique style of razor that uses vibration to help lift and separate stubble so that it&#x27;s easier to trim.  </li>
            <li>First off Gillette provided me with a power proglide to try and I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I was excited about trying Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to see what it could do for me.  </li>
            <li>my first impression when I got it \\&quot;things have sure changed since I first started shaving in 1967\\&quot;, some for the better and some just for the change.</li>
            <li>I received the razor free through a promotion with Gillette, and I am now a true believer in this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine any significant improvements</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>far as the shaving went, I was very pleased with the performance of the razor.</li>
            <li>For the most part (once the first two shaves are out of the way)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed</li>
            <li>That aside, after shaving with it, I would be more than willing to pay for this product.</li>
            <li>That being said this razor still gave me an excellent shave and I will definitely be using more in the future.</li>
            <li>have tried both the power and non-power body; I like both but don&#x27;t notice a significant difference between the bodies.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than many others, but the difference in quality is substantial and impressive.  </li>
            <li>And then I received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor which, of course, came with a cool power handle.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really unique.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too noisy and actually was kind of soothing (but then I can also fall asleep as the barber buzzes my hair, so maybe it is just me!).</li>
            <li>Shaving has never been a favorite activity of mine, but the ProGlide definitely makes it more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes this razor unique from others in the market is the handle.</li>
            <li>What I found was a nice clean and smooth result when I was done, The power handle adds more to the shave I feel and definitely plan to continue using it!</li>
            <li>But I like it, a very smooth and comfortable shave, and also very close</li>
            <li>The LED lighting on the handle is a nice extra touch, and the device is very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The handle on the Fusion Proglide power razor that i received free through promotional program run by Gillette has a very comfortable grip, therefore making shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li>Before the first time I used it I had around a 5 day growth going due to my playoff beard, but having to conduct interviews at work I thought it best to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work just fine without being turned on, and is a good enough handle in that case.</li>
            <li>Truth is, though, I have found very good razors for much less long-term cost.  </li>
            <li>the size of the grips really gives a strong hold!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor for people who want to spend a little more on a razor without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette shaving products in the past and this has proven to be the most superior that I have experienced thus far.</li>
            <li>The best thing, to me, about the power handle is the vibrations keep me from having to press so hard to get my head as smooth as I want it.  </li>
            <li>When I received the Fusion ProGlide razor, I really liked the new grippier handle, drop in weight, and increased circumference which made it easier to hold and maneuver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then my gf, being a loving and caring gf, tossed it out one day and bought me a new razor.</li>
            <li>and, most importantly worked VERY well.</li>
            <li>After I received my free sample from a program Gillette was running, I used the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle and quickly saw and felt a change.</li>
            <li>The shave was effortless and the blades rinsed clean each time I ran them under the water.</li>
            <li>This razor by far gave the best shave possible.  </li>
            <li>By keeping my electric razor clean the thing lasts years and saves me a ton of money in the process.  </li>
            <li>Powers makes this shaver super smooth.</li>
            <li>It gets a super close shave and leaves a smooth face.</li>
            <li>This razor gives you the neat and clean feel without the effort.</li>
            <li>It gets a clean, close shave in no time.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because I also got to try the all in one trimmer and found that I liked the thicker handle better.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any problems with the blades getting clogged, and shaving with this razor is super quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It offers the most enjoyable characteristics of both electric and non-electric razors.</li>
            <li>There is no question about the needs for a man to have a clean shave here and there.</li>
            <li>Super smooth shave, no nicks or cuts or anything.  </li>
            <li>They would clean house.</li>
            <li>They would clean house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried most of the hyped-up Gillette and Schick razors over the years, and while they were a definite improvement over the throwaway kind, they were never all they were cracked up to be -</li>
            <li>I’ve always gone back to Gillette because the craftsmanship of the product always works best for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Colorful, easy to review, and caught-my-eye as I walked by.  </li>
            <li>I get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I tried this morning super smooth shave, no nicks or cuts or anything.</li>
            <li>I have a beard and got a close, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I received the power handle free from Gillette, and quickly noticed the soothing effects of the Gillette Fusion PowerGlide Power handle on my face.  </li>
            <li>The vibration feature is great for ensuring a close, smooth shave with minimal skin irritation.</li>
            <li>The vibration also helps clean the blade out easier when I rinse it which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>and Luckily I got this product for free via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I think it aids in getting that super close smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the regular ProGlide for a while and didn&#x27;t think I could find anything I liked better.  </li>
            <li>The result was a super clean and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>As far as razors go, and I&#x27;ve used many, this is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>I was Shaving with a manual 5 blade razor and thought I was getting a close and clean shave&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really is the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I was able to try a free razor thanks to a program ran by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I used it to cleanly cut and trim my side</li>
            <li>It did rinse out cleanly after each use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor glides on your skin , giving you a super close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I got a super close and smooth shave with NO redness.</li>
            <li>I find it easier to clean the razor as well between the blades.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got ones with 60 blades, that vibrate, wash your car, clean your room and might even shave your face.  </li>
            <li>Rinses out incredibly clean under the faucet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, when the doorbell rang and I received my \\&quot;promotional product\\&quot;, I was excited to try it right then!</li>
            <li>I had been using the Gillette Sensor Excel razor for years and thought that it gave pretty good results, but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is battery powered so it is able to tackle the stubble a little more easily.  </li>
            <li>I just figured razor technology had gone about as far as it could go, and adding more blades or a gimmick like battery power were just oneupmanship between the two major brands to win market</li>
            <li>I got a nice close clean shave and my skin felt very soft.  </li>
            <li>It was a very nice shave on my long beard hair.</li>
            <li>The Fusion did add the single blade trimmer, which is great.  </li>
            <li>The single blade is great for under the nose and sideburns.</li>
            <li>The Fusion ProGlide handle feels very good in the hand and the vibration, in combination with an excellent blade, provides an extremely close shave on a serious beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this razor as part of a Gillette promotion for free and have actually been very happy with it - it fits nicely in my hand, has a good grip to it, and the batteries seem to last a lot longer than my last razor (which really seemed to chew up batteries).  </li>
            <li>This is particularly true if you, or your spouse, is a gadget friendly guy like myself.</li>
            <li>I received the Fusion Power Proglide from Gillette for free as part of a program they are sponsoring to promote the product, the price was right so even though I am primarily an electric user I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>The feel of the handle was very comfortable and felt very natural in my hand!!</li>
            <li>To no surprise, I did receive a little bit a skin irritation, but all and all a very good shave.</li>
            <li>than that, I would recommend the pro Glide Styler to anyone interested in easy and comfortable shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the handle is decent, but I think most would be fine without the micropulse feature of the handle.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I love Gillette and have been a loyal user since I started shaving 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li>However, I really like the nice new handle design as well as being able to easier clean the hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer on the other end of the handle was great for my sideburns, or if I wanted to go for a \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; look and not the smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li>get me wrong--the ProGlide Fusion Power delivered a very close, very comfortable shave...</li>
            <li>/&gt;To use a straight razor,  the angle where the  razor met the skin for shaving was very important.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that the light flashes when the batteries are low but why have the light on the whole time while you shave?</li>
            <li>Oh and for full disclosure I did receive this for free through a Gillette Fusion progam, which may attribute to my excitement because who doesn&#x27;t like free things right?</li>
            <li>I thought the ergonomic design and easy to hold grip were great, but as someone with sensitive skin, I found the pulsating action unneeded.  </li>
            <li>Its great when its new, but eventually, even with new batteries and heads, it&#x27;ll grow to weaken.</li>
            <li>I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProGlide by a special program from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I got this razor through a special promotion from Gillette.</li>
            <li>It does and the \\&quot;special lubricating strip\\&quot; wears out sooner.  </li>
            <li>I got this from a special program from Gillette, but use an electric razor, so I gave it to my wife to use.</li>
            <li>I received a Gillette proglide razor as part of a special offer put on by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I received this handle to test via a special program from Gillette.</li>
            <li>but was nothing special that was advertised.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is no exception to this rule with both cartridges and a handle that is specially contoured and vibrates.  </li>
            <li>, I think you&#x27;ll be a convert right away!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re almost better off buying a new razor each time the way the technology changes!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for the clean, smooth shave every morning!</li>
            <li>I leave stubble on my face most of the time, and shave my neck clean, so I need to get a straight line under my jaw and chin.</li>
            <li>It really reduces the burning and helps give a clean smooth look!</li>
            <li>This razor cut through 5 days worth of stubble quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle offers a nice and clean shave.</li>
            <li>Overall good clean close shave.</li>
            <li>Getting a good, clean shave was simple with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it, so I knew the new version had to be better, right?</li>
            <li>The vibrate function is amazing and really adds a tingling feeling to the fact that I&#x27;m letting 5 incredible sharp blades get really close to my jugular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The grip is very good and allows you to maintain a firm grip while shaving.</li>
            <li>I found that the button for the on/off of the vibration wasn&#x27;t very easy to push and that it would have been better placed on the razor if it were closer to the blade by about an inch, or above the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made life easier when shaving around my jawbone (rough spot for me because I have some very strong gray hairs that don&#x27;t take kindly to razors).  </li>
            <li>My shave was a smooth process, no slipping of the razor handle and a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I was able to hold it steady and got all the hairs out with one swipe!</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is a great little razor, perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The power handle fits very nice in my hand and does not slip or cause me to loose my grip.  </li>
            <li>I asked the hospital for special permission to allow a 4 day growth, got the OK and then tried the unit and WOW what a change!!!  </li>
            <li>the time I was done shaving, I was pretty happy with the handle overall.  </li>
            <li>you do use the vibration feature, this Proglide version of the razor has a BRIGHT LED that the regular Fusion did not.</li>
            <li>It shaves great and truly glides along my face, much better than the store bought brands I usually use.</li>
            <li>The grip is great, it never slips even when soaking wet.  </li>
            <li>After a long week, I found out I have a bit more gray in my beard than I would like, so I was eager to see how effective my shave was going to be.  </li>
            <li>Shaving every-other day as I normally do, I found the Fusion Power to provide a more comfortable shave than the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this razor gives an amazingly close shave yet doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>handle on this product is great even when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li>, it looks kinda cool, too.  </li>
            <li>The powered handle seemed to increase the quality of shave and for someone who doesn&#x27;t shave very often, experiences like these make me want to shave more.</li>
            <li>but I enjoyed the shave so much that I am going to continue to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.</li>
            <li>In the spirit of full disclosure, I must mention that this product was provided to me via a program run by Gilette that I agreed to participate in.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle razor is a good mix of an electric razor with the convenience of a standard hand held razor.  </li>
            <li>The one thing keeping me from giving it the full 5 stars it that it seems like I do go through blades faster than with the proglide.  </li>
            <li>I think this product overall is good, however, I have a beard</li>
            <li>I highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li>Any product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to should probably almost full credit.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating head is also a cool addition, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it adds to my shave.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the sweet rims.  </li>
            <li>it looks cool, but doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li>Realistically, I get just as close of a shave without vibration and anyone who says otherwise may just be fooled by the cool looks and neat vibration.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I try to get them (against the grain) I always cut myself, which is true with this razor.</li>
            <li>The result was a shave  which was surprisingly painless and left my face smoother than it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this item was it was good for when you do not have time to properly shave, but then again so are throw away blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For example, I really wasn&#x27;t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head.</li>
            <li>I might have appreciated some of the features more if I had understood what they were for</li>
            <li>This was true with power or not, with the Mach 3 or the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now these aisles are full of price-shocked guys standing around scratching their heads, wondering what to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my experience, the only better shave you can get is from a straight razor or good safety razor with the old-fashioned shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll get a good shave, relatively speaking.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>Instead of a razor blade lasting me for a couple of weeks, tops, when I use foam, my blade is good for six to eight weeks when I use hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>but this PROGLIDE is really even better.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a good investment for now.</li>
            <li>Secondly, this razor performs amazingly well, and gives a close, smooth, comfortable, and non-irritating shave.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product and I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think I can get a better shave.</li>
            <li>It would also be better for those with elaborate and finely detailed facial hair designs I would think.   </li>
            <li>stick with the tried and true and you won&#x27;t pay for $3 cartridges</li>
            <li>Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a super clean cut....</li>
            <li>The Mach 3 then came out which did seem to be a better razor and provided a closer shave with out much irritation so it was a winner.</li>
            <li>Then Mach 3 power nitro came out and the power aspect felt good but the results was basically the same.</li>
            <li>They look cool</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use the Braun (which has a surprisingly good shave block) for daily shaving, and save the Proglide for trimming my sideburns and neckline where it excels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They made this razor very flexible, I&#x27;m guessing so that it will follow the contours of your neck better (maybe in the crook of the neck</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth like a baby&#x27;s skin and most important of them all, no blood anywhere.</li>
            <li>I alternate the electric with Gillete Mach III, which I would say are almost as good as these blades.</li>
            <li>Fusion Proglide does offer superior performance over standard disposables, of course.</li>
            <li>And it was cool</li>
            <li>After giving it a shot and trying both with it on and off, I feel it does help to stand the hairs up a bit better and really helps the blade slide across the face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cursed with fast growing beard that grows in many textures and directions.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was surprised with how much I liked this.  </li>
            <li>The power function is very neat and it seems to have a better shave with it on than with it off.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure how much of a difference the micropulses made.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive a complimentary Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Pardon the pun, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>, so much so that I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get a safe grip on the handle.</li>
            <li>Overall a good razor</li>
            <li>The blades would have been good enough without the vibration.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go and buy this product without a coupon or sale because I think regular cheaper razors do just as good, but this product does work well.</li>
            <li>I used to think the vibration was a gimmick, but after years of shaving with one of these razors, I can safely say it gives you a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get a very close shave without the tugging.  </li>
            <li>The power handle made my face feel very relaxed during shaves, but I had to turn it off while shaving around the lips and side burns (for more control).</li>
            <li>They definitely did a good job with this razor&#x27;s handle.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>With the ProGlide Power, not only does the size fit me perfectly, but the feel of it is a notch above everything else.  </li>
            <li>I have used Gillette products for years and have always overall loved them.</li>
            <li>However, when I received a free sample through Gillette, I figured that it was worth giving manual razors another shot.  </li>
            <li>The overall shave was good</li>
            <li>That was always a clear indication that I would be shaving at my own risk if I did not change the blade.  </li>
            <li>Neat style and cool colors.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s literally the damage I&#x27;ll do with this razor in a full year.</li>
            <li>In the interest of full disclosure, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle was given to me by a Gillette-run program.</li>
            <li>The  blade on the top side is very convenient.</li>
            <li>But overall a good razor.</li>
            <li>I have been using an electric for many years and this is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>it was just cool.  </li>
            <li>still think these types of razors are a bit overpriced, but I guess if you have to shave daily, and can find a great deal on them, it&#x27;s a pretty sweet handle.  </li>
            <li>It was a really cool product because the razor basically did all the work itself being powered by the battery.</li>
            <li>Having viewed a commercial for the product, I thought it sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I got a bit of razor burn, but not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this has more to do with selling more blades than an inability to find a longer lasting product that will work on the strip, but it is a little annoyance that gets tolerated because the product is pretty darn good!</li>
            <li>Which is great as unlike other razors the blade will not pop off when tapping it on the sink to clean out the stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that will change as the blade gets older and duller, but right out of the package this razor provides an easy shave.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Gillette for providing me with my new favorite razor form your free program.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor, the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this razor free through a program with Gillette, but this will be my new razor of choice.</li>
            <li>He was very impressed with smooth glide, the close shave and the razors that never seem to go dull!</li>
            <li>I have shaved with Gilette since high school and have tried everything they make including the original sensor, sensor excel, mach 3, disposable pivot plus, and my favorite the disposable Sensor 3 http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Disposable-Sensitive-Lubrastrip-Packages/dp/B001F51QWK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1281647873&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2 .</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting rid of any other blade and using this great product!!</li>
            <li>power button is easy to push and the battery compartment stays secure until you are ready to replace the battery.</li>
            <li>The handle has a good grip, so it doesn&#x27;t slip when wet, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Even when the handle got wet, it was still easy to keep a good grip and not lose control.</li>
            <li>The packaging was easy to open and it has a handily designed holder for the razor.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good upgrade over disposable razors but nothing great compared to other products in this league.</li>
            <li>The other feature that I was impressed with was that it will flash when the battery is low, much better than it just dying on you mid-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also weighted just right so that it provides a comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li>It make the razor smooth right over the skin</li>
            <li>My hair grows very quickly, so by the time the ProGlide Power was on my doorstep, its first challenge was rather visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the older version I could only get three good shaves at the most before feeling</li>
            <li>Well, I am now on my 14th day of my first Gillette Fusion Proglide blade and it&#x27;s still going strong (NO cuts or razor burn).  </li>
            <li>And the other cool thing is that these blades work perfectly on the Fusion Power chassis, so no need to buy the new Power Proglide razor (unless you just want to upgrade for the looks).    </li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable and high quality.</li>
            <li>The grips are very nice and let you grip the razor no matter how wet it is.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided.</li>
            <li>I can say that I have seen the changes that have been made, the good from bad and now the close-to the best handle that feels right!  </li>
            <li>Imagine my delight when I turned it over and saw that there was perforations along the back for easy opening!!</li>
            <li>This razor is a little pricey and the blades aren&#x27;t cheap, but this stick will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li>Other razors have dragged or pulled the stubble causing great discomfort and razor burn.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s THIS great other than a profession Hollywood barber shave.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of other razors and after having this for two weeks it still shaves great with out any tugging or razor burns to the skin.  </li>
            <li>The handle has a great grip, stops the razor from sliding like my other razor does all the time.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting, durable, comfortable and it gives a great shave!</li>
            <li>it still provides a good shave but seems to tug a little more.</li>
            <li>For times when you have a little more time to shave, I&#x27;d recommend a good old-fashioned safety razor.  </li>
            <li>The newly designed edge trimmer is a lot better than the one on the original Fusion.</li>
            <li>Using it for 3 weeks now, I would say I am happy with not super excited though.</li>
            <li>Better yet was that my new close shave didn&#x27;t irritate my baby&#x27;s face in any way!</li>
            <li>As a handicapped guy I love my new fusion proglide!</li>
            <li>I love it and plan to keep it until I need to buy a new one just like it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say one is better than the other, but they are both nice and solid and they feel good in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your partner will certainly appreciate it!!</li>
            <li>Shaving with the Gillette was relatively easy and provides a great shave; especially with micro pulsation technology that Gillette has developed.</li>
            <li>On initial \\&quot;hefting\\&quot; the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Gilette is seriously the best a man can get.</li>
            <li>Now I will be a loyal customer</li>
            <li>However, after getting this product as a gift from someone, I quickly became a fan again.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;flexible firmness\\&quot; was definitely an advantage, and it worked exceptionally well in conjunction with the blade.</li>
            <li>It works in the shower and provides a quick and painless experience.</li>
            <li>In fact I enjoy the slightly larger diameter feels nice.</li>
            <li>It does seems to be a bit more smoother shave than older Fusion.</li>
            <li>I quickly opened it and took the razor out.</li>
            <li>and I quickly got used to it</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the overall results and definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Ok I have to say that when I received the Gillette fusion proglide power razor, via a program run by Gillette, I was skeptical at best.  </li>
            <li>I definitely have more control while shaving and end up getting a better shave.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close, smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure if it is the power or the configuration of the blades, but I definitely feel like it had a better shave than a &#x27;non-power&#x27; razor.  </li>
            <li>With the blades dulling so quickly and the use of a battery to drive the micro pulse technology, this increases the cost of this razor exponentially.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Gillette customer from there line of shaving gel to aftershave.</li>
            <li>But I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li>All that&#x27;s left is smooth skin, it&#x27;s amazing how close it gets.</li>
            <li>I have never been a big fan of the more blades are better campaign</li>
            <li>The power vibrate seems more powerful but just as gentle while the blade has been improved to be even smoother on the skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no plugging in the razor as it&#x27;s battery operated and a nice feature is that the \\&quot;power on\\&quot; light flashes when the battery is running low and needs to be replaced soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent marketing ploy designed to influence Americans to buy whatever product big businesses want us to buy next.</li>
            <li>You can buy a good quality boar bristle shaving brush for $15, or as part of a set, which you use to apply the soaps from inside the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;For instructions and more information on the old art of traditional shaving, you can also check out The Art of Manliness blog ([...]), which is an enjoyable website for the cultivated man&#x27;s lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, safety razors and straight razors</li>
            <li>The Sensor was not impossibly wide/</li>
            <li>However, for those quick morning shaves before work</li>
            <li>and I have been a loyal Gillette razor users.  </li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;d need to be able to shave in a tenth of a second to justify $3.50 or more per cartridge.  </li>
            <li>While it seems to be bit more smoother than older Fusion when I shave with the grain, I don&#x27;t see any difference when I shave against the grain.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that Gillette was able to create another \\&quot;best shave</li>
            <li>When I bought this one, it has 3 dollars off promotional scheme and it was really worthy in term of money, value and usability.</li>
            <li>but I wished I bought it from a wholesale store I currently shop at where for just 15 more dollars I could have gotten 5 more blades.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would use a man&#x27;s razor because of the fact I have been a loyal consumer of Schick Quattro For Women.</li>
            <li>As far as multi-blade razors go, this is the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I went from standard disposables to this, and instead of getting a lot better shave and/or saving money, I got a marginally better shave for quite a bit of money.</li>
            <li>The power button also feels more substantial than the older models.</li>
            <li>Somehow the powered razor seems like its covering more surface area, making each pass more meaningful, which means less irritation.  </li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t think the power feature adds much to the razor, overall the razor provides a great shave, so I&#x27;m not taking off any stars.</li>
            <li>It was a quick, painless shave.  </li>
            <li>By far the most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was by far the easiest to handle razor and closest, most comfortable</li>
            <li>While the Proglide Power Blades do very well on their own, the Power Handle does make the shaving experience that much smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the old Fusion ProGlide (Manual), and body redesign has made the product way more comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the ProGlide and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li>If you are a fast grower of facial hair, this will help a great deal.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Gillette Pro Glide styler for about a month now, and must say it is a tremendous improvement over the Gillette Track II razor I have been using.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that I wish the replacement cartridges were cheaper but overall this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product for sure.</li>
            <li>The on/off button is perfectly located and it&#x27;s set back enough so that it need not come in contact with water when rinsing the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving was quick and effortless using the Proglide.</li>
            <li>I got this free from Gillette to try and I got to say I liked trying this over the regular mach 3.</li>
            <li>and I got the box and quickly opened it with excitement.</li>
            <li>I would think that any adequately sharpened blade would also prevent \\&quot;tug and pull\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor on the market for me and my needs, the blades shave close and the trimmer on the back side is an added addition to have when trimming your facial hair or body hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anywho, a quick pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>Overall this is a good razor and worth trying out.</li>
            <li>I was one of the luckily ones that got to try this power razor from a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>ever since Gillette hooked me up with my Proglide Power Handle, i feel like shaving has become quick and painless...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s immediately smooth, solid in the hand, and effective.</li>
            <li>razor is truly excellent, so why haven&#x27;t I been using a razor like this for the last ten years?</li>
            <li>The handle is bigger and has more grips for better control and even weight distribution.</li>
            <li>Cuts super close</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t think a vibrating handle would make much of a difference to a blade I already liked.</li>
            <li>It has more \\&quot;grippies\\&quot; kind of like suction cups preventing it from slipping in my fingers.  </li>
            <li>This has made my daily shaving routine a faster more enjoyable one.</li>
            <li>For a super close shave nothing beats the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many, many different razors.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a \\&quot;try me\\&quot; from Gillette and after trying it I think they have a brand new customer!!!!  </li>
            <li>After trying it for the first time I was very impressed; having just tried the Mach 3, I can state for certain that the vibrating motion in the power Fusion Proglide helps avoid snagging and makes for a much smoother shave experience overall.</li>
            <li>The grip was soft to touch and very easy to maneuver around my face.</li>
            <li>After trying the handle with the power off first, it was just like ant other blade handle, felt good in the hand, easy to maneuver, light...</li>
            <li>and he said it was great, although he mentioned that the blade was too large (due to the five blades) to shave under his nose easily</li>
            <li>Still better off with high quality disposables.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a better shave.</li>
            <li>I have been using a high end electric shaver for a couple of years now and absolutely love the ease and quality of shave</li>
            <li>A straight or safety razor would be as good, but really not better simply because this shaver did it perfectly.</li>
            <li>The new handle feels very comfortable in your hands.</li>
            <li>new handle for the razor is very comfortable and fits in my hand well.</li>
            <li>Most razors focus simply on the blades (which, by the way, even the blades for this razor are superb) and leave little attention to the handle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now mostly using my electric wet with a great gel I&#x27;ve found \\&quot;Nivea sensitive skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge deal once you&#x27;re aware of it, but remember the device vibrates.  </li>
            <li>First off, I would like to mention that I got this free to try through Gillette.  </li>
            <li>for the razor itself (which was provided free as a Gillette marketing program) after the first use, it looks like a winner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it does seem to work a bit better than my normal, non-powered Fusion razor.</li>
            <li>The first thing I tried after receiving it for free from Gillette was a side-by-side comparision with my Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Gillette shaving products almost exclusively since the original Sensor debuted in the early 1990s, so I was eager to try Gillette&#x27;s latest shaving</li>
            <li>Let me first say, I do enjoy the &#x27;Power Handle&#x27; and I no longer think it is a gimmick.  </li>
            <li>Generally, I use Schick xTreme 3 disposables, so that&#x27;s kind of my reference point for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compared to my normal DE razor, this pulls/tugs a lot more, and chews my neck</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like to shave more than once a week</li>
            <li>This razor works great in the shower or out and the blade life is about average.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my husband&#x27;s take: Even when he hasn&#x27;t shaved in a week, this razor blades gives a smooth cut the FIRST time through...</li>
            <li>This product is really good to use, it is sharp and smooth, without burn and irritation.</li>
            <li>This razor is very soft on the beard and very smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first use, I could not believe how smooth the razor shaved.</li>
            <li>so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors</li>
            <li>First off I want to say that I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free as part of a program that was run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While not something we generally think about, this handle has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a very stylish handle for a mens razor.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, it was so smooth that I stopped to check to see if the plastic cover was still over the blades.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle gives a smooth, consistent, and tug-free shave.</li>
            <li>The shaves after the first shave is what is important to me.  </li>
            <li>The unit is very modern looking too!</li>
            <li>Either way, I was very pleased to see that my tricky areas only required one pass of the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle was a bit more bulky than a \\&quot;normal razor\\&quot; but pretty comfortable and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>Overall I was very satisfied with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Clean, smooth shave, no nicks, no cuts and super fast.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this product and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the razor and the results that I received.</li>
            <li>Most razors tend to cut me or do not provide a close shave, however, this razor left me feeling smooth and cut free.  </li>
            <li>I was able to shave in the shower without losing my razor like I normally do.  </li>
            <li>I received a free shaving razor and carts from Gillette through a program they are running at this time and used it for the first time</li>
            <li>I enjoy this shaving handle and it actually seems to work better in vibrating to get a smooth shave, compared to the pro-glide trimmer kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Fusion was what an incredibly smooth shave it was.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to have mine given to me for free via a program run by Gillette, because I&#x27;m not quite sure I&#x27;d pay $10 for the handle and one cartridge, and then have to turn around and pay $32 (Amazon price) for a pack of 8 cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m more than happy with this razor and not planning to move back to any others for a while (at list till the next Gillette razor</li>
            <li>Cuts nice and close, much better than the other razors I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good razor for a long time.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money, even if you spend full price on it.  </li>
            <li>The large handle makes it easy to maneuver across the face.</li>
            <li>You can tell that alot of thought went into the power handle because of the features like the auto off function that activates after a certain time or the easy to install/change battery compartment.</li>
            <li>The large handle makes it easy to maneuver across the face.</li>
            <li>My first shave sold me, very smooth and very close.  </li>
            <li>Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette.</li>
            <li>It pulls through my stubble cleanly without catching and I usually only have to do one pass through.</li>
            <li>but the battery vibrations must do something that makes the process so much easier and faster and it leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Hands down, it is the smoothest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>The sound of the vibrations were a bit louder from the older versions but nothing close to the sound of any electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>I liked the old version, but the lubricating strip wore away after only 4 shaves and I experienced discomfort frequently while shaving.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this power handle is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>anyone requires is the original twin blade Sensor - loud, proud &amp; simple.</li>
            <li>The Power handle was really nifty and cool as well!</li>
            <li>was that I really didn&#x27;t get that much better of a good close shave than any other pivoting head razor that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power and I can say, without a doubt, that I&#x27;ve found my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I love the handle on the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor.</li>
            <li>But I decided to try it as I love new toys</li>
            <li>Since I love trying out new products I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It is new and better technology.</li>
            <li>and I make sure to pop a new one in once a month.</li>
            <li>The new flexible one is even better</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li>Every time they create a new version, they make it a bit better.</li>
            <li>Love the new design of this razor</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying using the new razor by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I like the new colors and that it has more of a futuristic look.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s brand new, and have used it, so for now, I&#x27;ll keep using both, and try and decide which is actually better.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a better shave with this new Power Fusion razor</li>
            <li>I can describe the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor in one word, FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Coupled with the new Gillette razors I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sturdy power razor handle that provides a sure handed shave.</li>
            <li>Love the design of the new handle.  </li>
            <li>but it has always done a good job, felt solid in my hand and worked exactly like you&#x27;d hope a razor handle to.  </li>
            <li>The handle is very lightweight and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>It is easy to think that a razor is a razor, but there really are differences.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my main shaver, but as a good back up / travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li>It gets the job done fast and easy</li>
            <li>I thought the razor worked overall pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The tenth shave was just as good as the first shave with the same razor.</li>
            <li>It made it extremely fast, easy, and painless shave.</li>
            <li>With the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I found it easy to use in the shower thanks to the size/shape/construction.  </li>
            <li>It is very ergonomic and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>The power option does give a much smoother shave, and the bulkier handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin which is prone to razor rash using most razors on the market.  </li>
            <li>Reading some other reviews here at amazon I have noticed something interesting, former Schick fans who have converted to Gillette saying the Proglide is better or superior and whatnot...</li>
            <li>Reading some other reviews here at amazon I have noticed something interesting, former Schick fans who have converted to Gillette saying the Proglide is better or superior and whatnot...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a quick, close shave that will leave your face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very surprised and pleased when I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle.</li>
            <li>Very nice, like getting a facial massage while you shave, the handle fits nicely in my hand and manuvers well, well made does not hav ethat plastic feel like alot of other handles.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold, gives a closer more comfortable shave, with absolutely no nicks or cuts, no matter how carelessly or quickly I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is rare that I make the upgrade to a new handle, without buying a good supply of blades, these should be packaged with more than a single blade.</li>
            <li>Thank you gillette for the oportunity to try this razor first!</li>
            <li>She loves it better then her old razors!</li>
            <li>After the first shave - I was sold!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Gilette!!</li>
            <li>trim first!</li>
            <li>I was excited the first time I used this razor because it shaves so close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The power does add something unique to the shaving experience, I can&#x27;t exactly describe it, but it just adds something to the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, the Fusion Proglide razor and handle are top of the line products!</li>
            <li>I am glad to replace my old razor with this!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more razor blades for this Power handle!</li>
            <li>Gillette&#x27;s new Fusion Power ProGlide is far superior to what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>It was still very effortless and a super smooth shave, but it wasn&#x27;t AS close as using the vibration.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first trimming around my beard because of the cartridge size, but it was exact and easy.  </li>
            <li>My facial hair grows kind of quick</li>
            <li>And the ProGlide blades provide a super smooth and very close shave.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily switch the way I was holding the handle several times while I was shaving.  </li>
            <li>Even when I was rushed and had to do a quick job, I was pleased with the results, whereas I might have tore my neck to pieces using my old razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades are really sharp and provide a nice clean, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Being in a professional atmosphere having a close shave is very important.</li>
            <li>I remember that I was surprised that the handle was very light, even with the battery installed.</li>
            <li>Since using it , my son says its the best razor he has ever got to sample..  from a very active 23 yr old.  </li>
            <li>Being frequently an electric shaver the buzzing in my hand felt natural and it was easy to hold and use, but honestly I think the vibration is just a marketing thing.</li>
            <li>When you first look at the handle and see that is bulky than the original ProGlide razor handle you laugh.</li>
            <li>Shaves pretty clean.</li>
            <li>The blades are smooth, cut easily through my coarse hair and leave me feeling baby smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the razor is excellent, I have very sensitive skin and this coupled with the Fusion Proglide Extra Sensitive Gel</li>
            <li>good, thanks, i will bus new one in future, hope it more cheaper than this time.</li>
            <li>handle is also really large and wouldn&#x27;t fit in my shower</li>
            <li>The 5 blade head, although rather large, gave an incredibly smooth  shave.  </li>
            <li>The little edge razor works great for squaring off the sideburns and beard.</li>
            <li>I have experienced little to no razor burn while using this product which cannot be said for all types of razors.  </li>
            <li>Great for medicine cabinets that have little room or bathroom counters that need all the retail space.  </li>
            <li>The handle could use a little tweaking, but overalla great</li>
            <li>It gives me a smooth clean shave without the irritation that normally happens.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a fine razor, but it&#x27;s a marketing (not engineering) upgrade with goals to charge you just a bit more per blade</li>
            <li>If the razor holds up fine for more than a year I may come back and up the rating</li>
            <li>This causes the razor handle to fit my hand more tightly which accomodates a much more controlled shave.</li>
            <li>Given the high prices of the replacement cartridges, this could prove to be the factor that deters me from becoming a convert.</li>
            <li>As is my typical experience with Gillette razors they work great for the first two or three shaves, then they degrade quickly.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little rubber pad near the head that is perfectly placed for your finger for added stability on the cheeks and</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it, because I have been a faithful Schick user for years, but always enjoy trying new products to compare.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend anyone interested in a improved power handle from Gillette pick this up right now!</li>
            <li>This is a super sharp and good razor.</li>
            <li>The Gillette ProGlide shaver is my new shaving system, the powered handle has a sure grip and the micro pulses seemed to lift the hair on my face to give me a fast clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for the free razor.</li>
            <li>I got this razor free from Gillette thanks to a program they were running.</li>
            <li>If any of this seems intriguing to you, though, you may want to try it out.</li>
            <li>The handle is truly amazing that in its larger size, it is lighter than any handle I have come in contact with.</li>
            <li>The rubber handle is comfortable, my grip doesn&#x27;t slip and the massaging lift and cut the gentle vibration of the handle</li>
            <li>This razor was provide free to me to try as a part of a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a power tool with a real sturdy feel.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>A great razor for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone who wants a close shave while feeling comfortable during the shave.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a comfortable and close shave, this product works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for the free razor.  </li>
            <li>I got a chance to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free  thanks to a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Very close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>So much for competition and the free market economy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The power version makes for a very irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li>The handle is still too light, too fat, and not balanced very well.</li>
            <li>The razor glides over my face with no catching, no scraping feeling, and no irritation, all while delivering an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li>After using this razor I exfoliated my legs with Perlier White Almond Sugar and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who wants a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a huge sum of money for it.</li>
            <li>Amazing product for facial shaving.</li>
            <li>recommend this razor for anyone who wants that baby&#x27;s but smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and the gel strip built into the blade really does help.</li>
            <li>But thanks to a program run by Gillette, I had a chance to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free.</li>
            <li>The micropulses are amazing, I don&#x27;t know how I ever shaved before using a standard razor.  </li>
            <li>I Received the razor blade and handle free via Gillette as a test and has done very well for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for different hair types, as well, I have blonde, light hair, but it work for dark/denser hair as well.  </li>
            <li>The handle is very well fit for your hand.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a close, smooth, painfree shave.</li>
            <li>The handle is very sleek and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Like a babies bottom, my face is as smooth without much effort and rigamarole.</li>
            <li>I made sure i used the same shaving cream to get an accurate comparison.  </li>
            <li>It was smooth and a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for giving me a chance to try out your product for free.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the experience while shaving, but it did the job very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a free program by Gillette</li>
            <li>About the cost for the cartridges I firmly believe that the longevity and great shave will outweigh the additional cost.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the folks at Gillette for providing a free razor to test.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette, I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor free in exchange for the testing and review.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the things that makes the overall product amazing.</li>
            <li>The vibration from the handle really did make for a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And if that is the only downfall I am happy to sacrifice that extra blade for a consistently smooth and non-irritated post-shave glow.  </li>
            <li>but the shave was very close, and smooth.</li>
            <li>If I had to ding the product it would be here, it was not as comfortable with the handle on when shaving the much longer hair.</li>
            <li>Well I received the opportunity to try the razor for free thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li>I got to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for providing a free power handle for me to review</li>
            <li>Thanks to a free sample from Gillette</li>
            <li>The razor provided a very close and comfortable shave</li>
            <li>But the increased strip did make for a much smoother and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All round a great shaving tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was this light touch that allowed a close shave without hacking at my face and really digging into it.  </li>
            <li>Both had fresh batteries for comparison&#x27;s sake.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in a program Gillette sponsored for the Fusion Proglide Power razor.</li>
            <li>so they were worth it.</li>
            <li>The blades also clean very well with a quick rinse.  </li>
            <li>the handle is a nice size, it&#x27;s solid</li>
            <li>far as the con&#x27;s, there aren&#x27;t many but</li>
            <li>however like that they kept the extra blade on top of the head for precise grooming efforts.</li>
            <li>Because of the price, I don&#x27;t think its worth it.</li>
            <li>Knowing the brand and what I have come to  expect from the products, I knew it was going to be a fun product to try.</li>
            <li>make it a far better shaving experience than the Mach 3 without any cuts or nicks.</li>
            <li>This handle is a success.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>This razor did a good job overall and did not cause too much discomfort.  </li>
            <li>So far, this has been my favorite razor that Gillette has come out with.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a really nice handle.</li>
            <li>I will buy more blades for the Gilette and leave my old schick blades for travel purposes.</li>
            <li>In fact I think it be one of those rare instances</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not 100% used to it, and even after multiple shaves now, I still feel kind of uneasy about bringing it to my face, but hey</li>
            <li>Plus, the heft of the handle really felt good in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powered handle and the vibration it supplied to the blade definitely felt soothing when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was surprised on how better it was.</li>
            <li>The price of this razor just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy Gillete products and look forward to trying more out in the future.</li>
            <li>The handle fit the hand well, and I was able to maneuver the blade well enough to get a close shave everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I do notice that there is a distinct difference in the amount of pulling that</li>
            <li>The grip is much better than the old Gillette Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li>I dont know if I would have went out and bought it, but I am having fun using it.</li>
            <li>I think it would be a fun gift idea.</li>
            <li>The second I got the ProGlide Power out of the packaging, I was thrilled to see that this wasn&#x27;t the</li>
            <li>/&gt;The extra heft and girth provided by the battery compartment gives the razor a nice balance.</li>
            <li>I had no idea that the power handle would make that big of an impact on how close the shave was and most of all how comfortable it was.</li>
            <li>I received this razor complimentary to try and review from a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>but this one is totally different because it comes with a nice gripe that does not hurt your hands.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money you will spend.</li>
            <li>Using this razor has left my skin smooth and rash free!  </li>
            <li>but I think it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is the thinner blades or what, but this is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>well worth</li>
            <li>It was worth a try.</li>
            <li>The handle has a better grip than the old one too.</li>
            <li>For people with sensitive skin like me, they&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>The powerful vibrations sent through it never even affected my hand or the way of which I shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s defiantly worth the price.  </li>
            <li>As far as the power feature, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>but I can see how men might find it useful.    </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $11 or so to switch from the fusion</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve not used the non-power version, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether the vibration is a gimmick or does something useful.</li>
            <li>I suppose there is a degree of subjectivity involved when you make a comparison with fresh blades.</li>
            <li>Naturally, with a battery, there&#x27;s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason, Gillette appears to have completely bought into the notion that five blades gives a better shave than just two or three.  </li>
            <li>I now use a simple old fashion safety razor which works great</li>
            <li>Rarely causes nicks, never ingrown.</li>
            <li>Even on stuff I think is worth a review</li>
            <li>Wow that stuff interesting...</li>
            <li>Still LOVING this shaver almost a year later.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying things off of Amazon for a long time now, and this is my first ever review because this thing is simply the best razor out there.</li>
            <li>I have tried fresh batteries to no avail.</li>
            <li>I especially love the fact that even after several days of not shaving, I can remove the hair one of my cheeks with just one careful swipe.</li>
            <li>Is the motor worth it?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had gillete manual fusion and pro-glide razors, I think this product is far better, and will recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>But if what happens to me happens to you, then it is worth every dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I come from a family of Gillette users and I have used virtually every kind of Gillette razor in the last 15 years however the day I ordered Proglide</li>
            <li>Which razor you use is really worth the money.</li>
            <li>Anyways, the razor works well and is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The vibration is a nice touch but by no means necessary.</li>
            <li>who rarely had time to shave..  </li>
            <li>It is well worth upgrading to this newest Gillette model.</li>
            <li>I found it to glide over my face and it left me feeling smooth and uncut!I did receive this product free to try, but would buy it again!</li>
            <li>The Pro Glide wins by a landslide.</li>
            <li>The Pro Glide wins by a landslide.</li>
            <li>but you may find the comfort of the shave is worth it</li>
            <li>I am finding that to be quite useful in working under the lip and for sideburns.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, it&#x27;s economically advantageous to go with the Merkur Model 180.</li>
            <li>On a rare occasion I even shaved it three times.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s an epiphany that I can&#x27;t keep quiet about.</li>
            <li>Gillette was kind enough to provide me with a Fusion ProGlide Power Handle and blades.</li>
            <li>The handle has a good grip, even when wet.</li>
            <li>My shave is much smoother and faster in the morning, and I am delighted to be back with Gilette!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>I love this one just as much as my old one and will continue to buy refills for it.</li>
            <li>The precision trimmer is a nice feature if you have some facial hair you want to keep.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s provides a good clean shave and does everything you&#x27;d want from a razor, it just isn&#x27;t a noticeable improvement over any of the previous versions.</li>
            <li>So, since it had power (like an electric shaver), I thought this might be a nice middle ground - and it</li>
            <li>With a slightly larger handle it has a nice feel in your hand.</li>
            <li>I would say and this gets nice and low for a shave that lasts about 2 days.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this razor from Gillette, and overall enjoyed the shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps with more trial I would notice a bigger difference, but I felt the difference in getting a smooth, close shave was in the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using store-brand generic six blade razors, and quite honestly, they don&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li>find the rear trimmer to be extremely useful as well.</li>
            <li>I like the smoothness of the shave, left me feeling refreshed with a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Worth the money...</li>
            <li>After using this razor for a while, it performed slightly better than my old razor.</li>
            <li>I must say, I never would have bought the razor myself, as I was not unhappy with my razor at the time</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I was very happy about the performance of the blades themselves, I am confused as to the purpose of the handle.</li>
            <li>gave the second one I ordered away to a friend who liked it.</li>
            <li>The actual shave is noticeably more comfortable than the Mach3, but I feel that the Mach 3 delivers a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating handle-gimmick or useful?</li>
            <li>But if thee handle continues to perform as well as it has, they will be well worth the added</li>
            <li>Also the blue power button is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>everyone is different and will experience this product in their own way.  </li>
            <li>my skin is just too sensitive for a shave, with these blades I&#x27;m able to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using disposables for a year I can definitely say that the Fusion ProGlide is far superior than the cheap throw away razors.</li>
            <li>It definitely provides a smoother, more comfortable shave over a non-power razor.</li>
            <li>the action was smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>illuminated power button was a nice touch but not necessary.</li>
            <li>can honestly say that I&#x27;m a Gillette user now - and actually look forward to shaving again!</li>
            <li>But after experiencing this and have the dollar shave club products to compare to, it really is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and suffer from the dreaded razor burn and bumps when a blade gets used for more than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this product only 4 stars through no fault of its own, but rather</li>
            <li>I initially received a free Gilette Fusion Proglide Power razor through a program Gillette was hosting, and I love it.</li>
            <li>but I felt it was worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li>What I also liked about the power handle is that it has a slightly larger grip to accomodate the battery.</li>
            <li>Much better grips than my old razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I start my shave holding it near the top of the handle, I find that over the course of the shave, I wind up holding the handle lower over time.</li>
            <li>in all, the Pros far outweigh the Cons, and this is easily my favorite razor that I&#x27;ve ever used....</li>
            <li>During the shave the vibrations would cause the razor to occasionally pull on some of the hairs, though this was still more comfortable than shaving this length with the Mach 3 series of blades.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it to be raised above or in line with the rest of the razor since when im shaving in the morning</li>
            <li>With that said, I do love the Razor overall and am thankful that the Gillette provided me a free one to try.</li>
            <li>And if like me you think the vibrating handle is worth the difference in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me the feature that is worth talking about is the Power.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised to say that I am glad</li>
            <li>I love the variations Gilette offers in their product.</li>
            <li>The handle has a better grip than my old non power razor.</li>
            <li>for the shave, i think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this razor and I will definitely be getting some replacement blades.</li>
            <li>i just want to share my experience based on my own personal opinion and facts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that I have no trouble with a \\&quot;fast\\&quot; shave completely against the grain with this razor -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s too straight, and not enough ridges on both sides to keep a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>notice that the vibration does anything useful.  </li>
            <li>The weight is good as well, not too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li>For a premium handle, its nice, but there definitely are nicer handles out there.  </li>
            <li>I always have a good handle on it even when its wet.</li>
            <li>As expected from Gillette Vary good over all quality.</li>
            <li>Overall, its a nice razor and worth trying for yourself.</li>
            <li>but it would totally be worth the price otherwise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this handle if you&#x27;re a Gillette user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received a free razor through a program from Gillette, but I was already a loyal user and already had a Proglide power handle for months before.</li>
            <li>As a light bearded guy who can easily get by only shaving twice a week (unless something special is going on), I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time, money and effort on shaving.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away that the handle was larger, making it more comfortable to shave.  </li>
            <li>I am an individual who HAS to shave every day for work, not because I like to, therefore I want to make sure that my shave is not only enjoyable, but fast and that it delivers a nice clean look without much</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this for face-shavers who can afford it (refills are fairly pricey but should last a month or more); but for head-shavers who don&#x27;t hold the razor the way face-shavers do, I don&#x27;t suggest laying down the money to try this handle.</li>
            <li>With the power on, the razor cut through my stubble with the greatest of ease - and left my face smooth - much smoother than I have gotten with other</li>
            <li>This is a great razor and the electric function is a bit odd at first</li>
            <li>But this razor is worth getting if the price is right.</li>
            <li>Normally I get razor burn easily but not with this product.</li>
            <li>it conforms to his  face when he slides the razor over  his skin its easy to use.. not confusing to how others operate..  </li>
            <li>The shave was definitely a more pleasant experience in that the power handle caused less pulling frequent with the mach 3.  </li>
            <li>and it was easy to hold onto in the shower where I normally shave.  </li>
            <li>The blade seemed about on par with most other top of the line blades, however when combined with the Power Handle, something happens...</li>
            <li>I love this razor and while I&#x27;m sure practically no one will read this, I wanted to add my 5-star rating to the other 5-star ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I do know is that the razor almost slides out of my hand when I hold it lower because there is no black rubbery grip on the top part of the lowest part of the handle.</li>
            <li>The pulsing razor pulls all my hair so smoothly and shaves my face so nice that I can&#x27;t see using any other razor</li>
            <li>Lays well in the hand, not too heavy or too light and with the matching cartridges it gives you a nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li>but you get used to pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bonus that it even comes with a battery.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a worthy and capable product, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>but you get used to pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>As with any razor hair tends to get stuck between the blades but a quick rinse off cleans them pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They vibrate to shake the hairs from their rested position, and, as I&#x27;m the only one who can grow a full beard in my family, getting the closest shave is very important.  </li>
            <li>I love this new handle that features a  bigger, more ergonomic side grips, that allows me to get a good grip, even when wet.</li>
            <li>I am going to assume it works better than the 1-4 blade razors as there&#x27;s no other reason they would add the coveted 5th blade!  </li>
            <li>One neat part of this razor is the ability to clean up sideburns by pushing the top head back that has the gel coating.  </li>
            <li>The button quickly and easily turns on the vibration action of the handle.</li>
            <li>Other blades, even my beloved Fusion, would pull on my face when I shaved.  </li>
            <li>grip on the handle of this ProGlide is superior to other Gillette razors I must add.</li>
            <li>The ergonomic side grips helped and provided good grip even when the handle got wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other aspect of the razor that Gillette promotes is the battery powered micropulses activated by pushing a button on the razor.  </li>
            <li>I really believed that there wouldn&#x27;t be any significant difference in the shave quality or the experience.</li>
            <li>The groves on the hanfle seem to be in all the right places.</li>
            <li>Gillette you got this one done right.</li>
            <li>After turning this razor on you could tell a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>But then again, not everyone&#x27;s made of money right?</li>
            <li>But also, it takes finding the right one to suit all of your needs.</li>
            <li>I should say right up front</li>
            <li>and I went and tested my theory to see if I was imagining it all--and nope, I was right on the money.</li>
            <li>Warms your face right up.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>These were the right price for a razor.</li>
            <li>it slid right through them.</li>
            <li>it is just right and does give the sense of having an electric shaver in your hand.</li>
            <li>It has the right amount of weight</li>
            <li>Right out of the package</li>
            <li>I do have a beard right now</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>it was off in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I would say that this fits right in.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>While shaving using the vibration setting - the razor puts out the right about of vibration to give you the close shave without feeling that your hand is going numb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was very little irritation after I shaved, and for the most part, I was nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was really smooth and I would recommend it because it made a believer out of me, and I don&#x27;t like to try anything new!</li>
            <li>Plus the blue power light is very cool.</li>
            <li>The GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE is also very comfortable and easy to hold with its non-slip ergonomic grip even when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li>I have pretty much had every razor style available.</li>
            <li>Weather using gel, foam or even a sugar-based shaving scrub, the Fusion ProGlide just glides across my face and consistently gives me a very close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides a much closer, faster, consistent, and comfortable shave with no ingrown hairs whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time Gillette user, and i received this for free from gillette a trial program, and i must say that this razor is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is also really great and no issues with getting it wet, I use this for daily shaves in the shower and it is still running strong after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I also discovered quite by accident, that Consumer Reports did their own independant testing and came up with the EXACT SAME results.</li>
            <li>It had a good grip and was not difficult to handle after it got wet.</li>
            <li>noteworthy information was that the blades performed very well in the shave itself, providing a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, the razor is nice, but with the price point being higher than the Mach 3 Power, I don&#x27;t have any reason to switch.</li>
            <li>The handle is sturdy with a decent amount of weight to help with the shaving process, and not feel like a cheap thing that will crumble in your hand.</li>
            <li>The blades cleaned out very easy just by runnung under water, tapping of the razor on the inside of the sink was no necessary.</li>
            <li>I always shave in the shower and the larger handle makes it very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>The battery compartment is also very easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li>While the handle is a nice size that fits comfortable in your hands while working up and down when shaving.</li>
            <li>While shaving, I made sure no other members of the household could see which side of my face was shaved with the Gillette and which side was shaved with the Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesnt pull at all, even when shaving against the grain and does not matter if you shave daily or have several days of growth, either way, the razor is quality and does not pull and tug at the hair, which is very nice and very important when you have sensitive skin like I do.  </li>
            <li>it just slides across my face like a VERY sharp razor should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close and comfortable - I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>To my amazement, it really does feel like an electric razor and was not tugging on the long hairs at all...and gave a nice, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how many shaves it&#x27;s good for but a AAA Duracel is holding steady.</li>
            <li>( much like new grips on a golf club make for a better swing)  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I liked the new handle.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating action felt nice, like little hedge trimmers effectively getting everything.  </li>
            <li>I have shaved with it several times and i must say that it is quite comfortable and easily manuverable.</li>
            <li>far as performance, this razor makes my legs super smooth.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll probably just stick to my safety razor, since it offers a super cheap shave.</li>
            <li>My son likes this razor better than ones he&#x27;s previously used and I like it because he shaves more often.  </li>
            <li>Most people wont be able to notice a difference between this and any of the previous incarnations of the Proglide line.</li>
            <li>The low battery light easily tells you when you will need to replace the battery.</li>
            <li>I was able to get super close shave without having to keep going over the same spot.</li>
            <li>Battery life lasts for quite a while and blades are super durable lasting longer than most others.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor through a program offered from Gillette and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The handle was nice and comfortable and help the blades move smoothly over without having to grip too hard for precision.  </li>
            <li>Regarding the shave - honestly both Gillette Fusion Razors, Power and Regular, provide great shave and it is hard to see the difference.  </li>
            <li>think this is a great buy, especially for those that have sensitive skin and get razor burn easily like I generally do.</li>
            <li>but since this isn&#x27;t new then maybe you&#x27;re fine with it.    </li>
            <li>When I got it out of the package, provided to me free by Gillette, I thought it would be just another normal shave.</li>
            <li>Gillette is know for great products in the past.</li>
            <li>price of Gillette&#x27;s ProGlide Power is a bit higher ($9.99 on Amazon) but it could be worth it.</li>
            <li>For instructions and more information on the old art of traditional shaving, you can also check out The Art of Manliness blog ([...]), which is an enjoyable website for the cultivated man&#x27;s lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>A small price to pay for a great shave.</li>
            <li>So my first try of the Gillete ProGlide was on ~3 days worth of beard.  </li>
            <li>It cleans amazingly and the blade lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It tickles at first, but is a fun novelty.  </li>
            <li>The battery gives a micro pulse that allows for the razor to cut with barely any sensation that the blades are touching the skin.</li>
            <li>The blade cartridges loaded and unloaded with ease, and the battery powered handle provided a smoother than normal shave that was nick, cut, and razor burn free; compared to a non-battery powered shaver handle.</li>
            <li>the interest of my overall shave, I&#x27;d prefer that companies like Gillette focus on practical innovations like making blades that last longer instead of trying to distract me with a bright light and a buzzing razor.</li>
            <li>had to laugh when I took the first stroke.</li>
            <li>I have a heavier than average beard and while this razor gives a good, close shave, there is no reason to go buy it if you are already using the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much good the vibrating function does for a smoother shave or whether it&#x27;s just a gimmick, but it was a unique sensation when shaving.</li>
            <li>Featuring bigger, more ergonomic side grips, allowing you to get a good grip, even when wet.</li>
            <li>felt kind of strange using it, and would probably use it again without the vibration.</li>
            <li>The blade and shave itself were very impressive, however the second and third shaves with the blade (and a few days growth) didnt seem to be as good as my normal razor.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor and have used no other razor (except to try one or two new ones that I got for free).</li>
            <li>Then you have the edger on the back, which is perfect for some of those tight spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that the micropulses lead to a better shaving experience but the handle is easy to grip &amp; comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Turn the battery on and the handle vibrates a little, but the rubber gripping absorbs most of it</li>
            <li>I found that this Razor is able to handle my thick full facial hair with great ease.  </li>
            <li>This razor also has a single blade for trimming which is good over all but tends to clog up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>While I like the fact that it&#x27;s thinner and more easily-handled than most of the other powered handles I&#x27;ve used before, I guess I just really don&#x27;t like the vibration aspect.</li>
            <li>The holder even has a new look and it seems all these add up to a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li>the new pro glide doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes claims of important improvements on what I would have thought was unimprovable--after all it is just a razor with a new generation (it claims) of blades.    </li>
            <li>I used that new thermal scrub too (comes free with 4 pack blades).  </li>
            <li>The new Proglide is smooth and did the job without punishing my face.</li>
            <li>I was offered the oppurtunity to try this new one for free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>Gillette had a free promotion offer to try out their new profusion power glide razors.</li>
            <li>I have wanted to try out Gillette new product and this free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I received the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor free through a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>It sound to me like overkill because being a creature of habit, and not wanting to try anything new.  </li>
            <li>I just used my new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor that I received from a free promotion by Gillette.</li>
            <li>Admittedly,the shave I got was close and comfortable when this handle was coupled with Gillette&#x27;s new cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>Through a free program with Gillette, I tested out their new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power side by side with the non-Power version.  </li>
            <li>and it had a light to let you know when it needs a new battery.</li>
            <li>At first it felt like it was going to slice right into my face</li>
            <li>Proctor &amp; Gamble stockholders and doing pretty well right now - maybe you should buy their stocks instead of the blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery last forever and the bottom line is that the razor provides a great shave for a low cost.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice the improved grip, although I guess that is a good thing since I didn&#x27;t have any problems holding it, even when wet.</li>
            <li>the five-blade design really does yield a better shave than an old single-blade shaver -</li>
            <li>The vibrations were so much easier on my facial hair and the handle has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with how easy it was to use and how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>I have used this razor now about a half dozen times and have loved the feel.</li>
            <li>The vibration it gives is just tremendous and shaves very close.</li>
            <li>The shave with the Gillette Fusion Proglide  is superior to the previous model, THe Gilette Fusion.</li>
            <li>And relative to my older manual 5 blade the handle on this Proglide is much more rounded and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It was smooth, comfortable, and left a swath of stubble-free skin that didn&#x27;t need an additional shaving.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak to whether there&#x27;s a good enough reason to switch from another razor, but if you&#x27;re like me and looking to go \\&quot;old</li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised that P&amp;G Rep actually ready my comments here and wanted to know more.</li>
            <li>razors seem to be getting more and more gimmicky lately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to add nothing to the shave and it completely eliminates any tactile feedback, which I find necessary for a good shave.</li>
            <li>The shave is super smooth and 100 times better than my previous razor.</li>
            <li>But not so much better to make it worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and shave my neck and with this razor it made it so much easier to shave my neck with the bigger grips on the handle</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor left my skin feeling comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li>good quality, just don&#x27;t like black colour.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a well designed handle with soft grip sections that make for easy maneuvering.  </li>
            <li>manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is great, I love the design and weight, but it&#x27;s not perfect.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, the texture of the handle allows for a comfortable shave, and facilitates a better grip even when wet.</li>
            <li>As i said with my review of the blades this razor is probably perfect for an everyday shave type person but for someone who lets their facial hair go for a week it just doesnt do the trick.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and handle for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I was incredibly surprised with how balanced the handle was in my hand, and how easy it was to grip and slide the blades over my face.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a 5 blad razor and it shaves really smooth, so I was excited to try this new one, as I shave a beard and my head.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using razors for 25 years now, and I&#x27;ve tried a pretty good range of razors, from fancy razors down to the cheapo $1 razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I received the razor complimentary, I was under no obligation to provide a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than the single blade side clogging its a fantanstic razor and look pretty awesome too!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to people who get razor burn but miss that clean close shave.</li>
            <li>I got this razor and blades through a free program from Gillette and I am completely hooked!</li>
            <li>while the hype is still pretty big, I was surprised at how genuinely good this razor ended up</li>
            <li>There didn&#x27;t seem to be a natural contour to it so that I could get it to fit right between my fingers.</li>
            <li>The price is ok, especially since I was able to try it for free through a special promotion through Gillette, but the refills are a little pricey.</li>
            <li>Compared to previous razors I&#x27;ve used it saves closer and more uniform, it&#x27;s great for people with facial hair because of the trimmer blade on the back, and it&#x27;s easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>vibrating handle which helps cut down on irritation has a power on light that blinks when you are running low on power which is great</li>
            <li>Not only during shaving is it the most comfortable shaver that does not pull your hair, it also creates such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Not only during shaving is it the most comfortable shaver that does not pull your hair, it also creates such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This very gentle gliding across the skin allowed for faster, smoother strokes, like there was no resistance.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a very comfortable razor to use.</li>
            <li>The vibrating razor flows very smoothly across your skin and although it may not feel as though you are shaving, the results are definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>It has very modern and sleek design.  </li>
            <li>I just applied a little bit of soap to the areas that I needed to shave, and that was all I needed to get a nice clean</li>
            <li>The new precise trimmer cuts better, overall a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>The idea of a blue light on the handle is a unique feature that reminds me to turn the shaving system off when  cleaned and finished.</li>
            <li>Precise and sharp, you cannot find anything better around.</li>
            <li>so it was important for me to make sure the blades are always sharp</li>
            <li>I am a lifelong user of Gillette razors so was excited when I was given the opportunity to test out the latest one.  </li>
            <li>I recently received a free power razor through a program run by Gillette and was excited to try it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to try this product via a program from Gillette and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal and satisfied user of their Mach 3 model for a while now, and I was curious to see if it was worth it to upgrade to something like this.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out, I will say that the quality of the blade is up to par with Gillette&#x27;s standards.</li>
            <li>The handle is light, comfortable to hold, easy to control and that battery sets up a little vibrating action that keeps the blades moving smoothly and effortlessly across the skin.</li>
            <li>The Trimmer is very nice for a lot of the harder to shave areas the full razor can not get properly.</li>
            <li>Overall - another great product from Gillette, better than other brands, bigger size is a step up and vibrations make it easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>The main improvement is that blade now tilts back much more sharply, allowing you to shave at many more angles.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer provides a good shave with an easy to snap on razor blade that will not pop-off like other shaving blades due to an advanced locking mechanism.</li>
            <li>The razor head is easy to snap on and snap off , so all you really have to do is buy new razor heads.</li>
            <li>If it is not the right size or weight it is not easily maneuvered and the shave is not as good as it could be.</li>
            <li>However, that little fact has nothing to do with just how well this razor works and the good things I have to say about</li>
            <li>The powerhandle has a good grip but is a little noisy when you turn it on.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the new razor, I never used a \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor.</li>
            <li>So when I was approached by them to try their new product, I was really excited.</li>
            <li>I have used the pro glide for years and was was excited about a new product.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try my new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived in the mail I was excited to try this new combo blade razor/electric razor.  </li>
            <li>However, when you turned the power on, there seemed to be much less \\&quot;pull\\&quot; - it seemed to move through the whiskers more easily.  </li>
            <li>I was given this product to try and I usually use disposables but when I used Gillette Fusion ProGlide I was very satisfied by the close clean feeling</li>
            <li>its slim and easy to maneuver around the contours of my face and makes for a quick and simple shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades have very good durability considering how thin they are.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a firm comfortable grip on the razor and the vibrating function makes it very easy to glide over your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>did find that the razor was very easy to clean with less hair being clogged between the blades.</li>
            <li>Let me start out by saying that if you&#x27;re absolutely settled on a cartridge razor system, this or the regular Fusion Proglide will probably fit the bill just fine.</li>
            <li>While cool looking and effective at trimming up edges, The bulky, vibrating, light-up handle seems extraneous, and I&#x27;m mainly scared to get it too wet.</li>
            <li>handle &amp; shave performance did not stand out as special during my side-by-side comparison with my normal Fusion.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing like the first clean shave of a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li>Overall shave result was smooth, non-irritated soft skin with a very pleasant surprise, no bumps or pain after a few days.</li>
            <li>I never felt like the Fusion was a huge step up from the old Mach 3 Power.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised the vibration made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Very well designed!</li>
            <li>When I first saw the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I have to admit I thought it was just a marketing gimmick that would be used to up</li>
            <li>The first is the riveted handle itself.</li>
            <li>The Fusion ProGlide Power handle was bigger in size and circumference, a tad lighter and had more tacky rubber to the handle than the Mach 3 Power handle.  </li>
            <li>The weight and ease of use was evident from the moment I picked it up.  </li>
            <li>First, the battery-operated razor makes for an easier, cleaner shave.  </li>
            <li>It not only costs more and makes the razor heavier, but it also downgrades the performance.  </li>
            <li>So this is my first blade razor that vibrates.</li>
            <li>and my fiance loves that i shave more regularly now!!</li>
            <li>I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette and so far, i have used it for about 6 or 7 shaves.</li>
            <li>The heft of the handle is comparable to handles of higher quality (and price).</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the design of the handle.  </li>
            <li>After the first couple of shaves, I get use to the vibration the have not had any issues with loosing my grip.  </li>
            <li>Just got this razor free as part of a Gillette program and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>But this is the first razor that I felt</li>
            <li>At first I did not notice a closer shave, but now after about 1 week of consistent use I have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>only thing that I still don&#x27;t understand is about the use of the battery or vibrations for a better shave....</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it outperformed the Gillette Mach3 Turbo razor that I&#x27;ve been using for the better part of ten years.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the vibrating was a gimmick.</li>
            <li>the handle for the Fusion Proglide is larger, more ergonomic and heavier; 2) the handle for the Fusion is powered (by a AAA battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all I will start off by</li>
            <li>With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving.</li>
            <li>I hanve never been able to use regular electric razors somI</li>
            <li>and i still get as close of a shave now as i did the first time....</li>
            <li>My skin has never been able to tolerate an electric razor, but the \\&quot;power\\&quot; series is different.</li>
            <li>I was interested in this razor because of the fact it viberates</li>
            <li>Upon the first use of the ProGlide Power, I immediately noticed a smoother cut and easier shave.</li>
            <li>The blue light was also rather cool addition to the handle.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried the Fusion Proglide.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette regular Fusion razor for many years.</li>
            <li>I have to first shave with an electric trimmer and then follow up with the Fusion</li>
            <li>favorite part of the entire razor was the handle.  </li>
            <li>As a man that shaves his head I was, at first, nervous about using a vibrating razor on my head.</li>
            <li>Also, what I liked about this razor is I can wet my face with water and still get a close shave without the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I recommend Gillette products as my first option to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The handle has an on-board micro chip that is suppose to provide consistent power, shave after shave.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s certainly not uncomfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>It definitely seems like more a novelty than anything, and some people like that.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the razor is the same as my normal razor.</li>
            <li>takes 1 battery and got my shave MUCH MUCH Closer!</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I have ever tried for difficult grain areas, like under the neck.</li>
            <li>The handle is attractive, well made, and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Well the ProGlide Power handle is clearly designed to provide the user with a comfortable, non-slip grip because I never once found myself reaching for a dropped razor while showering.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see Gillette is making strides to keep men shaving regularly.</li>
            <li>OK so this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power shaving system not only has a five-blade cartridge it has a handle that uses a battery...</li>
            <li>The only thing about this blade is when I was shaving it gave me a couple offcuts but that was nothing because most blades give people cuts while shaving anyways.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>I was interested in if the power made any difference</li>
            <li>I otherwise would miss the first time around.  </li>
            <li>From the first shave, it has been consistent.</li>
            <li>It is the only way I have been able to shave every day and eliminate razor burn.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how smooth this razor is.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>The blades last longer than most razors I have had as well.</li>
            <li>Much more than just my standard Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>It works pretty darned well, so I won&#x27;t be too skeptical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who is looking on getting a handle on a better shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, I find the fusion power proglide to be one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>despite what I&#x27;ve seen in some reviews, I actually do get a better, closer shave with the powered fusion over non-powered razors.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>Dont buy the manual one (my very personal opinion, you can if you want :-) )  </li>
            <li>(i have not tried it though ;-)).    </li>
            <li>I bought this razor because I was looking for something different that could make my experience better.</li>
            <li>exactly how</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy the Proglide Power razor based on several outstanding reviews here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, you buy several shaving soaps and soap dishes, for variety if you like, which are better for your skin than mass-market aerosol shaving gels.</li>
            <li>It is obviously marketed towards males, but I like the quality of the mens razors better than womens.</li>
            <li>pretty fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing I tried with this razor was a side-by-side comparision with my Mach 3 razor.  </li>
            <li>The most obvious problem it has is cost (just like the Fusion Power).  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve discovered this five bladed razor tends to nick my face more often than a double or triple bladed razor.  </li>
            <li>My first razor was a Mach 3 Turbo</li>
            <li>WHEN I FIRST SHAVED WITH IT</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to redo an area too many times, so you sense by feel where the patch is that needs extra attention.  </li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t believe a friend of mine when he gave me this tip.  </li>
            <li>First stroke drew blood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s FAR more comfortable than the regular Fusion Power.  </li>
            <li>With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving --</li>
            <li>But for most guys, it simply doesn&#x27;t deliver the closeness the \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough when I got out, I did not miss a spot.</li>
            <li>First of all, the pricing of the product is around $10.00, on Amazon and in stores.</li>
            <li>From the first stroke of the blade, I could feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the improvements!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.    </li>
            <li>cents\\&quot; worth, as shaving is very subjective and</li>
            <li>Anyway, this razor is really nice with a flashy colorful handle and nice grip.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for this one compared to the regular Fusion</li>
            <li>and this was the first time I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>I turned on the motor for the left side and it was even better.</li>
            <li>First, the closeness and ease of the shave are noticeably improved over the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>I bought it, and just tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I had seen a dermatologist many years ago to ask him why my neck always seems to break out in red bumps.  </li>
            <li>He pulled a couple of my whiskers to show me the exact reason.  </li>
            <li>I have used Schick Quattro the standard non battery one and its ok but for my head I use the Gillette Fusion power.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a \\&quot;powered\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette since my first razor--which, incidentally, was my first razor--and they have treated me well over the years.  </li>
            <li>Recently my wife tried a Schick Quattro razor, fell in love with it, and suggested that I try a multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li>I must say that from the first shave that I am hooked.  </li>
            <li>I only use Proglide razors and that is because my face and wanna be mustache and beard love it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s minimal pull on the skin, and I wound up with a nice close shave without any nicks or irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li>It doesnt wear out fast and you can buy replacement heads for them!</li>
            <li>I might have a defective one but thought I should enter a one star for others to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>I have been using mostly Gillette shavers for several years.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor really helps with this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m female and use men&#x27;s razors because they work better.  </li>
            <li>I find that this allows a much better shave than before, especially around the nose.  </li>
            <li>The shave did not feel anywhere near as comfortable as it felt using the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li>While shaving, you will realize that is EXACTLY what it does.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I still have more use of the same razor.</li>
            <li>The shave did not feel anywhere near as comfortable as it felt using the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li>While shaving, you will realize that is EXACTLY what it does.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I still have more use of the same razor.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t test it first and got the bulk set from Costco.     </li>
            <li>At first I thought that OK maybe its was this specific blade I was using</li>
            <li>It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever.</li>
            <li>Fusion Proglide    Hydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>country.&lt;br /&gt;Today is the first time since I took birth that my shave did not give me any cuts, neither did I feel any irritation.</li>
            <li>I was fine with my old regular Fusion, but this you cannot even feel the hairs being cut, and gets my face super smooth.</li>
            <li>During my first run with this I saw that it was able to glide and shave all my facial hair.</li>
            <li>I am coming from using the Mach 3 for many years, but when I forgot it while on a trip I decided to try something different.</li>
            <li>I’ve used many brands of razors over the last 30 years.  </li>
            <li>When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating head isn&#x27;t just a gadget, it actually does assist in  producing a better shave.</li>
            <li>First off, yes I am a woman.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how smooth it was and for some reason I dont have to shave nearly as often as I did with Quattro.</li>
            <li>and I remember the first time I used the Gillette Proglide on my head</li>
            <li>The product that I found to give me the closest smooth head with the Power Proglide is the Nivea Shave Gel for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>After realizing I couldn&#x27;t justify $200 a year on cartridges, I was absolutely sure there had to be a cheaper way to shave that didn&#x27;t involve an electric razor which doesn&#x27;t get close enough.</li>
            <li>I have used power handles from gillette in the past, but the redesign makes me more confident while shaving in the tub or shower.  </li>
            <li>My shaves are now smoother, faster, and just overall more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first glance</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice rubber grip so there is no chance of slipping while shaving.</li>
            <li>if you haven&#x27;t tried it, i recommend you do very soon!</li>
            <li>At first I thought that the vibrating handle was just a gimmick, if it is</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was pleased with how it made the shave go due to the changes and improvements they have made to their original handle.</li>
            <li>I really gave it a workout!</li>
            <li>Buzzing provided by the shaver massages the skin (get your mind out of the gutter ;)  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good experience and worth a solid try.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more blades once these are done.</li>
            <li>first I thought the vibrations were going to be a gimmick, but gimmick or not, my shave was closer.</li>
            <li>I thought the whole \\&quot;power handle\\&quot; thing was silly, but I saw Gillette would let me try one free (and who doesn&#x27;t love free, razors ain&#x27;t cheap!)</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly what I need,</li>
            <li>tried it first with the power on the razor seemed to pull.</li>
            <li>Gillette gave me a free sample of this razor and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>The thinner, finer blades give a close shave, so much better than my last razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However most of the time I only shave every 2-3 days</li>
            <li>Pretty darn well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many razors over the years, but I keep going back to my Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is the micro comb, the thinner blades or the suspension system, but it really delivered a great shave.</li>
            <li>shaving needs might be a bit different from most guys in that</li>
            <li>First I have to say that I received this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>My first impression was &#x27;I wonder why this thing takes batteries&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>The product was also able to handle a 1 week shave with the same level of effortlessness.</li>
            <li>I have never tried a power razor before but the shave with this razor was the first time in my life that I felt no skin irritation or nicks at all.</li>
            <li>After receiving the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle via a program run by Gillette, I was surprised how perfectly it fit in my hand,</li>
            <li>I also love the blue on button that glows when the vibration feature is on.</li>
            <li>The bigger, more ergonomic side grips made my shower shaving experience a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the Proglide Power Razor, it was like a hot knife trough butter.  </li>
            <li>I do plan on continuing the use the Gillette Fusion Powerglide Razor, even after the first cartridge is done.</li>
            <li>Not entirely uncomfortable, but still made me cringe.</li>
            <li>Overall I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it indicates when the battery is low.</li>
            <li>First The blades dont clog up with hair after shaving.</li>
            <li>This was the first Razor I have ever used that did not nick or cut me in one of the first two or three uses.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit more pricey but in the long run I see it will be well worth my money.</li>
            <li>I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power from a program from Gillette and decided to put away my old razor and give it a shot.</li>
            <li>When I first saw the Proglide Power Handle come on the market, I dismissed it.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a power razor</li>
            <li>First off, I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor thru a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I got the Powerhandle with a coupon when my electric razor died and I have to say that I really like the shave that it gives!</li>
            <li>When I tried this handle for the first time I knew this was it for me.</li>
            <li>The first thing you will notice is the handle.  </li>
            <li>After the first shave, all those doubts went out the window.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with it, especially since it was free!</li>
            <li>10 years ago, I received one of the first Gillette Fusion razors for my 18th birthday.  </li>
            <li>10 years later, I participated in a program run by Gillette that gave me the opportunity to try out the latest version of this razor.  </li>
            <li>At that point, I almost wouldn&#x27;t consider shaving with the Mach 3 without first trimming.  </li>
            <li>short, the handle vibrations take a bit to get used to, but the shave is extremely comfortable and close!  </li>
            <li>I liked the grippy handle and found that it didn&#x27;t slip, even when wet.</li>
            <li>The rubber grip has a nice feel and helps keep the razor in your hand when its wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years, and most recently the Fusion ProGlide, but the Power part really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found my last razor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>which is really what anyone cares about!  </li>
            <li>Firstly i thought how the battery will work in a razor,</li>
            <li>but that was taking care of by shaving after a got shower or using a damp hot cloth on my face before shaving.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the larger size helps me grip the handle better and provides a better grip, especially on days I shave while in the shower.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I have used a razor handle that vibrates.</li>
            <li>I was suspicious about this product at first.  </li>
            <li>Really the closest shave I have ever had!</li>
            <li>If you have the opportunity to get the power handle (or better yet, try your friend&#x27;s, if he&#x27;ll let you), I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion Proglide is a pretty proficient razor.  </li>
            <li>It was definitely doesn&#x27;t do any better of a job</li>
            <li>and I must say I was pleased overall with the razor.  </li>
            <li>When I actually began the process of shaving I found that the handle fit securely in my hand throughout the whole shave and my grip did not falter once.</li>
            <li>and I believe that is do to the handle being thicker and giving me better control than the razors on the market with the standard size handles.</li>
            <li>and this seems to do the job pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Upon first turning on the razor</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a reasonable product, I&#x27;d recommend this!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change in this aspect is to provide a better grip in the thumb area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, and don&#x27;t need to trim around sideburns or a goatee, you could do OK with this razor.</li>
            <li>The pulses seemed to work pretty well</li>
            <li>This is the first razor blade I have used that didn&#x27;t irritate my neck.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This razor gives you a nice shave with minimal razor burn, if any.</li>
            <li>Very well designed!</li>
            <li>The power option on the handle provides for better precision and allows me to shave faster, as it removes hair faster than a regular razor.</li>
            <li>If I shave frequently, I am more likely to have irritations occurring.</li>
            <li>When I first heard of a vibrating handle for a razor, I snickered to myself.  </li>
            <li>Also, the constant vibration, or \\&quot;power\\&quot;, only makes the awkwardness of the handle design more noticable and makes it even more</li>
            <li>I had to double check the shaved area to make sure the razors did its job.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I have ever used a battery powered razor.</li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t to hot though.</li>
            <li>When i used first time Gillette Fusion Power Proglide Handle  No difference,</li>
            <li>However, I have never had a problem with turning it on or off on the first attempt.</li>
            <li>When I first got my razor</li>
            <li>This is personal prefernce, but I don&#x27;t love the tingly feeling of the handle in my hand.  </li>
            <li>(and this is my first power</li>
            <li>I was first intrigued by the power handle and wanted to see what difference that would make.  </li>
            <li>If one thing is consistent, it&#x27;s that Shaving Technology continues to advance.  </li>
            <li>By the end of the work week, my face can get pretty irritated.  </li>
            <li>Regular handle has rubber part all the way to the top, and Power handle does not.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion the rubber piece on top side should be bigger.  </li>
            <li>Regular Handle provides better grip, but Power Handle is easier to hold.  </li>
            <li>If you have big hands - you should like Power Handle more.  </li>
            <li>It also seems that power handle has slightly better angle than regular one.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like more of a gimmick than something that would actually help the quality of my shave.</li>
            <li>I was scared to try my first shave, but after the first stroke I had to continue.</li>
            <li>I obtained a free razor via a program run by Gillette and was surprised by its size.</li>
            <li>Which leads us to my first point: The blades for the Fusion ProGlide are around 4 bucks each.</li>
            <li>The five bladed Fusion gave me a closer shave on top of the 3 bladed shaver I had been married to for the last 12 years.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that the power button on the updated razor is flush with the handle, making it a bit harder to turn on accidentally.</li>
            <li>I was also pleased with how simple it is to instal the battery and turn it on.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for providing the razor for me to review!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I wish it was compatible with the Mach3 heads as I personally feel that the Mach3&#x27;s are better than the fusion&#x27;s even without the vibrating feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many shaves the strip should last</li>
            <li>After only 2 shaves with this one, I found my irritation clearing up even more.</li>
            <li>This is the first handle I have owned that requires a battery.</li>
            <li>FIRST IMPRESSION -</li>
            <li>The same rubber that outlines the word \\&quot;PROGLIDE\\&quot; on the razor&#x27;s underside should also outline the word \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot; on its top side.</li>
            <li>I recently received the latest Gilette Fusion Proglide Power for free through a program with Gillette and was pleasantly surprised with the quality after being a longtime user of the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the vibrating was a gimmick.</li>
            <li>Definitely was better when used in the \\&quot;off\\&quot; position.  </li>
            <li>The only down-side I found was that the power button was not located in the most intuitive place.</li>
            <li>the top shelf 5 blade razors perform the same over time, so let me focus on the power</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product before I bought it, I will definitely be switching though.</li>
            <li>So this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a 4 blade</li>
            <li>I have ordered several more razors already.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor!!</li>
            <li>At first I thought that adding a battery powered handle was just some gimmick, suffice to say it did make a difference in the how the shave felt.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time this week</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vibration was a bit distracting at first, but after getting used to it</li>
            <li>So for me it really was worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first time I have ever used a battery powered handled razor blade.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; in this razor was just a gimmick.</li>
            <li>The power part causes the razor to vibrate and by doing so, allows the razor to cut hairs better than a regular manual razor would.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that this handle is larger than many others</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not 100% sure that the vibrating handle actually did anything</li>
            <li>Prior to this razor, I was using the Gilette Mach 3 turbo which gave me an ok shave.</li>
            <li>The handle was also much easier to control and handle!</li>
            <li>I am a believer and the way it helps lift the hairs up and makes a really close shave!</li>
            <li>The first shave was the closest shave</li>
            <li>I do not think my shave was any better than with my regular razor.</li>
            <li>The power part causes the razor to vibrate and by doing so, allows the razor to cut hair better than a regular manual razor.</li>
            <li>When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>I was interested in if the power made any difference</li>
            <li>Here is the funny part.</li>
            <li>it has a better gip than the standard Fusion Power.  </li>
            <li>only reasoning for the razor not being a 5/5 was that the top of the razor head where the lubricating strip is located was just a bit too large for me to be able to get the upper lip right under my nose area.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>I give 4 stars because it is an excellent razor but too expensive.  </li>
            <li>The handle is larger than most razors.</li>
            <li>It has a nice rubber textured grip and I didn&#x27;t find it slipping in or out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>At first it took some time to get used to the thing buzzing.</li>
            <li>When I first looked at the razor handle</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I have ever tried for difficult grain areas, like under the neck.</li>
            <li>I first received my razor</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for many years, I used to buy Schick razors for test and possible replacement option once in a while.</li>
            <li>Overall better build quality.</li>
            <li>had my doubts at first.</li>
            <li>The grips gave me a good mechanism for firm grip.  </li>
            <li>The razor felt good in my hand and wasn&#x27;t too heavy or too lightweight.</li>
            <li>This razor is okay, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype, and, most certainly, not the price.   </li>
            <li>The handle itself is broad and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>I am able to shave every OTHER DAY, and I work in an industry that prefers men to be clean</li>
            <li>I am a loyal consumer of Gilette products, and in my opinion this product meets the high quality standards I have come to expect from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>This new handle really allows you to utilize all of the razors because it fits so comfortably.</li>
            <li>The new larger handle with grip is nice</li>
            <li>I was invited to get a free razor of a new shaving technology offered via a program run by Gillette, I was ready to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife has sensitive skin and loves the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power since she can touch my face without feeling like she is touching sandpaper.</li>
            <li>It does some like the blades stay sharp for a long time which is VERY good.</li>
            <li>The vibrating handle make it more smooth and less bothersome to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave itself didn&#x27;t seem to be any more comfortable then previous generation products.</li>
            <li>The handle was easy to hold and the grip was comfortable even when wet.  </li>
            <li>The handle was solid,  easy to grip, and was not slippery when shaving fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>For most this expertise is easily acquired but for a few they never get the hang of</li>
            <li>Super smooth 7 hours later!  </li>
            <li>This is a radical change from previous Gillette razors I&#x27;ve used and was a more comfortable razor to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vibration also seems to help the blades move much more smoothly through the hairs with less pressure.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I was lucky to receive and sample a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>More smooth, less razor burn for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to test it out for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive them for free through a program for Gillette.</li>
            <li>I pay more for chewing gum, and don&#x27;t enjoy it half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have Gillette send me a free razor to try out</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have been selected to receive the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a similar non-power handle by Gillette for years, so this felt very familiar.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say if it did a hugely better job, as I was still marveling at the clean smooth cuts from the blade itself, but it did seem to make it easier.  </li>
            <li>I can only compare it to other Gillette razors, but this is by far their best.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I never would have bought this cartridge as I&#x27;m a regular user of an old-school safety blade razor which works great for me.  </li>
            <li>The precision trimmer edges up nicely for the clean cut look, but after experimenting I also feel it&#x27;s a less risky shave than the main blades around the \\&quot;danger zone\\&quot; chin and neck area.    </li>
            <li>The handle shape is easy to grip &amp; with the side grips, there&#x27;s no slipping or dropping while I&#x27;m trying to shave.  </li>
            <li>I felt that I barely had to push down on the razor to get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>i received this product for free from gillette, which was awesome, and will definitely be stocking up on the blades, i am not crazy about the chrome color, but at the end of the day it is merely the color of your razor, not something to ruin your day.</li>
            <li>I use all sorts of different blades and have tryed many different kinds of blades and have noticed that no blade is good enough for me unless it is made in usa from chainsaws to stanley utility knife blades-carbide drill bits</li>
            <li>Right now, Amazon has a special offer for $3.00 off, so that pretty much zeros out the price difference with the cheaper (and less able) brands.</li>
            <li>This handle is that 16 year old with a tricked out shiny Honda Civic with loud exhaust and a cool sound system.  </li>
            <li>I finished shaving and was VERY pleased, so much so that I look forward to my next shave which never happened with the old model.  </li>
            <li>: the battery is tricky to put it, so be sure to look at the little slip that comes with the handle or you&#x27;ll be perplexed like  </li>
            <li>I normally purchase almost everything on Amazon, but I was fortunate enough to get this product in the mail for free from Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was impressed with this razor as a whole but the handle of this razor is much different than others that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I also do not get nearly the quality shave that I get with the original blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this the other day from Gillette and I really liked this razor.</li>
            <li>It does provide a nice weight to the handle which makes it easier to hold and use on the face and other body parts.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference other than the vibration is kind of annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a little more time for shaving, and a little attention to technique, you can get shaves with an old safety razor that are as good or better than anything you can do with a Gillette Fusion.    </li>
            <li>The little moisture strip at the top of the razor seems to really help in allowing it to glide over your skin easily.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer was the icing on the cake for me; this thing really got the hard to reach spots under the nose and worked great at the side burns.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the original fusion for since it lights less bulky and</li>
            <li>So all in all I gave it a 4 star rating only because I feel that it is just as adequate as the original without needing the power handle.</li>
            <li>It is hard to believe that this much more is actually better, but it is.  </li>
            <li>The blades did a great job of keeping my face smooth and clean for long but the handle was just like other average or cheap brands.</li>
            <li>I have been loving my new Gillette Fusion Proglide power handle since I received it a few weeks ago free via a program Gillette is running.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed with the Gillette Fusion my face is smoother throughout the day much longer compared to my old cheap razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I rate the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle 5 stars, because it really does fulfill what it is advertised to do and offers the closest shave a man can get, primarily because of the battery powered micropulses, flexibility, and ergonomic design.</li>
            <li>I do not mention this as a negative, but rather it is very sturdy and feels great in the hand.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to achieve a nice shave with its thin blades.</li>
            <li>In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean.</li>
            <li>so its more of a natural grip with makes for smoother shaving, less slips and quicker more percise shaving.</li>
            <li>, maybe it was just me, but the blade included with this razor, provided free by a Gillete program, wore out very quickly, prompting me to have to make a quick stop the next day to my local Walgreens to pick up a refill cartridge.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of trail shaving, I must admit that the Gillette is by far the most masculine looking razor I have ever used, however it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li>personally recommend buying a good quality handle, quality double edge shaving blades and quality shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll note again that while this difference was evident during the shaving process, the end result (the shaving closeness) was pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Best advice for those with sensitive skin, stick with the old stand-bys from Gillette (the ones that don&#x27;t vibrate) and you&#x27;ll do better...</li>
            <li>Overall I felt the shaving performance and results were just as good as the regular Fusion.  </li>
            <li>Sure, for a few bucks you get an electric razor that is really fantastic.  </li>
            <li>(well, at least most men do most days)</li>
            <li>I mention this only because I feel this razor does such a good job why not pamper yourself and feel like you just had a spa experience.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling nice and soft after each shave.</li>
            <li>As i was shaving last week with my beloved Quattro, my hubby walked in and noticed how I was repeatedly shaving the same spot over and over.</li>
            <li>the only way it could be better is if you got one at a braber shop with a straight razor...</li>
            <li>Weight is evenly balanced with a solid grip and provides a clean quick shave.  </li>
            <li>Love the side grips and just really the overall color scheme and look of the product...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just not worth more than the non-power version.</li>
            <li>I recently was able to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle thanks to a sample provided by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I love the bigger handle with the ergonomic side grips that has made holding on to the handle and navigating it around my face and neck so much easier for</li>
            <li>this first thing I noticed was the the large grip.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It certainly costs a bit more than other razor, but you&#x27;re paying for a far superior overall experience</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the heads lasted a bit longer, but they do last as long as my old ones and with better results.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and worth the money.</li>
            <li>After using it a half dozen times, I love it!</li>
            <li>My face was super soft!</li>
            <li>Gillette needs to get back to basics by realizing it is much easier to keep a satisfied customer who gets a good, comfortable shave as opposed to introducing new brands of razors that have gimmicks, and that are, not to mention, ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li>Most of the time this is because it is a hollow plastic, as a result I always need to grip tighter to get the right sort of control and pressure I want on the blade.</li>
            <li>I received a free razor through a program run by Gilette and Gilette has finally gotten it right with this system.</li>
            <li>The Proglide left my face super soft and the best part was I hardly got any bumps after using it for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing to mention is that replacement blades are a little pricey, but worth it for such a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Schicks for a long time because they&#x27;re super lightweight and comfortable to hold while my arm is up in the air.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I notice is that it has a package that is easy to open...</li>
            <li>battery vibration seemed odd at first, but honestly I think it helps to make a smoother and closer shave.</li>
            <li>: is there a positive difference?    </li>
            <li>grip is positive and tacky.</li>
            <li>I have had a positive shave experience with the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First impressions were positive.  </li>
            <li>The grips are a positive addition.</li>
            <li>The thinner blades of the cartridge make for less tug and pull than some other razors; I&#x27;m sure the good grips, the swiveling head, and the concomitant enhanced maneuverability likewise contribute to the ease of shaving.  </li>
            <li>The difference is clear and can be compared to holding a full tang chef&#x27;s knife against holding a wood handled discount knife.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly recommend the handle to anyone in the market as long as they wanted to go with the 5 blade option.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be too much of a gimmick to me at first glance.</li>
            <li>I have been using one blade for a month and it still shaves smooth with no drag.  </li>
            <li>really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power since the first time I started using it</li>
            <li>With the Fusion Power, I&#x27;d pretty much have to shave in the shower to avoid razor burn on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock sharp edge double edge blades (made in Russia) are great and inexpensive - $34 for      100 at the time of this review.              </li>
            <li>The straight razor ritual just takes too much time for me, but I totally understand whey some people would love it.</li>
            <li>if you really are into shaving and willing to shell out the dough.</li>
            <li>also provides a very close shave - which is exactly what I have been looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what this will do after a few more shaves.</li>
            <li>Even when wet, there was a nice grip that prevented it from slipping, giving me better control.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a long time and it works every time, I love it</li>
            <li>The vibration, though, is pretty much there for a gimmick.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed is that the handle is thicker with a beefy rubber grip.  </li>
            <li>the shave is super smooth and clean, I&#x27;m not sure if its the added vibrating option or just and overall better razor..</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the non-power version simply because I&#x27;m thrifty (okay, some might say cheap)</li>
            <li>This thing really works A quick clean close shave, even with an extra days growth.  </li>
            <li>A razor is pretty much a razor, right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.</li>
            <li>I was not sure how good the idea of a power razor was with shaving</li>
            <li>I had been using the \\&quot;Gillette Mach 3\\&quot; for the past couple of years and it was good.</li>
            <li>But if you think this matters, it is definitely true that the lubricant strip is heavier than on the old blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is superior to the razors I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>It felt good in my hands, not too small, not too bulky.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not that far into using it to know if that is a true statement.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave and only shave once instead of going over and over the same area to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not exactly sure what difference the \\&quot;power\\&quot; makes shave wise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a proglide since it was new and got this new iteration as a free trial.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and keeps my face smooth for longer than my previous razor.  </li>
            <li>The slight vibration made for a comfortable and almost therapeutic shave on my easily irritated face.  </li>
            <li>I tried out this razor free as part of a The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor has a nice, solid weight to it, plus bigger, more ergonomic side grips compared to previous versions.  </li>
            <li>I liked that I dont have to use a new blade every single time I shave.  </li>
            <li>The thinner blades didn&#x27;t clog up and washed out pretty easy (which was a HUGE complaint about my older Fusion), and after using it for a few weeks, the blade is duller but not as nick happy as I thought it would</li>
            <li>microcomb feature aligns your facial hair so that it cuts in the right direction, which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>The razor glides right over my face with minimal effort (especially when using a good gel shaving cream).  </li>
            <li>Concerning the lubricating strip, it is a definite improvement, being more slick and lasting longer while the handle allows a more secure and comfortable grip than its predecessor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricier than non-power options, but for me it seems a better value than buying a full electric razor.</li>
            <li>Small, light, powerful, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, bigger is better to fit in my gorilla mits and this one is larger than its&#x27; predecessors, It&#x27;s very shiny, so it is aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>And the other great benefit is that your razor blades last much, much longer.  </li>
            <li>is the same as on the other Fusion razors, which help to make it comfortable and effective.</li>
            <li>All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.    </li>
            <li>The handle is balanced and easy to grip, and you need to get used to holding it a bit differently because of the system vibration.</li>
            <li>The handle is balanced and easy to grip, and you need to get used to holding it a bit differently because of the vibration.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was hassle-free and easy to open, requiring no scissors or additional patience to get through a barrier of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan on trying the power handle with a normal ProGlide cartridge, while also trying the enhanced ProGlide Power cartridge on a standard handle to see which component contributed more to the easiest and closest shave</li>
            <li>While the off mode gave a really nice shave, the on mode gave me a closer, smoother shave with a lot less irritation.</li>
            <li>I not only could feel the difference in holding it but a scale shows the difference easily.</li>
            <li>My Gillette Fusion Proglide experience has been nothing less than spectacular.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bulbous end to the handle, which is slightly larger than the rest of the handle, and it made it easy for me to pinch and pivot the handle in my finger tips to get under my neck and chin line.  </li>
            <li>I am very particular with the razors I use</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and will definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li>I like the bigger handle and easy grip easier to helP me shave but the vibrating part I could do without.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is my finger can easily accidentally disable the vibrating pulse when changing grips.</li>
            <li>It is of solid construction and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was so simply to use and easy to load the battery into the handle.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m lucky, but my skin is fairly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This battery-operated razor is easy to setup, and place in a simple AAA battery.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace, they last about 1-2 weeks per double-sided blade, dependng on beard thickness.</li>
            <li>yes, Gillette is clearly bullying the marketplace as we longtime loyal customers can no longer find our favorites in the stores.</li>
            <li>How much better can these possibly be than a normal razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gillette gave me the opportunity to use the first razor free of charge, however, I will continue to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li>I noticed the places I normally have to hit two or more times to get a close shave only took one swipe.</li>
            <li>Did not slip and was easy to move around, even with my big meat hooks of hands.  </li>
            <li>The larger handle made for easy shaving</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, anyone who is minimally handy will figure it out in less then 30 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vibration seemed to make the razor slice through stubble twice as easy as before, as though it turned the stationary blades into a sort of oscillating saw you&#x27;d use to cut drywall, but on a much smaller scale.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor in a free package that Gillette sent to me and was cautious at first.</li>
            <li>and I quickly found out that I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>honestly didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in closeness, or less irritation, than I got with my Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle only takes 1 aaa battery which is easy to change.  </li>
            <li>The compartment that houses the batteries was easy to open and close thereby making it easy to replace them when necessary as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a result, I have a natural bias toward the traditional heavy metal type and consider most of the disposable razors on the market today as just cheap pieces of plastic which are better for women&#x27;s legs and underarms than a man&#x27;s beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I expected more automation from the Power razor.</li>
            <li>The batteries and razor blade were still going strong after shaving daily for over a week</li>
            <li>This product well engineered, and I strongly recommend you go to your local department store and pick one up!</li>
            <li>It is just slightly thickly then a normal razor, which is great since I have large hands.  </li>
            <li>For many years I’ve exclusively used a single blade razor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the power component helped, but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>ProGlide Fusion Power features a large handle, a five-blade cartridge, and a battery-powered motor that produces \\&quot;micropulses\\&quot; (vibrations) during shaving.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t do large volumes with it, but it works for its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>and I have no use for the vibration feature, but maybe certain genders do, who knows?</li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from the brand to try out, but I will certainly be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I saw a large, end-cap display for these razors yesterday at CVS.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly is a convenient feature.</li>
            <li>I should start by saying I have large hands (think XL size gloves).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for certain.</li>
            <li>I am sold of this new product!!</li>
            <li>Next, the whole handle is waterproof, so you can take full advantage of the power feature in the shower!  </li>
            <li>My wife often finds great savings for these razor systems so it is possible toget it for a much lower price than the average retail cost.  </li>
            <li>Overall i&#x27;m pretty happy with it and will likely purchase more blade refills for it in the future, changing from a very long experience with the Shick Quattro Titanium.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my only gripe; this new handle with the better grip works well for</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with this product and the new larger handle.</li>
            <li>I was able to this new razor against my current Mach 4 razor to see what all the hype was about</li>
            <li>the blades are much different from what I was using but the application of them in this was is new and certainly better.</li>
            <li>I was exceptionally surprised when after my first shave I had decided that I would go out and purchase a replacement cartridge right away.</li>
            <li>I now go through one time all downstrokes, then a second time through going up, and with that little vibrating thing (doesn&#x27;t it seem like that would not be a good idea, for the razor against your face to shake really quickly while you&#x27;re using it?)</li>
            <li>The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise.</li>
            <li>start, the packaging was done very well...easy to open and easy</li>
            <li>The vibrations that the handle puts out are strong enough to distract me from what it really going on.  </li>
            <li>perhaps that actually has a bit more to do with the weight distribution of the handle than i attributed, but nevertheless these blades do a better job, hands down.</li>
            <li>in all, its a great razor, but its super expensive to buy cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Right then I decided to upgrade to a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Putting the battery in was easy and felt light a tight fit when I put the cover back on.  </li>
            <li>About twice as much per cartridge, not sure the trade off of a better fresh feeling shave would be worth the cost difference.  </li>
            <li>This is very important as I shave in the shower where my hands are always wet and often slippery from soap and shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>The single blade at the back of the blade head does a great job especially above the top and lower lip, and the soft blue glow of the power button does add a cool touch.</li>
            <li>While the slight vibration while shaving with the razor power on was pleasant, I did not notice a major difference in the closeness of the shave I got while using the razor with the power off.</li>
            <li>While I like my old comfortable razor that I have had for years - I REALLY appreciate the new Proglide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the battery is most of the weight, but the handle is also a little bigger and contoured (unlike the Mach 3 which is pretty much just a straight shaft).</li>
            <li>When I was younger, I used electric razors, Norelco and Braun types, and thought they were fine; I was a bit intimidated by manual shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure from a cost standpoint, this razor is going to be a lot more expensive to use on a regular basis than my trusty Mach 3, but I can&#x27;t argue that it provides a better shave.</li>
            <li>The commercials had me a bit skeptical at first, but once I tried it, I LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>A super close shave and my skin was left feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The handle is big for my women groomers, but fits my hand fine.</li>
            <li>All in all, a very clever design, and very slim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is actually pretty decent, and the Gillette brand is one I respect.</li>
            <li>At first glance it&#x27;s a close cousin of the older Fusion - 5 blades (+ a trimmer blade) on a vibrating handle.</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I&#x27;m getter older</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty particular since I shave my face and head.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had introduced me to this razor line and spoke very highly of it, but I ignored it thinking it was just another razor.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was able to sue this razor all five work days last week without much discomfort by the end of the week.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed if the power option really changes my shave at all, but time will tell and it certainly doesnt bother me while shaving.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it is waterproof and a little thicker with a nice grip</li>
            <li>Due to the greater time-consumption of maintaining a straight razor, I suggest trying a safety razor outfit first.</li>
            <li>liked the 5 blades and found that there was little to no pull and tug.</li>
            <li>It really made the razor handle look slick and like a product of exceptional quality.</li>
            <li>first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this razor is the high quality design.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to anyone that wants that close shave that you are always looking for!</li>
            <li>first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this razor is the high quality design.</li>
            <li>However overall this razor is very comfortable very well made and is a marked improvement over any disposable razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It still shaves very smooth, but I am not certain if the power function really does anything.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great little device.</li>
            <li>The mild humming is odd for a safety razor, but not disturbing at all, and the shave is fantastic.</li>
            <li>A really good razor is hard to find</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think the razor is a good value considering the quality and the longevity of the blades, it takes some time for the blades to dull.</li>
            <li>A really good razor is hard to find</li>
            <li>I was very surpised as this razor was very high powered.  </li>
            <li>I must note that the blade gets worn down very easily and gets clogged with shaving cream/hair.</li>
            <li>Cleans my face very easily and keep the shave time down to 2 days or so.</li>
            <li>I fully appreciate how this shaver helps cut down on the time to obtain a clean, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>While the Proglide provided a great shave, the Hydro 5 did the same job for much less...and with money tight the way it is these days, I need to cut corners where possible, and the Schick razor allows me to do that without sacrificing a fantastic shave in the process.</li>
            <li>While the Proglide provided a great shave, the Hydro 5 did the same job for much less...and with money tight the way it is these days, I need to cut corners where possible, and the Schick razor allows me to do that without sacrificing a fantastic shave in the process.</li>
            <li>I rated this 4/5 because it might not be the best option if you have very thick facial hair.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product, but I would probably not buy it because for how little I would use the vibration action, the price would not be worth it.</li>
            <li>so light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large groves on the handle were nice for gripping, especially since your hands get wet and possibly slippery when shaving with shaving cream or gel.</li>
            <li>so I got my free Power ProGlide from Gillette for trial and intended to use it with an open mind but was not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>I get a smooth shave with fewer strokes and the blades seem to last much longer than I am used to.  </li>
            <li>Few days later, I went out and got the Shick Hydro 3 blade, now this is a great razor.</li>
            <li>The vibration really allows a very close and very nick-free shave.</li>
            <li>Needing to shave everyday its one those items that need to last a bit, happy to say that the razor has held up for two weeks</li>
            <li>Even the luring blue light to show that it on is very aesthetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li>The wide handle is great for use in the shower because the grips help you hold on to it when wet and soapy.  </li>
            <li>Very visible blue light lets me know the razor is on.</li>
            <li>really like the thin blades which gives you a closer cut with out the irritation which is really great for people like me whose skin gets irritated</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette...</li>
            <li>I found the grip to be very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was suprised, it complements the Proglide blades and provides for a much smoother shave and experience than I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently received a free sample of this razor from a Gillete promotion.</li>
            <li>The Mach 3 blade moved around, but not quite as much.  </li>
            <li>And, when the power is engaged, you really feel connected to the razor handle.</li>
            <li>(I received them as a free demo through Gillette), and I&#x27;ve got mixed feelings about it.</li>
            <li>The vibration really does work.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of a vibrating straight razor.  </li>
            <li>The gentle vibration it has when turned on felt soothing to the face.</li>
            <li>I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave.</li>
            <li>The vibration really help with not getting any nicks.  </li>
            <li>I recently upgraded to the Fusion ProGlide Power razor by receiving a free sample through a program that Gillette was running.</li>
            <li>This is really an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; razor for me.</li>
            <li>That makes me very happy!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, especially after getting the ProGlide Power through a free program by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only con that I have is the price but after receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free through a program ran by Gillette</li>
            <li>turned the power off and it was a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>The razor is a vary solid design and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; that the batter power provides really does let the razor get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I was ready.  </li>
            <li>When I recently had the opportunity to try one for free through a program run by Gillette, though, I decided to take my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades work really well, but I do not see the benefit of the vibration.</li>
            <li>but the whole vibration thing not so much.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any improvement in the shave over the non-powered version.  </li>
            <li>The robust design keeps the razor in my hands no matter how much water and shaving cream get on them.  </li>
            <li>I really like the power handle on this razor.</li>
            <li>That is what i think makes it very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>The blade currently seems to be holding out well and makes my skin feel soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>Using the power feature didn&#x27;t do much for my shave.</li>
            <li>This razor went straight through without a problem.  </li>
            <li>I received the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette, and I really like the handle and how the razor shaves, but I don&#x27;t really see or feel a big difference between shaving with it on or off.</li>
            <li>It is a smooth shave with a tiny massage while the hairs are coming off your chinny chin chin.  </li>
            <li>My thanks to Gillette&#x27;s promotional program that gave me the product to review.</li>
            <li>Turn on the power handle and get ready for the shake.  </li>
            <li>really gripped the skin (without irritation or cuts) and delivered a crazy-close shave.  </li>
            <li>The handle fits my hand comfortably and is simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Storage: I enjoy the simple plastic holder that comes with the handle.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Usually, it is much easier to just run the electric razor over my face on the way out</li>
            <li>i love how it never slips even when wet and</li>
            <li>With the handle \\&quot;powered up\\&quot; it vibrates, although not noticeably on the face, and the shave is much smoother with no tug at all.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle gave me a very close shave and did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharper and leaves a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked very well.</li>
            <li>The contours on the handle made it much easier to grip and maneuver with.</li>
            <li>When you turn on the razor it vibrates which makes the shaving much easier and smoother.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked VERY well.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows really fast</li>
            <li>It is a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free one from a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>The rubbery grip stays in your hand very well</li>
            <li>The battery provides the \\&quot;Power\\&quot;, which is really just a vibrating motion to the razor blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li>and this one is on the light side, especially if you remove the battery.  </li>
            <li>now includes a \\&quot;power on\\&quot; light that flashes when you&#x27;re running low on juice, having that heads up</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
            <li>Recently received free Gillette Proglide power razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>The shave with this razor really is &#x27;closer&#x27; than the non-power 4 blade Gillete razor</li>
            <li>how much is power</li>
            <li>and I really like the performance of this one .</li>
            <li>I got this razor free from Gillette about a month ago and put it into my daily rotation.  </li>
            <li>I had always thought that the razor market was filled with commodity products, but this morning my eyes were open to what I have been missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I work in the OR as a Surgical Nurse and we are demanded to be very close shaven.  </li>
            <li>The continuous vibration is coupled with a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor, simply helping bring hair to the surface for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It really is their smoothest shave yet.</li>
            <li>The vibration really made it feel like I could glide over my hair, rather than get that tug and pull that can happen so often when shaving.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Gillette products but it really depends on your needs.</li>
            <li>The Proglide really excels at that and keeps irritation to a minimum.  </li>
            <li>The appearance was very shiny.</li>
            <li>I was recently chosen to recieve the power fusion handle for free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette.</li>
            <li>vibrating feature does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a close, long-lasting, shave.</li>
            <li>The part I really like are these shavers with the lubrication strip.</li>
            <li>I tried the Power Handle and was absolutely blown away by the difference it made.</li>
            <li>I really like the grip and how the handle feels while I am shaving.</li>
            <li>It was very close.</li>
            <li>I was recently given a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I felt very indulged feeling the added closeness the micropulses provided.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely would recommend this razor to everyone, even the ladies.</li>
            <li>I have used out cheaper power handles and didn&#x27;t notice much of a change besides my a hand vibrating.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free Gillette Proglide Power Handle shaver through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>Its sort of like a gentle vibration while you shave and it seems to help get a smoother shave.</li>
            <li>The handle vibration really enhances the shave quality and the functionality of the handle itself.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really want to have to change batteries as well as blades and the LED</li>
            <li>is a bit much.</li>
            <li>The handle of the Gillette Fusion had just the appropriate amount of rubber to stay in my hand, even when wet.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying&lt;br</li>
            <li>has not really increased and the shave is much better than before.</li>
            <li>The handle is much more&lt;</li>
            <li>Given that Gillette passed on a free one to try out, I will be purchasing them in the future.</li>
            <li>While the vibration is &#x27;neat&#x27;, it didn&#x27;t really seem to improve my shave.</li>
            <li>The aesthetics of the shaver itself makes it look cutting edge (no pun intended), futuristic, and impressive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews much</li>
            <li>* fast shave&lt;br /</li>
            <li>* very close shave as expected&lt;br /</li>
            <li>&gt;* very aesthetically pleasing design</li>
            <li>From a program run by Gillette for a free razor, I finally had no excuses to try it out.</li>
            <li>The handle is quite comfortable,but, I don&#x27;t believe there is much difference between the manual and the power razor.</li>
            <li>I also feel that there wasn&#x27;t much difference between my Mach 3 or either Gillette razor, except the price in the blades.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous about using an electric that has real blades and the motion from the \\&quot;Power\\</li>
            <li>I also like the straight edge but for someone who would do precision shaping on a goatee</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much to where it&#x27;s noisy or annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need the battery operation and don&#x27;t think it makes any difference now that I have it</li>
            <li>close shave and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find there was much &#x27;glide&#x27; and</li>
            <li>and it seems to really minimize any tug and pull.</li>
            <li>, it really does make a difference</li>
            <li>, i bought this one, to know another type of razor, and i have to say that this razor is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gillette has done it again, smooth and silky shave system second to none!  </li>
            <li>It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box.</li>
            <li>Maintaining a straight razor at home is time-consuming.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like shaving, and I put it off when I can, but the Powerglide has made shaving so fast that I&#x27;m no longer trying to avoid it.</li>
            <li>But give us the option of buying a simple twin Sensor blade at an affordable price and keep it readily available.</li>
            <li>This could be a big drawback for some, but I value the comfortable</li>
            <li>dunno about buying into the whole Gillette \\&quot;system\\&quot; of warm-up washes, Fusion creams, and cooling aftershave.</li>
            <li>I dunno about buying into the whole Gillette \\&quot;system\\&quot; of warm-up washes, Fusion creams, and cooling aftershave.</li>
            <li>Both shave very close.  </li>
            <li>I have all the products - the Merkur&#x27;s safety razors, the Gillette Fatboy, and as assortment of straight razors from Dovo and Thiers Issard.  </li>
            <li>That may be too much to ask.</li>
            <li>Recently, I was given a free [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>(non-powered type), and I tried it, but didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s already too much IMO.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all sizzle and not too much substance.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a tip that has really served me well:  </li>
            <li>use hair conditioner rather than shaving foam, and you will get a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I get much closer shaves.  </li>
            <li>Very well dsigned product.</li>
            <li>Now that he switched over to this one, his face is REALLY much smoother.</li>
            <li>Really...</li>
            <li>I know this is my first night using it, but i just want to let everyone know that i dont normally write reviews for stuff i buy on here</li>
            <li>This is a very well made razor.</li>
            <li>This is legit, and the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t see any movement of the razor</li>
            <li>The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain.</li>
            <li>With the proglide I only have had to change the blades once in two weeks, and the performance has always been fantastic.</li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t get the power thing.</li>
            <li>I have a friend that really likes his Proglide</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was a bit much.  </li>
            <li>Only had a day&#x27;s growth that night, but noticed that this was astonishingly smooth, non-grabby</li>
            <li>I do like the lore and beauty of a handmade straight razor and was thinking of one, but I shave in the shower, strictly by feel, and don&#x27;t take much time doing it.</li>
            <li>It really does glide over your face.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I saw the commercial and automatically thought the fusion was great this one must be better, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li>The blades are pricey, but I doubt I&#x27;ll mind too much given the results.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting the Power Razor as it really does make a difference while shaving</li>
            <li>and you will really see this ProGlide Power come to life..</li>
            <li>This razor works really well</li>
            <li>but this is as close as it gets without learning how to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I ended up with one of these as a sample, not expecting much from it.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea why the vibration works the way it does, but when used in the bikini area, it gives incredibly smooth, irritation-free results that I didn&#x27;t think were possible.  </li>
            <li>You should really give this razor a try.</li>
            <li>He has used it on facial hair abit longer and it still manages to shave his skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>Granted, the cartridges on this do cost 4 times as much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it without reservations to anyone!  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to me to aid much in shaving.  </li>
            <li>There has been so much hype around this razor.</li>
            <li>I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not looking for a religious experience when I shave - just smooth skin without irritation, nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t see any movement of the razor</li>
            <li>when I look at it turned on, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>I need a firmer razor, one that doesn&#x27;t flop around as much at the head.</li>
            <li>Really like the power feature.</li>
            <li>Some of us may recall that the &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; our fathers used to shave with was called a straight razor.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret of getting a great shave depends on the pressure one applies to the shaving &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;,  </li>
            <li>I was really considering the safety razor route, but now I may not have to.</li>
            <li>so the sturdiness is appreciated.</li>
            <li>It conformed very well to my face.</li>
            <li>neither of them really got the chin and neck areas.  </li>
            <li>I rate this one highly!</li>
            <li>With the battery it vibrates giving your fingers that gentle relaxing massage while you shave your face.</li>
            <li>really gives a close shave w/o razor burn</li>
            <li>This razor works really well.</li>
            <li>I still think the expense is a lot but not so much</li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>so I could really put this razor to the test.</li>
            <li>Moral of the story, if you like a smooth effortless shave, every time, us the vibration.</li>
            <li>As it turns out I dont really see the advantage.  </li>
            <li>Prior to getting this handle for free from Gillette, I was using the non-Power ProGlide version.</li>
            <li>I was given the chance to check out a Fusion ProGlide Power thanks to a freebie from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting the handle to make a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I seem to get a very close shave and with little/no cuts.  </li>
            <li>Fits really well in the hand.  </li>
            <li>This razor gives me a very close shave.</li>
            <li>and I will say that the power doesn&#x27;t really make that much difference,</li>
            <li>I really like the power feature in the handle.</li>
            <li>I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle and Razor from a program they were running, and couldn&#x27;t wait to open the package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well balanced.  </li>
            <li>I really like these battery operated razors.  </li>
            <li>I like the blue power light.</li>
            <li>I felt like it kept getting stuck and pulling too much.</li>
            <li>I received this free from gillette to try controlling my facial hair</li>
            <li>But the real question is how well does it work?</li>
            <li>it provided a very close shave</li>
            <li>I will need to see if the cartridge lasts a whole month as it is stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the non-powered version, I had to go over a lot of areas multiple times to get a smooth shave, which created irritation.</li>
            <li>I could really feel the battery powered micropulses in conjuction with the microcomb lift the hairs up and guide them in a uniform direction for a closer cut.</li>
            <li>I bought this one without paying much attention.  </li>
            <li>It really does help get a closer shave.</li>
            <li>I feel that it really helped me get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I really like the handle</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It is very durable</li>
            <li>I also like the gentle microvibrations and feel like they lead to a closer shave.</li>
            <li>it made for a very pleasurable shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I really feel like it helps the shave</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the need for the battery component when you still have to manually move the razor.  </li>
            <li>but now I really like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>You will go through several cheap disposable razors in length of time you use 1 of these razors.  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try this razor thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I have purchased the razor both prior to and after using the free product.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor for several weeks after it was provided to me free from a Gillette run program.</li>
            <li>and I find myself not dropping it as much as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Now including a \\&quot;power on\\&quot; light that flashes when you&#x27;re running low on juice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets very close to the skin and have yet to have a cut.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended the power razor!</li>
            <li>I thought, \\&quot;who wants to put a vibrating razor to their face?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as part of a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li>The smooth and sleek design of the rest of the handle gives the razor that extra appeal.  </li>
            <li>These really help the razor glide across your face, without any pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li>Well see how much the blades are and decide if she is going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am always running around in the morning trying to get myself together, and tend to worry about nicking myself in my hurry to get ready for the office.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people think that the only important part of shaving is the blade.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>This razor, though convenient and smooth in some ways, does not rationalize the cost it would require for you to constantly change the head/blades.</li>
            <li>I got recently got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle for free to try out via a program from Gillte.</li>
            <li>I really like the comb on each blade</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for providing this to me as a promotion.</li>
            <li>I received a free razor through a program run by Gillette giving me the opportunity to try the product without the financial burden.  </li>
            <li>Much better than expected.</li>
            <li>I began waxing but that would take so much time</li>
            <li>though, I highly recommend this razor, for women too!</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s that much of a difference as to the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>Also another feature that was improved on this model was the micro pulses that are generated by the power handle which has given me a much smoother feel after shaving.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor is very well made, shaves quite close and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>Besides that, the handle performs very well.</li>
            <li>In combination with the the blades it provides a VERY close shave.  </li>
            <li>It works well with the power on, but you get a much smoother shave with the power on.  </li>
            <li>Our household likes it so much we have switched to using it exclusively.</li>
            <li>I really was anticipating getting this power handle in the mail.</li>
            <li>It still shaves me very closely.</li>
            <li>so I needed a handle that will be able to stick to my hand when shaving the harder areas like the jaw line.</li>
            <li>Getting the sideburns cut straight was a breeze.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for any one looking for a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The vibration really does make a difference, especially on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>really like the Power feature.  </li>
            <li>The shave is much closer and smoother than fusion.</li>
            <li>i was recently selected to receive a Gillette Fusion Proglide power for free from a program that Gillette is running.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the stabilizer does too much for me</li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue using this razor.</li>
            <li>I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor recently from Gillette and have never been happier with a razor before.</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette products before, to mixed reviews, but after doing my research, I decided to give the Fusion ProGlide Power a chance through a free Gillette promotion.</li>
            <li>Recently, I received the Gillett Fusion ProGlide Handle for free via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very picky about handles.</li>
            <li>However, once I started to shave, the power function didn&#x27;t cause any damage, so I am much at ease with it.  </li>
            <li>I recently received a free ProGlide Power Razor from a program sponsored by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>but I looked as though they didn&#x27;t leave as much razor burn as I would sometimes get.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery operated micropulses didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>and I could not comprehend how the 5 blades can make such a smooth shave and believe me it did.</li>
            <li>a very close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Having 5 blades is a bit much for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;After receiving a free razor through a program from Gillette, I am definitely making a switch again.  </li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t see myself paying what the Fusion ProGlide Power is selling for.</li>
            <li>It was very close.</li>
            <li>First of all, I want to mention that I don&#x27;t normally shave with a razor.  </li>
            <li>The handle has a power button that makes the razor vibrate gently while you&#x27;re shaving.  </li>
            <li>It really required a side by side</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t feel much difference in the smoothness of the shave itself, I did notice a difference in the act of shaving.</li>
            <li>The gentle vibration must do something to help reduce the risk of razor burn and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t nick his face as much and loves for power part of it.</li>
            <li>The handle makes it so much easier to shave your face.</li>
            <li>I Found it very convenient and very ergonomically suited to the palm of the hand.</li>
            <li>and it changed my whole shaving experience!&lt;br</li>
            <li>this handle are the same that fit the non-vibrating handle</li>
            <li>The price is higher than a normal handle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li>but there are HIGH VALUE coupons everywhere!</li>
            <li>i really didn&#x27;t understand the vibration.</li>
            <li>so darn much i am going to switch to an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I like the battery power light that provided indication of when the handle was on or off, and whether the battery powewas low.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a program run by Gillette, I had the opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this product.</li>
            <li>None really,</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>One thing that really helps is the conditioning strip on the blade itself.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a very close shave, there was no stubble when I was finished.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades seem to do really well at hacking the hair to pieces before it has a chance to tug.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying different razors and I really enjoy this one.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I had a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Does it really make a difference?  </li>
            <li>In larger areas on the face, the razor did fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The power portion of the razor has a nifty blue led light when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li>The refills are reasonably priced considering how well they do</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for the trial as I will stick to their four blade razor.</li>
            <li>I got this product as part of a Gillette promotion, and frankly wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>First I did a normal shave without turning on the handle to get a sense of how well the razor worked with just the blades.</li>
            <li>The handle feels and looks like metal but is really just plastic.  </li>
            <li>The handle itself is extremely comfortable and simple to use.</li>
            <li>It really does change the shave.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the way this handle looks.</li>
            <li>As for the micropulses I don&#x27;t know if they really make a difference in the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li>and I did not notice a real difference.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette.</li>
            <li>It cut micro-close and left my skin feeling smooth; even my girlfriend noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>highly recommend either of the Fusion Proglide razor bodies!</li>
            <li>I am a very frugal consumer but will not compromise on some products.</li>
            <li>It really glides well on ones face.  </li>
            <li>recently received a free razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>Then, if it&#x27;s one of the days that I really want to be thorough</li>
            <li>I received this razor free via a program run by Gillette, but I&#x27;ve already ordered several razors for my family and friends to try for themselves.</li>
            <li>These blades get very close and do not cut me up like others do.</li>
            <li>3: I feel like I can name a much needed change:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>It allows enough flex in the head to get a smooth shave all the way across.  </li>
            <li>A razor with 5 blades and a non vibrating handle gives the same smooth shave as this does so</li>
            <li>The 4 blade cartridge makes the difference; the power handle - not so much.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free Gillette Proglide Power Handle shaver through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>Its sort of like a gentle vibration while you shave and it seems to help get a smoother shave.</li>
            <li>razor has never pulled any hairs and seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>The shave is close and thanks to the power gripe handle</li>
            <li>I did not feel the Mircopulses added much to the to the quality of the shaving.</li>
            <li>I really, really like the shave I get with their products, but feel like there&#x27;s a shaving arms-race going on and Gillette is just continuously trying to</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I can really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it turns itself off after awhile</li>
            <li>my face is REALLY much smoother.</li>
            <li>The handle has a power button that makes the razor vibrate gently while you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I&#x27;ve found that I can shave faster with this razor, because you don&#x27;t need to spend as much time lathering the shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth enough that you can almost use it without any shave gel.</li>
            <li>The finer blades help glide across my face without so much tugging.</li>
            <li>The indicator strip really lets you know when it&#x27;s time to change the blade, which in my case isn&#x27;t very often, thankfully.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t mind shaving.  </li>
            <li>but I really did notice a difference.</li>
            <li>The battery really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Mach Three was good, but this is the clearly the next big step in shaving.</li>
            <li>It fits in your hand and is nice and firm.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that even though the shave mas smooth most of the time I could not get a smooth shave when I shave against the grain which is what I was really hoping it could</li>
            <li>After using the Gillette ProGlide Power Handle provided by a Gillette run program, I have enjoyed many of its features but found the micropulses to be unnecessary.  </li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>I recently received the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER RAZOR through a program run by Gilette and after using the non powered version for years I was surprised at home much better the powered version is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Fusion blades without the power handle and they seemed to pull at my hair more than I like, however the vibration removed the pulling and helped me get a very close shave for my wedding day with minimal irritation (all of which cleared up in plenty of time for the pictures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I had to go back to my old Gillette Mach3 disposable which were 100x better then this.     </li>
            <li>handle had a nice feel but was slightly heavy</li>
            <li>My wife enjoyed the shave it gave so much that the biggest problem I have with it is keeping it away from her as she tries to steal it for herself.</li>
            <li>I have used, but with only using it once so far it could take more uses before I realize</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the point of the vibration feature and seems extremely more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>The Proglide Power handle is definitely something different, but I honestly have to say that I could do without it.  </li>
            <li>I have shaved with th Gillette Fusion Proglide Power a few times so far and have had a good experience with the power handle.</li>
            <li>The Power option is kind of gimmicky.</li>
            <li>As a special promotion, I received the new Gillette Proglide from Gillette, and its thin blades and powerized handle has been great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The addition of power, in other words, a vibrating surface gives a cleaner shave without pulling or tearing - even usable on very light growth without shaving cream or water.</li>
            <li>The blades themselves are very comfortable and provide an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li>Very smooth on the skin and the slight vibration seems to help achieve the closer shave compared to my previous (and well liked) razor.  </li>
            <li>While I usually buy most of my grooming supplies from Amazon, I was lucky enough to be a part of a promotional program by Gillette and received one of these razors for free in the mail.</li>
            <li>, it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide.</li>
            <li>, it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide.</li>
            <li>with the battery in the handle, the weight of the razor was just right, not overly heavy to burden my hand, not overly bulky either, just a good solid</li>
            <li>am thrilled that I am shaving less!</li>
            <li>I mean, is there much more important to a man than his face.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a great razor plain and simple.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll briefly compare this to the other razors I&#x27;ve tried and tell you a honest view of mine about why this deserves only one star and which razors are better.    </li>
            <li>however with this Fusion ProGlide power razor I get a very close smooth shave without going back and forth many times like other</li>
            <li>Bottom line is, you&#x27;re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the black gripping on it.</li>
            <li>For the first few days, the Gillette razor provided a very smooth shave and was relatively knick free.  </li>
            <li>First new razor I&#x27;ve bought in years, and</li>
            <li>This is the first new razor I have tried since then.</li>
            <li>The first thing I needed to do was to get used to the new method of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use a razor in the new style.</li>
            <li>Love the idea of being to get a better closer shave with already 5 thin blades but the nice little humming and vibrating feeling from is Gillette Proglide handle!</li>
            <li>bottom line, the Fusion ProGlide powered or not - can glide right off the shelves into shaving history as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li>This is a true case of a product living up to the hype and being worth every single cent.</li>
            <li>having sensitive skin is though when finding the right razor.</li>
            <li>Love the blades so much I threw out the other razor I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>First I want to say I&#x27;ve shaved with most razors out there, even the Gillette Mach 3 ,Schick Hydro 5 , and this by far is the best closest ,least irritating shave I have had.</li>
            <li>Well worth it if your looking for that effortless shave and extremely close and smooth results.</li>
            <li>The razor handle itself felt very sturdy, much more so than other reusable razor handles I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have been a long time user of Gillette products and was very excited to try out this new razor</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor if you have a tough beard and want a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My second, third and subsequent shaves were just as good as the first.</li>
            <li>Allows you to store a new pack of cartridges underneath for quick changing of an old one.</li>
            <li>Seriously, though, this is the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is you can&#x27;t really submerge the razor handle to clean it, and I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the shower or use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I really just shave to clean up the areas around my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this razor for anyone that wants a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle provides a firm grip for a clean and smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li>My initial concerns about water getting into the handle were quickly dispelled, as the seals for the battery compartment were nice and tight.  </li>
            <li>The weight and grip, give control of the razor at a more nuanced degree than any other disposable I have tried.</li>
            <li>I discovered they were a significant improvement over the regular Mach3</li>
            <li>Five bladed tends to nick my face more often than the Quattro or any other four bladed razor</li>
            <li>It could even be considered elegant among other grooming supplies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a pretty specific shaving routine because of my sensitive skin, so when I received a free &#x27;Pro-glide&#x27; razor from Gillette to try I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that I am quite pleased with it..</li>
            <li>The handle has more grip than other Gillette Handles.</li>
            <li>The Fusion power handle has vibration that is a significant improvement over a different power handle</li>
            <li>this blade does not provide any more protection against razor burn than any other blade.</li>
            <li>I really like the micropulses feature, which helps my sensitive skin feeling smooth without the tugging and pulling I&#x27;ve experienced from other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Back to my original Gilllette Sensor.</li>
            <li>but it is better than other brand razors</li>
            <li>Tried other brands too and this one is his favorite.  </li>
            <li>Get the Shick Hydro or any other disposable razors, they will do a better job.</li>
            <li>I tried during the same shave using the razor with the micropulses on and then off and did not feel a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>This is an improvement over my other razor handles as it does feel more ergonomic and easier to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next, the motor inside has received a significant boost.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference between the regular fusion and the fusion proglide.</li>
            <li>One caveat, however is the strip on the razor head - like many other razors, it soon fizzles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the shave was any better one way or the other.</li>
            <li>However, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge does not have this problem, despite having more blades than any other razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try it and left my stubble grow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned a battery operated razor in my entire life, believe it or not, so this was a unique opportunity for me to try this out.</li>
            <li>While the blue light that lights up when the button is pushed up looks cool, I don&#x27;t think the Micropulses actually enhance the shave itself in any way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other razors and with all of them -</li>
            <li>Overall, I think Gillette has come up with a great new razor that I personally plan to keep using in the future.</li>
            <li>The blade on the Fusion ProGlide slides right through hairs without the tugging I often had with other cheap blades.  </li>
            <li>Like any other man, I typically do not like the act of shaving, but I liked using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>most razors are a little rough, this one actually feels smooth for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it does exactly, but it does feel a little funny at first, but it seems to work great</li>
            <li>wow, this is way better now that it has this new Flexball!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve seen the commercial where they show you</li>
            <li>The Fusion ProGlide Power Handle was no different, it comes encased in a very comfortable rubber grip and the handle is large enough that it fits snuggly in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Further speaking to the cosmetic appeal of the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, the power button actually lights up a cool blue which is nothing more than pretty, but I like pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor, provided free from Gillette, proved to give a comfortable close shave without the irritation I usually have.</li>
            <li>i have become rather lazy and rarely use shaving cream any more.</li>
            <li>I have to bang the razor on the sink several times while shaving to clean it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really gives a closer shave compared to my older Gillette cartridges.</li>
            <li>old fusion shaver was already great, but I still experienced the issue of cutting myself in several places and the shave hurting when having too much facial hair.</li>
            <li>enable the razor to glide through my beard much quicker and with a much closer shave than I would normally have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one actually increased the tug i had to provide in order to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>The Proglide gives a good but not superior result, and Gillette&#x27;s instructions for an optimal shave require too much prep time.  </li>
            <li>, it does give me a clean, close shave; but only if I space out its usage.  </li>
            <li>and it felt like any normal smooth shave as if I was just removing some daily stubble.  </li>
            <li>The first was the Fusion Proglide Styler, but this turned out to be a better size option for everyday shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle was suitable for the different grips I use while shaving, such as the fingertip grip and the hand palm grip.  </li>
            <li>If used correctly(trial and error required) it will actually give a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>It has become my go-to razor for mornings when I have time and want to feel extra clean shaven.</li>
            <li>Only the center gets used the most, and thus, the blade wears out quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last, but I liked the feel of the vibration as I shaved.  </li>
            <li>In all, this razor exceeded my expectations and has totally replaced my old traditional Gillette razor - for sure!</li>
            <li>The company recommends to change the blade after every 4 or so uses but in my personal opinion, with such a clean and smooth blade, the blade can last you several more uses than that.</li>
            <li>The razor batteries last about a month and that is with daily usage,the blue power light will start blinking letting you know to change the battery which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this one too.  </li>
            <li>This goes really well with a badger brush and some high quality shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This is a really well made razor, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The problem, if you ask me, which you have, is that the handle is very light, and the vibration motor is centrally located, which means not only does the blade vibrate, but the whole handle does.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the optimum angle is, but I have trouble believing that every hair requires the same angle for a smooth cut, given that I have to shave in several directions.</li>
            <li>I tried the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor recently because I got it free through a promotion from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money on this new razor.  </li>
            <li>For those, who are looking for a new razor, which will give you an unbelievably comfortable shave, look no further than the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li>For those, who are looking for a new razor, which will give you an unbelievably comfortable shave, look no further than the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li>The new and improved handle glows with a blue light and provides a vibrate function to help eliminate the tug on the skin.</li>
            <li>I received my current Gillette Fusion razor through a special offer from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The vibration is enough to make the shave a little more comfortable, smoother and faster.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to grip when wet thanks to the ridges on both side, and the blade cartridge pops on and off with the snap of a release button.</li>
            <li>In comparison to the previous iteration I owned, not much has changed, but the things that have made me really happy.  </li>
            <li>As far as power options go, the Gillette Fusion Proglide is relatively quiet and the blade cartridge is easy to connect and eject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I have always had a slight problem getting a really close shave, but this provided the closest - must be the vibration :).</li>
            <li>I can always get a good grip on the handle whether it is wet or dry</li>
            <li>I previously reviewed the Fusion Proglide Styler which I loved, I think a big part of it was the blades.  </li>
            <li>What a clean close smooth shave with little to no effort exherted onto myself!</li>
            <li>It was smooth and resulted in less razor burn than other razors I had used and gave a nice close</li>
            <li>It was very smooth and did not have the ripping effect of a typical shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually get good results with The Gillette Fusion Proglide and the handle is easy to grip and to hold, recently using the bigger and thicker handle from the Styler</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the comfortable grip and overall heft of the ProGlide Handle.  </li>
            <li>Let me say I  received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for FREE via a program run by Gillette and will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li>Well I did not notice any how difference in my shave, how smooth my face was or how long between shaves.</li>
            <li>Works well, smooth shave and no irritation as long as the vibrate is turned</li>
            <li>I still get minor razor burn on my neck sometimes, but I can&#x27;t imagine another big-brand-name razor like this being this smooth.  </li>
            <li>the past couple shaves how nice the handle is.</li>
            <li>The rubber gripping on the bottom is deep and firm allowing for a light touch to control the handle.</li>
            <li>From a logical stand-point I am completely stumped as to how vibrations are supposed to add to the quality of a shave.  </li>
            <li>Of course, this has come with a cost as the average price of a disposable blade approaches $5, but the benefits are just as notable.</li>
            <li>It had been several days since shaving and at this point I usually only shave in the shower to get an easier and more gentle shave.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about the handle is that it has considerable heft to it compared to the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts even the first time I used it, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>When I used to use my old razors, the cuts on on my neck would bleed out and make it look like I came straight out of a horror movie!</li>
            <li>Cheaper razors that last longer and still give me a top notch razor-burn-free shave adds up to one very converted former Gillette fanboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I found that for ME, the opposite was true.</li>
            <li>but I found that for ME, the opposite was true.</li>
            <li>The razor is definitely of higher quality than the old one.  </li>
            <li>My \\&quot;qualified 5 star rating\\&quot; is given because the improvement of this razor over my first 5 blade manual Gillette is no where near the improvement seen in moving from the 3 blade to 5 blade system.  </li>
            <li>I got some razor burn going against the grain with it, but I have a pretty sensitive face to begin with, so I don&#x27;t hold that against the razor.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Honestly I was skeptical of Gillette just creating another gimmick cartridge to take our money, but as far as their other razors are concerned, this one really is great.  </li>
            <li>but when by four year old electric gave out my first thought was not to impulse</li>
            <li>The only thing is you cannot use this to full effect without its battery but its built that way</li>
            <li>The vibration is a bit intense, but you can&#x27;t feel any of the tugging and pulling you normally feel when shaving.</li>
            <li>Purchased this razor first, then purchased the Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no \\&quot;open here\\&quot; arrow, so I was all ready to get the scissors to cut the top off, when I happened to pull on the back, and it tore off.  </li>
            <li>In addition, because I have a clef chin, I was not able to shave that area effectively without going over the spot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t be writing the same type of review with that type of use in mind.</li>
            <li>I shave my head and was worried that I would hit the power button when shaving the top of my head since I was holding the razor upside down.</li>
            <li>Then came the Fusion and then Fusion Pro which , hands down was better than any shave I&#x27;d ever had.</li>
            <li>Look for me to change once the cost comes down to more affordable prices.</li>
            <li>I guess with louder vibrations you also get stronger vibrations, able to handle when pressing down on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any other handle I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>It is a little more than most other razors, but for me it is work it.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for the better part of 15 years now, and I have to admit that I had tried just about all razors out there including other Gillette products like the Mach 3 and electric razors, but none have compared to the Fusion ProGlide Power Razor!</li>
            <li>You also have precision blade that can clean up the line after you use the flat side.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a nice close shave with a little vibrating action in the handle.</li>
            <li>a little pricey but simple shopping around can almost always result in a good price.</li>

            <li>Thank you again Gillette for the opportunity to try the new product!</li>
            <li>In sum, I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to shorten their normal shaving time.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the shave very much, and this coming from a guy who usually uses an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Very few nicks, nice lines around my goatee with the precision trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Gillette&#x27;s Fusion gives a really close shave and really leaves my legs and underarms smooth, for longer than any other razor.  </li>
            <li>This new system with a power blade works very well.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this razor to anyone who is looking to switch to something new.</li>
            <li>I really like the design of this new product.  </li>
            <li>This was a reasonably priced new handle.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t think of trying anything new.</li>
            <li>I have grown very fond of this new razor.</li>
            <li>The new Flexball™ effortlessly follows the contours of your face, providing a much closer, and smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;re not going to use the power option, I&#x27;d assume there are cheaper options out there that use these same blades (which are great, by the way - super thin, sharp, and smooth).</li>
            <li>The new shape of the handle and the grip was so easy and felt soft to the touch yet with total control of where the blades were heading.  </li>
            <li>It might not be the second coming of Jesus, but it certainly beats sliced bread!!</li>
            <li>I found the handle to be very ergonomic, and slip free; even when wet.</li>
            <li>The handle is nice and sturdy, but also flexible allowing the most awkward of angles to be performed while shaving.</li>
            <li>It was easy to hold on to even when it was wet.</li>
            <li>Shaving is still not my favorite morning activity, but this power handle does make it much less of a chore.</li>
            <li>Much better than the previous versions.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t slip when it gets wet, and it is easy to grip.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to grab and it is no slip even if your hands our wet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to hold and the rubber grips make it stick in my hand when wet.</li>
            <li>It does the job better with a smoother shave with less pulling than before.  </li>
            <li>I just wish I could say that this version was leaps and bounds better than the previous ones.</li>
            <li>The side grips made it easy to handle the razor even when wet,</li>
            <li>For me I like the clean shave without the nicks and having to wear pieces of toilet paper to cover them that you get from the cheaper razors.</li>
            <li>It was easy to grip, even while in the shower with wet hands.  </li>
            <li>The handle isn&#x27;t much better than the previous fusion models.</li>
            <li>I thought once I added the AAA battery that it would give it more mass like a typical razor</li>
            <li>The handle is well made and easy to grip, I do not feel like it will slip out of my hand, even when wet.</li>
            <li>The handle was also easy to hold even when wet.</li>
            <li>For many shoppers who make purchases such as these based off the look in the package, such as myself, you might be losing some customers with this bump at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Some technology actually does make our lives better - this is one such convenience</li>
            <li>An exceptional shaving experience that left my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li>You can definitely tell that the overall shave is better with the handle turned on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The two main differences between what I&#x27;m accustomed to with the Mach 3 handle and</li>
            <li>(Occasionally I&#x27;ll try the latest hyped product from Schick but always come back within a week.)</li>
            <li>This review is particularly focused on the handle itself.  </li>
            <li>I came across this particular handle from a promotion Gillette was offering</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE October 19, 2013 - I&#x27;ve been using this razor regularly and have gone though several refills and still love it.  </li>
            <li>It feels good, heavy, solid in your hand.</li>
            <li>Surely there are more of you who have noticed this disturbing trend of late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then when I got a older</li>
            <li>It seems to struggle just as the older fusion against the grain.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Gillette Mach 3 line, but still have sensitive areas under the jawline, so I decided to try the alleged top dog in blades.  </li>
            <li>If you took out all the gimmicks, this would still be a decent razor.</li>
            <li>(Another use was when an older brother had his rear tanned when he got out of line!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, there is an extra blade on the top of the unit for precision trimming.</li>
            <li>I used this exactly nine times and you know exactly when you&#x27;ve shaved your last shave with a blade.</li>
            <li>Today I got my free Gillete Fusion PROGLIDE, and guess what the shave was the same as my old fusion.</li>
            <li>notable different is the various ergonomic grips running along the handle.</li>
            <li>As this review is essentially about the Power Handle itself, not the blades, I want to elaborate on why it&#x27;s been such a treat to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>than you would if you just bought a decent electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I still have one of the older model battery razors, and they have come along way.  </li>
            <li>The main benefit, as with the manual pro glide, comes from the 5 blades, which are well supported in an improved suspension system.</li>
            <li>and I would only give it 2 stars because of how quickly the lubristrip wears out.</li>
            <li>Oh the joys of getting older)  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll opt for something more basic.</li>
            <li>With the price of these razors that&#x27;s a plus, enjoyed the product and will definitely buy in the future and recommend.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this razor as part of a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I was comparing this particular razor to another Gillette Fusion razor I have</li>
            <li>It works especially well if I have more facial hair.</li>
            <li>I got one free to try from a Gillette program, and have to admit that while I use to think all razors are about the same, this one has completely made me rethink  that.</li>
            <li>trying it a 2nd time same results, maybe I just took more time in using it</li>
            <li>With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I got a decent shave</li>
            <li>I used to use the older Gillette Fusion power</li>
            <li>This particular razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a trial of this razor through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I want the shave to be as comfortable as possible.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use the same blade for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>I like to keep it steady</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve ever taken particular notice of my razor&#x27;s handle before....until now.  </li>
            <li>If you have to shave daily or at least quite often, that is a great feature.</li>
            <li>With the handle being larger I was able to control the shave a lot easier than my regular Fusion.</li>
            <li>but you just need to move your grip up to the main grip pads on the neck of the razor.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Fusion Power Blades and they have been doing a decent job.</li>
            <li>Although I do wish the handle itself was a touch bigger, overall i have no complaints at all and am looking forward to many shaves to come.</li>
            <li>Who would think that a simple powered Micropulses would give me any further benefit from an already outstanding razor</li>
            <li>I never would have purchased these blades or power unit before trying this, but we will be definitely be purchasing more in the future to keep these blades on hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really surprised with the close and smooth shave I got while using the power razor for the last couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have used a Gillette Fusion manual razor for years with much satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>These did not seem to be any good, as the first one I ordered lasted less than a week, (shaving alternating days,) while other brands always lasted 3-4.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was concerned with the cost of the blades, but I&#x27;ve now shaved 8 times on a single blade and my shave this morning was as close and smooth as day one.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it had the power to leave a nice clean shave on such a small battery.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other razors in terms of price, since I got it free through a program run by Gillette, but I am certainly a fan of the shave.</li>
            <li>When I received the razor, it didn&#x27;t look much different than what I expected, however upon first use, I can say I love the Power razor feature.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide did OK, but the results definitely weren&#x27;t as smooth as his usual razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blade has not lasted nearly as long as the original fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>The wet shaving methods and products are far superior to other shaving mechanisms, but the time it took to safely use a double edge razor took up 25 minutes of my morning for a three pass shave avoiding major nicks along the way.  </li>
            <li>Razor blades that are sharper and probably last just as long as the cartridges (and perform better), for much, much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Functionality - the light is covered up by your hand when you are shaving, so there is not much point to it rather than perhaps looking cool and possibly draining a battery faster.  </li>
            <li>I really  thought the five blades were a gimmick and wasn&#x27;t going to try it, I really do like it better than razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer blade at the back edge of the new ProGlide cartridge gave sharp again comfortable and accurate results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gillette was running a free program to try out their new razor, the fusion profiled power, and as a long time fan of Gillette, I couldn&#x27;t refuse.</li>
            <li>The vibration IMHO does nothing to help the shaving, but get used to it, as long as I&#x27;ve lived they have seen fit to invent something new every couple of years to keep a revenue plan.</li>
            <li>The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.    </li>
            <li>I would usually use a trimmer to take off most of the hair before I shave if it has been this long between shaves but thought I would give it a shot without trimming it first due to the note on the package that the razor was good on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve not seen any change to the high quality shave.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any additional utility out of that feature and feel it drove the price point up a bit too high for the item.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to all types of shavers out there.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to ANY one that shaves any part of the body, I give this a 5 Star rating out of 5.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>I would probably not pay the high price for this razor or the replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you use Fusion blades and it feels like they pull a bit on your stubble, I highly recommend upgrading to the power handle.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend this!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended blade</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you also try [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Highly, HIGHLY recommend buying this prduct.</li>
            <li>If you have this problem, then I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>If there is one downside to using Gillette Fusion razors it would be the high cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li>only better shave is short old dude at the men&#x27;s barber shop downtown wielding a straight blade.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>this is a 2-month supply, assuming each cartridge lasts a week which I highly doubt.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would have to use a set of electric clippers before shaving this much growth, but the Gillette blades are pretty open, so I skipped straight to shaving.</li>
            <li>As ad added bonus, I highly recommend the addition of the ProGlide Power Handle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anybody to try out this razor.</li>

            <li>I have and will always be a dedicated user of Gillette Proglide and HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly encourage you to try it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It was definitely a high quality shave.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these any day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor.</li>
            <li>My one caveat at for this early review is that I have not been able to determine how long the blades last but do not expect that to be significantly different, and if I am not mistaken the older blades still fit as well.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t buy electric shavers because the price is always really high, but since i received this from Gillette for free from a promotion i figured i would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it did not viberate a whole lot while shaving, most other electric shavers were vibrating so much that it made it hard to get a close shave, but this one was not like that which was very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first impressions were positive - the battery compartment requires a larger handle, which has been covered in a patterned rubber grip.  </li>
            <li>I remember that Consumer Reports was unimpressed with the vibrating Fusion when it came out, but I got one right away and liked it--even while aware that each \\&quot;improved\\&quot; razor came with ever-more expensive blades.     </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and a lot thicker than other razors I am used to so that makes it much easier to handle.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, but not much better than regular, and I expected better.  </li>
            <li>The grip on the handle is fine, it doesn&#x27;t get too slippery when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li>There is no need to worry, the handle can get wet and will still work fine</li>
            <li>But, if your just a simple joe like me and just want a fast and easy shave, I&#x27;d suggest to stick with a regular Gillette Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li>My fears of nicks, cuts and a handle that is to large were completely unfounded.</li>
            <li>To be honest I don&#x27;t get the vibrating part, I tried it the first couple of shaves and really didn&#x27;t see much difference and forgot to turn it on at least 75% of the time after the first couple of tries.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be chosen by Gillette to try out their new pro glide power razor at no cost, and boy was I blown away.</li>
            <li>They do cost a little more  </li>
            <li>I prefer a little weightier handle, something more substantial that I can control and grip.  </li>
            <li>it has a little more weight and sturdiness.</li>
            <li>The vibration may cause the hair to lift a little more and it also helps agitate the face to stop irritation.</li>
            <li>did get a little more snuggle time from my wife.......</li>
            <li>The vibration feature left me confused because it seemed to do my harm than good - the vibrations caused me to nick myself quite a few times more than I would normally, and I felt like it made my overall experience much more cumbersome.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been blissfully ignorant of the innovation going on in the category until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I really enjoyed the shave that this little device provides.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I did notice is that the handle itself was a little more bulky and had a feel that you knew you were holding it, unlike some disposables that are</li>
            <li>a little more grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits my hand better and lets me twist and turn with little effort.</li>
            <li>The power button requires a little more force to turn on and off</li>
            <li>I never understood how my friends and family members were able to achieve a close and fast shave on a regular basis, while I would shave twice as slowly and get a shave half as good as theirs.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy at all and in fact is likely very light yet solid if you remove the battery.</li>
            <li>The micropulses, as Gillette calls it, gives me a very smooth cut every time and the vibrating action actually \\&quot;lifts\\&quot; the hairs allowing me to cut as close to my skin as possible without injuring it.</li>
            <li>Standard safety blades will do you fine, and they&#x27;re much, much less expensive than constantly buying cartridges which clog and wear out quickly (if you want the best safety razor blades, [...]</li>
            <li>The razor comes in packaging that is easy to remove without using sharp objects.</li>
            <li>I normally use a Panasonic Multi-flex electric razor, but mix it up every now and again when I feel like taking my time and looking a little better.</li>
            <li>It comes in a really nice hard case which you can set the blade on to.  </li>
            <li>will probably keep the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle and use it with my Mach3 cartridges (they seem to fit) and only use the more expensive Fusion ProGlide cartridges on special occasions when I need a particularly close shave.</li>
            <li>The blades really do glide over my face quickly and comfortably, and the shave is so close that no stubble appears for hours later than with previous blades.</li>
            <li>At first vibrations feel strange when you are shaving, but you get used to it very fast</li>
            <li>The handle is much more comfortable in my hand, and the power button is a little harder to press.  </li>
            <li>For a little extra thickness (holding one battery), the razor fit snugly in the hand and did not feel that difference in thickness, but when the button is pressed it did make the shave smooth.</li>
            <li>I used a new fusion blade on one half of my face and the proglide on the other, both provided a very smooth, comfortable, and close shave.</li>
            <li>Not entirely sure If I&#x27;m completely converted over to this new tech, but for now, I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t enjoying it!</li>
            <li>I did not have to repeat strokes as often as I did with my previous razor and the extra single razor it has on the opposite side of the cartridge was excellent for thinning my mustache.</li>
            <li>The Gillette is sometimes not the most comfortable shave (especially when the blades begin to dull) but it is always the closest.  </li>
            <li>Also glad that other gillette blades will fit since I have about five cartridges left from my regular fusion before I need to get new blades.</li>
            <li>because the high quality of the Gillette blades themselves and the high quality shave that they provide on their own render the added benefit of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle somewhat less essential.</li>
            <li>The pulsating action really does provide for a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>The handle has grips that make the razor feel secure in your hand, eliminating the worry about slipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and maneuver, with grips that prevent slipping.  </li>
            <li>I generally use a standard razor with disposable blades because I have experienced irritation when using electric razors in the past.</li>
            <li>The handle was comfortable to hold, even while vibrating and wet.  </li>
            <li>The Power handle allows for a much smoother closer shave than my old Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great products that may have brought me back from the disposable world.&lt;br /&gt;One note of constructive criticism, why not give us a few refill blades with the razor?</li>
            <li>I feel that I have sensitive skin and this razor is gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li>The flexibility of the shaver head and the lubrication pad made shaving smooth, effortless, and pulling was minimal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been curious about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, but didn&#x27;t feel the need to try one until I received a free one as part of a promotional program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>But with cheap razors I found I&#x27;d end up with nicks and irritations no matter how carefully I shaved.</li>
            <li>Too expensive but a great razor.</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t quite figure out why you&#x27;d want a battery operated razor, but he said he was surprised to find that it really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d make any difference at all, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>That said, I recently switched to the very inexpensive Dorco 6-blade system which is available only via mail order.</li>
            <li>If you do not care where it is made you&#x27;d be happy buying one at random without reading where it was made on the box.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t quite figure out why you&#x27;d want a battery operated razor, but I was surprised to find that it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>The blades were so gentle on my skin that I used them to teach my thirteen year old son how to shave.</li>
            <li>the vibrating action is very good,the aaa battery lasts about six months.</li>
            <li>I also really like the blue light that lights up; it provides almost not benefit, but it&#x27;s blue and shiny and I like that.</li>
            <li>Having been avid user of the Gillette Fusion Razor for the past three years, I didn&#x27;t think there was going to be much difference when I picked up the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, which I received for free via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>and my skin was baby smooth with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see much difference from my old Mach 3 that I&#x27;ve been using for a number of years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The \\&quot;power\\&quot; aspect of the handle is a real wild card.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical before using this product but the results were great.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my everyday shave.  </li>
            <li>I even got the irritation lotion to use a long with it for the full experience.</li>
            <li>Definitely  a 5 star product worth your while and money.</li>
            <li>This was not my normal brand</li>
            <li>To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days</li>
            <li>The vibrating is different at first the results make it well worth the minor awfwardness at first.</li>
            <li>Normally I shave every day.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Although the first few shaves were smooth, I did not receive a closer shave than with the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>But, for me, the improvements in Gillette&#x27;s latest-generation shaving system aren&#x27;t compelling enough to make me switch.</li>
            <li>I purposely waited to let my stubble go for the weekend and shave on Monday like I do with my normal razor.</li>
            <li>Normally after 5 uses I would have irritation and bumps on my neck, but none with using the proglide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have been trying to find a good razor, and I finally have found what i have been looking for over the past 30 years.</li>
            <li>Comparing this razor to the normal ProGlide and to the Schick Quattro, I choose the ProGlide Power.  </li>
            <li>Is this worth the extra cost?  </li>
            <li>It feels pretty much the same to me when I use the vibrating and when I use don&#x27;t use</li>
            <li>a normal Civic would not.  </li>
            <li>I have the used normal non-vibrating Gillette for some time now, and I don&#x27;t think this fancier looking, vibrating device makes any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Normally, I use electrics so I don&#x27;t break out in rashes.)  </li>
            <li>My facial hair grows pretty fast so even by the end of the day I sometimes notice some stubble.  </li>
            <li>When I shave with my normal razors</li>
            <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t take the time to write a review of a razor, but in this case I couldn&#x27;t help myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the next step in shaving evolution will be as I feel this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money.</li>
            <li>this razor gives me and the extra cost is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t mind paying for something when it&#x27;s actually worth the extra money, and</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t mind paying for something when it&#x27;s actually worth the extra money, and</li>
            <li>I have the power one at work and the normal version at home.  </li>
            <li>To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days</li>
            <li>It did very well around the ankles, knees, behind the knees and under the arms it was nice and gentle.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the feel of the normal versions handle though, the power version is made of plastic and doesn&#x27;t feel as premium.  </li>
            <li>Overall, worth it.</li>
            <li>Normally I use an electric shaver, but when I received this one from Gillette, I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the only ones to get a good shave across those small pores.  </li>
            <li>I shave my entire head usually twice with the grain and twice or more against the grain using a moderate degree of pressure and I can truthfully say it leaves my head the smoothest of anything I ever tried.   </li>
            <li>For the longest time I simply used regular old Gillette Mach 3 disposables and bought some more every time I ran out.</li>
            <li>razor is worth the price and especially the cost of the blades.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it out, because it&#x27;s not normally something I would spend my money on.</li>
            <li>But these Fusion power blades turned out to be more than just a mechanized gimmick of the same old same old.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>So if you shelling out the money for manuals, just put in a few more bucks for the power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally as I tuck my son in to bed at night and kiss kim</li>
            <li>automatic shut-off feature is a nice touch, but not worth paying extra for.</li>
            <li>Since I work from home, I normally don&#x27;t shave until the evening before I go out.</li>
            <li>Recently, I was provided a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor System to use and review, complimentary of a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I did get this one complimentary, but I often buy a second system</li>
            <li>The wider handle and grips made my morning shave easier than normal.  </li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;ll have to wait a couple days or so between shaves or else</li>
            <li>For the price though, I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The handle is fatter the most razors which gives you a firm hold on the razor and makes it easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li>but, I would definitely tell you that it is worth the asking price.</li>
            <li>, Power Handle is slightly bigger and thicker than regular one and blue light looks cool when you turn the handle on.  </li>
            <li>My normal razor is the Schick Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li>My normal razor is an Edwin Jagger safety razor.</li>
            <li>This handle is a very quiet and powerful handle.</li>
            <li>As usual, Gillette&#x27;s blades are superior, and this one is no different.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t last overly long, but it&#x27;s way longer than most of its competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I feel like they really improved all the short comings of the first razor.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I use a Phillips Norelco SensoTouch 1160X electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I have a thick beard and could probably shave twice a day, but this left me smooth for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I think its pretty much the same shave.</li>
            <li>Normally I use an Electric Razor to shave.</li>
            <li>The vibration sort of acted like a massaging effect that reduced the irritation that is normally associated with shaving.  </li>
            <li>question really couldn&#x27;t be answered until my first actual shave with the razor.  </li>
            <li>buy a new one but try a high end blade razor until I make my electric choice.  </li>
            <li>Engineered to last less, engineered to make your facial hair grow back quicker, and engineered to cost more and make more money for Gilette, is really what the marketing campaign should be like.</li>
            <li>first think i noticed when turning on the new razor, is it has a higher frequency vibration than the old one, which is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li>I got back from a 3 day trip and the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor left my skin feeling super smooth without any nicks and cuts that I normally get from a regular razor.</li>
            <li>give you a much closer shave, with less irritation, with healthier skin from traditional shaving soaps, that smell better, at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>give you a much closer shave, with less irritation, with healthier skin from traditional shaving soaps, that smell better, at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>Mainly the reason for that is a still have a pack of twin blades for my old razor which work fine on my face, but are a tad rough on my head.</li>
            <li>I have needed a power handle that accurately shaves even if its wet and the side grips on this new power handle have done just that.  </li>
            <li>If I were starting out fresh and needed a new razor, perhaps this would be the product.</li>
            <li>were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).    </li>
            <li>With the generics, I would always have to go over my face at least twice (even with a new blade) to ensure a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this razor especially if you&#x27;ve been having trouble finding one that provides a clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates.</li>
            <li>The handle is big enough, easy to hold and maneuver.  </li>
            <li>When dry, it&#x27;s got a nice feel to it, but when it got wet, it lost all of it&#x27;s grip</li>
            <li>I have even been able to make the blade cartridges last up to 3 months by keeping it dry after using it and using shave gel instead of the foamy shave</li>
            <li>As with many manual razor blades you tend to look for the smoothest, closest shave with less irritation for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised that after two weeks using the Proglide that I have to say it does indeed provide a better shave than the previously mentioned model.</li>
            <li>It literally took me more than half the time to shave compared to my old one.</li>
            <li>The ProGlide Power handle provides a nice grip when shaving in wet and dry conditions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to grip and solid enough to give you that quality feel.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide because of the vibrating handle which is a huge plus for me due to my sensitive skin and it really makes shaving feel</li>
            <li>The rubberized handle is easy to hold in various positions to allow for an easy way to hold the handle when trying to reach those hard to reach parts of the face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and have endlessly been searching for a razor that will not only give me a nice close shave, but one that also won&#x27;t irritate my skin after shaving.</li>
            <li>Even with a new blade on a normal razor it does grab a bit.  </li>
            <li>The safety razor actually works better if you let your whiskers grow longer as since it&#x27;s single blade it never clogs.    </li>
            <li>Even when I was younger I have never been able to shave with a single blade razor.</li>
            <li>My big problem area is under my chin on my neck and right along the jawline.  </li>
            <li>The handle was very comfortable, and worked very well for getting at the hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>But that was really the only positive point that I found with this razor.</li>
            <li>Sure, it can make a shave more expensive in the long run, but it&#x27;s worth it (as far as I&#x27;m concerned).  </li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin and could not use an electric razor, so he wasn&#x27;t very keen on something that sounded suspiciously like it might be a hybrid of old and new.  </li>
            <li>The battery falls out when you open the package, so make sure not to loose it in the excitement.</li>
            <li>Although I did experice a little anxiety at first wondering if the extra power was going to end up with more nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the handle being really wide, it just didn&#x27;t feel very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>The pulsing, at first, was odd, but was quickly overlooked.  </li>
            <li>the past 6 years I&#x27;ve been using mainly the Gillette Custom Plus razor, and have been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this razor, right down to the packaging (the product popped right out, no fighting with the plastic).  </li>
            <li>It provides a smooth, close shave just like other razors of its class.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different razors including all the past versions of the Proglide and it provides one of the best close</li>
            <li>This razor gives an extremely close smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor from Gillette the other day for free to try and tell the world what I think.  </li>
            <li>I need a comfortable handle and a sharp blade.</li>
            <li>had thought the 5 thin blades were mostly marketing at work, but it&#x27;s pretty obviousnow that Gillette has really tried to make</li>
            <li>So I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide from a Gillette program the other day to try for free.</li>
            <li>I knew this was my new razor of choice.</li>
            <li>This new razor gives you the ease of using a blade shaver with the added benefit of enhanced experience of an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Press the razor into the new blade and it locks in</li>
            <li>I like the new grip too as it fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li>This was a totally new experience for me.  </li>
            <li>but that is something you do not have to worry about with the new ProGlide Power handle.</li>
            <li>You will see and feel the difference when you use the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor with the new handle.</li>
            <li>have been using Gillette razors for years, have upgraded each time a new one comes out and have to say</li>
            <li>Today we are going to talk about the new Gillette fusion proglide.</li>
            <li>It is now my new razor.</li>
            <li>Based on the hype, I decided to spring for the new Proglide.  </li>
            <li>In comparision the replacement baldes on the new proglide online range from about 3.50 to 4.00 before shipping per blade.</li>
            <li>I live in venezuela and here just arrive the Gillete Match3</li>
            <li>The Proglide will now be my new go to razor for the prework shave.  </li>
            <li>My  husband is resistant to trying anything new, so it took some nudging to get him to try this.  </li>
            <li>I just tried the new razor this morning.  </li>
            <li>Lots of razor burn and discomfort with that cream, even with a brand new blade (tried it for two days).  </li>
            <li>As for my existing fusion blades and the new proglide blades</li>
            <li>These new fangle-dangled battery-operated ones, however, are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The New Features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li>To sum up, pass on the powered version and go with the cheaper &#x27;manual&#x27; version and be prepared to pay a lot for new blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Schick Quattro for years, and figured it was time to get a new razor.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Over these 10 years I tried just about every new razor there was on my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the new \\&quot;microcombs\\&quot; inserted between the blades, maybe a thicker \\&quot;protection strip\\&quot; or maybe thinner blades.</li>
            <li>If i had to buy a new one i would</li>
            <li>I would say if it is a gimmick to sell a new product then I would say that it works</li>
            <li>No, it just means you should wait until you nned a new razor or until you see it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a new fan and dedicated user from now on.</li>
            <li>But the opportunity presented itself to try their new Fusion Pro Glide Power and everything</li>
            <li>I have watched plenty of commercials about the new razors</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wanting to see how the Gillette Fusion Proglide would perform on a longer, thicker bit of growth, I let myself go for a over a week and resisted the urge to use my new Proglide.  </li>
            <li>It seems like Gillette comes out with a new version every year or so, so</li>
            <li>When I used this new blade, I didn&#x27;t have any of those problems.  </li>
            <li>Just a new way to get us to pay more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the new proglide from Gillette  to try out and</li>
            <li>I need a new one.</li>
            <li>I shave in in the shower and with the new grips on the side</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s talk about my new Proglide Power Razor.  </li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to test the new Fusion Proglide Power Handle along with the Proglide Power Blade.</li>
            <li>One new concept came to the market that I didn&#x27;t understand or grasp.</li>
            <li>Now I think it is time to pack away he electric razor and start using this razor as my new razor.</li>
            <li>I bought new heads and my wife stole it</li>
            <li>I like the new handle</li>
            <li>with that said I wondered why it needed an upgrade with the new Power feature.</li>
            <li>I also got a really good shave in less time than other razors take.</li>
            <li>If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I&#x27;d go with this one.   </li>
            <li>Other than that, the new grip design is great, not super tacky, but still enough grip for decent control.</li>
            <li>The vibrator is very useful and its not overwhelming as it does not make your hand vibrate but only your razor, The vibrating transfers toward the razor giving you a smooth look.</li>
            <li>The reason my expectations were so high was because I enjoy all the other products that Gillette offers.</li>
            <li>Personally I did not see a huge difference in my shave as opposed to using a regular Gillette Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li>Being in the military, I am required to keep a clean shave on a day-to-day basis.</li>
            <li>Not at all - the handle is ergonomically designed to be bigger and have better grip, even when wet.  </li>
            <li>In just one swipe, the skin was left extremely smooth and didn&#x27;t require additional shaving over the same skin.  </li>
            <li>I felt as smooth a shave as if I were to use a more expensive electric</li>
            <li>I really like the shape of the handle as it made shaving different areas of my beard much easier and to my surprise the vibration did not make the razor jump and nick my skin.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this razor next time I need to do away with unwanted hair and be left with smooth supple skin.</li>
            <li>It fit snug, had tiny rubber grooves on the back that molded to my fingers, and wasn&#x27;t at all slippery.  </li>
            <li>things considered, this is really just an average handle that looks cool.  </li>
            <li>So it was much to my surprise when I tried the proglide only to discover that it was much, much smoother then fusion.</li>
            <li>This thing REALLY works, and works fast, and gives the ultimate cut while it&#x27;s at it!!!  </li>
            <li>And a puck of good quality shaving soap might cost $10 or less, and it will last you an entire year.  </li>
            <li>received the power version of this razor in a free trial offer and decided to give it a shot comparing it to the regular fusion proglide I use daily.  </li>
            <li>Wow, closest shave I have ever had and more importantly - no bleeding.  </li>
            <li>then earlier Gillette models, and really, not any better than some disposable blades.</li>
            <li>The power handle provided a much better shave for me without having to repeatedly drag blades across the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s early on in my shave process with this razor, but so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light, but weighted enough (with the battery installed) to feel solid in the hand.</li>
            <li>Even if you keep it dry, the vibration mechanism weakens fairly quickly regardless of what batteries you use.</li>
            <li>The handle is much better than pervious models and when used properly you will get a quality shave and when your hands are wet</li>
            <li>I recently got a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power shaver for free and figured I would see if an upgrade from my previous razor would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>I do not see any stubble until late , late in the day, and for a guy like me, that&#x27;s impressive.  </li>
            <li>It featured a larger set of grips to be able to keep the shaver from slipping during a shave.</li>
            <li>I sent it all back like new!!!</li>
            <li>The little vibrating action of the battery powered handle really made a huge difference in how easy it was to shave, and the razor glided right through thick stubble with no problem at all.  </li>
            <li>I figured to keep it simple: fresh blades in my current Fusion and in the Fusion Proglide, one for each cheek; four down strokes over gel shaving cream on the left cheek for the Fusion and four more on the right for the Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li>LED power button may be a little too bright for me in the morning (no bright lights, please), but it isn&#x27;t loud like my shaver, so no worries of waking the house accidentally with the buzz-saw sound of my shaver.</li>
            <li>Until I used them, I didnt think they would be any better than what I was currently using, but after having used a high quality five blade razor like this, I couldnt go back to the regular cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li>I did a side by side comparison of the old and the new by shaving one half of my face with the old version and the other side with the new version and for me, the old system gave me a smoother glide hence a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Definitely a high quality shave that far exceeds what you pay.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>that I have very sensitive skin and shave in the shower using shaving oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but did not have a problem with razor burn or cuts.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and is prone to cuts and breakouts.</li>
            <li>I was wary of using a battery operated razor at first, but found out that not only is it shower safe, but I actually enjoy the vibration while shaving my face.  </li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even when you get your hands wet and full of shaving cream, the new handle will not slip or slide.</li>
            <li>Upon using it the first time, I noticed how different it was with the new Power Handle.  </li>
            <li>Just got back from a trip with a 15 day old beard and it cut right through it without a problem.</li>
            <li>It was a little bigger than most razors and very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>To my surprise the new blade system feels the same as other multi-blade systems- until you press that magic button.</li>
            <li>recently received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;The new Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge is by far the closest and at the same time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very high quality and works very well, especially for pansy faces like mine (darn sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>When I was done, the was absolutely no irritation and my skin was so smooth, a better, closer shave than I have gotten previously with regular non-vibrating razors.  </li>
            <li>Even without shaving for 2 weeks I was able to shave quickly with a few strokes and my face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li>I have always liked a hand held razor, but never really loved them.</li>
            <li>This is no ordinary razor.  </li>
            <li>I definitely got a defective one but please be aware this may happen to you too.  </li>
            <li>Didnt believe the commercials at first especially the vibrating handle...</li>
            <li>With most other razors, I can only shave once every 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li>I am not completely sure if it has any effect on the quality of the shave, but I think it shaves better when the vibrating is enabled.  </li>
            <li>First I&#x27;ll note that I&#x27;m a female, and not the target audience for this item, so I handed it over to my boyfriend to do the testing.</li>
            <li>All of these are just lovely ways of saying - hey, we are not giving you a different colored fusion razor like the phenom or racecar or matrix of whatever they called the other Fusions.    </li>
            <li>Two weeks prior to purchasing the Proglide I purchase my first Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li>your facial hair doesn&#x27;t tug/ pull like so many other razors.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was about the exact same price as what I was paying for Mach 3 cartridges some 5 YEARS ago.</li>
            <li>He also loves the detailed cutter on the top of the blade to get precision cutting... comes in real handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most, I think razor companies have gone overboard adding blades, lubricated strips, hydro technology, and now power.</li>
            <li>I love the power and the blades with the extra blade compared to other razors.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>A bit surprised not to see even one spare razor though!</li>
            <li>This was exactly as advertised and definitely met my expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable but it really does help the blade slice through your hairs.</li>
            <li>But I also believe people shoudl try something first, as their faces and head will be different than mine.</li>
            <li>I tried every razor on the market starting with the Gillette sensor 2 blade when I first started shaving at around 14-15 years of age.</li>
            <li>I was proven wrong, the power handle was nice!</li>
            <li>i havent heard so many comments about how my shave looks smoother or how its lasting longer (due to closer shave)  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor delivered the smoothest shave I have ever had - not only on the first use but also after repeated uses.</li>
            <li>, I gave it a try and was I ever surprised!</li>
            <li>Had I not received it, I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it due to the upfront cost; but now, I do plan on purchasing the refill blades.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Gillette Mach III for over the past five years and have been satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li>Design is pretty in line with Gillette&#x27;s recent offerings and looks at home in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but is it that much better than the Mach 3 or other earlier versions?  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the shave after using the Schick Hydro for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels like my old razor with one exception, POWER!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a shavette for years, so when this promotion came up I wasn&#x27;t actually all that interested.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I thought at first it was the way I was shaving, but time after time I saw bumps on my face starting to form.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the blade was the overall presentation.</li>
            <li>And, just like every other Gillette razor I have used before, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>With this razor, I can use it several times and each time is just like the first in quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is my first time using a powered razor and it was definitely an experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the vibration wiggles those rascally whiskers out or what, but it is the most painless shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using the Gillette Fusion HydraGel), but this is the first time i&#x27;ve used one of the powered handles.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Gillette Fusion Regular (non power) razor handle for the last 3 years and was excited to try the Power Handle.  </li>
            <li>However I recently had the option to try this over the first generation one I had been using for years..</li>
            <li>I currently have a Personna Magnum 5 razor, and I&#x27;m pretty stocked up on blades from Costco.</li>
            <li>I do encourage others to try the product out for yourself since you have to feel it in action to truly understand how well it works!</li>
            <li>At first I thought the handle was a bit big.  </li>
            <li>I also love the small vibration that the handle provides.  </li>
            <li>I think the concept is most interesting, but I prefer a simple razor, and this is a bit too complicated,</li>
            <li>with the Fusion manual razor, I would still get some razor burn if I shaved two days in a row, but the Fusion Proglide Power razor gives an unbelievably close and enjoyable shave, even in that circumstance.  </li>
            <li>I kick on the power feature and the pulsing action does a great job of eliminating the last traces of stubble without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li>but they were equal in closeness at first.</li>
            <li>That is not usually the Fusion Proglide Power Razor but a sale or coupon</li>
            <li>For many years Gillette was above its competitor and I do remember only one razor in Schick&#x27;s line that I&#x27;ve used for some time before moving back to Gillette product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really thought that the vibrating feature would be more gimmicky, but it actually does lend itself to getting a close shave without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little on the high end of the price spectrum, but I received it for FREE via a program by Gillette, so</li>
            <li>At first glance, the razor looks to by typically made in the same high quality fashion that Gillette has made standard amongst most of their razors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note that I was using a new Gillete Fusion ProGlide blade on my previous razor as well</li>
            <li>The vibration seems to be a little too strong to my liking.</li>
            <li>It was my first battery-powered razor that I had ever experienced, so I was a little skeptical at first.</li>
            <li>For me it came down to two huge reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides having razor blades that cost a tenth as much as the Fusion cartridges, a classic styled Merkur safety razor is a solid, well-made tool.  </li>
            <li>These are good razor blades, but the cons seriously hamper their overall value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this one for free as part of a program run by Gillette and I was not let down.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, I don&#x27;t have to worry about hiding out due to blemishes, and I owe it to Gillette and their Fusion Proglide Power Handle!</li>
            <li>I even sat and compared it to my Mach 3 Turbo Power handle (which, even at 5 years old, still looks exactly the same as the new Mach 3 Power handles, so</li>
            <li>The electric is very smooth, especially in the shower with some shaving gel, but this razor beats it hands down, and with no nicks or irritation.</li>
            <li>At first the handle seemed a bit large but is to be expected since there is a AA battery in there.  </li>
            <li>On most of my face it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference but on my chin and upper lip where the hairs get really stiff</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the handle is larger than the razor I typically use (Mach3), but it is pretty light</li>
            <li>In the past I typically would use Gillette sensor or Mach 3 razors, but as a promotion Gillette was having, I was able to try this product for free which was an added bonus.</li>
            <li>Overall, the changes to the handle were slight, but left me with a very satisfied feeling over the improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use electric razors because i have extremely sensitive skin and razors irritate it very much.</li>
            <li>I have found that the extra blades actually leave me feeling more razor burn, and I keep facial hair (not a smooth shaver) and the size of the blade head is cumbersome while trying to shave in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>The blades cut close and provides a comfortable clean shave in less passes than other razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li>The size is good the normal size for a razor and not too bulky like other power razors I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>This little gripper definitely comes in handy while shaving and have shaving cream/gel/oil on your face so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand and cause you to cut yourself and of course it is a major plus if you shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>You also can use the old Fusion Power cartridges with the new handle.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating pulses in this new Gillette allow me to shave as close as the old style razor while still eliminating razor burn.</li>
            <li>My old one is now for work and this new one is for home.</li>
            <li>Gillette may have gained a new, young customer.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and no matter what I try (all those new razors with 5-6 blades, the lubricating strips, etc.)</li>
            <li>So far, after almost two weeks, the blade still feels almost new.</li>
            <li>, however, I am not 100% sure what is different between this new one than my previous power handle.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t go back to my older shaving tool; Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is supperior and top of it class, very confortable, excelent grip when hands wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a user of the Mach 3 for a long time, but gave this one a try recently after I had received it for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it is a Fusion razor with a blue LED light and some minor changes.  </li>
            <li>smooth shave did not last long as promised ....</li>
            <li>While it fits comfortable in my hand, these felt slightly off.</li>
            <li>The first few shaves are fine but the blade does not last and soon you can feel it dragging across your face.</li>
            <li>Less drag on my face and a clean shave with nothing left behind was a great way to start out the summer!</li>
            <li>not, then I would say that this is an opportune time for the competition like Wilkinson Sword to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Hopefully that will now change.ord to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever used a regular razor I realized that my skin was just too sensitive.</li>
            <li>The handle provides a gentle vibration that seems to reduce the irritation normally caused by shaving, and the replaceable battery is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li>For me, it was so uncomfortable that I couldnt wait for the shave to be done, instead of taking my time and enjoying my shaving time like a true gentleman.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle all the tugging I would get from my old razor.</li>
            <li>The handle is better than other Gillette handles as it is relatively light weight, but still heavy enough to feel well built.</li>
            <li>Being one with very coarse stubble, I can burn through blades pretty quickly, I&#x27;ve noticed that all though the refills cost about the same as my old SChick, they last longer, which is just an added bonus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very heavy, not conducive to a reverse-grip, and the \\&quot;precision trim\\&quot; blade on the back keeps catching on my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally, with my Mach3, the hairs would get stuck inside the blades and I have to make repeat strokes over the same areas, but with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I was able to still complete the shave in single, deep strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>([...]) has cryo-treated safety blades that last five times as long as regular safety blades, so you save even more money).&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Gillette razors but always thought the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; version were just a more expensive gimmick - I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect any significant difference, but after using it and then going back to other manual shavers, the difference is noticeable.</li>
            <li>It actually took me less time to shave with Fusion ProGlide than my Electric to get even better results than the electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer is the only part of it that is better than previous models.</li>
            <li>Despite the larger profile, it was easy to hold even when wet.</li>
            <li>All razors are more or less the same, right?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its comforatable enough and easy to hold without slipping.  </li>
            <li>other than a cool appearance the razor is just a down grade from the original fusion.</li>
            <li>They have five + one sharp blades that are easy to clean via simply tapping them and the stubble falls out from between the blades unlike with other blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I enjoyed shaving with the Power Fusion Proglide, I&#x27;m just not sure that extra blades and vibration are worth any extra money.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a razor through a Gillette program for free to try this sucker out</li>
            <li>Most razors dull after just 1-2 shaves, and even within the first shave will typically catch pretty</li>
            <li>It only took one stroke to remove all of the hair, and the added single blade on the back for trimming is a great little bonus.</li>
            <li>Back in the day I had one of the original vibrating razors and it was a bit odd to use, so I was skeptical - but the new blade configuration works great with the vibration.  </li>
            <li>Compared to disposable razors, this has a bigger handle with side grips that is easier for a man with large hands to hold on to.  </li>
            <li>It certainly was different then what I was used to in a shave - but</li>
            <li>I recently noticed that I would have to shave over certain areas about 5-10 times for it to do its job.</li>
            <li>and I would have to wait for the hair to grow back a certain length to wax again</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the head is a bit too large in my opinion, so when I was shaving my cheeks it was just a tad cumbersome.</li>
            <li>For me, the shaves have been much better with less irritaion, and so far the blades seem to last longer than the old version.</li>
            <li>The sensor 3 blade was a little closer and just as comfortable as the two blade.</li>
            <li>I received it from Gillette for free, and I was a little hesitant about the power feature.</li>
            <li>I let it glide smoothly over my scalp with just a little pressure and</li>
            <li>This may seem like a little unorthodox, but I primarily use a razor for my legs since I am a cyclist.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this new Fusion, since I have a Fusion already, and I gave it up for a safety razor with the old timey double edge blade, since that razor worked better than the Fusion did at giving me a comfortable</li>
            <li>To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the blade system was much more precise trimming around existing facial hair compared to other blades I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>The handle is thick and sturdy feeling; comfortable for a guy with large hands.</li>
            <li>Secondly, at the end of a week or so, the Gillette razor started to pull on my face a little more because the blades were dulling even with the micro pulsations.  </li>
            <li>I thought the original Fusion Power was a slight upgrade on the Mach 3, but the Fusion Proglide Power is miles ahead of both.</li>
            <li>I like that this handle is a little larger, which allows me to grip it a bit better.</li>
            <li>It did seem to shave a little better than my current razor.  </li>
            <li>That could be a result of years of use or the Fusion Power has that much more vibe, it&#x27;s hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The thing glides along the face, hardly feeling like it&#x27;s touching you until you realize the hair is gone.</li>
            <li>When I need to shut it off I would rather not have to fumble with two hands to get to the button and push hard, I would rather be able to do this with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the battery powered Fusion, but after not shaving for a week and a long weekend, I was ready to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>When I was in high school I tried to wet shave for the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer to Gillette Razors for as long as I have been shaving, pretty much beginning with the Mach 3 and continuing on as new products were released over the past couple of years.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference either way until I shaved those hard to smooth mutton chop areas.  </li>
            <li>Sure, the blades are a little more expensive, but what&#x27;s it worth to make a chore that men do daily</li>
            <li>The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the ProGlide was slightly easier to clean with the vibrating head.</li>
            <li>I got this to replace a couple year old Fusion handle that I had dropped at least three or seven times too many.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be clear</li>
            <li>The ProGlide handled this quite well, I presume the vibration helps the blades stay clear.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, a ton of thought and research went into designing this handle.</li>
            <li>To be clear, I was offered a Fusion ProGlide to test by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely coarse beard, and spent years searching for a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>But for me it is clear the micro-pulses/vibration that the razor has works wonders on getting a super-easy and close shave.</li>
            <li>The slight vibration that comes from the razor while shaving seems to make the razor move quicker and smother over my neck and face for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>This handle offers a very soothing and different shaving experience than just a stand alone razor.</li>
            <li>I received it free through a promotion and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I would encourage others with sensitive skin to use this product.</li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised to get the Fusion ProGlide and get to try it out.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it was.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is also not too heavy or light.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If price isn&#x27;t an issue and you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If price isn&#x27;t an issue and you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The ProGlide Power system really is a shave above the rest.</li>
            <li>It offers an inferior shave to the handle without power.  </li>
            <li>The power button was in a spot I could find and it was clearly marked.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I have found the handle design with its grip and vibrations to be a complement to the whole shaving experience.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised by the shave</li>
            <li>I would recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin as do</li>
            <li>The vibration action is a monumental help in getting hairs off the razor.  </li>
            <li>feel the one detraction from this razor is getting used to the vibration action.  </li>
            <li>In the last couple of days I really wanted to put it to the test</li>
            <li>Recently received a Proglide Power Razor via a program run by Gillete, and was absolutely amazed by the quality.</li>
            <li>How soft the handle is......which it is.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is WOW.  </li>
            <li>The unit is shorted out completely now.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Overall, it gave a very close shave.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely waterproof</li>
            <li>any sensitive skin/razor burn</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the guy with bumpy sensitive skin that razors never work well</li>
            <li>To start with I have extremely sensitive skin around my neck and shaving can be killer.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely hooked and will never go back to anything</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and there was no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>My only real hesitation with continuing using this razor</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I had none of that.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;power\\&quot; part of these handles is simply a vibrator that shakes vibrates the razor much like the vibration ring on your cell phone.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then this razor is for you.</li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin but with the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide you will have no worries.</li>
            <li>Being busy, i don&#x27;t take the time to shave every day.</li>
            <li>The Gillette fusion Proglide Power Razor is an updated version of their old fusion razors.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample to test via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li>I was surprised it didnt tug or nick</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>However, when traveling, it&#x27;s far easier to take the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor and use it.</li>
            <li>i think this razor was all looks no performance the old fusion</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a difference between the old Fusion and the Proglide Fusion.  </li>
            <li>Who would ever have thought a shaving system could have to near perfection</li>
            <li>This though isn&#x27;t completely one of them with the Gilette Fusion Proglide Power Razor.</li>
            <li>Simply put, safety razors and straight razors</li>
            <li>really - it does not last any longer than a twin blade!</li>
            <li>like the razor, but as soon as the vibrate gets turned on, it tears up my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>What I can say, is that somehow with all these \\&quot;innovations\\&quot;, they have managed to minorly improve an already stellar razor.  </li>
            <li>But is Gillette thinks they&#x27;ve gotten it complete figured out, they&#x27;ll stop trying.      </li>
            <li>The five blades makes for a really big shaving surface that I found I couldn&#x27;t really get to go where I wanted.</li>
            <li>The blade stabilizer and microcombs do appear to be a modest improvement in this regard.  </li>
            <li>JUST LOOKS PREMIUM AND MASCULINE.</li>
            <li>I have the power version and when you turn it on the whole razor buzzes and vibrates just enough that as your shaving</li>
            <li>4pack and nearly $7 cheaper than the Proglides.</li>
            <li>and I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li>The vibrations (really, they are tiny micro-vibrations)</li>
            <li>I would not be surprised if the razor by Gillette testing is an improvement.  </li>
            <li>My husband tried this razor, and at the end of the week we compared it to his old two-blade razor.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to use my old trusty Gillette Sensor 2-blade to finish the job.  </li>
            <li>This thing completely smooths my face out.</li>
            <li>They really are very different than anything I have seen before.  </li>
            <li>works about as well as my old gillette razor.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have an extremely sensitive skin and the thought of shaving gives me nightmares.</li>
            <li>(Try Alba Shave Foam or Aveeno Sensitive Skin brands) and this is heaven for your face.</li>
            <li>I would really like to try the razor that they use in the commercial that glides over</li>
            <li>it provides the closest shave you can possibly get without going into an \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; barber and getting a straight razor shave..</li>
            <li>Also, get rid of that crap-in-a-can gel or foam and get yourself some natural cream that you lather with a badger brush (Truefitt &amp; Hill, Proraso, etc)</li>
            <li>As far as this \\&quot;power\\&quot; part...</li>
            <li>He said it gives a much closer shave than regular razor.</li>
            <li>And last, you can get cuts much easier.  </li>
            <li>This one is not nearly as heavy as that old one.  </li>
            <li>and I hear a loud rattle.  </li>
            <li>find that the power vibrating head really does not improve my shave compared to standard units.</li>
            <li>He has extremely sensitive skin with tons of curly ingrown hair</li>
            <li>Then again I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.    </li>
            <li>So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I cannot tell a difference from the old Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li>and my sensitive skin has been deprived of</li>
            <li>Try using a Bic Sensitive razor or a bump fighter razor instead.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The addition of the vibration helps with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t believe how baby skin soft</li>
            <li>(Although, I believe you can use regular Fusion Proglide cartridges, although they aren&#x27;t much cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But overall, the power handle itself allows a much finer and closer cut.</li>
            <li>B00AFCPAAS Gillette Mach3 Sensitive Power 1 Razor 1 Cartridge 1 Battery]]</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades last me through a whole work week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When Gilette sent me a free Fusion Proglide Power Razor to try, I realized what I was missing.</li>
            <li>The vibrating action makes this shave</li>
            <li>I knew my old razors would cause while trying to get through that growth.  </li>
            <li>razor has a battery powered vibrating action activated by a power button.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor for three weeks now and have been pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>It appears that most of the negative issues that I had encountered on the Gillette Fusion Power have been addressed.</li>
            <li>It really was noticeably smoother than the shave I was getting with regular disposables.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the package and holding it in my hand, I felt like I was holding an old friend.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must say - I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no stranger to Gillette, but I had been using their old razor technology for some time (Mach 3).  </li>
            <li>I like to &amp;#34;hear&amp;#34; the razor as it runs across my beard the vibrator completely dampens this out.</li>
            <li>The design of the razor didn&#x27;t really alleviate a problem for me, it actually created a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a Fusion ProGlide Power razor to try via a program from Gillette and was pleasantly surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so anything I can use to reduce the sensitivity I&#x27;ll give a try.</li>
            <li>This helped my sensitive skin, since there was no grabbing.  </li>
            <li>The power action did help keep it from getting stuck on the stubble.</li>
            <li>Aside from the cooler blue-and-black color scheme and the light-up power button that lets you know when your AAA battery is about up, the ProGlide handle is really quite similar to the Fusion Power handle.</li>
            <li>I had a week old vacation beard when I decided to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.</li>
            <li>I wish I had discovered this a lot earlier in life because it would have saved me so much time, money, and pain.</li>
            <li>handle design is by far the coolest.  </li>
            <li>had I known how well it would compare to my old razor.  </li>
            <li>I currently use the mach 3 turbo razor and really wasn&#x27;t looking to change.  </li>
            <li>However, each of them has developed problems with the switch in that the razor turns on by itself and drains the battery.  </li>
            <li>The trim is handsome at least that&#x27;s what she says.</li>
            <li>so it follows the contours of your face really well without having to pull and stretch your face to get all those different curves.  </li>
            <li>It shaves extremely smoothly, so smooth that a few times I forgot to turn it on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old fashioned razor user and I knock my razor against the side of the sink to get the razor trimmings off the blades.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with sensitive skin on my face and</li>
            <li>It lets me have complete control on what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li>Again, so far no complaints.</li>
            <li>The handle is solid, the battery compartment seems really watertight and it appears durable.</li>
            <li>This is where the product really showed that it is different.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide was markedly smoother.  </li>
            <li>but I was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it did in fact make a difference in the smoothness of my shave.  </li>
            <li>The handle is much thicker than the standard disposable razor, which makes it easier to grip.  </li>
            <li>The handle also has a generous rubber grip around the handle and another rubber grip area near the razor itself where you can rest your thumb or index finger depending on how you are holding the handle.  </li>
            <li>my wife and 9 year old son would feel my face and tell me which side they thought was smoother.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>took out my old trusty and shaved.  </li>
            <li>Goodbye tradition and habit and hello young lover.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a few strokes to get comfortable with the feel of the razor</li>
            <li>This FAR out performs my setup.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about trying a power razor but thankfully I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin where it always feels like the hair on my face is being pulled out by the roots.</li>
            <li>Kept thinking - can a handle really be that big a deal?</li>
            <li>OVERALL - I really like the handle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problematic lowest part of the handle is also where the battery is loaded to allow for the Micropulse action.</li>
            <li>That was rightfully declared wishful thinking by the court, so I&#x27;m surprised to see products like this persisting in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Skin was soft with no cuts or nicks.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the powered version and the regular razor.  </li>
            <li>But.... how would my normally sensitive skin react to the close shave?  </li>
            <li>The pulses really seemed to help keep the razor moving in one fluid motion.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a very well designed</li>
            <li>vibrating action seems to help lift the stubble and make the razor go through the hair easier.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin where it always feels like the hair on my face is being pulled out by the roots.  </li>
            <li>The skin under my stubble is quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>It very well may be part gimmick, but it actually works well.</li>
            <li>Above all, I really appreciate the grip.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for individuals who shave every day and are looking for the complete shaving experience.</li>
            <li>As a user of the standard Gillette Fusion razors for years, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference between shaving with those and using the power version.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is i don&#x27;t believe the \\&quot;power\\&quot; part really does anything.  </li>
            <li>Call me old fashioned.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I am cursed with what I call \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit, I have been somewhat skeptical of the whole \\&quot;vibrating handle\\&quot; razor phenomenon, but when Gillette offered to let me try one for free, I thought that it was worth</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is how it was much lighter than my non-power razor.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor.</li>
            <li>(it is much larger than the Mach3), and it was very balanced.  </li>
            <li>The handle is much thicker than the standard disposable razor, which makes it easier to grip.</li>
            <li>The handle also has a generous rubber grip around the handle and another rubber grip area near the razor itself where you can rest your thumb or index finger depending on how you are holding the handle.</li>
            <li>But the ProGlide definitely makes life so much easier for me.</li>
            <li>In addition it&#x27;s also supposed to imitate what an electric shaver feels like against your face complete with the humming and noise.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t got any irritation so far</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin and lots of shaving products</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor has completely changed my morning routine.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I was a regular blade user it may have had more of an impression on me, but the vibrating thing just struck me as gimmicky.</li>
            <li>When Gillette introduced the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handles in the Fusion line a few years back I immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li>however, in all fairness I have discovered a 6 bladed razor that I have only found at Walgreens which shaves JUST AS GOOD as my Fusion--not to mention are cheaper (by at least $3 per refill), and would often stick with that in the last year</li>
            <li>The Blades seem to need more attention/cleaned multiple times during the shave when you skip a few days..</li>
            <li>I am now a convert, this is totally worth the extra money for the overall value in the product and the shave.  </li>
            <li>And the vibration seemed to make me go more slowly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this handle functions 100% and will give you a good shave, but it&#x27;s not because of the ergonomic grip and electronics.</li>
            <li>My old 2 blade Sensor does as good as the power glide so after I finish this expensive razors i purchased</li>
            <li>Although switching blades is normal maintenance that must be completed on a razor, this was a little premature for a blade to start dulling this quick.  </li>
            <li>I am going back to my old stand by !!!</li>
            <li>I will admit that I don&#x27;t grow anything thick in a day, so it wasn&#x27;t hard for it to give me an outstanding close shave with a  very clean and soft feel.(I</li>
            <li>I have so many random handles from defunct razors, or just ones that didn&#x27;t feel right.  </li>
            <li>blade pivots enough, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the right starting position</li>
            <li>These razors don&#x27;t last very long, and this is coming from someone who can&#x27;t grow a full beard.</li>
            <li>For the baby face like me who takes half a week to grow a 5 oclock shadow, the power option is pretty much</li>
            <li>I have tried alot of different Razor&#x27;s after using many I finally settled on \\&quot;\\&quot;Sensor 3\\&quot;\\&quot; as other razors do not suit me</li>
            <li>Ive always been a little sketchy about a vibrating razor on my face, but its WORTH it!</li>
            <li>attribute this little event to Gillette not caring for my original review here on Amazon (below)...</li>
            <li>(no more grizzly bear)! :)</li>
            <li>I mean, how much better could it be?  </li>
            <li>But this product gives such a smooth and clean shave that it makes the Mach 3 look like an extinct old generation product.</li>
            <li>The significance is that anyone with sensitive skin knows that running a razor blade over the same spot that&#x27;d been previously shaved over can easily irritate the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor gives an unbelievably close shave, and it is easy to handle, minimizing razor burn and cuts.</li>
            <li>Unlike other razors, it left my skin smooth and without being irritated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned one as I thought they were gimmicky, but it seriously helps make shaving more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The multiple thin blades and secure grips on the handle produce a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li>My face felt smooth hours later, unlike when I shave with some other, cheaper razors.</li>
            <li>The biggest plus for me is that the fit is different in my hand than other razors.</li>
            <li>This razor was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette and I must say that after trying this,I will never go back to any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a full beard and typically have no use for a razor and use a electric shaver just to trim.</li>
            <li>I have very thick/coarse facial hair, and this makes it difficult most times to shave consistently.  </li>
            <li>It provides a very close, smooth, irritation-free shave every time, and as long as you dry the blades regularly they shouldn&#x27;t dull too easily.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it provides a clean close shave as expected from a razor.  </li>
            <li>The button to turn on the vibration was easy to manipulate -- wet or dry.</li>
            <li>appears to do the job in the same way as old classic gillette mach 3 has been doing.</li>
            <li>I could even use it dry on my face for quick touch ups which I never could do with a regular disposable razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>At first I did not notice, but this thing can stand up right as well as flat down.</li>
            <li>The blades on the ProGlide are SUPER SHARP!  </li>
            <li>The large bulb at the bottom was kind of annoying to me and effects the overall aesthetics of the look of the handle, which overall is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Normally on the 3 day shave, I have significant regrowth by the end of the 2nd day but because of the closer shave from the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I didn&#x27;t notice the same level of regrowth until the middle of the 3rd day!</li>
            <li>Later with double blades I got \\&quot;passable\\&quot; results, but not s particularly close or easy shave.</li>
            <li>But other then that, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind</li>
            <li>But this razor works so well, and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with irritation, nicks or those unsavory missed spots that you sometimes notice half-way through your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades seemed to wear out faster than other razors I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s worth it to replace them for the comfort from this system.</li>
            <li>My beard is fairly course and it usually takes several passes to get an area closely shaved which in turn makes me press harder as well.  </li>
            <li>I have problems gripping things in my hand and most razors that I use the handle is small and thin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gone to buy new blades yet, but a quick Web search puts the prices in line with other blades of similar quality.</li>
            <li>About me: can&#x27;t grow a full beard, not very thick facial hair, used to shave once every 3-4 days, these razors have me shaving every other day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the shave better, in fact it may hurt it slightly, since the last thing you want when shaving is tiny rapid movement of the blades.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product is more or less same like its predecessor.</li>
            <li>I received the  Fusion ProGlide Power handle and blade as part of a free campaign run by Gillette and BzzAgent After using for about a week and a half, i&#x27;m definitely a fan of it so far.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that due to all the rubber on the handle, but it was more slippery than my other razor handle.  </li>
            <li>handle appears essentially the same as the older Fusion Power, so if you have an older working \\&quot;power\\&quot; handle the ProGlide Power blades are interchangeable.</li>
            <li>I got a decent shave and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>i switched for the fusion razor to a classic safety razor and will never go back</li>
            <li>The basic razor (and especially the starter kit) are not expensive, for what they are.</li>
            <li>I never had the same problems with the older version of Gillette&#x27;s Fusion.  </li>
            <li>Several times during the first shave the only way I could tell that I was shaving was to look in the mirror and see the shaving cream gone from the area I had just shaved.</li>
            <li>At first was skeptical of the vibrating shaver and still not quite sure of it&#x27;s contribution</li>
            <li>I like the extra blade feature and combined with some decent shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I have found that electric razors have not been able to provide a close enough shave for me and have been using the Gillette Mach3 for the past</li>
            <li>I was glad that it only needs one small battery for whenever I will need to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Oddly, I am not even shaving that area</li>
            <li>This was evident in many of the difficult areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only downside may be price in the long run but if you want a quality shave it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>just different, so I was a little more conscious of my morning shave, which has become second nature to me.  </li>
            <li>So finally i looked into single blade shaving and found mt edwin jagger DE89 and have been using a brush to lather my cream, the combination of the two produces an almost irritation free shave and is musch cheeper once you have the basic equipment.</li>
            <li>From what I have noticed having used it now for over 2 months (still on the first original blade, too) is that the Hydro blades stay sharper MUCH longer than ANY previous Gillette product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>have been happy in the past with other Gillette products that I use, and I would recommend this razor to friends who were curious in trying it.</li>
            <li>The handle itself, minus the power feature, is designed very very well.  </li>
            <li>The Fusion ProGlide appears to be a bit different visually, but I don&#x27;t really see much functional difference over the regular Fusion razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have the same issue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have the same issue.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment lock was a little tricky to figure out at first but is pretty simple and the button is a little tough, you really gotta give it a good push, but all in all</li>
            <li>There are no loose parts, it&#x27;s just a very solid feeling in the hand, like you&#x27;re using a very well crafted tool.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, it is starting to pull a little, but that is much more than I ever got out of a generic!  </li>
            <li>It feels as though there is less drag so shaving is faster and somewhat more effortless.</li>
            <li>but for wet electric shaving the exact right gel makes all the difference and other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I did not have high expectations when I first received the product but after using the razor for a few weeks I have completely made the switch to this product.</li>
            <li>Now for the razor blade itself, in the past I could only use a blade 3 or 4 times before I just had to get a new one, (which is another reason the big pack of disposables made the most sense).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these razor&#x27;s for yr&#x27;s, I love these razor&#x27;s &amp; will never buy anything else, the razor&#x27;s last a very long time &amp; usually don&#x27;t need to shave for 2 whole day&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Well luckily for this lonely razor sitting on my desk for a week i was scheduled for a minor surgery in a fairly sensitive area and was notified i had to be shaven completely with a razor.</li>
            <li>The only positive I can see from this product is the larger handle which helps with grip and handling.</li>
            <li>Its design is sleek and fits comfortably in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette was kind enough to send over this bad boy</li>
            <li>Usually with these disposable razors the weight and feel of the handle itself is a bit on the light side.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that the lubicating strip disappears long before the blades really need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>No more cheap razors for this guy.</li>
            <li>Like the previous series the handle is comfortable to hold and the vibration is noticeable but subtle and smooth - the razor doesn&#x27;t want to jump around while holding</li>
            <li>I usually use an electric razor, but after receiving a free ProGlide Power from Gillette I was sold after just a week of use.  </li>
            <li>Provides a smooth shave without the usual nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>I have used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle (that I received for free through a program run by Gillette) for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li>In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I&#x27;m considering doing the ol&#x27;-fashioned</li>
            <li>so I think in the long run you end up going through the Fusion ProGlide blades much quicker.  </li>
            <li>after 5 shaves it is no more smooth ...</li>
            <li>usually use a Gillette Mach 3 as my primary tool to shave.</li>
            <li>It was comfortable to use, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the vibrating part is for.</li>
            <li>The vibration feature I felt wasn&#x27;t as smooth as the Mach III that I usually use.</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed it left me with a much smoother face than my old razor.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and since I shave in the shower, I can attest to its waterproofness over the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strange thing to have on a straight edge razor like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I need to make several passes; but not with the Fusion ProGlide.</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t have to go over any spots on my face like I normally do with the non-powered version</li>
            <li>I normally use the regular Gillette Fusion razor weekly, so I thought why not try this one out.</li>
            <li>I consider myself an avid wet shaver.  </li>
            <li>Last but not least, just like its predecessor</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my Mach 3 Power for normal usage.</li>
            <li>I would like a normal non battery run handle with the same weight.</li>
            <li>you are a normal male, and part of the comfort of shaving is in the comfort of the handle, I would advise you not but the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power, you will regret shaving with this handle.</li>
            <li>Definitely not, or at least not at the current price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally shave with the buy in bulk razors from the local warehouse store.</li>
            <li>While one can use the front of the razor for straight cut areas like sideburns, the trimmer on the backside of the head does a better job at making a straight line and is easier to tell where you&#x27;re cutting.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the shave was very smooth, no nicks nor chafes which are so common with the traditional safety</li>
            <li>The handle is the same as the older Fusion Power with the only real difference being the color styling (blue instead of orange).</li>
            <li>Not a hard test, not enough for a review either</li>
            <li>I did not have to go over certain areas multiple times, like other straight razors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine on the sides and neck but just doesn&#x27;t seem to get very close and is also irritating.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using this product daily, it&#x27;s probably just fine, although the vibration with the battery seems gimmicky.</li>
            <li>close shave for men with fine to med thick beard or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There is also a single blade on the back side of the razor head to get right up under the nose.</li>
            <li>Considering how freakin&#x27; expensive Gillette products are, and especially how much more they charge for the Proglide than the Fusion, I&#x27;m sorry, but I would expect if the product cost 35% MORE, that the razor would actually perform 35% better, too.</li>
            <li>I tend to find razors with 5-blades overdoing it a little, but I&#x27;ve never gotten such a smooth shave with either disposables or women-specific razors, like the Venus.</li>
            <li>It was a little bit on the big side, but that makes sense because they need to fit the battery inside it.  </li>
            <li>I must admit that it turned out a little better than expected.</li>
            <li>I wish the colors popped a little bit more (although really, no one</li>
            <li>biggest problem I have had with razors in general is that they quickly become clogged, preventing the blades from cutting any more hair.  </li>
            <li>The handle is more bulky and a little harder to handle while shaving in the shower</li>
            <li>The &#x27;power&#x27; handle helps that process, allowing for a dull blade to easily cut through those whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i thought for sure since it was free it would be lame, but i was not lame in the least.  </li>
            <li>I ended up seeing a much better shave with less irritation than any of the other razors I tried.</li>
            <li>I ended up seeing a much better shave with less irritation than any of the other razors I ever used.</li>
            <li>In comparison the regular Fusion I previously used this is a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve had better shaves with other less costly razors.</li>
            <li>The other thing that I love about the razor is that I have cut myself using it less than any brand of razor than I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The results were much better than the other razors in this category I have previously used.</li>
            <li>I found it hard to believe that this razor could be better than my current razor</li>
            <li>On top of that, the precision trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge took care of the hard to shave area under my nose.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change would be to add different levels of vibrations so its not all one speed which appeared to be very high.</li>
            <li>I tend to shave every other day and the blade seemed to stand very well upon multiple uses for the whole week duration,</li>
            <li>I recently got a new schick power blade and after using for about a month I realized I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>As luck would have it, I caught a commercial announcing the new ProGlide was coming on June 6th.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m definitely keeping this one and buying new blades for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And if you have been using the Fusion, I would definitely recommend the upgrade to the new Fusion Proglide.  </li>
            <li>This new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle definitely makes all the difference in my shave.  </li>
            <li>this morning I had my second shave with the new razor.  </li>
            <li>From the disposable razor to multiple blades to ergonomic handles, there&#x27;s always something new in the Shaving aisle.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close enough shave when new, but the clogging was a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li>S&amp;S. i reach for my brand new weapon of scruff destruction and commence facial battle.</li>
            <li>unlike the Hydro I was using I could only get 3 shaves and needed new blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I typically have to shave everyday with other razors - I just can&#x27;t seem to find anything that could cut my stubble well enough to leave my face smooth for more than a day at a time.  </li>
            <li>the Power Blade turned on, the sound and feel of the vibrations masked the feel and sound of the blade cutting hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same blade for 5 shaves now, and it still is cutting great.  </li>
            <li>I really like the classic black color.</li>
            <li>The real test for me was a dry shave.  </li>
            <li>is a bit strange at first, but I&#x27;ve actually grown to like it now.</li>
            <li>Overall, my shave was smooth and I had few issues.</li>
            <li>that said, as much as I really wanted to like this, this razor receives only 2 stars from me for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>handle allowed me to shave slowly, and cleanly without having to go over the same area twice, which really helped me avoid</li>
            <li>My only issue is for me personally after going over my whole face and neck</li>
            <li>This maybe because I properly wash my face before I shave so my facial hair is all ready to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will keep testing back and forth with my old one, but this one looks like a winner so far.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s such a weirdly-shaped and sensitive area, I&#x27;ve never had completely, baby-smooth underarms before.</li>
            <li>You definitely pay for the upgrade - it is twice as much as the regular Mach 3 blade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have a boss that doesn&#x27;t say a word when I don&#x27;t shave for a few days at a time.  </li>
            <li>I was probably even more skeptical of the power handle than I was of the \\&quot;magical\\&quot; five-blade cartridges (but they won me over, too), so you can imagine my surprise when I discovered how much easier it was to shave with the power handle.  </li>
            <li>Yes blades can cost but really worth the money over the typical razor..</li>
            <li>my facial hair grows fast and sometimes I have to shave 2 x a day, if my facial hair grows a couple of days the blades snag on my hair.</li>
            <li>At first it was a bit strange that the entire razor was vibrating when powered on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and really didn&#x27;t feel like there was much of a difference with the shave.</li>
            <li>This feature is probably for the aforementioned \\&quot;burly\\&quot; men above who grow whole fields of hair on their face every day.</li>
            <li>Since the shave is so comfortable, I am finding that I am currently shaving everyday so this is not a problem.</li>
            <li>i will likely continue my use of this weapon here and now, or in a galaxy far far away.</li>
            <li>But here Gillette has us over the barrel and is literally forcing everyone to pay a premium for what many of us do not believe is any better (in fact - annoyingly worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Overall, a good razor at an expensive price.</li>
            <li>was a little timid at first since it was battery powered and vibrated on my skin, but I did not have any trouble with it shaving close and giving me a smooth face.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have realized I can usually only shave with razors that have two blades.</li>
            <li>grip is very soft and grippy, so I am not losing my grip on the razor in the middle of shaving.</li>
            <li>; we will continue to purchase Gillette&#x27;s fusion line regularly due to its effectiveness (blades stayed relatively sharp for a good time in comparison to other products &amp; possible second-hand Gillette products); thank you!</li>
            <li>The handle was comfortable as long as the price came down I would buy it.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>To test the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, I put a new blade in each of the two razors and proceeded to shave the left half of my face with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and the right side with the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test platform</li>
            <li>As a dad constantly on the go, it takes up very little counter space and it is easy to take on the go.  </li>
            <li>The major change in design this make is the micropulse vibrations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was one major difference however.  </li>
            <li>The power feature of this razor is a major downgrade.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Gillette brand of razors in the past and was really excited to try this one out.</li>
            <li>With the cost of blades that is definitely a major drawback.</li>
            <li>There is no other way to shave,</li>
            <li>First I tried shaving without turning on the power and the razor felt sharp.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anything would persuade him to going back to his old razors, and in fact, he did throw them out!  </li>
            <li>Major BS here by Gillette.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no math major, but I think that&#x27;s a savings of about $182.&lt;br</li>
            <li>had sampled the Gillette Fusion Power when it first released and was extremely dissatisfied with the experience, so I returned to my Mach3.</li>
            <li>This was the price I found at a major chain that carries the fusion refills.</li>
            <li>I received this to try out via a Gillette program and won&#x27;t go back to my old handle!</li>
            <li>It fits the hand like no other.</li>
            <li>Weighing the alternative of just throwing the razor in a shaving bag, I feel this provides a little more protection from the blade snapping off or any other issues</li>
            <li>My face actually felt as if I was again 12 years old and never had the need to shave!</li>
            <li>I only used hot water to prepare my face, so I can only imagine it being even easier with some regular preparation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it took a few strokes to realize that I really had to shave exactly the same as I would without the power model.</li>
            <li>I felt like it cut better and easier, and I didn&#x27;t have as much difficulty at the usual trouble areas.</li>
            <li>So far I have not had any nicks or cuts, and I glide right around uneven surfaces, even my chin.</li>
            <li>I especially like the design of the power handle, the grips make it easy to shave in the shower, no more dropping the razor.</li>
            <li>I typically wear a full beard but use the razor to shave my neck and face above the beard.</li>
            <li>right at first but goes dull immediately so until they come out with an american blade for this</li>
            <li>Definitely would look to purchase this handle in the future as long as the price was right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, a few notes on the packaging - the back of the package is perforated, so it tears open easily -</li>
            <li>Due to a significant recent career change, I&#x27;ve since had impetus to reevaluate my shaving method, for purposes of professional and personal travel both domestically and internationally.</li>
            <li>I was concerned, but again very positive impressions after a few days of shaving regularly with the new Gillette Fusion Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to dig in a little too much because I want my shave as smooth as possible, and with other razors I end up with some scrapes here and there.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that the very thin and flexible blades, along with whatever technology they use to sharpen the things, is the key here.</li>
            <li>so I need to be certain that the razor I choose won&#x27;t slip out of my hand while wet.  </li>
            <li>I have absolutely no idea how the vibration is supposed to help - it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>definitely got a better shave with this razor, although it&#x27;s hard to say how much of it was due to the pulsating handle and</li>
            <li>I have had issues with many razors in the past due to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The replacement blade cartridges can be a little pricey, but they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>The flexibility that it provides is very useful in terms of being able to get odd or uncomfortable areas when shaving, like parts of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>My beard is tough and it really dulls the blades on other razors but so far this razor has surpassed all the others.&lt;br /&gt;The single blade trimmer that is on the back of the blades is great for shaving right under my nose where I can&#x27;t get with the regular set of blades.</li>
            <li>Many of the features of this razor are slight refinements of previous designs.</li>
            <li>recommend this razor to anyone looking for a clean wet shave that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin bumpy and rough.</li>
            <li>In addition, clean up only took a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I only shave a few days a week, considering that it is not a requirement with my line of work that I be clean shaven.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the blade and design was a bit different, indicating probably why my shave was so different from an older model fusion blade.</li>
            <li>Tough too complain about this since I like the blade vibration on my face way more than I dislike the handle vibration.  </li>
            <li>While this made shaving my neck and most of my face quicker and easier, the larger head made shaving more \\&quot;precision\\&quot; areas like my upper lip and chin a little difficult as I felt like the razor was not able to contour easily to the chin fold or part of the upper lip just below the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The vibration will give you a smoother closer shave and your girlfriend will love it, your closer shave I mean, plus it&#x27;s waterproof!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a beard/mustache, and do some precision shaving, and the vibration seems to dull the feel I use to get an accurate line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could not, for the life of me, get the bottoms of my sideburns to look clean, and it actually nicked a small cut on the underside of my earlobe as I was shaving near it.  </li>
            <li>The light vibration means you don&#x27;t have to press as hard in those areas which avoids nicks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use cheap disposable razors, they are dull after one shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe a handle this grippy and comfortable is hiding a battery compartment.</li>
            <li>The light vibration means you don&#x27;t have to press as hard in those areas which avoids nicks.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to the individual with limitied to medium thickness of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>and I know such an organization would only produce high quality products</li>
            <li>The overall awesomeness of this combination has convinced me to come back to Gillette, even with the high pricing of the blades.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend; my only issue is the high cost of the refills.</li>
            <li>The original blades would last at least a month, but not so with this new blade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using these until the razors I currently have go dull (luckily that will take a while) and downgrade to the original Gillette Fusion Blades unless the price of refills goes down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I shave dry and these are much faster and much smoother than other razors</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked the shave that I was able to get with the handle, but I felt it was a little too annoying to use to really justify the closeness.  </li>
            <li>Due to the fact that I use this in the shower for my daily shave, I was hopeful that the razor would perform better than the previous version I had tried.</li>
            <li>It seems that in any situation where it might start catching(getting dull), this might help the blades last a bit longer, as it&#x27;ll be moving more to cut through the hair, without actually pulling.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor and the price isn&#x27;t all that bad.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s a failed attempt at what could be really amazing technology.</li>
            <li>I have used a variety of shaving systems, but generally prefer Gillette.</li>
            <li>Turns out its the best solution so far to the pain I commonly have during cutting.  </li>
            <li>Not a bit of drag or irritation was experienced, so I let my beard grow for a week, thinking that this time it would fail the standard it now set.</li>
            <li>Just generally another marketing scheme I thought...   </li>
            <li>In general I still prefer an electric.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70yrs old and have been using an electric razor as long as I can remember because I have sensitive skin and get razor burn, I do, however, feel the shave of an electric razor isn&#x27;t as close as manual.</li>
            <li>Even with wet hands your grip never slips and it does not seem too small like so many disposables do.</li>
            <li>First off, normally a disposable razor would usually take me around 8 min even in the shower.</li>
            <li>My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power.</li>
            <li>After receiving the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor thru a free Gillette offer, I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li>power function seemed to help with the shave and really helped cleaning the blades out&lt;br /&gt;Blades seemed to last a long time without dulling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was no drag or chaffing of my skin or hair, and</li>
            <li>I recently tried out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle razor and was pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li>There is no drag on any part of my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different multiple blade razors and electric shavers in the past, but have been exclusively using the Schick Quattro for the last 5 or 6 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Blades and lubricating strip do not last nearly as the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Changing the blades couldn&#x27;t be easier, just press the button on the back and the old blade pops off.</li>
            <li>Working at a corporate office, being in front of senior leadership, and trying to look as professional as I can at all times.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the battery compartment is water-tight, because I haven&#x27;t had any problems with using the razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>So, far I have used this same blade for almost a month and</li>
            <li>you are someone with sensitive skin, this will probably help as it only takes one pass to get a close shave!</li>
            <li>And I have been using this razor with the same blade in now for 3 weeks, and I still did not get razor burn with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>thought the blades were pretty average.</li>
            <li>I am used to nicking myself several times with my old razor.  </li>
            <li>my neck like the old Fushion would occasionally did.</li>
            <li>I believe this is because the hairs were too short but that may be something with me, sensitive skin or something</li>
            <li>I personally have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Applied Gillette Fusion shaving cream and tested it next to my old Fusion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the (old) Fusion to shave my head for several years now.  </li>
            <li>The only negative impressions I had were figuring out how to load the battery in the handle and the cost of replacement blades which are quite a bit more than standard disposable razor blades.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised how well it actually reduced shaving irritation alongside this razor.</li>
            <li>I always went back to my Mach 3, then Fusion and was pleasantly surprised to see that the Fusion was being re-tooled to be even</li>
            <li>through the amazon Vine program I received a Schick Hydro 5 razor back in early August.</li>
            <li>So far, after weeks of daily usage, I have not had a blade-change yet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my  old razor.</li>
            <li>They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s back to his old two-blade.</li>
            <li>then I bought a ProGlide Power Razor about 2 weeks before it was actually released and all I can say is WOW...</li>
            <li>This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face, nick or cut you in any way...</li>
            <li>only one complain is i deleted my old addresses before ordering this</li>
            <li>I am 67 years young and for the last 20 or so have been an electric shave user.</li>
            <li>I thought the vibration may be preventing the razor from having too much sustained pressure on the skin, although I don&#x27;t generally use much pressure when using razors in general, so I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin, using a regular razor can be a daunting task.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that that the button lights up, rather than the old style, will burn up the battery faster.</li>
            <li>Not much pressure is needed for a very close shave with no nicks or burn.  </li>
            <li>I could barely feel it shaving my face.  </li>
            <li>The smoothness of each stroke made me feel as if I was not shaving at all because I could barely feel the razor on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to my old Schick Quattro.</li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, make the switch and save a lot of money.</li>
            <li>This blade system has completely redefined the art of shaving and is the only reason why I&#x27;m not an electric razor user anymore.</li>
            <li>I can grasp it between my thumb and a finger and feel like I have the ultimate control for those sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>The mineral oil from the lubristrips also left my skin feeling soft and irritation-free.</li>
            <li>I would never go back to my old razors; and, trust me, I&#x27;ve experimented with all kinds.</li>
            <li>Unlike my old razor, the ProGlide massages my face such that I don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m shaving.  </li>
            <li>The multiple blades and vibration lift the hairs prior to trimming, resulting in a much closer shave than obtained using the regular model.  </li>
            <li>and I mus say that it is a vast improvement over my old Gillette Fusion handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>and I barely notice that it vibrates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the shave I received from the razor it seemed to be the same if I had the vibrating on or off.</li>
            <li>This handle works very well, but the vibration is stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I usually only shave once a week, as my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>the Gillette Fusion Power Razor has nearly an identical handle and weight (although the Fusion ProGlide has slightly larger rubber grips).</li>
            <li>The gentle vibration and micropulses definitely added to the overall closeness and smoothness of my daily shave.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the handle and how it didn&#x27;t slip out of my hand in the shower while my hands were wet.</li>
            <li>No slipping, no sliding, even with water and shaving cream on the handle.  </li>
            <li>I ditched my old brand because this razor simply works.  </li>
            <li>Definitely for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this Pro Glide Power Razor, even for guys, who, like me still use the old fashion safety razor.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shave with the Power model.</li>
            <li>This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face, nick or cut you in any way...</li>
            <li>I turned on the power a few times and first of all it did not feel natural to me</li>
            <li>Well, after only using the Gillette disposables for all those years, the Walmart blades were pretty bad(cuts, rough, etc.).  </li>
            <li>At first I was not sure if I would like this razor as the handle is a bit fatter then the normal non battery operated Gillette razor.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>The handle took 2-3 uses to get fully used to, but it&#x27;s possible I may never go back to a normal razor again.  </li>
            <li>I shaved off about a weeks worth of growth in a few passes, used the same old shave gel I always use, and viola, NO CUTS,</li>
            <li>The power handle makes it tougher to maneuver and tugs your hair more, irritating your skin.  </li>
            <li>so it was kind of uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>The razor was sent to me by a program run by Gillette, I would have been kind of skeptical in buying a \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot;, a vibrating razor</li>
            <li>Gillette is on top of the razor game.</li>
            <li>My hair was thin on top</li>
            <li>The vibrations annoyed me more than anything</li>
            <li>I had experience with this product before and did not find it any better or worse than it&#x27;s name brand competitors.</li>
            <li>They even have rubber grip at the very bottom of the handle where batteries go, great for the last pinky finger as it curls the base.  </li>
            <li>After using this razor for the past few weeks, I can honestly say that I like it a lot and will continue to use</li>
            <li>The accompanying literature says that the built-in \\&quot;guide comb\\&quot; directs hairs into the blades, at the \\&quot;optimum angle\\&quot; for cutting.</li>
            <li>The idea of a battery-powered manual razor seemed kind of silly.</li>
            <li>I really like the new handle, its a little thicker and</li>
            <li>The precision edging blade is a really nice bonus for getting those extremely difficult little areas like right under the nose and for edging the sideburn area nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I quickly and almost effortlessly received an extremely close shave (MUCH closer than my typical recent</li>
            <li>I will admit that I don&#x27;t grow super thick facial hair, and that may be a factor for some people, but if you have normal facial hair growth, and sensitive skin, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li>When it came down to my first shave, the Proglide seemed to get deeper on hairs</li>
            <li>First, the handle has slimmed down from what it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, I have less irritation after using this razor than the usual which is nice.</li>
            <li>It seems like we are constantly seeing ads for &#x27;new&#x27; razors with an extra blade, closer shave, etc.  </li>
            <li>I got my brand new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power in the mail a few days ago thanks to a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>With this new razor not only does it work for my face but also for my head which i shave almost daily.</li>
            <li>These new ones now come in blue and chrome whereas the ones from last year came in gold.</li>
            <li>I just bought a new one in blue assuming it would be made in France just as my gold one I got last year was.</li>
            <li>One benefit in having a beard is that the blades last a very long time because I don&#x27;t have much to shave each day.  </li>
            <li>One of the big stand outs is the handle not only is it easy to hold but it has a vibrating function that makes for less tug when shaving (I have very coarse facial</li>
            <li>typically use an electric razor because of sensitivity, but the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER CARTRIDGE provided me with a smooth and long-lasting shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take me any longer than using the electric shaver, and the skin irritation was far less and the shave much closer.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t mean to sound like a salesman here, but I do have another suggestion.</li>
            <li>but a few days after it just felt like a much more even and lasting feel of the shave compared to other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I usually purchase a large package of shick and sometimes gillette disposable razors due to how quick the blades go out.</li>
            <li>I have a \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; face; my facial hair naturally grows both thick and in multiple directions and tends to grow thick along my neck, yet my skin is sensitive, making a rotary shaver a good option.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I went a little slower than usual, but I expect that I&#x27;ll get back to my normal speed once I&#x27;m more used to the pulse</li>
            <li>After a half dozen shaves, the conclusion was that the Gillette gave a slightly better shave, but it was close enough that if I had not shaven half of my face with each razor, no one could have noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>is a bit odd at first</li>
            <li>Definitely less irritation today than with my first shave with the blade yesterday.</li>
            <li>and I noticed less \\&quot;breakout\\&quot; around my neck within the first week.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s JUST about time to change, but I could still probably handle another shave or two with no less comfort than I had with the regular Fusion Power blades.</li>
            <li>I found it much better than of the other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Having been using a regular Gillette razor for as long as I can remember I was a little hesitant when I got this one for free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I have used many types of shaving creams with the Proglide razor like Nivea for Sensitive Skin, various types of Edge gell, Aveeno, Aloe Vera Gel, Shaving Secret oil, hair conditioner, bottled shampoo, moisturizers, shaving mug soap with brush and even dial bath soap brushed into a lather with my shaving brush.</li>
            <li>It normally took be 15 minutes to shave with a single razor.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this certainly gave me a close shave and minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>blades themselves are great, but the vibrating handle made me a little skeptical if this was a gimmick-product.</li>
            <li>and it shows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get razor burns with cheaper razors due to all the pulling and tugging, but thanks to the ProGlide</li>
            <li>Gillette provided one as part of a test program, and, having used other Gillette products I was very hopeful that it would perform well.</li>
            <li>Its just like its other non powered version (as the power feature doesn&#x27;t really change my shave).</li>
            <li>This product dwarfs any other straight razor I have used.</li>
            <li>the handle itself, it grips well, but feels beefy after using other disposable handles for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>Issard straight blade with a careful four pass 15 minute shaving, but who has time for that!  </li>
            <li>The Fusion has put all other over the counter modern safety razors to shame.  </li>
            <li>(I had a credit) and shaved a 4 day old beard this evening in nothing flat.  </li>
            <li>Other razors cut reasonably close, the using the Fusion there are times when I can run my hand across my face and not detect even the tiniest bit of beard.  </li>
            <li>The handle is much easier to grip than other razors in this category.</li>
            <li>It cuts really close, closer than any other razor I have used including my $250 electric razor.</li>
            <li>how much was due to the blade.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t grow facial hair that fast, so it takes me a long time to get through a razor (I only shave 2-3 times a week since I have the gift of a baby face).</li>
            <li>I find that this blade lasts me much longer than other brands.  </li>
            <li>However, I find that the refills last much, much longer than the refills of other brands and in the long run it at least compatible if not even more economic that the other leading brands.  </li>
            <li>or so when money has been tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally saved up and purchased a Proglide razor recently and found the shave to be pretty much as expected.</li>
            <li>Its a good shave but blade does not last long for me making it too expensive to continue with.  </li>
            <li>So I put a new blade on my old razor and shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion.</li>
            <li>So I put a new blade on my old razor and shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>The blades do not last very long and are expensive to replace but that is a minor inconvenience for the great results that the product provides.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to maneuver big enough to hold small enough for comfort.</li>
            <li>This helps both in controlling the blade in your hand and also makes it feel less cheap than other blades.  </li>
            <li>The vibration is strong but not overpowering and the handle is thick enough that it&#x27;s not hard to keep a grip on with wet hands.</li>
            <li>They all recommend a safety razor - but you have to be very careful and it takes much longer.</li>
            <li>The subtle vibration makes the shave smooth and close.  </li>
            <li>I got this product for free from Gillette, and I was skeptical because I use a 3 blades, and I&#x27;m very picky about what razor I use.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is too light in my hand, even with the battery for the for the buzzer installed.  </li>
            <li>This one gives me such a smooth shave that I can keep stubble at bay for at least a day.</li>
            <li>It is substantial and solid, not like the cheap blades that are so common.</li>
            <li>When gripped by the black rubber portion that circles around the top, sides and back just below the neck of the razor, the razor fits firmly in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But there are moments, meetings, social events, and my wife&#x27;s request for a closer shave that no electric razor can accomplish.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handles I definitely recommend this version - especially guys with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin and refuse to shave daily, even though I have fast-growing facial</li>
            <li>As far as I know, the micro-comb is the only thing that is different between the power and manual blades, which makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I picked this razor up last week and noticed a big difference in the closeness of the shave and the smoothness of my skin vs. my old razors.</li>
            <li>I would constantly get razor burn and bumps with my old Mach 3, but there was nary a red spot to be seen or felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The grooves within it allow for a more natural and less forced grip on the razor.</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower, so having a a razor I can keep a steady grip on even when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li>Naturally, with a battery, there&#x27;s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.The downside, you might expect, is that the blades are about twice as expensive as the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Since my old razor never bothered me, I won&#x27;t be switching to these more expensive blades.</li>
            <li>With the power on though, I did not experience the same irritation that I have in the past when using full electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>were fixin&#x27; something that ain&#x27;t broken actually made it better.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I see no reason to switch from my old Fusion to newer and more expensive cartridges.</li>
            <li>For a heavy bearded person who shaves every day (or twice a day?), this will probably be worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Since my old razor never bothered me, I won&#x27;t be switching to these more expensive blades.  </li>
            <li>Frequent razor replacement in addition to the cost of a better quality shave cream is ridiculously expensive.  </li>
            <li>The handle feels nice in the hand, and the vibrating action - when turned on - doesn&#x27;t feel awkward.</li>
            <li>Normally those are areas where even new blades catch a bit and things get a little sketchy but this one went through without a hitch.</li>
            <li>However, other areas that were not as thick felt a very smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used other Gillette products in the recent past and was always pleased</li>
            <li>a little stubble.&lt;br /&gt;The proglide does a close shave with little to no pressure on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The real issue is: is it really worth $34 for 8 replacement blades where the hydro has 8 for just under $</li>
            <li>Starting out, this looks just like an ordinary manual razor with a swappable razor blade like so many other razors out there.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the handle looked to be a little bulky and going to an issue.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see any major difference in the final result</li>
            <li>I like that you can use it in or out of the shower even though I was a little unsure about this at first.  </li>
            <li>I tried other brands in the past and did not like them, so I am a firm believer that Gillette makes a good product.  </li>
            <li>It provides an experience which is second to no other product out there.</li>
            <li>Extremely close shave, even closer than normal!  </li>
            <li>Its slightly thick for my taste makes it a lil hard to shave of certain areas in my neck, although together with the razor it creates an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>There was less irritation, and the shave was closer than with the Mach 3 (whether this is from the handle or the increased blades, I can&#x27;t be positive).  </li>
            <li>The blades were much sharper than the regular Fusion blades and gave him a very smooth shave without cutting himself at all.  </li>
            <li>The blades are much sharper than the regular Fusion blades and give me a very smooth shave without cutting myself at all.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be a little bit on the sensitive side, and I also tend to get as much use out of my blades as possible, given the price of replacements.</li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin and it has been tough to find a razor that can give me a great shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, there are some ridges on the bottom that improve how well I can grip a wet handle, but the ridges still feel odd in my hand even after a full month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using it and it is well worth the small money spent upfront.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive the trial as I&#x27;m cheap when it comes to buying razors and go for the less expensive ones at Target.</li>
            <li>The blade sharpness seems to last about the same as other blades and it is evident from the razor drag when it is time to change to a new blade.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive thin skin and black course hair on my chin yet more soft hair on the sides.  </li>
            <li>Also in my experience, the cartridges are interchangeable between the different Gillette Fusion handles, so unless yours has broken or is very old I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this one expecting a significant upgrade.</li>
            <li>handle was comfortable to hold, when it wasn&#x27;t vibrating, otherwise the vibration went all the way down your hand, which made it feel less</li>
            <li>Because it takes fewer strokes and glides over my facial hair easily, I feel the process of shaving with this razor takes up less time than with my previous razors.</li>
            <li>Even though they are expensive and have a few cons, the resulting super-close shave is worth putting up with it, and I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet (</li>
            <li>I have to say that I generally use inexpensive store brand razors from one of the big box stores.  </li>
            <li>should also say that I generally use an electric razor during the week, and then use a traditional razor on Sundays after I&#x27;ve skipped shaving all weekend.  </li>
            <li>The lines on the razor are too straight, and the whole time while shaving it is noticable how uncomfortable of a handle it really is.</li>
            <li>I love the Fusion line &amp; will continue to purchase whatever is the least expensive Fusion available.  </li>
            <li>And when I factor in that the much cheaper Mach 3 shaves essentially as close as the other</li>
            <li>Being a regular Fusion user, I did not honestly see how a powered version of this device could make any significant difference.  </li>
            <li>It is a larger handle due to the battery inside, but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>In fact even when the blades are dull, I have kept it in my shower just to clean up my face after using a different razor my wife bought me.  </li>
            <li>I am a 33 year old life long electric razor user.  </li>
            <li>I cannot talk about length of use of the blades since I have only used it for a few days, but so far I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to me at least, the shave this gives my fairly sensitive skin and course beard definitely makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li>to me at least, the shave this gives my fairly sensitive skin and course beard definitely makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be about the same as a normal Gillette razor, but it really glides over your face 10x easier than any of their other razors.</li>
            <li>first I don&#x27;t care for the waste of a battery operated razor.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you need that feel when you&#x27;re hunting for a few whiskers that escaped the first one or two passes.  </li>
            <li>my skin is ridiculously sensitive and these razors are smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind; no breakouts or red itchy bumps on my neck afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft and smooth, with no stubble left behind.</li>
            <li>Normally use a Bic disposable and never really feel I get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Usually buying a razor is one of my least favorite things to do, but not any longer!</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to shave even thick and hard beard, without any irritation.</li>
            <li>After 2 shaves, you&#x27;re paying 3 or 4 times for a shave that&#x27;s less close AND less smooth.</li>
            <li>My facial hair is very bristly and thick and the I felt like the vibration or the 4 blades made the facial shave less comfortable.</li>
            <li>It cuts down on the &#x27;pulling&#x27; of longer hairs and items that much closer on the day to day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first started shaving, I was a little taken back from the vibrations.  </li>
            <li>handle is fancy with lots of features, but its a little bit of an overkill unless you grow a lot of facial hair or if you are shaving for the first time after a week.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a little hesitant about my razor actually vibrating on my face.</li>
            <li>This has been a problem for me when I&#x27;ve used other razors, which is one of the main reasons why I switched to an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been looking for a better shave lately and decided over the last four months to switch over to wet shaving with a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>I thought the feeling would pass after my first shave, but the handle just plain looks</li>
            <li>My first instinct was that vibrating a razor at my thoat was a bad idea, but it turns out that I didn&#x27;t get any more nicks or cuts with the Gillette than I did with the Schick.  </li>
            <li>Without hesitation I can say the Fusion was a much smoother and less iritating shave.</li>
            <li>Without hesitation I can say the Fusion was a much smoother and less iritating shave.  </li>
            <li>It is much wider than the typical razor and has ergonomic side grips.  </li>
            <li>After just one use I immediate realized that I was getting a much closer shave than my previous razor.</li>
            <li>only concern is the higher cost per shave that I envision, since the Pro Glide Power Blades are so much more expensive than my previous Track II blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>There appeared to be less drag, and I was able to shave quicker because I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the area again-which meant less irritation.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of shaves I actually had trouble keeping a grip of the razor.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, I am giving the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor three stars because it did do pretty well over the period of a week, but it did fall short in a few areas.  </li>
            <li>It did give a nice clean shave, but the vibration annoyed me and made it difficult to stay on track.</li>
            <li>It provided an effortless shave and left no irritation that I would usually get from the collars of my shirts after a fresh shave.  </li>
            <li>Most of the razor handles are small and narrow.  </li>
            <li>Also, rising out the razor along the way was extremely easy, no clogging up behind the blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first one that I&#x27;ve used that works well enough, even on a few days growth, to avoid it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I grow thick hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>The product advertises a precision trimmer, which is supposed to help with these areas, but I&#x27;m not sure it completely addresses the problem with maneuvering such a large cartridge.</li>
            <li>Who would&#x27;ve thought, but that little vibration helps this razor cut through my rather coarse facial hair like the proverbial hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the single AAA battery might make the blade feel a little heavy, but it was a very comfortable weight.</li>
            <li>&quot; so if you want cheap blades then expect a lousy shave with cuts and knicks..if you want an extremely close and comfortable shave with minimal effort then this is the razor for you...</li>
            <li>I am very grateful to have been included in the freebie program as I always wait for the last second to purchase my next batch of razors due to the costs.  </li>
            <li>I only had to do one pass over the bikini area which really cuts down on the rash, I appreciate that.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised by the Gillette Proglide and at first I was, but overall I would say that it would be hard for me to switch my razor to the Gillette if you are looking to save money.</li>
            <li>I packaged up the entire original package as new, including the box, original receipt, and the cheesy complaint card you are entitled to write as per their refund guidelines.</li>
            <li>As expected, this product offered the same, if not better, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>In general, my skin is a bit sensitive and my whiskers quite rough (especially the greys).</li>
            <li>Prior to this I really never put much stock into a power razor, having used Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 for a long time and being quite content with it.</li>
            <li>the blade narrower, our faces are curved, not flat pieces of paper.</li>
            <li>I normally shave my neck with a Braun electric due to issues with razor burn, but I didn&#x27;t experience any razor burn with the Fusion ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had the opportunity to learn about a Gillette program to evaluate their new razor, They sent me the Fusion ProGlide Power for a free evaluation, and was predictably skeptical.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a difference as to how the handle enhances my grip while shaving dry or wet.  </li>
            <li>I let it dry for couple of days and put in a fresh AA and nothing, no light on the button no movement.</li>
            <li>I let the unit dry out for 2 days and put in a fresh AA and nothing, no light on the button no movement.  </li>
            <li>Disposable razors are less expensive than cartridge systems, but I never realized they aren&#x27;t as good quality.</li>
            <li>, I grow facial hair quick and thick, and this still tears up my face.  </li>
            <li>Now I have very thick coarse hair that grows quite quickly and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>There was just too much width there to shave around tight corners in any direction without getting nicked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It received three stars due to the promises made by Gillette, and the fact there older products are just as functional as this newer, more expensive one.</li>
            <li>The only opportunity for improvement is that getting the battery in is not straight forward and the directions aren&#x27;t very clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the fact that I&#x27;m usually dealing with wet hands that could potentially slip on the handle on my razor, I felt the Proglide Power&#x27;s handle was secure the entire time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li>The next morning I pulled out  an old unused single blade disposable</li>
            <li>Having said that I still support the Gillette brand because, I think that compared to other brands that I have used in the past they are stillthe ones that I feel comfortable using on my face.</li>
            <li>generally use the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor because my face is sensitive to getting knicks and cuts from other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use the regular Gillette Fusion razors due to problems with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;ll stick with it, but it sure will be tough to leave this razor!</li>
            <li>I get such an amazingly close shave without the horrible razor burn or super sensitive skin afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The vibration of the razor tickled a little bit but it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>gives it a little added weight and makes it feel very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>After shaving, my face feels smooth, no razor bumps after shaving every day (usually if I shave with other razors daily</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t repeat what some of the other reviewers have said about how well the new Power Proglide shaves, but suffice it to say,</li>
            <li>and then I took out the new Fusion  blade on the block and shaved the other side of the face.</li>
            <li>The added battery also doesn&#x27;t add very much bulk to the product, which was another reason i&#x27;ve been hesitant to try these in the past.</li>
            <li>She buys the large 52 pack, making each razor about $0.65 - $0.75 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used those razors until the blue lubrication strip falls off, which turns out to be a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Also, the Fusion Proglide blades appear to last a little longer than the Fusion Power blades - but not by much.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would have to say that the vibrating razor might be a little too much for the every day user.  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous when I hit the power button, but upon shaving I could actually feel the hair on my face standing up, ready to be shaved.</li>
            <li>The new Proglide version of the Fusion is considerably different than the other versions.  </li>
            <li>My skin is little extra sensitive, so i do get razor bumps near my throat, but i dont think thats because of the razor</li>
            <li>The handle was a little big as well but not so much as to make me not use it in the future.</li>
            <li>The powerful vibrations help give an extra close shave with no irritation, even when using an a dull blade, which increases the life of the blade.</li>

            <li> However, this razor is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li> this is not the best choice.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to have a close shave!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still the best razor I used in years.</li>
            <li> excellent product and seller.</li>
            <li> excellent xmas gift for men.</li>
            <li> I bought this for $4 on Amazon in July&#x27;10, I must say that this is the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> Its the best partner.   </li>
            <li> Without doubt this product provides the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the best on the market, but it isn&#x27;t perfection.  </li>
            <li> FUSION PROGLIDE IS DEFINITELY BEST SHAVE</li>
            <li> I thought the FUSION was the best</li>
            <li> I recomment this shaver as the best on the market!</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide is Gillette&#x27;s best razor since the Mach 3.    </li>
            <li> The proglide works great!</li>
            <li> for me, it truly is the best shave I have ever had and have been looking for for years.</li>
            <li> It works perfect with the power vibration.</li>
            <li> packaging is excellent ...</li>
            <li> This is probably the best shave you&#x27;ll ever have if you&#x27;re used to using disposable blades.</li>
            <li> It was awesome with closer shaving and the blades lasted one month for me!      </li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the BEST razor that I have used, ever!</li>
            <li> Ended up buying the 3-1 gillette and that is awesome too.</li>
            <li> To my amazement, the shave was still superb with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Shaving was done with the power feature on and off, but either way the shave is excellent.    </li>
            <li> I got this for a song and with 5 blades it works great!</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best of the manual and electric shaving worlds.  </li>
            <li> Must admit I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> Priceless!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> and I was impressed that they wanted to pass on my experience to their staff.</li>
            <li> I saw a great deal on the Schick Hydro 5 and just thought I will try that for a change and what a change it was!!</li>
            <li> it will be very happy for us</li>
            <li> but I inadvertently found it to be an excellent razor for the bikini</li>
            <li> /&gt;Incidentally, it&#x27;s not the best razor for legs.  </li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve used yet, and while I&#x27;ll probably stick to an electric for day-to-day shaving, this will work as a perfect substitute when I&#x27;m charging that one up.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best razor that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Best razor ever!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razor I ever had.</li>
            <li> That is great customer support!</li>
            <li> This has been the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Best shave ever.</li>
            <li> The ergonomics are the best I&#x27;ve come across, well balanced, correctly angled head, substantial weight with battery installed.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take that \\&quot;Best</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best.  </li>
            <li> The best up to this point from my experience is the Merkur Model 180.  </li>
            <li> the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> A great purchase even if it was an Amazon vine purchase!</li>
            <li> But I am thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very impressive.</li>
            <li> am highly impressed by the Fusion Proglide Power Razor.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was the best razor out there.</li>
            <li> This IS the best razor yet.</li>
            <li> Best Razor which I have.</li>
            <li> Where I see the greatest difference between this razor and razors like Mach 3 and the Gillete Power Fusion is when I shave my head.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li> , it was excellent.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best razor for sensative skin.</li>
            <li> and cant wait to shave again good job Gillette!!</li>
            <li> The best part is that it comes with the AAA battery.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> This razor is absolutely priceless!</li>
            <li> All in all, I have found the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to be an excellent razor handle.</li>
            <li> The razor blades are excellent, high-quality razor blades that I would recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> They truly are \\&quot;The Best</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> One of the best shaves I ever had.  </li>

            <li> The design is perfect!</li>

            <li> performance on my neck was also impressive.</li>

            <li> She says it works GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li> However, since I found the Fusion Power razor, I feel that I have the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> The power handle is AWESOME.  </li>
            <li> Best product packaging yet for a razor handle.</li>

            <li> They give you the best shave, with no nicks/cuts.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, I have been very happy with the shave and will soon be buying refills for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.</li>
            <li> but I &#x27;m not to impressed by the vibrator.</li>
            <li> As to the closeness of the shave, the 3 blade product made by Gillette is still an excellent product</li>
            <li> it was perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,IT MADE BY THE BEST COMPANY FOR MENS SHAVING PRODUCTS</li>

            <li> It was one of the smoothest shaves that I have ever gotten from a disposable razor, and I was very impressed with the way it worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power capability that this disposable razor provides you with one of the best hybrid razor shaves around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> I said, best razor</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide is the best manual shaver I have used  to date.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Cannot be beaten by even the best electric razors (I&#x27;ve tried the series 7 Braun recently).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m not as impressed as I hoped to be...</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have this razor and found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still not the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> and I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li> The motor in the handle feels perfect without being overkill.  </li>
            <li> I would say it gave me the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> but it does the job great!</li>
            <li> The handle on this razor is awesome - it is not like the others when it comes to size.  </li>
            <li> These has got to be the best handle invented.  </li>
            <li> This feature brings together the best of two worlds: the smoothness of a blade shave with the vibration feature of an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> After using it now for about a week, it is the best razor I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> This razor gave me an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of their products for over 7 years and thought that I had found the Mach III Power to be the best that they made.</li>
            <li> My best yet!</li>
            <li> However, I was not overly impressed with the micropulses.  </li>
            <li> The side grips on the handle are great!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the best razor on the market today!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my proglide razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of Gillette&#x27;s manual razors and this is the best that&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the manual shave.</li>
            <li> This razor works flawlessly !</li>
            <li> I put some shaving cream on and I shaved my beard, and I will just tell you it is the best</li>

            <li> I wanted to use the razor for a while before I commented on it and must admit this is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> However with this being said, I feel like its one of the best handle out on the market today.  </li>

            <li> I thought the razor was the ideal lovechild between a handheld razor and an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The difference was incredible.</li>
            <li> The balance in the handle was just perfect for going around my chin and the blade was great.  </li>

            <li> This lightweight handle has great rubber grips that allow for perfect shaving control.</li>
            <li> end opinion is: if your already using a Mach 3, just stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;I think your best investment would be to find a good shaving cream/gel, that works best for you!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> BUT, if you are looking for a great shave, this razor is excellent!</li>

            <li> pivoting head provides great razor to face contact throughout the shave.</li>
            <li> It also has a great ergonomic, non-slip handle.</li>
            <li> This is a great option to have all in one product.</li>
            <li> The handle feels great.</li>
            <li> The handle worked great.</li>
            <li> All around great razor.</li>
            <li> so i get a great shave.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a great razor handle</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this truly is a great product.</li>
            <li> I received the razor via a program run by Gillette, and boy was I happy I did.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor and the electric function</li>
            <li> I think this razor is great</li>
            <li> GREAT job</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor handle does a great job as it is designed.</li>
            <li> This razor works great.  </li>
            <li> It was great</li>
            <li> The handle had a great feel to it and had a great grip so that it was not slippery.  </li>
            <li> This was a great product to try and now im hooked.</li>
            <li> It did a great job.  </li>
            <li> The ProGlide Blades themselves are great</li>
            <li> I like the power series a lot and think it does a great job</li>
            <li> GREAT for travel!&lt;br /&gt;+Blades pop on and off</li>
            <li> This is a great handle that you can buy at a superstore/grocery store.  </li>
            <li> DId I mention that is looks great.  </li>
            <li> When using the shaver the blades seemed to cut great.</li>
            <li> , I am always happy with these razors.  </li>
            <li> Gillettte always presents a great quality product and this was no exception.</li>
            <li> Great handle on the Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to give this handle a try.</li>
            <li> When changing blades this button works great.</li>
            <li> Once you push the power button, it makes all the difference combining a great blade with vibration gets you an even closer shave.</li>
            <li> What a great shave it was.</li>
            <li> Awesome look and trendy.</li>
            <li> Great product all around.</li>
            <li> I did expect it to be as great as it was.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a power razor before and it was great.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Mach 3 for years and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I must say the handle on this product is great.</li>
            <li> I found this razor a great substitute for an electric razor, which I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Great job Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to overstate things, but this is the smoothest, easiest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I liked the fusion, but didn&#x27;t think it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Amazon has great info and instructions.</li>
            <li> great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> It is an all around great razor.  </li>
            <li> I give it four stars because it is a great razor</li>
            <li> GRIP FEELS GREAT IN HAND.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;power\\&quot; option with battery and all sounds great, but doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> matter HOW great my shaves have been using Gillette products, invariably I wince each &amp; every time I go into a store to purchase replacement blades.</li>
            <li> : did the Proglide shave great?</li>
            <li> Spend the $10 and buy this now it really is amazing and the best shave ive ever gotten.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s orange, that one used to work great.</li>
            <li> so I knew this was a great inexpensive razor.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman and never can understand why they market the great razors to men.  </li>
            <li> &quot;, I think this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the blades.</li>
            <li> If you have been a Gillette man like me give the Hydro 5 a chance its cheaper than Gillette and wont hurt, it could give you great shaves and save a lot of money over time.</li>
            <li> Great deal from Amazon so that helps with justifying the price.  </li>
            <li> The power and non power are both great but the vibration from the power is like a massage for your face</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> It works great,</li>
            <li> While Gillette&#x27;s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great razor if you can handle buying the blades.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> but I would imagine it also produces a great shave.  </li>
            <li> how well it contours to curves, and that&#x27;s great and all, but I never had a problem with it before this version of the razor.</li>
            <li> It is a great razor.  </li>
            <li> It is a great improvement to an already great razor.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor i ever own, it gives you the baby finish</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Felt great.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  </li>
            <li> but this one does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great blade.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d probably be just as happy without the vibrating handle.</li>
            <li> This gave me a great close shave.</li>
            <li> It gave me a great close shave each and every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced from one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I need all the help I can get to keep my face from getting irritated, great product.</li>
            <li> Over all this is a great shaving handle for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was mind-blowing and because of that I have to say all in all, it&#x27;s been great and Gillette has made me a fan.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is a great razor.  </li>
            <li> It is a great razor.  </li>
            <li> But the handle was great.  </li>
            <li> But it truly gets great results.</li>
            <li> Thank you a great product.</li>
            <li> I got a great shave and the blades didn&#x27;t clog at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Altogether, the features of this handle and blade combo provided me with a great shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried them yet, it&#x27;s a must have for a great shave.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> it has a great grip so if your using in the shower you will have no problems holding the razor.</li>
            <li> Thanx Gillette for the opportunity to test this great product.</li>
            <li> This razor is great.</li>
            <li> and you have a great razor handle.</li>
            <li> This on be too is sturdy and feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li> It is great for a close shave without irritation or nicks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the build and quality of the product is great, I don&#x27;t find myself wanting to switch to it as my go to razor.</li>
            <li> I think it does a great job shaving</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor quite a bit now, and the results are great.</li>
            <li> I always have a great shave when i use this product</li>
            <li> and i am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> In fact, id say the closest blade shave ive experienced.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> This is a Great Razor.</li>
            <li> The handle felt great in my hand, not a bit bulky like I feared it might be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I thought this was a great product and one</li>
            <li> Great, great razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its great as a short-term power razor, maybe a year at tops.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> Great all around product.</li>
            <li> This razor is great.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the Gillette Fusion proglide power has a great handle design with a comfort grip</li>
            <li> Well, I must say this razor provides a nice shave but its not the best.</li>
            <li> The button to turn the power on is a great improvement too.</li>
            <li> It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great if you want to keep water marks off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The difference is not that great</li>
            <li> gillette fusion proguide styler is great</li>
            <li> that clouded my review but honestly, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> and it still did great.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just shaving my cheeks and neck under the beard, but it does great.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> Great price for product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for shaving your head as well.</li>
            <li> We just choose not to use the vibration feature and be perfectly happy.</li>
            <li> got it two years ago still works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, period.  </li>
            <li> it works really great</li>
            <li> The MACH3&#x27;s have always treated me well and did a great job for my shaving needs.  </li>
            <li> This razor shaves great, considering it has 5, yes 5, blades.</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion proglide power cartridge gave me a great shave</li>
            <li> Gillette is known for great razors, and The Pro Glide Power Razor is no slouch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> The grip on the handle works great for my bi-weekly shaving needs.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Great shave.</li>
            <li> It is a great product if you want to upgrade your razor.</li>
            <li> and I think it is a welcome change to the world of shaving.</li>
            <li> great design.</li>
            <li> My thoughts on the handle it that it has a great feel when I use it to shave.</li>
            <li> The razor does give a great shave</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy to report that it&#x27;s still holding strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor.  </li>
            <li> The handle has a great grip to it.</li>
            <li> The blades are great, haven&#x27;t cut myself yet.</li>
            <li> Since I have to shave every day, I don&#x27;t mind spending what it takes to get a great shave.</li>
            <li> The razor itself worked great.</li>
            <li> I have not received any nicks or cuts using this blade nor have I experienced any bumps or burns.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results it gave me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Proglide Power razor for a bit  now, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Yet I experienced zero irritation...</li>
            <li> A radical improvement on an already great product.</li>
            <li> It is a great razor and give me a great shave with no cuts</li>
            <li> Even without the gel or cream, I haven&#x27;t experienced any tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li> Over all great product.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a nice compliment to some of the best razor cartridges I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> these work great.</li>
            <li> My experience on the handle was great.</li>
            <li> Great length and size for shaving also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great product with a great outcome every time.</li>
            <li> The microComb does a great job of trimming my sideburns, no \\&quot;Lamb</li>
            <li> Overs one of the closest shaves out there and is a really great price.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to try out the Fusion Proglide Power through a Gillette promo.</li>
            <li> handle feels great in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed of how great the product worked..</li>
            <li> The blades are the smoothest that I have experienced.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide has a great handle.</li>
            <li> The rubbery handle is ergonomic and allows for great grip and control.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Gillette makes great razors, but the Fusion Proglide Power Razor is just not for me.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a promotion from Gillette, and can definitively say this cuts great.</li>
            <li> Great razor handle.  </li>
            <li> in all the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is a great razor and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love the closeness of this shaver!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, close, painless shave.</li>
            <li> I very nice razor</li>
            <li> The thing handles chins very nicely and does not cut you up at all.</li>
            <li> The razor fits and feels very nice in the hand.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> I found that the handle was very nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product Gillette, just go easy on the price!</li>
            <li> this product is very good, not imagined how good it is, I recommend the Gillette outdone, loved the product can now shave every day.</li>
            <li> it leaves the cleanest cut and the grip is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> IT IS AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> They both do an amazing job!</li>
            <li> The razor is amazing!</li>
            <li> and I am still receiving amazing shaves each and every day!</li>
            <li> This Gillette razor is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Best razor ever and thank you Gillette for giving it free!</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is one of the best around.</li>
            <li> The built in grips feel good and allow for great control.</li>
            <li> The shave is excellent, but even better is that the frustrations I just mentioned have been minimized.</li>
            <li> Love that it could be used in the shower and fits perfectly in my hands.</li>
            <li> The blades are also fairly forgiving on skin (I tend to shave without shaving cream and rarely experienced any razor burn with the fusion</li>
            <li> Fair price great service.  </li>
            <li> He also told me to leave it alone, and to buy my own!  </li>
            <li> Either way, if you have the money, buy what works for YOU and don&#x27;t let anybody tell you different.not justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best razor I have ever used in more than 25 years of shaving.</li>
            <li> Really, really nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll begin by saying that I&#x27;ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and feel it is one of the best on the market!</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned, and I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> Good shipping and works great in my walk-in closet</li>
            <li> They have a sixth blade on the top for shaving your neck, what an awesome feature!  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for people looking for a great razor at a good price point.</li>
            <li> I love Gillette as this razor created the perfect shave and no rash!</li>
            <li> What a nice razor!</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have used many razors, both manual and electric, and have to say that the Proglide gave me the best shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so close and nice!  </li>
            <li> Loving it!</li>
            <li> and I can safely say it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> But after a week of the Fusion Proglide, I am happy to report that my face feels as good as it did on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really liked the vibrating handle on this thing!</li>
            <li> I found that to be the most impressive part of the razor, and that&#x27;s why I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> but i am here to honestly tell you that I was blown away with the improvement that it made!  </li>
            <li> The grip is perfect and allows one to get a great shave with easy strokes.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this handle felt great and is an exceptional partner to the ProGlide razor blade.</li>
            <li> It gave me a really pleasant feeling that reminded me of using my electric shaver</li>
            <li> The Pro Glide Power Razor has me pleasantly</li>
            <li> However, when I tried the Pro Glide Power Razor I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave is easily one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> The handle is the perfect size, easy to move around in your hands, and</li>
            <li> This is easily one, if not the best razor I have used for shaving my head/face.</li>
            <li> The battery is easy to install and the power button is in the perfect spot, your thumb just seems to hit it without thinking about it.</li>
            <li> The power button is perfectly positioned for easy activation.</li>
            <li> The razor handle made the razor easy to maneuver and get the best shave you can.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is awesome and still growing strong.  </li>
            <li> The sensation wasn&#x27;t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.</li>
            <li> The sensation wasn&#x27;t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.</li>
            <li> The handle is beautifully designed and feels nice in the hand,  The shave it provides was better than very good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette produces great shaving &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34;.. every one is better than the one before it!</li>
            <li> When I was shaving every day, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, very smooth and nice</li>
            <li> Along with a great shave, the handle was very comfortable, with a great grip.</li>
            <li> Very good razor, I will be buying more blades and making this my permanent razor.  </li>
            <li> This thing is loaded with great features to have a great shave with, but after getting used to the features at the top of the razor, I&#x27;ve been noticing</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best I&#x27;ve encountered so far, and Costco carries them so I can get the best deal on replacement blades.</li>
            <li> It feels good in your hand but did nothing to enhance my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from a program run by Gillette and I am very happy I did.  </li>
            <li> The handle is serviceable and provides good grip and maneuverability.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Impressed, I got it for free via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> in all, this is a fantastic razor handle and would be perfect for those with</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got a good weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Just used the razor and loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the Fusion ProGlide Power shavers around for a while, but I&#x27;ve thought that they were probably a good way to make faceburger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that the vibrating blades did not slice my face into ribbons, and I did get a nice close shave from it.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Another sign of good workmanship.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Gillette products, this one is good.</li>
            <li> good shave</li>
            <li> The Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power handle has a good feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li> so I figured it would be a good time to test this Powered ProGlide.  </li>
            <li> Good job</li>
            <li> It just glided over my skin the vibrations were soothing and the well designed handle felt good in my hand.</li>
            <li> he loved it.</li>
            <li> is a good position so that you aren&#x27;t turning it off during your shave.</li>
            <li> and it promises a good shave.</li>
            <li> With a good blade</li>
            <li> My free razor provided by a program run by Gillette was just perfect.</li>
            <li> I loved the razor.</li>
            <li> When I got the confirmation that the razor had shipped, I chose not to shave until it came in so that I could give it a fair try.  </li>
            <li> The handle had a superior grip.</li>
            <li> I got to try it for free from Gillette, and I am very happy that I got the opportunity.</li>
            <li> The razor has a good weight to it when the battery is inserted and it looks and feels like it could withstand just about anything.  </li>
            <li> fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the razor</li>
            <li> I think I would get just as good of shave without having the \\&quot;power feature\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a good handle that my hand can wrap around.  </li>
            <li> Good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I loved the handle grip and weight.</li>
            <li> The good news is that the handle is fully compatible with the Fusion Power cartridge and vice versa.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle free to try from Gillette and I am very happy with my experience.</li>
            <li> and this does not work good at all with the power handle or blades.</li>
            <li> It gives the best shave and makes the skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> but I shave my head as well and have loved the results.  </li>
            <li> Good job guys.  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s actually a good thing when you&#x27;re throwing something in a travel bag and don&#x27;t want it to accidentally activate.  </li>
            <li> I get a close comfortable shave from this, and use it over my electric razor any time I need to look my best.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor.</li>
            <li> it is still a good shave</li>
            <li> * good grip&lt;br /</li>
            <li> good:</li>
            <li> They still have that wonderful, smooth feeling against my sheets when I climb into bed that night.</li>
            <li> The best shave ever, smooth and close.  </li>
            <li> But the proglide is so good</li>
            <li> You can buy a good quality boar bristle shaving brush for $15, or as part of a set, which you use to apply the soaps from inside the dishes.   </li>
            <li> I was very impressed by how smooth this glides over my face.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a good quality razor and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Good job this time around, Gillette.ith the old-fashioned shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li> Good job this time around, Gillette.</li>
            <li> Good job, Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Once he used it, he was delighted.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was THAT good.</li>
            <li> In fact it was a superior shave all around.</li>
            <li> I have since been getting good results from it.  </li>
            <li> The fusion was good</li>
            <li> it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was</li>
            <li> ALl we need is a good functional shaver.</li>
            <li> and that was good</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is a really good razor when you consider the price.</li>
            <li> Really a good razor with no complaints.</li>
            <li> Superior in all ways.  </li>
            <li> They are really good.</li>
            <li> Couple this with a good shaving cream</li>
            <li> I have a good razor.</li>
            <li> My replacement unit I purchased seems to be good.</li>
            <li> so although its a good close shave with the Proglide</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite know what good it does, myself.</li>
            <li> before, so I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s why this razor is as good as it is.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor and I loved the quality and ease of ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Of course, unless you get a good deal on one that makes it cheaper than a replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li> the razor is almost as good as the hype  </li>
            <li> it gives a really good shave</li>
            <li> it covers angles good shave  berman</li>
            <li> After seeing the price of refills I may regret using it, but it was nice to get a great shave.</li>
            <li> The razor feels good to hold</li>
            <li> but this was good too.</li>
            <li> There are two things that I have always loved about it.  </li>
            <li> Good buy and goodbye.</li>
            <li> I do not know how this compares to their Fusion and blah blah, but I do know that this is a good razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you heard, but Gillette just gave away some of these perfect pieces of machinery for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one before but this was offered at a good price</li>
            <li> GOOD VALUE.</li>
            <li> In terms of cartridge razor &#x27;systems&#x27;, this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Well good news, the word is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using a fusion power for years and think this one is equally good.</li>
            <li> did not have any irritation at, which was good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a good razor</li>
            <li> (3-4 shaves a week) and the blade is just as good as when I opened it.  </li>
            <li> The grip felt good in my hand, didn&#x27;t slide around on me and moved everywhere</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with how close the shave is and how smooth it is.</li>
            <li> I did not use this feature, but think it is a good safeguard in case someone does accidently leave the power on.</li>
            <li> she was delighted.  </li>
            <li> I had a three day beard growing (waiting of shaver to arrive), and after I used it my wife said that my face was like a babies bottom (I assume that was a good thing).  </li>
            <li> works well, good price</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent product, its design makes for a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a good handle that my hand can wrap around.</li>
            <li> The handle was of good quality; its sturdy feeling complemented an ergonomic grip.  </li>
            <li> The handle on this razor is superior to the Bic razors I have used.  </li>
            <li> but it was a good shave.  </li>
            <li> It has a great shut off feature which comes in handy to prevent it accidentally being turned on in a drawer or during travel.</li>
            <li> good razor.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this razor was an exceptionally good razor.  </li>
            <li> which is good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked gillette&#x27;s products and this is another great addition to the Gillette family of razors.</li>
            <li> The grip feel good and snug between the fingers and palm.  </li>
            <li> It is a good quality razor.</li>
            <li> All in all a good razor</li>
            <li> shave was good, but I blame the blades for the quality, not the sonic screwdriver that they were attached to.</li>
            <li> One of the smoother shaves I have had in a good while.</li>
            <li> The handle is attractive, efficient and  effective.  </li>
            <li> I has a Gillette Mack 3 and Gillette Fusion is a superior product.</li>
            <li> But as soon i bought this product and started using it , I just loved it.</li>
            <li> It feeld good in my hand and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> do like that the razor gave me a good shave and didn&#x27;t damage my skin.</li>
            <li> The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It felt good in my hand</li>
            <li> I always get really good shaves with this razor</li>
            <li> would recommend this product based on how good the blade cartridges are.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide Power is definitely a good razor</li>
            <li> The handle has a good grip and the blade does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor handle that cuts nice and close.  </li>
            <li> I find the Proglide a good improvement over the fusion blade.</li>
            <li> will say that this is a good razor, but the battery &amp; the vibration, I have tried it, and see no benefit.</li>
            <li> No problems at all, shaved as good as ever.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I loved this razor.</li>
            <li> It feels really good, almost an extension of my hand.</li>
            <li> It feels like it was perfectly designed to fit snugly in the hand</li>
            <li> The razor blades are good and do a good job.</li>
            <li> It was nice to see that it had a feature to shut off if on longer than 8 Minutes, great for travel.</li>
            <li> I loved the handle.  </li>
            <li> Good size</li>
            <li> vibration seems to help my skin react to the shave and gives me a good feeling during and after.</li>
            <li> handle fits nicely in my hand, which gives me great control during my shave.  </li>
            <li> The handle had a superior grip.</li>
            <li> For example, when shaving under my chin, the grip I used caused a fair bit of fatigue in my hand.</li>
            <li> Best thing they ever did was to send a free one in the mail when I turned 18.  </li>
            <li> It does just as good a job.</li>
            <li> It shaves good but the refills cost</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to guess 5 blades is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> This razor is quite good.  </li>
            <li> There is on the bottom, however, which doesn&#x27;t seem to do any good.</li>
            <li> it is overal a good product from close shave to the feel of the handle.</li>
            <li> I have always had good luck with Gillette&#x27;s blades and this one did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> It allows me to get a good line on my side burns and goatee.</li>
            <li> I get an excellent grip on the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor that I got from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I used this razor yesterday and loved it.  </li>
            <li> i wake up in the morning, pound some coffee, and hit the latrine for the good ole</li>
            <li> Gilette sent me a free razor to try out the power glide and it was an awesome shave as always!</li>
            <li> The vibrating handle seems to either help the blades through the cut, or masks the pulling sensation, but either way it was a good experience.  </li>
            <li> best compliment I can offer is this - I received a sample of this product free via a program run by Gillette and it made me a believer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I used to use a two blade razor, but after trying this razor after receiving it for free from a program run by Gillette, I have to say I am extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin and does not cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have EVER had (and the vibration felt good on my skin).</li>
            <li> Loved the styler and the razor.</li>
            <li> The handle felt good in my hand</li>
            <li> while shaving the grip felt good even when shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> and I got a good amount of uses out of it.</li>
            <li> Has a nice, balanced weight and feels like something sturdy that would give you a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I got to try it for free from Gillette, and I am very happy that I got the opportunity.</li>
            <li> FEELS good against my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have as good of an experience.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Original Fusion for years and this was awesome!  </li>
            <li> I was able to achieve a superior shave than before, one that lasted all through the day!</li>
            <li> All in all a great tool for getting that clean shave you desire!!</li>
            <li> It feels very comfortable and smooth and has provided me with one of the best shaves I have experienced.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor for times when you need a good shave quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is a great razor handle and probably the best and most comfortable of any razor handle that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> really liked the design of the handle; it looked good, felt good</li>
            <li> The rubber gripping on the top of the handle is perfectly designed.  </li>
            <li> And the best part is that the blade is so great it just takes on pass over each area to provide a shave much smoother than my electric razor could ever do.</li>
            <li> It really feels great and provided me with a wonderful shave.  </li>
            <li> The power handle helps the awesome razor heads give a nice close shave while still be comfortable and</li>
            <li> I was very happy to be able to try this product for FREE via a program run by Gilllette!</li>
            <li> razor.&lt;br /&gt;+Nice ergonomics and feel to the handle, and looks nice too.&lt;br /&gt;+Comes with an awesome plastic case that securely holds the razor and can clip in a 4-pack of replacement blades underneath.</li>
            <li> Between the superb handle and the tremendous razor, I found myself with the closest, smoothest, easiest shave-job of my life.  </li>
            <li> How many more times can you upgrade a shaver, works great!!</li>
            <li> The handle fits perfectly in my hand allowing more control and a better shave.</li>
            <li> I use the the Razor with the power on for a nice smooth shave and it is great because it does not pull my skin which in return does not cut me!!</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide power from Gillette give away program, and can honestly say I have had the best shaves of my life using this razor.</li>

            <li> The handle is very comfortable to use and the blades are great.</li>
            <li> Quality isn&#x27;t an issue here: the razor looks great, and gives me a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It did a great job in provided a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Very good comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> handle was very enjoyable to hold.  </li>
            <li> I was more than happy to accept this razor from the program by Gillette.</li>
            <li> However the handle must have some magic to it as my face felt great after the shave.  </li>
            <li> It provides a great shave either way, and I love how the handle sits in your hand.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power via a program run by Gillette to review as I&#x27;m always looking for a better razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are always coming out with very innovative products.  </li>

            <li> Both my wife I have been a &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; time Atra Plus razor users and we were very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I have just treated myself to one of the most smoothest and closest shaves I have EVER experienced.</li>
            <li> a razor with this many blades is great.</li>
            <li> At the very most - and I think I&#x27;m being a bit too generous here -</li>
            <li> I received this razor courtesy of a program run by Gillette, and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It works great, but I can&#x27;t use it continuously for more than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs for this and gifted 1 to my dad and he was really happy using this.</li>
            <li> It is a very interesting concept between an electric and disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> The blades gave me an incredibly close and smooth shave.</li>

            <li> I recommend everyone buy this product, it really is very good and the seller met, I bought it and it has been very useful</li>
            <li> The razor itself is nicely balanced and feels good in the hands.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with how this handle performs, and as my first powered vibrating handle, I must say I am impressed.  </li>
            <li> The handle is absolutely amazing, the rugged yet smooth grip is incredible.</li>
            <li> The micro-vibrations of the handle combined with the excellent replacement blades gave me the smoothest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had - even week-old stubble.  </li>
            <li> A great clean shave!</li>
            <li> The Lubrastrip was a pleasant addition, and the handle was very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Downside</li>
            <li> I love the micropulses handle with the side grips!</li>
            <li> I tried it out, and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with this razor since I first used it.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I mostly love it because of the razors handle!</li>
            <li> The power button, I have to say, it pretty awesome and glow blues.  </li>
            <li> while I can start to notice a bit of difference from the first shave, I am still impressed.  </li>
            <li> LOve the idea!</li>
            <li> Another innovative concept from Gillette!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor!</li>
            <li> But I will say I haven&#x27;t had a better shave except from a barber!</li>
            <li> I do think the first shave out of the package was just marvelous.  </li>
            <li> Well the first shave is extremely awesome.. then the quality  of shave drops from there..</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad I did!    </li>
            <li> This is my first vibrating razor and I am thoroughly impressed!</li>
            <li> I Love that it has the vibrations!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Too many blades!</li>
            <li> Glad I got the razor and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got to use this one!</li>
            <li> I already warned her I better not catch her using it on her legs - its mine!</li>
            <li> My first shave with this razor was excellent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I made this change!</li>
            <li> For the first shave, I intentionally skipped a day to see how well it did, and was I impressed.  </li>
            <li> really enjoyed the shaving experience with this razor from Gillette and have already replaced my others with it!</li>
            <li> and I love this razor!  </li>
            <li> I suggest this razor to anybody looking for a smooth face!!</li>
            <li> It seems to cut a bit better than a non-powered handle, so it works for me!</li>
            <li> This review is specifically for the handle, which I was pretty impressed with.</li>
            <li> Sure!  </li>
            <li> I received this through a program run by Gillette and I&#x27;m so glad I signed up for it!</li>
            <li> Glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor!  </li>
            <li> this much more pleasant?  </li>
            <li> It glided so easily, and did a great job.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle is easy to grasp and use and the shave is like nothing you&#x27;ve experienced before.  </li>
            <li> The handle is great and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> excellent, easy to use, very good shaving experience, it does not irritate your beard, and leave the skin soft and</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this to anyone as a great option for a manual razor!</li>
            <li> The light weight and balanced handle felt great in my hand.</li>
            <li> I found the handle to be a great fit for my hands.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the amazing razor I received, but when the battery runs out I will hesitate to replace it.</li>
            <li> This Gillette fusion proglide razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> It just seems amazing.</li>
            <li> Gillette did an amazing job in the design and features of this handle.</li>
            <li> I felt as smooth as silk and looked great.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the Power is just amazing.</li>
            <li> It was a great smooth shave</li>
            <li> wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all i would reccommend this shaver, it was a great shave, not a lot of vibrating and was a comfortable grip to hold on to.</li>
            <li> WHAT A GREAT WAY TO GET A TRUELY SMOOTH SHAVE</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing, but I had to get used to the fact that it vibrated, or as they call it \\&quot;Micropulses\\</li>
            <li> Thank you Gillette for sending me this amazing product to try.</li>
            <li> Affordable and amazing shave that anyone can get in my eyes</li>
            <li> The shave I received from it was beyond amazing.</li>
            <li> simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I must admit works amazing</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, and the shave is amazing.</li>
            <li> Simply an amazing razor.</li>
            <li> Just tried this Proglide Men&#x27;s Power Razor and it cuts amazingly.</li>
            <li> the vibrate feature is great - smooth shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> Paired with the amazing head, it did wonders.</li>
            <li> Shaving isn&#x27;t something we enjoy doing but this blade makes it easier to get it done and get on with your day looking great.</li>
            <li> It has a great feel, size, and is comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li> The Micorpulses were amazing to the shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Was happy to try this free razor I received through a program by Gillette.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor that I received for free from a program by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor from a program run by Gillette and was so happy I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what a difference the battery power makes on a close shave.</li>
            <li> Great close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> and I had an amazing shave.</li>
            <li> However, this is a great product to take on travels as the cost is relatively cheap and if you are yearning for some electronic aided shave.</li>
            <li> This razor provides an amazingly close shave.</li>
            <li> I got a great shave using the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power Handle along with ProGlide blades, which I received free through a promotion program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle was comfortable and had great \\&quot;gripping\\&quot; coverage; and the moisturizing strip also helps with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing,</li>
            <li> my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li> power handle is amazing as well</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> The power handle and vibration is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am happy because this was provided to me for free by a program ran by Gillette to try it out.</li>
            <li> But the amount of CLOSE and COMFORTABLE shaves makes this a great purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basing this off of a 2-blade experience, this is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how the micropulses help to give a smoother shave and the shave lasts for a longer period.</li>
            <li> I got to use the Fusion ProGlide Power handle to shave, I liked it quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> It continued to feel nice in the hand as I shaved my face and head.  </li>
            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> The battery power works in the shower, so that&#x27;s a nice convenience.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shave I got from  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.  </li>
            <li> just honest</li>
            <li> It has a nice grip and fits well in my hand.  </li>
            <li> It has a very ergonomic grip and a non-slip hold perfect for those rushed in-the-shower shaves.  </li>
            <li> The handle was nice</li>
            <li> The razor has a nice weight and balance</li>
            <li> The vibrations on the razor was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I liked the power handle.</li>
            <li> i honestly didn&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Within a minute, I was loving it.  </li>
            <li> Quite honestly I would not have ever had used a Fusion Pro-Glide Power if Gillete had not sent me one for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> slick.&lt;br /&gt;The battery powered handle vibrates nicely letting you get the close shave.  </li>
            <li> But all they did was take to okay things and put them together, call them great, and charger more for refills.</li>
            <li> I liked the razor</li>
            <li> It kind of irritated my skin and just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have to say I really liked the razor</li>
            <li> It gives a nice shave too</li>
            <li> The razor gives a nice, close shave without any nicks or cuts and I did not have any problems with razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I also liked the vibrations.</li>
            <li> The vibration adds to the good shave, and makes it more efficient.</li>
            <li> This comes in handy when you are trying to get a close shave, while avoiding any nicks.</li>
            <li> i did receive this item from Gillette as part of a test program, but my review is honest about the product.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the fact that using the powered handle makes shaving much easier.</li>
            <li> The vibrating shave is nice.</li>
            <li> I had gotten away from Gillette in favor of the disposable razors and can honestly say I am wondering why I switched.</li>
            <li> I like the good ol reg razor better  for me</li>
            <li> I liked the way it felt in my hand.</li>
            <li> This gives you a very close shave and the power function is awesome.</li>
            <li> was impressed with the ability of the Proglide to give a smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It does not slip in your hand which is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li> The design and color scheme is very sleek looking for a razor and the best part</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the trimmer and it kind of freaks me out</li>
            <li> The handle grip is awesome, very confortable.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did (all things do work together for good...).</li>
            <li> The good medium compromise is the famous safety razor, which is making a comeback these days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OK, I understand that Gillette cannot effectively inventory all the retailers with every generation of product they ever made.</li>
            <li> I liked it and you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> But the shave was really nice.</li>
            <li> The battery power works in the shower, so that&#x27;s a nice convenience.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette razors always provide a nice shave but their ever increasing price of blades pushed me away years ago.  </li>
            <li> I always liked going against the grain cause</li>
            <li> My husband really liked this razor.  </li>
            <li> when I look at it turned on, but he said he liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li> but it is a nice gimmick</li>
            <li> The floating blades so effectively follow the contours of my skin that I get as close as shave as I ever have before.  </li>
            <li> There has always been some kind of trade-off between closeness, irritation, tendency to produce ingrown hairs, price, and speed of use.  </li>
            <li> The battery has lasted quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> Really, really nice.</li>
            <li> Also no razor burn which is always nice.</li>
            <li> , I own a Pulsonic (retired) and a Panasonic Arc 5, both vibrating electrics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> still, it&#x27;s a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had to replace the battery after a month which is also a nice surprise since I figured they must be in bed with Duracell and had created another way to help sell AAA&#x27;s to tech nerds.</li>
            <li> The razor pivots nicely along thw jaw and chin.</li>
            <li> The vibration felt nice</li>
            <li> I was kind of drawn into the advertisements.</li>
            <li> my $14 battery operated Braun (including batteries) travel shaver works as good or better.  </li>
            <li> It looks nice, but that&#x27;s about</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad and he liked it.</li>
            <li> nice product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 because, honestly,  the vibrator is a novelty where form over function is a sales tool, not an improvement in shaving.</li>
            <li> I really believe the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> you hold it however you dont really realize its fatter, and the shave it gives is excellent.</li>
            <li> With that being said I need a nice close shave without razor rash.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to a nice relationship with the Fusion Proglide Power Razor and saying goodbye to the Mach-3 Turbo.</li>
            <li> I have to say I really liked the razor</li>
            <li> Oh, and if you&#x27;re wondering whether I missed the protective wires of the Quattro, that&#x27;s an affirmative.  </li>
            <li> The package arrived with the razor, a nice holder, and one blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, very close shave.</li>
            <li> I also like that the handle has a nice feel to it-</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice feel and does not slip.</li>
            <li> Power Handle is also a nice bonus for those with</li>
            <li> Also the blade is absolute perfect shave</li>
            <li> I use in the shower, the grip is nice</li>
            <li> Things kind of go downhill from there and a blade change is required.</li>
            <li> While I do not feel as though I received a better shave do to the vibration, it does feel good on the hand while holding it.  </li>
            <li> One of the features that I really liked was the moisturizing strips.</li>
            <li> It gave me a great shave, and overall I was very impressed with it&#x27;s design and functionality.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; reasonably priced</li>
            <li> The battery is more of a gimmick though instead of a good addition.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave without any issues.  </li>
            <li> Liked the feel of the handle</li>
            <li> I really liked the Proglide Power.  </li>
            <li> and I also liked the vibration motion</li>
            <li> your looking for a good razor with 4 blades, you may love this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, the shave is nice.  </li>
            <li> they are pricey and I&#x27;d have to think about spending this kind of money compared to the Mach 3</li>
            <li> Today as a test I shaved my three day stubble without any shaving cream just some warm water.</li>
            <li> My skin was not irritated after using the razor, which was a nice feeling for once.  </li>
            <li> The handle was nice to grip</li>
            <li> like I got a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li> Here, the vibrating pulses came in handy.  </li>
            <li> I got a nice close shave, with no nicks and/or skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This whole system is awesome.</li>
            <li> I liked the razors alone without the micropulse</li>
            <li> Before this I owned (and still own)</li>
            <li> This is a nice feature for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I liked it, a lot.  </li>
            <li> liked the power feature.</li>
            <li> But to be honest I will always buy the Gillette razor blades.</li>
            <li> My guy friends had to ask me to stop talking about it, because I was so thrilled about it.</li>
            <li> I know Gillette razors are kind of pricy</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice</li>
            <li> This will be nice if I wanted to take the razor with me when travelling.  </li>
            <li> I am loving this razor.  </li>
            <li> The grip is also nice which ensures that it doesn&#x27;t slip and cause harm to the skin.</li>
            <li> nice shave plus massages ur face  </li>
            <li> It has a nice feel in your hands and having the battery installed for the micropulses</li>
            <li> I own</li>
            <li> Also the weight distribution on the handle is good and helps control the razor better while shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Can believe how nice of a shave I get.  </li>
            <li> Really is the perfect shaver.</li>
            <li> but you kind of ignore that part after a while.</li>
            <li> liked the feel in my hand as it glided across my skin.</li>
            <li> Although the handle was well weighted and held the blade to my face i am not too sure how much good</li>
            <li> With the power on this thing glides thru hair like a knife thru warm butter.  </li>
            <li> I received a  from a program that Gillette was running, and to be honest</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say i would not have bought a battery powered razor on my own.  </li>
            <li> I am basically an electric razor user but I have to admit that I really liked this blade.  </li>
            <li> There was something nice about its heft.</li>
            <li> The power feature was nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stylistic looking shaver handle with a nice grip.</li>
            <li> A nice clip on blade cover would be nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I get a great shave with both, but something about the vibration of the power razor makes the shave more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, if your the kind of guy who likes to have the newest tech out there, i recommend this razor for you.</li>
            <li> Quite honestly it didn&#x27;t add anything to my experience.</li>
            <li> Perfect razor, I guess there is nothing better than this in the market right now.</li>
            <li> Want a clean smooth shave without nicks then use this razor and you&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li> Received the a free razor via a program run by Gillette and was impressed with the closeness and clean shave.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for an amazing shave at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> The price is high, so I want to be very happy with a product before spending that kind of money.</li>
            <li> Trust me, it is well worth it!!!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is a great product for creating a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> The button is easy to find, the rubber grip is perfectly done, and the overall look and feel is just incredible.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor to anyone that is in need of the best shave of their life.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this razor and  highly recommend it</li>
            <li> the handle is amazing the new design fits perfect in your hand and the micropulse helps give one of the closest and smoothest shaves</li>
            <li> for many years now and have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> First, it gives an incredibly close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have since shaved with it a number of times and was impressed with how easily this razor does slide right across my face.</li>
            <li> All in all im extremely impressed with this razor and will recommend to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> I got this awesome new razor from a Gillette promo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would say it&#x27;s the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> This blade provides the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> It seems that regardless of brand, the blades keep getting better and better, but I&#x27;ve never found one with a good trimmer...until now!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The handle feels good in your hand and the razor is easily cleaned.</li>

            <li> The results are equally spectacular:  very smooth feel and NO cuts.  </li>
            <li> This razor does what it says, and the space between the blades stays remarkable clean as well.</li>
            <li> This razor does what it says, and the space between the blades stays remarkable clean as well.</li>
            <li> I thought that the handle was fine, I like the way it looks and feels, but I thought the shave was just as good</li>
            <li> The shave was great but nothing more than an original fusion shave.</li>
            <li> Everything about the package is great, easy to get into, no cuts on the hands, perfect way to remove the product from the back side.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that Gillette came up with the first electric slim handle on a razor!</li>
            <li> This is a very unique product and now its my favorite!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try the latest and greatest from the company.  </li>
            <li> can talk about the blades, but I&#x27;ll just sum them up by saying they offer a smooth, effortless shave with 0 irritation, as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about how good this razor was until I recieved it free from a program sponsered by Gilette.</li>
            <li> The thin/fine blades glided across my face, leaving me smooth yet still feeling good.  </li>
            <li> This was a nice feeling. :)&lt;</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

            <li> this razor is by far the best razor out there today, no doubt about it...</li>

            <li> For a good smooth shave, this is the razor to use.</li>

            <li> , in all, this razor performed excellently and I am now struggling whether or not to toss my old razors or not.</li>
            <li> A comfortable shave, a good feel in the hand, a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> The handle itself does have a good look to it though and it felt comfortable in my hands.  </li>
            <li> This razor is by far the best razor I have used in years!</li>
            <li> I also liked being able to use the powered razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The razor had a smooth glide over my skin (Fairly course stubble)</li>
            <li> The one thing that kind of did worry me off the bat is if I would be able to use this razor IN the shower, as nowhere on the instructions</li>
            <li> This razor is by far the best razor out there today, no doubt about it...</li>

            <li> That easy!</li>
            <li> The button that turns the razor on and off was easy to use, even with my oversized fingers!</li>
            <li> Another plus is the fact I am 4 shaves in (every 2 days) and the blade is still going strong!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this to fight against razor bumps and ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> It indeed makes it better, a closer, a more comfortable, and quicker shave!!</li>
            <li> - I had decided to really grow my hair out to give it a good test!</li>
            <li> This razor does a good job of what it is intended to do - give a clean, close shave and not cause razor burn in the process.</li>
            <li> If comfort and a close shave is more important than price then this is a good razor for you.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have noticed a slightly more comfortable glide with this over the Fusion Power.  </li>
            <li> I have also found that it helps create a nice smooth shave when combined with some  nice products.</li>
            <li> It has been a pleasure to have a good clean shave that is so effortless.  </li>

            <li> I can honestly say this is the best shave I have ever had in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product, always look forward to the great products the Gillette puts out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a great smooth and comfortable shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the shave was good, I experienced some tugging by the blade even when shaving a day old beard.</li>
            <li> It is very light and easy to hold and use!</li>
            <li> First of all, it MUST be noted that Gillette has made a great effort to rethinking plastic blister pack design.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it i didnt think it was all that great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend the money on one since I was happy with my electric, but after the first day - I&#x27;d buy one.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty great product.</li>
            <li> I tried the first fusion and it was not that great.  </li>
            <li> First off, I must say this is a great razor.  </li>
            <li> The power function combined with a great blade kept my face smooth and clean after shaving and did so in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> The 4 blades give a great shave and my wife, in particular, liked the FlexBall movement.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not like an amazing thing, but I found myself turning it on every day, even though it would be easy to just pick it up and shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great razor that demonstrates a significant improvement over the original product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like an amazing thing, but I found myself turning it on every day, even though it would be easy to just pick it up and shave.</li>
            <li> I loved it because it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and seemed to be adequately lubricated.  </li>
            <li> The razor handle was easy to grip and handle, and the vibrating handle made all the difference in the world for a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li> The handle was a nice size and easy to grip.  </li>

            <li> First impression - looks very nice</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the battery in the hand razor to be very useful, but the vibration surprisingly helps during shaving and allowed me a very close and smooth shave that my wife loved!  </li>
            <li> Fits into your and easily, light weight and love the vibrating feature!  </li>
            <li> I received this razor free from a program from Gillette and i am so glad i did!</li>
            <li> It shaves smooth and my shave lasts atleast 5 days or more!</li>
            <li> I gave it a try and was impressed with the shave and the smooth finish but that would happen with any new blade.</li>

            <li> I feel like I get a better shave with this razor without no nicks.</li>
            <li> think the Fusion ProGlide Power handle looks quite a bit better than the Mach 3,</li>
            <li> and I think I may have found my favorite</li>
            <li> I prefer a bit more of an angle between the blades and the handle, but this straighter line seems to be where most newer handles are going.</li>
            <li> That being said, I love the weight and feel of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I have done this on more than one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found it distracting and obtained much better results after turning it off.</li>
            <li> This handle is so light!</li>
            <li> I was provided with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor to try and I was extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> but I got about twice as many shaves out of them than with others</li>
            <li> I also love the fact there was no irritation when shaving With this razor</li>
            <li> Love it, love everything about</li>
            <li> I was a nice smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have tried just about every razor on the market,most are ok, some better than the others.</li>
            <li> Receiving this razor to try for free was definitely amazing.</li>
            <li> have a Gillete Fusion (non-battery operated version) that I&#x27;ve used for more than a year now.  </li>
            <li> The battery-operated version is much more efficient than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li> do believe this is the best overall product for shaving on the market.  </li>
            <li> do believe this is the best overall product for shaving on the market.  </li>
            <li> just wish these were a bit more affordable and that there was some sort of subscription club from Gillete itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li> I started out using the Mach3 (3 blade) razor which I thought was ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this made me wonder if there was an even a better product out there and encouraged me to purchase the manual Gillette Fusion (5 blade) razor.</li>
            <li> (this was still way better than the Mach3 Turbo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the blades on this free razor I received as part of a Gilette program are top notch, I have to be honest: I have no idea what the vibration is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Since that time I have purchased more blades and will continue to do</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Handle gave me one of the best overall shaves that I can remember.</li>
            <li> free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and gave me the opportunity to try this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Gillette.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it in the bath tub as well, with the same flawless results.  </li>
            <li> I love the look and styling of the handling.  </li>
            <li> But the blade did give a nice close, smooth shave</li>
            <li> Its comfortable and has a nice grip to it.</li>
            <li> Fortunately,I received the ProGlide Power Razor free in a program run by Gillette!</li>
            <li> That being said, I really enjoyed this razor, and have purchased it since.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by by the ease of use simply by inserting the battery into the handle.  </li>
            <li> The Fusuion proglide provided a nice, smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li> I like he fact that even though the razor contains a battery, it is still safe to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The shave I get is so smooth!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m getting a shave that is any better or closer</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and the shave is sooooooo close with zero razor burn!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is all that it says and more.</li>
            <li> now I will use this one because it actually is the best out there.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Gillette products.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find anything that worked better for me.</li>
            <li> I always assumed the best shave came from the number of blades but nowadays, with razors having more and more blades than the last model, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Gillette for many years.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are better than any I have used before, leaving me with the closest, smoothest shave I have had in decades.</li>
            <li> The blades, the power, the combination of the two make this my favorite razor of all time.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it once I tried it though.</li>
            <li> I must say the Gilette is 10X better comparatively.  </li>
            <li> I will say that throughout my shave I felt nothing but amazing painless smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how well this product worked and suggest it to anyone who shaves on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The best part is the shaves actually seem to get better the longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been VERY happy with the razor and will definitely continue to use this as my go-to razor from now on.  </li>
            <li> I received this razor for free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The vibration from this razor makes the hair on my face stick up more</li>
            <li> after 2 shaves to be able to tell though.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> It is my favorite, my holy grail, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> There is an improved grip on the blade side of the razor that allows a better hold when the handle is wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did love the blade.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like I get a better shave with</li>
            <li> She liked the feel of the razor and the smooth shave she got.  </li>
            <li> The handle of the Gillette Fusion had just the appropriate amount of rubber to stay in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Even though this was given to me free from Gilette i will buy it in a heartbeat and will use the refills!</li>
            <li> my surprise, the shave was noticeably better with the ProGlide.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> The handle is shaped nice to fit into your hand and the power button is placed</li>
            <li> and I can shave more often without my skin paying for it.  </li>
            <li> This tended to make shaving take longer, as I found myself going over some spots more than ones</li>
            <li> even more so when you are using a powered razor,</li>
            <li> Glad that I had the opportunity to try this.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like it or of it would even make a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to try this out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to go over any spot more than once.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I noticed it is even better than the Fusion ProGlide</li>
            <li> Yes :)</li>
            <li> I mostly use the cheapest razors I can find, but after getting a sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide power handle</li>
            <li> I sure everyone has that one area of your face, chin, or neck</li>
            <li> &quot; this handle helps provide is more mind over matter.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t love either.</li>
            <li> and the handle is comfortable and amazing to use...</li>
            <li> so nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I received it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> Prior to using the razor, the best shave I could get that was mostly painfree was with the Gilette Fusion (non-battery operated version).  </li>
            <li> I have to say, this razor is so much better than even that one.  </li>
            <li> I love the vibrating handle.  </li>
            <li> I was able to shave under my nose.  </li>
            <li> This battery-loaded handle, although it provides an interesting vibration feature, is none of those things.  </li>
            <li> Able to hold on to it and shave with confidence.</li>
            <li> The gillette fusion pro glide handle is ok.</li>
            <li> I love the way it shaves because I was able to shave without having any hair tugged out of my skin.</li>
            <li> (I wished I had more face to shave).</li>
            <li> I am in love with my ProGlide Power razor.  </li>
            <li> Well the proglide power has definitely proved itself among the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I think it evens cleans better under running water while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I must say I really do love Gillette&#x27;s handles for their razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received the razor free through a Gillette program and this review is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed a nice nick free shave.</li>
            <li> handle is better then the Gillette Power trimmer.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is an amazing device that enhances a truly smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The handle I feel is more of a gimmick.</li>
            <li> so for the most part I just used the cheapest i could find and tossed them after one use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> I received this as a freebie, and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t pay for it.</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Handle.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave 5 times without noticing any problems.  </li>
            <li> I was even able to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the fact that it requires a battery to operate though, I&#x27;m perfectly content with and actually prefer the battery-less options.</li>
            <li> I received this razor via a program run by Gillete and I liked the Gillete Fusion Proglide because it glided along my face smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The head of the Fusion razor is more compact and I feel like it gets closer to my skin and does a better job getting into the tricky part under my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love being able to use this in the shower and not feeling like it&#x27;s going to slip out of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I ended up liking the power razor better than the manual.</li>
            <li> I seemed to have a better, closer shave with the power turned on.</li>
            <li> Manuel was way better in my opinion and cheaper.</li>
            <li> since the trend to powered razors has started I&#x27;ve tried several and haven&#x27;t been very impressed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more about the shaving cream and the after shave, but</li>
            <li> Anyway, I gave this a try, and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I also love that this works so well on my underarms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> The best deal is when you buy it with the extra Cartridges.    </li>
            <li> Overall i am impressed, give me some more stars to add :)</li>
            <li> I was able to pivot the razor and change directions with ease, no cuts, no nicks, and no razor burns.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the Proglide Fusion which I received from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the vibration</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Gillette Mach 3 for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> The women will love you and your close, clean-smelling shave.</li>
            <li> The women will love you and your close, clean-smelling shave.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been shaving a beard for decades and has tried out many, many razors during that time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More than they asked for!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was the Gillette I stuck with for many years.</li>
            <li> I felt more in control and got a much better shave that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> and I can surely find cheaper brands that work just as well.</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> and I can surely find cheaper brands that work just as well.</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> gives the best shave that I&#x27;ve come across outside of barbershop.    </li>
            <li> It does what it says, it glides better on your face.  </li>
            <li> The micropulses still do not provide a greater degree of comfort over a razor that lacks this feature.  </li>
            <li> For the most part I think I&#x27;ll stick to safety razor for the bulk of my shaving and then finish up the \\&quot;scary\\&quot; areas with the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they have some lovely marketing but in the end</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY LOVE THE POWER VERSION.</li>
            <li> It seemed to float over his skin, and it left it in the best condition that I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> for the rest of the features, I&#x27;m sure Gillette made some incremental improvements</li>
            <li> this translates to not only getting great shaves, but to saving a lot of money!</li>
            <li> my surprise, the Proglide Power was FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> I notice it on cleanup for sure.</li>
            <li> But as I began to take stock in all the models I have used over the years, I found something interesting...</li>
            <li> Interesting, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I simply cannot justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper.</li>
            <li> The Schick handles still feel MUCH better and heftier.</li>
            <li> more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I could have went a couple more days</li>
            <li> I was so glad to be offered something that my husband could use...</li>
            <li> Any more than that</li>
            <li> The battery is over the top.</li>
            <li> Too many blades and again a battery?</li>
            <li> The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:    1)</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Much more satisfying to use than anything made of plastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Merkur model 180 for five years now, and love it.</li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working or not.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro is a bit more imprecise.</li>
            <li> While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn&#x27;t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.    </li>
            <li> The power version also has a feature that claims to guide the hairs in straighter for a more close, even cut.</li>
            <li> We have much more of our bodies to shave than they do.  </li>
            <li> or if it made it better in any way.  </li>
            <li> Using the Proglide I can confidently shave at a pace that is about 4 times faster without nick concerns.  </li>
            <li> In defense of double edges, they still remain the best performance/price ratio of any disposable razor.</li>
            <li> what the heck, the more blades the better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resisted the temptation to purchase Gillette&#x27;s \\&quot;shaver of the moment\\&quot; because I was satisfied with what I had.  </li>
            <li> I go more than 48 hours without shaving - 2 things happen.  </li>
            <li> - more than 1 of them will bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my latest bout with this issue I decided to give this baby a try.</li>
            <li> and love the design for my scalp, and tried the FaceBlade[[ASIN:B003LY2E3I HeadBlade FaceBlade Travel Razor]].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a closer, easier, more efficient shave, even from my</li>
            <li> so I would have the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s surely what i didn&#x27;t get from this one.</li>
            <li> I truly don&#x27;t see how Gillette will be able to improve on this.    </li>
            <li> , I just think this product is really outstanding).</li>
            <li> Hi folks,  After more than a decade of electric razor use I decided to try a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I started out on the Gillette Mach 3, which went ok, and then saw a demo of the vibrating Fusion Proglide at a store.</li>
            <li> I also shave against the grain all the time to get the best shave possible.</li>
            <li> This razor does the job but is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> Whatever the case, shaving has never felt better, nor lasted longer than it has with this razor.  </li>
            <li> But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  </li>
            <li> I have had it just a week, but my usage has been outstanding.</li>
            <li> more that a dollar a piece.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The best shave will come from a double edged safety razor - and these blades can be recycled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the Gillette marketers make you think you are getting more because you paid more -</li>
            <li> I was planning on ordering couple more for my brother and dad.</li>
            <li> unless I find something better, I will continue to use this razor for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Flexball handle prevents a lot of irritation by providing a smoother, more contoured shave that hugs the face.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Bzzagent from Gillette!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a gimmick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shaving my lip with a lot more confidence now...</li>
            <li> I love how it feels to shave with.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Gillette,  to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Have been using Gillette razors for years and always got the latest one to try to eliminate cuts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors over my lifetime.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it....</li>
            <li> I have seen so many advertisements on TV and on YouTube for this razor.</li>
            <li> Of course, you will not be able to tell because of the smoothness of the shave.</li>
            <li> The duration of the blade is better than standar Fusion.</li>
            <li> There was no gliding at all, it was more like grinding.</li>
            <li> The truth is that I kept on buying into the newer razors that came out thinking they were better</li>
            <li> So all in all the Mach 3 manual and power were better than the Sensor excel 2 and 3 blade razors up to now.    </li>
            <li> I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved.</li>
            <li> Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help.</li>
            <li> not as many cuts, with this one :-)</li>
            <li> The five-blade cluster is more than just gimmickry, it provides a wider shaving area, which is more stable as you shave.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> it ok</li>
            <li> but there are better one i try</li>
            <li> Many others then came out with safety razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I give five stars for the interest of all mankind, I just had the closest shave EVER (and I have had many, including from straight-blade razors).</li>
            <li> Many people seem to complain about the vibrations.</li>
            <li> He still said that power version of this was better.</li>
            <li> don’t know whether it’s a placebo or what, but the vibrating handle does seem to make for a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> and im satisfied</li>
            <li> It delivers most of the time; I just wish it were always.</li>
            <li> love this razor because of the close shave and no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying more soon...</li>
            <li> It is also somehow more invigorating to shave with the power version.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have (as I did) or can still get blades for this.</li>
            <li> The battery powered viration feature lessens the friction for sure.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that for me it actualy caused more friction and micro cuts.</li>
            <li> When I tuend it off I got a much better shave.</li>
            <li> I am able to shave with the grain and against the grain on my neck and face without any irritation or razor burn.   </li>
            <li> Amazon \\&quot;Top Rated\\&quot; directed me to an old-school Merkur double-edged safety razor, and I read up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not convinced that they are anything more than a marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li> It has more power than most razors.</li>
            <li> When Gillette offered to give me a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to try - I figured sure - I&#x27;ll try it.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a great design and doesn&#x27;t slip like the old razor I used (one of the reasons i liked the electric better then).  </li>
            <li> The battery is safely sealed from water, so you don&#x27;t have to worry when using it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the LED light up power button.</li>
            <li> Overall this is the best razor ever!</li>
            <li> Overall the razor is the best razor that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My frame of mind is that the blades are sharper or at a better angle, or maybe it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had my Mach 3 handle for many years, and hopefully this lasts just as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must say this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> It also made shaving ore enjoyable.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure the vibrating would make a difference</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power both with the power off and with the power on and with the power on the shave was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> and my expectations were it would not do me any better than the Fusion Pro I used .</li>
            <li> I have used it for several weeks and find the shave the best that I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll end up spending more</li>
            <li> Drop the price on these razors and you will sell more, Gillette.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoyed this razor.  </li>
            <li> it feels like i got a better shave</li>
            <li> I was provided this gilette razor through a promotion, and I could not be more pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The head shaving is what has kept me a Quattro user for so many years, as the Quattro has protective wires that keep me from inadvertently scalping myself.</li>
            <li> The Gillette razor has no such wires, but I&#x27;m a daring guy, so I gave it a shot, and was very impressed.</li>
            <li> I love the handle on this razor.  </li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve always liked Gillette products and they gave to me to try for free</li>
            <li> The experience was better</li>
            <li> LOVE the vibration</li>
            <li> Overall this is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li> If I skipped more than a day of shaving, forget it.  </li>
            <li> There was no tugging and pulling, just a nice smooth shave, after one pass.  </li>
            <li> This is simple the best.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this razor.</li>
            <li> The handle and grip is comfortable, has a nice design and looks &amp; feels sturdy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Am a Gillette user and love all their products.</li>
            <li> I think I will be using this more often now.</li>
            <li> power is more convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether or not mechanized handles are better than electric shavers?</li>
            <li> When I got the Razor I wanted to compare it to the others I have used with the thought that it  could not be that much better</li>
            <li> my favorite razor</li>
            <li> was better about it.  </li>
            <li> It felt like I had more control over my shave, just because of the shape/weight of the handle.  </li>
            <li> The razor with 4 blades and a vibrator is Ok</li>
            <li> 4 blade approach is that much better.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of taking several shorter strokes to shave, I found the Proglide Power Handle worked best if I used one continuous stroke.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a number of their razors over the years and have always been satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> To start with I love the handle.</li>
            <li> I Love This product ..</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the shave.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free as part of a Gillette market study for honest opinions of the product.</li>
            <li> But that happens to me with most razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the flexibility of the razor to help adapt to the different contours of my face.  </li>
            <li> The gripping surfaces made it easier to maintain control of the razor while getting the look you want.  </li>
            <li> but I was thrilled when I received a free Fusion Proglide Power Handle through a program Gillette was running.</li>
            <li> Therefore, allowing you a better grip while shaving.  </li>
            <li> What can one say about what is probably one of America&#x27;s favorite razor that hasn&#x27;t already been said.</li>
            <li> The Proglide Power Razor performed outstanding on my day to day morning shave.  </li>
            <li> She uses men&#x27;s shavers anyway, she says they cut better than women&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Safe to say that this thing has come</li>
            <li> I love the auto shutdown (safety)</li>
            <li> I love the way this fits in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the handle.</li>
            <li> tell you what, too, I&#x27;m so glad I got the chance to try it.  </li>
            <li> It honestly gave me the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I do not think I will be replacing this razor with something else, because I am that pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Combined with the ProGlide blades (which I reviewed separately) and my preferred shaving gel (Currently using Anthony for Men), I get some of the best shaves</li>
            <li> I love the vibrating handle</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed my experience with the handle.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this razor.  </li>
            <li> This shaver provides a smooth shave!  </li>
            <li> The handle is interesting because it vibrates.  </li>
            <li> More than I&#x27;m use to paying for blades</li>
            <li> best shave ever, battery lasting 5+ months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many razors that are targeted for women, and none of them measure up, including Gillette&#x27;s women&#x27;s version of this razor.  </li>
            <li> Using the vibration the result is even better.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this out via  a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> , I noticed when shaving it gives you a nice close and smooth shave with massaging comfort in from the handle to the blade.</li>
            <li> help me have more control over the handle</li>
            <li> What this smooth!</li>
            <li> I have tried it many times both ways, with it vibrating and without it vibrating.</li>
            <li> There is also more rubber on the underside</li>
            <li> Overall I get an excellent shave without worrying about nicks or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think a better use would be when you turn on the unit if the lights flash</li>
            <li> and I am thinking I will get a couple more shaves.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to get one.  </li>
            <li> I was given a Proglide as a promotion and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> The Proglide was just a tad better.  </li>
            <li> However, that said, if you use coupons and shop around you can get a good price, and this razor is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> the power is superfluous ，I used gillette 3 which i think is better than this one ，although this is the update</li>
            <li> I must say I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> Its stylish and sleek.  </li>
            <li> Razor and blade were provided free from Gillette!  </li>
            <li> It gave me a nice smooth shave with no irritation or razor burn.</li>
            <li> Another thing I really love is that it can be used it the shower, with no problem.</li>
            <li> Love this razor</li>
            <li> The razor is OK and I will probably purchase it in stores.</li>
            <li> I was able to try out this handle.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured Gillete would have built a product that conformed to the user&#x27;s hand better, but this razor is not it.</li>
            <li> I love the way the handle fits in my hand for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure about using this but really happy that I did</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for sure</li>
            <li> Like everything else in life, there comes a time when you need to upgrade it to something better and newer</li>
            <li> By using the vibration feature I was actually able to get a closer shave than without the vibrations.  </li>
            <li> love my Gillette Fusion Power Proglide Handle razor.....</li>
            <li> I am able to get 5 uses out of the cartridge before I have to change it.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything that I can&#x27;t stand more, than having to fight to get your product out of its packaging to use it.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the packaging on this product being the easiest to open that I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> razor contours nicely to your face and offers a great shave.</li>
            <li> All in all, the blades on this razor are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Most times I use an electric razor followed up with a blade razor (no shaving cream).  </li>
            <li> Look/style: It looks stylish.  </li>
            <li> One to two passes at most.</li>
            <li> I never thought the vibrating handle would have made a difference in how it shaved, actually being worried about being cut by the vibrating blades, but instead I most impressed with the smoothness of the pull as you drew the blades across your face, and the result was a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the convenience of home delivery, but the quality of the shave wasn&#x27;t quite there and the comfort of the handle wasn&#x27;t even close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels so much better after using the  Fusion Proglide Power.  </li>
            <li> And my face looks a lot better too.  </li>
            <li> the grip seems feel more controllable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to go two days without shaving and not look like a hobo....</li>
            <li> And considering that I shave my head also, I have more area to cover :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> easily more than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the experience.</li>
            <li> I have had the same blade on this razor for almost 4 weeks now and I am happy to report no razor burn or bumps!  </li>
            <li> Glad I took a chance and made the switch.</li>
            <li> They provide a close shave and a safe shave.</li>
            <li> Although, as said, they are top of the line - the price still makes you think twice before buying.</li>
            <li> knowing this, I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it and am glad that I got it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the shape of the handle</li>
            <li> I received a free razor from a Program ran by Gillette!</li>
            <li> The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette!</li>
            <li> I slack on shaving more</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a chance it could make more of a difference when the blade becomes a bit more used</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fairly confident this improvement was from the power</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I do love it.</li>
            <li> For years I have tried many razors and systems that have come out on the market.</li>
            <li> The Power Handle feature is ok</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li> got slapped on the hand for claiming that these vibrating razors helped a person get a better shave by stimulating the hairs to stand up.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it once I tried it though.</li>
            <li> It would make more sense to have the button where the thumb ends up when gripping the handle.</li>
            <li> I also love the way the razor fits in my hand.  </li>
            <li> but if I ever miss a day, I have to use the Power ProGlide because it just works so much better.</li>
            <li> Compared to using a three blade I did notice a better looking and closer shave with the five blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle on the razor is superb and much more accommodating to larger hands and fingers than competitor handles.</li>
            <li> I love the closeness I got while using the power razor.</li>
            <li> it provides an effortless, close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> 5 blades is way better than the 3 I started off with with my mach 3.  </li>
            <li> but I would gladly have paid the 10 bucks for it.</li>
            <li> but I love it</li>
            <li> I still use that most days because it&#x27;s quicker to use than lathering up and shaving with the Proglide, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li> Not as bulky and fat, not that many blades, easier to shave under the nose and around the lips.  </li>
            <li> I just feel like the industry can do a lot better at making shaving more luxurious.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine has been extolling the greatness of this product for many months now.</li>
            <li> I must say that I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Still, I was satisfied just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is SOO much better than the razors I had become accustomed to using.</li>
            <li> Do they cost more?</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I just love this razor.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with it but am worried about the price of blade refills costing to much.  </li>
            <li> a much better shaver feel if the handle were to be made a bit more substantial feeling.</li>
            <li> The handle is ergonomically designed for a better grip in the shower and out, and helps with given a better, closer shave.</li>
            <li> and I think I may have found my favorite.</li>
            <li> I started using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor this week and love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for many years now and I haven&#x27;t used a better razor than the Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> The ProGlide Power Blades are even better.</li>
            <li> When shaving more of the blade is not even being used.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the weight and feel of this razor</li>
            <li> If it sat at more of an angle, it would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes sure you get a close shave every time.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  </li>
            <li> The vibration is supposed to help you get a better shave, but I do not notice a difference when it is turned on or when it is off.</li>
            <li> My shave experience was faster, easier on my skin &amp; more precise then ever before!</li>
            <li> Besides the blades providing a top notch shave, the handle was top of the line as well.</li>
            <li> and I will spread the word that it is a worthwhile razor to have.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide Power Handle which I received for free from Gillette is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Gillette and it does give a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of change but am I glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got to try, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for it.</li>
            <li> because how many times can it get better.  </li>
            <li> I wouldnt be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle now has more ergonomic grips for better control, it snaps snugly into the included plastic holder n stays in place</li>
            <li> Suffice to say when I tried it after not having shaved for a couple of days, it pulled and tugged even more.</li>
            <li> and I think it evens cleans better under running water while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> And more than once I&#x27;ve been subjected to &#x27;razor burn&#x27; from these</li>
            <li> I tend to use my blades longer than most, trying to get the most for my money.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure it did any better than the fusion.</li>
            <li> When asked by Gillette to try the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I thought that it was just another gimmick product to get you to spend more.  </li>
            <li> The shave always leaves my face feeling smooth everytime!</li>
            <li> I got this razor free to try from Gillette, and this is by far the best razor that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend the power handle - but will keep using it to see if I get better performance after more practice.</li>
            <li> The greater heft gave me the impression of more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the shave</li>
            <li> The blade gives a nice close, smooth shave and it doesn&#x27;t pull at all.  </li>
            <li> did it mention that it was safe.</li>
            <li> done, I was happy that I was not nicked anywhere and was very content with my shave.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best disposable razors around.</li>
            <li> The power button is on the handle so you are able to turn it on and off.</li>
            <li> The vibrating feature helps make your shaving experience much more relaxing.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not something to use for many years, I would say that it&#x27;s handle</li>
            <li> provides better feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This might one of the better razors I have used.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I had the opportunity to try this product through the Gillette sampling program they just ran.</li>
            <li> Honestly of all the razors I have tried this one has proven to be the smoothest and most comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I prefer this blade for shaving my legs for cycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> - I felt like it helped the razor glide better on my skin.</li>
            <li> The handle is just the right size and fits in your hand nicely and the grips are nice to keep from dropping the razor when shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> used it to shave my head and face would recommend this to everyone  great clean silky smooth shave and got it for free from gillette</li>
            <li> The shave was very good and smooth, but since my beard is not very tough to begin with, it was not noticeably better when I turned it on vs.</li>
            <li> head is fairly tender but provided me with a clean and smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle was very comfortable and easy to maneuver and it really gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to see the advantages of using the power razor.  </li>
            <li> First off the handle has a great shape and really gives u a good grip on it while shaving.</li>
            <li> Flat out the best razor you can buy under $25.  </li>
            <li> This is a great new shave!</li>
            <li> When I got the chance to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as part of a free program from Gillette, I was pretty happy to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars since it did produce a nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues getting a nice clean shave, but thats not the case anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the close clean shave</li>
            <li> A nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me a nice clean shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li> this particular model does a great job</li>
            <li> I did feel that the vibrations led to a nice, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am still impressed by how comfortable it is to use with no drag or pulling.  </li>
            <li> I went without shaving for 3 days to make sure I had a pretty good amount of hair grown out.</li>
            <li> I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle for free via a program run by Gillette, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to shave and was smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for great shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and we highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For me the blade cost wouldn&#x27;t be high because it&#x27;s a great price/qualty/value.  </li>
            <li> in all, a great product - I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is another great high quality Gillette razor system.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for great shave.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle is a great new concept that makes my shave that much better.</li>
            <li> The handle is a nice fit and weight in my hand, and it is easy to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The razor provides a very clean and close shave without causing any nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the battery fits easily inside of the razor, so it&#x27;s very light to carry.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The handle is very comfortable in my hand and washes up easily.</li>
            <li> For normal use on your face it was great.</li>
            <li> But since the opportunity came up to give this a shot I figured it was worth trying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately impressed with how smooth the shave was and how much closer it felt.</li>
            <li> The weight of the handle and battery feels pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best bladed razor I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> This razor is one of the best I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking at the price, this is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For a long time now, I&#x27;ve been using a Mach 3 razor (1st generation), and have been very happy with it also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my wife loved the gillette fusion proguide styler first time in a while that i could trim without redness .This</li>
            <li> Still a pretty good shave though.</li>
            <li> When i got my razor my first impression was good.</li>
            <li> After 6 shaves the strip still looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The weight of the handle and battery feels pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> First the pro&#x27;s:  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is light weight, easy to handle and maneuver and produces a great close shave with no nicks.  </li>
            <li> At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water.</li>
            <li> I normally use an electric razor, but this razor provides a great deal more precision for my shave and the vibration is helpful to make for a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The new fusion proglide power handle is great.  </li>
            <li> When trying this product they made it seem as though there was something new and great about it.</li>
            <li> When this on amazon and for a great price I picked up a new Razor.  </li>
            <li> The new blade arrangement and battery power make a great combination.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of hearing how great her new razor worked, I gave in and purchased the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The new design looks great as well.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a nice holder to keep it save from kids and even has a reflective mirror for quick shaves.  </li>
            <li> The handle made it easy to follow the contours of my face...giving me greater connection between face and blade.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Handle made it a pleasant experience and flowed across my skin with a very gentile feel.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I love this razor and its really easy shave.  </li>
            <li> Also, the blades do not bend easily or get out of shape which makes them work better for longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to try it for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> It feels much more comfortable to hold, probably do to the greater thickness.  </li>
            <li> Got a great shave, very close and smooth.</li>
            <li> After use, the razor fit snugly into its holder and provided the best position for drying the razor until the next use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Right off the bat, the \\&quot;micro pulse\\&quot; feature of the razor was quite interesting and the thinner blades made the shave more comfortable and smoother result.</li>
            <li> So now, I got my free razor from Gillette, love it and plan on getting more razors/blades...</li>
            <li> To top it all off, safety razors are more environmentally sound than the plasticky Gillettes.  </li>
            <li> great thing with this is that it&#x27;s a regular razor till you turn it on, so you can get a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> I will update this review after I have used it more as to blade/battery life, but so far it is great.</li>
            <li> After trying Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I was left very impressed at the smooth and close shave it provided.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to get a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have been able to try this for free.</li>
            <li> I loved that this handle was very sturdy and was able to control it with ease.</li>
            <li> Gave a great shave as my skin tends to be very sensitive to razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever experienced (and I have a very sensitive neck).</li>
            <li> But the best part of the RAZR is the single edge blade that makes it very easy to get clean to find lines in my beard.</li>
            <li> The five blade shave plus the single blade edger plus the electric handle equals the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> The five blade shave plus the single blade edger plus the electric handle equals the best shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It allowed for a quick, easy, and smooth shave, which was very satisfying because I am not always able to get the smoothest of shaves.  </li>
            <li> the most effective tool for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed right away was that nothing was rattling or shaking around.</li>
            <li> The first shave is always great on many razors but this was great for a long time.</li>
            <li> This razor is very comfortable to handle which is important in a razor.  </li>
            <li> Being in a job where I need to shave every day, having a quality razor, and one that&#x27;s economically sound is very important.  </li>
            <li> I used this razor, which I got for free from a Gillette program, and the shave it gave me was very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to receive a free Fusion Proglide Power Razor to try out.  </li>
            <li> This was a free razor provided by Gillette as part of a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle itself is very comfortable in your hand while in use.</li>
            <li> I was easily able to grasp it and fine tune my grip for maximum control.</li>
            <li> this handle works great, but did not feel superior to some of the other razor handles I have used.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I love about this razor handle, is that if fits perfectly into my razor holder which is attached to my mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s superior to the other multi-blade razors in its class, and with the month-long life of the edge of the blades, the impact on your wallet is greatly lessened as well.</li>
            <li> Schick then came out with the quattro 4 blade(the original first one) which was Ok and provided a good close shave</li>
            <li> This razor is super easy to use, and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> It was a nice clean, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice, clean, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I can hold it more tightly, and confidently, and get the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Very cool, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Overall, its a very good handle for shaving.  </li>
            <li> overall great handle very easy to use i&#x27;m going to continue on using it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> I love this razor and handle and the power buttom makes a huge difference i didnt think it would</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin, no cuts or irritations.</li>
            <li> It works exactly like you&#x27;d want it to, feels nice in the hand and just for a cherry on top</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like the vibrations bring the hair closer to the skins surface for a closer more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> But if money is no object, or if you really need a more comfortable shave, this would be a good razor for you.</li>
            <li> this is probably the most comfortable grip I&#x27;ve had on any razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> razor did what it says and delivers a close smooth shave, I felt it was better than the hydro.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try the Fusion ProGlide Power free from a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> When I first received the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program by Gillette, I looked at the handle and laughed.</li>
            <li> I feel this product gives me a closer shave, and feels more comfortable when shaving.</li>
            <li> I found the handle comfortable to hold, though I suspect its size has more to do with the need to accommodate an AAA battery than with ergonomic design considerations.  </li>
            <li> The blades are smooth and with the vibrations, are able to eliminate the ingrown hair situation that I had been experiencing.</li>
            <li> This razor was free from a Gillette promotion.&lt;br /&gt;The blades on this razor a OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li> The vibrating gives you a slightly more comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> I received the razor free from a program by Gillette and boy was I glad.  </li>
            <li> It shaves more smoothly and faster than any razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Honestly, anything that scrapes the hair off my face and doesn&#x27;t leave me bleeding is pretty much OK in my book.</li>
            <li> received the Proglide Power Handle as a promotion from Gillette, but I would be more than willing to make this purchase on my own.</li>
            <li> I got it for free to try, from Gillete, but I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It gave me the smoothest most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> You can buy a cheaper razor, but I doubt you&#x27;ll find one that will give you a smoother, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle free through a program Gillette was running.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a free Gillette Fusion Proglide through a promotion from Gillette and the results have been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power gave me the closest most comfortable shave that I have ever had at home.  </li>
            <li> in the end it was the most comfortable shave that I have gotten at home</li>
            <li> I was able to receive a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Because it gives a close, smooth, and knick-free shave I absolutely love it--5 stars all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But as to the razor itself (or more precisely, its blades), I have to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> But as to the razor itself (or more precisely, its blades), I have to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more that I enjoy than lathering up my Rooney silvertip badger and shaving on a weekend morning.  </li>
            <li> You maybe able to get a 10/10 baby butt smooth shave with a Thiers</li>
            <li> But if money is no object, or if you really need a more comfortable shave, this would be a good razor for you.</li>
            <li> I am always trying to find shaving products to give me a closer and more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I was able to land this razor free.  </li>
            <li> The shave was close, smooth, and he actually enjoyed using the razor.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I lathered up and was amazed as the razor glided effortlessly over my face and through the stubble, giving the smoothest, most comfortable shave that I have had.</li>
            <li> This is the best 10$ I ever spent.</li>
            <li> More blades, more power, and whatever else their powerful marketing machine is able to drum up.  </li>
            <li> bulkier and seem to provide a cleaner more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for the 20 blade, vibrating, self lubricating, razor that compliments you on your technique as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;Because of that I&#x27;ve still been scavenging Mach 3 blades (still a great razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear</li>
            <li> He says it gives him a really great, close shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin (he says it feels soft afterward).  </li>
            <li> Gillette razors in general are just great, regardless of the latest gadget they&#x27;ve added to their newest razor.  </li>
            <li> and it was much more comfortable then</li>
            <li> If you want the most baby skin smooth head and face, you will want to try this razor.</li>
            <li> They never gave me a great shave, but I chocked that up to my sensitive skin and thought razor burn and bumps were unavoidable.</li>
            <li> I shave every day, and have tried everything to make it more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I used it both with the power turned on and off and the vibrations do give me a closer and more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I was able to go against the grain pain free and it was probably the closest shave that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> The pulses were smoother and made the shave more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> even more effortless smooth</li>
            <li> Got the free razor from Gillette and first impression was good on looks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to apply any after shave lotions too since this worked out great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The most comfortable shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE is the most technologically advanced ever.</li>
            <li> SO SMOOTH THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was part of the free trial program, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vibrating head and blades make for one of the smoothest and most comfortable</li>
            <li> While i thought the vibration in the power handle was nothing more than a cheap gimmick</li>
            <li> Really glad I received this free from a Gillette program, it gave me another chance to try a razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really great if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor is my favorite of all of the widely available supermarket brand razors.  </li>
            <li> While the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, I would have gladly paid for it in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> Also it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received this free razor via a program run by Gilette and have been pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> The first shave, as with most first shaves, was great.  </li>
            <li> I am used to the old convention of using the Blade and found this as a great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products all of my adult life (40+ years), and have always been happy with them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Liked the light weight and overall great unit for the money.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can use it in the shower and the handle has a battery indicator light.</li>
            <li> The handle feels great in your hand, and is not heavy at all, even though it has a battery powering it.</li>
            <li> It is realy smooth shaving, My wife even love it .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion power glide handle is the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s able to mimic the smooth and effortless glide of an electric razor while shaving as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> The ProGlide Power handle is comfortable to use--way better than disposables.</li>
            <li> give you a closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor many times BEFORE receiving a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was given a free razor which was provided via a program run by Gillette and am so glad I was.  </li>
            <li> the handle on this razor is incredibly well balanced and fits well in the hand, giving me ultimate control of the blade.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this free razor from a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> The Proglide has a nice sturdy grip that can be held comfortably and the vibration allows for an easy and clean shave.</li>
            <li> The vibrating gives you a slightly more comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> The 5 blade razor has a pivoting head which flowed with the contours of my face providing me with a close, comfortable, and sexy ( my wife&#x27;s words) shave.</li>
            <li> far as the actual shave, this razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve used in giving a good, close shave.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor out for free, it did</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took part in this free razor program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> the rabid vibration paired with the power blade makes my morning go much more [smooth.]</li>
            <li> However even though I was able to try it for free, I still tell friends and family to go buy it because it works so well for me.</li>
            <li> I received this free to try from Gillette and am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Fusion Proglide Razor is already the most comfortable,</li>
            <li> The best handle I&#x27;ve used is on the Schick Xtreme - curved, lots of ridges to get a good grip (especially when using in the shower), and a convenient indent towards the end where your thumb naturally goes.  </li>
            <li> I have never had my skin feel this smooth from a shave except maybe when I had no hair on my face. :-)  </li>
            <li> As the day went on I was able to feel some roughness on the the fusion side of my face while the proglide remand relatively smooth.</li>
            <li> I received a fusion proglide power free through a program run by Gillette, and I have to say that this razor doesn&#x27;t perform any better than the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave with the additional trim blade on top.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I buy this one pay 2$, so is a good deal, the quality is very well.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a really good razor that doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;tag &amp; pull\\&quot; sensation and this razor really does the job.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I picked up kits for my sons.     </li>
            <li> I really liked this razor and it would be worth the money to buy it.</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVED how much faster it was at shaving than my now behated Quattro.</li>
            <li> Ive always been a Gillette fan, but this razor is powerful &amp; extremely effective...</li>
            <li> Well worth it for the nice shave.</li>
            <li> the M3 was the best I had tried before, but this new Fusion Proglide actually is pretty comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The blade across the top is actually pretty handy , it shaved close to my nose and made sideburns even and easy.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to grip and a cinch to clean, even in the shower!</li>
            <li> easy to clean and well built too!</li>
            <li> Firstly, when I started shaving the Gillette sensor excel 2 blade was excellent and provided a good shave with less to no irritation at all when used with a shave gel.</li>
            <li> The new handle is great and is comfortable to hold while I shave.</li>
            <li> The ProGlide blades are so good that even after 15 shaves, the blade is still better than new Mach III or TRAC II, I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that it does look nice when you press the power button on the handle and does light up a very nice blue!  </li>
            <li> how easy it was to use at any angle, how the vibration provided a closer, more comfortable shave and even that it lit up.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to grip which resulted in a closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The handle is light weight and well designed for easy gripping and handling.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight, easy to maneuver and delivers a better shave than my electric razor which is now gathering dust in the drawer.  </li>
            <li> I can say without bias that the Proglide Power is easily the closest shave and most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever received from a handheld replacement razor system.</li>
            <li> I had been a loyal Schick Xtreme3 user for many many years.  </li>
            <li> The handle is superb and it it is easy to hold even when it is wet (like in the shower).</li>
            <li> Very smooth, clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> This new razor is amazing!  </li>
            <li> The rubbery grip has a nice feel to it and the weight feels just right.</li>
            <li> No pulling, no scraping and no slight discomfort that I occasionally experienced with Mach 3.</li>
            <li> she liked it better than her traditional, non-powered razor, but didn&#x27;t say it was exceptional.</li>
            <li> This is possibly the best shave he has ever gotten, and it left his skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s face, and in great condition.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this product and am glad I was able to receive it for free through Gillette.</li>
            <li> Although the razor itself gave a clean shave, the handle was easy to hold and very light.  </li>
            <li> Last days I received this razor via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the razor I only could say this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, The new ergonomic design is perfect, and it&#x27;s much better than the others in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for my purposes, this new Proglide seems to fit the bill very nicely.</li>
            <li> The best shaving experience, closest shave, less strokes, saves time, is clean, very easy to clean are just some of the many supreme advantages this razor has compared to others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that I received any better results from the power handle than I did from the original.</li>
            <li> (I have one other Gillette that I use, too) and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Despite its bulkier width, I found that this handle was more user friendly.</li>
            <li> This thing is so cool!</li>
            <li> This razor looks and feels awesome, but at the end of the day it still shaves my face just like any other razor would.  </li>
            <li> it is most DEFINITELY worth it!</li>
            <li> COOL!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, due to my pattern of beard growth, manual razors tended to leave me with ingrown hairs all along my jawline, despite my best efforts to prevent them.  </li>
            <li> I can say with confidence that this razor delivers the best shave out of any other razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> the original fusion in my opinion glided better.</li>
            <li> This little magnificent beauty feels so sophisticated in my hand.</li>
            <li> The Mircopulses from the battery powered handle get the job done quick and easy!</li>
            <li> The power feature wasn&#x27;t something that I was all that excited about but have grown to love.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself matches the best of other products I&#x27;ve used and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that I was satisfied and certainly not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This razor ranks one of the best in my opinion and it outlasted any other disposable blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I easily got a good close, clean shave and didn&#x27;t nick myself, not even on my first time using this razor.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a great new product out on the market, it&#x27;s worth checking out!  </li>
            <li> I experienced a close, smooth shave with no irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> got this razor free from a program that Gillette was running, and it is great marketing on their part because I am no longer using my old razors.  </li>
            <li> I found this razor to give me a great smooth shave for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit bigger than what I had before, more suited to a man&#x27;s hand, and the contour is great.</li>
            <li> Gillette has made a quality handle that makes shaving easy.  </li>
            <li> The handle fits my hand and is easy to handle, almost as if it was designed just for me.  </li>
            <li> The time to set up the handle with battery and cartridge was very quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The power button is easy to find.  </li>

            <li> The grip makes it easy so not to slip when water and/or shaving cream drips.  </li>
            <li> I found it easy to maneuver, but what I didn&#x27;t understand was the battery-operated micro pulses that are supposed to make the shave even smoother.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality handle with an excellent blade that does a great (albeit expensive) job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> And, these razors are affordable, and easy to find at the stores.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I was already pretty happy with the Fusion ProGlide razor, and was interested to learn what the Fusion ProGlide Power handle would add to the experience.</li>
            <li> And the battery powered razor helps clean it better than any razor I have had.</li>
            <li> The handle allows you to easily maneuver the blade across all areas of your face and reach even the hardest spots around your nose or ears.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not always easy to put pressure on something.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs as easy.  </li>
            <li> I have a beard, and clean up all around it including my neck, and I am pleased that this prevented irritation and razor burn.</li>
            <li> As if I could expect that it might be damaged easily if it were to be dropped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I get razor burn incredibly easy.  </li>
            <li> The handle is easy hold on to and a pleasure to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Easy grip handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a more quick, more clean, or more comfortable shave than with</li>
            <li> The handle is sleek and is comfortable and the overall shave is incredible.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its handle is comfortable, easy to clean, and IT VIBRATES!</li>
            <li> I read the information that came with the razor and on the web and was impressed by Gillette&#x27;s audacity (for instance, a circuit board to keep an even flow of juice to the vibrator motor even as the battery runs down, and special groves to feed whiskers into the onrushing blades as the user draws the Fusion Proglide across a cheek!).    </li>
            <li> I feel the handle is light although it has a battery in it and the light weight makes the shaving experience very smooth and pain free.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great razor, with a comfortable  handle, very smooth shave, and has sped up my mornings quite a bit as a result.</li>
            <li> My husband liked this razor very much.</li>
            <li> My wife also liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> It shaves nicely in the large, easily accessed areas of the face, but around the nose, mouth and chin, I found it more cumbersome than precise.</li>
            <li> The best thing about the handle is the large grip that gives you good control of the shave and does not feel like it will fall apart after a few use.</li>
            <li> The handle was very cool looking and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Fast, smooth and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> I had pretty nice growth on my face and head.  </li>
            <li> With the nice sharp  razors and the added vibration works great.</li>
            <li> for good reason, since I&#x27;ve been using a normal Fusion Pro-Glide for years</li>
            <li> The shave was nice, and pretty close.  </li>
            <li> Traditional shaving soaps last months, are good for your skin, and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> But the cost savings, even over just a year, will be SIGNIFICANT for me -- almost $60/year vs. the Fusion Power... AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHAVE EVER???</li>
            <li> I liked the close shave I got, even without trimming my beard first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ever since it first came out and have been an enthusiastic fan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got to try this for free as part of a program by Gillette, I don&#x27;t think I would have purchased this without a significant coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I first took it out of the package, I noticed the nice grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was the gentle vibrations, or maybe the five blades, or more likely both together, but I was totally impressed with the closeness, efficiency, and ease of my shave.  </li>
            <li> First it has the teardrop shape at the bottom of the handle which fits nicely in the palm of you hand.  </li>
            <li> I also like to soak my razor in hot water before I use it, to warm it up, but I was scared to do that with a battery being in the handle.</li>
            <li> Its easy to get spoiled to the super close shave this razor system provides!  </li>
            <li> first impression on the razor is that it&#x27;s a nice look.  </li>
            <li> I liked the product, but the vibration did irritate my skin at first.  </li>
            <li> I assumed that it would be more of a gimmick than a true differentiator.</li>
            <li> This razor is hands down the best that money can buy.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This razor, from the handle to the blades is awesome,  my hubby got it from a Gilette promotion and has not put it down.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaving system.  </li>
            <li> , it does an amazing job, is very gentle (important to me since I have eczema).</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp and aid in getting that perfect shave.</li>
            <li> The weight feels good in my hands too, not like some new rinky-dink disposable....</li>
            <li> But, you won&#x27;t have to worry about anything, except maybe looking too good with this new razor from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> The handle itself is smooth and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> They both work fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to grip, fits comfortably in my hand, and allows me a closer shave then ever before.</li>
            <li> ProGlide Fusion Power is a perfectly fine product, and I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from buying it.</li>
            <li> shape of the Power Blade made it easy and comfortable to hold, but I pass on the vibrations.</li>
            <li> The handle feels comfortable in my hands and easily maneuverable around my face and neck.</li>
            <li> smooth shave with an easy to grip handle.</li>
            <li> The unit is light weight and has an easy to hold and maneuver handle that provides a smoother shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Speaking of which, the handles grooves and sleek designed helped me to easily and smoothly glide the razor across my neck and face.</li>
            <li> , each has been an improvement over the previous, with the newest generation being the best.    </li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t disagree that the Fusion cuts fine</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy on the face.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, gives a close comfortable shave and leaves my face feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> This is just an improvement on what was already fine.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to operate, which I dig.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> It has rubber grips that both make it comfortable to hold on to and easy to manuver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, this is an incredibly comfortable, easy to grip handle.  </li>
            <li> It holds blades securely and releases them easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a fine razor package, and the powered handle does offer some marginal improvement over the manual</li>
            <li> shave itself is comfortable and easy on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Even shaving against the grain of my hair was easy and pain free.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be just fine.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this razor and recommend it for a smooth, easy shave.</li>
            <li> i was less impressed with as I still felt friction, which the claims are that the battery operated pulses reduce.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, it makes shaving so much less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for creating another Great product for Real Men!</li>
            <li> Manual razor would work just as fine in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product from fine hair but it struggles for course hair.</li>
            <li> The handle grips are comfortable; the handle doesn&#x27;t slip while shaving and it is easy to control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all what could a vibrating razor really do besides make your girlfriend happy, with the close shave you&#x27;ll get, of course.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably less than $2 a week for an awesome shaving experience.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable in the hand and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I personally enjoyed using this razor and you can tell it is another great razor in the long line of Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> Like all Gillette products, I love the quality of the shave I get, and with this razor I can really trim up around my beard and have nice clean lines.  </li>
            <li> As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor.</li>
            <li> Oh and its super cheap too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get an incredibly close, clean shave with minimal effort and no irritation.</li>
            <li> This razor blades are extraordinary!</li>
            <li> The vibration was adequate at making it seem like my shave was better off than without the battery powered function.  </li>
            <li> Pressing the power button your welcomed with a bright blue power light and a very strong vibration that is focused on the head of the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s 100% perfect, but it&#x27;s 100% better than most other straight edge razors.</li>
            <li> With the advent of more blades (3 or more), in general I&#x27;ve been much more satisfied with the quality and easy of shave.</li>
            <li> handle is extremely well engineered and weighted perfectly for a clean and neat shave.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free Fusion ProGlide Power handle from Gillette on a trial and was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable and you get more than you pay for!  </li>
            <li> I must first disclose that I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor free of charge from Gillette to write an honest non-bias review.</li>
            <li> The handle is a truly revolutionary design, and I am so happy to have had the opportunity to try this new and exciting way to shave.</li>
            <li> Really a smooth, easy and totally comfortable experience using whatever gel cream was on sale.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky to be able to try a free sample Gillette sent me.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to get one for free through a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I feel the Fusion ProGlide provided a very smooth shave leaving my face feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> It was great to try and I will continue to use the Fusion products as I love the nice close nick free shave that I had by using this product just not sure the vibration added anything to the experience.</li>
            <li> I had no complaints with the last razor, but I was in need of new blades and figured I might as well get the latest and greatest.  </li>
            <li> and they fit on the Proglide razor just fine.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice large blade surface</li>
            <li> This little comb seems to straighten out the hair as you shave so the hairs hit the blade at the perfect angle...</li>
            <li> I received this razor from gilette to try , for which I was very pleased to try the product, the handle performs with high efficiency.  </li>
            <li> I received the Gillette power handle for free through one of their marketing programs and was a little impressed by it.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t mind the very bright power button, this would be well worth a try for a regular razor user.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razors I have used hands down!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razors I have used hands down!</li>
            <li> I got this razor through a program run by gillette, it is a great handle, comfortable and nimble enough to shave at any angle.  </li>
            <li> I switched to the proglide and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s grips to help you have a comfortable shave, and the razor handle contains a microchip that provides power every shave because the micro-pulse makes shaving effortless, smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> fact that it&#x27;s waterproof is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> But I have been a huge fan of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide brand,</li>
            <li> They got rid of the battery indicator that I never used nor did I think was accurate</li>
            <li> 5 blades seemed like a bit much, but I tried it because honestly, it was free and why not?</li>
            <li> So after switching to The Gillette Fusion Proglide, the razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, I&#x27;ve noticed I huge difference.</li>
            <li> Its design is sleek and the blue light indicator is a great feature.</li>
            <li> I also find that the quality of shaving Gel that you use makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been keeping a bald head for about 6 weeks now and this razor is a huge improvement from the twin.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Gillette from Sensor XL to Mach 3 .</li>
            <li> I guess maybe my skin is too sensitive, but I thought that this was supposed to the best for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Received my free razor from Gillette several weeks ago and it still shaves great.  </li>
            <li> Great razor overall and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> I feel these both really add to the experience and really provide a great shave.</li>
            <li> The mircopulses help create a smooth shave that does not irritate the skin.</li>

            <li> but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh</li>
            <li> However I have to admit this razor gives a really comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> safety razor came into  being when a guy named Gillette devised a &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; to eliminate the need  to hold the razor at a precise angle to shave the face.  </li>
            <li> I would say it gives a feeling of so called &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; as it suppresses friction feel and makes it feel smooth.</li>
            <li> It glides over my face and takes with it unwanted hair, leaving a smooth aftermath that I thoroughly enjoy.  </li>
            <li> the Fusion Proglide gets way closer, leaving a smooth surface.  </li>

            <li> It turns out, the vibrations feel really great on your face regardless if they actually improve the shave.</li>
            <li> though I do enjoy the vibration, I don&#x27;t think it helps the shave</li>
            <li> It was incredibly comfortable to use and the blades glide effortlessly over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received my proglide handle free from a program run by gillette.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this razor free to try from a program run by Gillette.</li>

            <li> For starters, I do need to mention that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle was provided to me free through a Gillette campaign.  </li>
            <li> : I received a free razor to test from a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle razor.  </li>

            <li> I received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Schick Quattro user, and have been for a lot of years, but Gillette sent me a free Fusion ProGlide Power through a promotional program, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work in an industry where it is important to maintain a clean-cut look.</li>
            <li> The lubristrip allowed for smooth strokes and as a result, the razor was gliding effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, they have addressed that issue in this product.</li>
            <li> In each situation, the result was a smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> If you continue to use the cartridge after the lubristrip has worn out, you will lose some of the benefits of the product&#x27;s smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The 5-blades and microcomb allow for a smooth shave and remain resilient after repeated uses, but because the lubristrip wears out, the cartridge needs to be trashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been happy with my shave quality for several years.</li>

            <li> I got the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge from Gillette .</li>

            <li> I got the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> The handle itself was nice and light even with the battery inside but the vibrating sensation was kind of different and something that you&#x27;ll have to get used to.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle is great as a razor but doesn&#x27;t need the extra vibrating feature to make the shaving experience beneficial.</li>
            <li> got Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor free it was provided via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I must say it is incredibly smooth</li>

            <li> I received the ProGlide Power Razor free through a program offered by Gillette.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t be free, so that was a plus.  </li>
            <li> moLNN8UHVUWUC4]]I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor from Gillette as a promotion.</li>
            <li> When I received my free razor that was provided to me via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the ability to hold the handle firmly, especially when using straight from the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m fairly picky when it comes to razors.</li>
            <li> and after i have compared both of thoses i tried the schick hydro 3and that was the best of them all it is much smother and moist and the replacement razors are the cheapest of the three and my 5oclock shadow came in later than when shaving with fusion pro glide as for closeness</li>
            <li> and though I really like the fusion I don&#x27;t think it is perfect as occasionally</li>
            <li> The massage feature is more of a novelty than a bonus, but overall it is a good product that I will continue using.</li>
            <li> - I shave more whiskers in one stroke than most peach-fuzz Caucasians shave in a whole week...</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love how there is no irritation and the vibration really stimulates the whiskers to make for one smooth shaving experience!</li>
            <li> but they do a complete job in giving a good shave.</li>
            <li> 8 times now and the battery power does seem to hold good so far (battery does not feel drained).  </li>
            <li> I am sure that the power light is an useful feature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice an ergonomic, but I don&#x27;t need to shave for hours and found normal shavers to be more than adequate.</li>
            <li> The shave is very smooth and closeness of the blade gives a fresh and clean look with the power razor blades.</li>
            <li> The first 4 or 5 uses on a new blade are great.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the right razor all my adult life and happily my quest has ended.  </li>
            <li> very easy and clean shave and very durable!</li>
            <li> I have to say I received this razor as part of  a Gillette program to try a new razor, but I was very glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at a great price, more affordable than any other store I&#x27;ve seen them at.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Gillette fusion proglide cartridge to everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> The power function is very useful</li>
            <li> overall a very nice razor</li>
            <li> The power function is very useful</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for better, more comfortable blade.</li>
            <li> The vibrating blade really does help and I liked precision trimmer for getting a clean shave below the nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle for the quick touch ups.  </li>
            <li> so when I got this handle for free to try, I was excited.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power gives me an incredibly close shave that lasts longer than any of my other shavers.</li>
            <li> I was provided this product for free through a program run by Gillette, and I must say that it has not disappointed me at all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into buying the latest and greatest then Gillette doesn&#x27;t disappoint, but if you&#x27;re a creature of habit I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the price to try and see.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the despite my happiness with my old standby safety razor, this new cartridge really did a great job.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I managed to get a chance to try one of these for free from a special Gillette program.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fresh feeling clean shave - with extremely close precision</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first blade after 4 weeks and the shave is still very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I has 5 blades that cut pretty close and is very smooth, however, I did use shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I deliberately did not shave for two days to give this Gillette Fusion Proglide a run for its money and it passed the test with flying colors it gave me a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Being in the Army, having a clean shaven face is incredibly important.  </li>
            <li> The shave provided was smooth, clean and took no time at all.</li>
            <li> * Clean and smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power did provide a clean, close and comfortable shave -- regardless of whether the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; made a difference or not.  </li>
            <li> like my face to be clean and smooth but this is just too close of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Clean, close, comfortable shave but</li>
            <li> The razor cut so smooth and clean</li>
            <li> Clean, close shaves, without nicks and cuts, with a smooth, even feel are what these blades have delivered.</li>
            <li> and I still get that close, clean, razor burn free shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power system us a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It did provide a smooth, clean shave though.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth clean shave, even without turning on the power.  </li>
            <li> Although I did get a clean and smooth shave</li>
            <li> The blade really does glide across your face and the handle is way more comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no nicks, there&#x27;s no missed spots, just a clean, close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I gave a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I credit the close, smooth shave to the battery vibration and the super fine blades.</li>
            <li> the handle was super easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li> The handle is cool looking, it feels solid and has a great grip.</li>
            <li> The button that releases the blade is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> but this razor makes it quick, easy, and painless.     </li>
            <li> The Gillette multiblade systems are very forgiving of rushed shaving, and truly do a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> Although quite pricey, the 5 or so blades on this razor make shaving a quick and easy job.</li>
            <li> After using the razor all week, my latest shave was just as comfortable as the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I figured at the very most I&#x27;d need to simply find a better shaving foam/gel, but I never did find it.</li>
            <li> The handle is pretty good, i did&#x27;t really see the benefit of a vibrator, but the razor worked well</li>
            <li> However, an easy twist allows the end to come off giving quick access to the battery when it needs to be changed.  </li>
            <li> I have used the normal Gillette Fusion when shaving for many many years.</li>
            <li> I feel, as I do with most Gillette products, that I am using a quality product and have confidence that it will give me a close, comfortable and consistent shave.</li>
            <li> and I find that Fusion blade will give me a more comfortable shave more than twice as many times of \\&quot;premium\\&quot; razors and at least 4 times as much as a good throw away razor.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and grow hair very rapidly, so a great razor is quite important to me.  </li>
            <li> I wish the blade was a little large to cover more area at once, but otherwise I was very happy with the razor.</li>
            <li> I found the razor very easy to manipulate and shave with thanks to this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent handling, well thought out, and my new favorite!  </li>
            <li> I think I found my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li> Both the Proglide and Fusion Power are nice handles and needed for the high quality Gillette blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> Its a nice looking razor, looks high quality, and like a well made product.  </li>
            <li> Due to the greater time-consumption of maintaining a straight razor, I suggest trying a safety razor outfit first.shaving soaps last months, are good for your skin, and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for a great new product.</li>
            <li> I got the razor free through a special offer from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> But... because a special program by Gillette gave me the opportunity to try out the  Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free, I decided to give it a try and have been using it for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> I recieved this razor free from a special Gillette program.</li>
            <li> Through a special prgoram run by Gillette, I had the fortunate opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels great when using it, better than previous Gillette products.</li>
            <li> This Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is great and gets extra close, but it seems like the battery runs out kinda quickly.  </li>
            <li> I loved my old Gillette Fusion and have been loyal to it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved several times with it and the battery is still going strong, so that&#x27;s a good sign as well.</li>
            <li> The power button lights up bright blue, so it is easy to remember to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> It quick, smooth, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That was the first thing that pleased me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received noticed it was coming, I was really excited.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Vibration: I was excited by this.  </li>
            <li> I could feel a significant increase in my shaving comfort with the vibration on.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor so so much!</li>
            <li> plus they added a nice blue LED light which makes it more up to date with the LED craze.</li>
            <li> and I must say I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> with these blades it is not a problem and they significantly reduce the amount of razor burn.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves close and cleanly more so than the non-powered version on the first pass.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion Proglide, which was acquired through a Gillette sponsored program for me to try out, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> After years of being a traditional Gillette blade shaver I have seen a remarkable difference in the quality of the shave provided by the Power Glide.</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I love that the first battery is even included, ive had mine for over a month and still haven&#x27;t had to change the battery either.</li>
            <li> Intially was excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to step out of the norm and try this battery powered razor by gillete.</li>
            <li> When the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor was first released I was more than hesitant to give it try.</li>
            <li> First of all I love the blade.</li>
            <li> , I love it, and it really works!</li>
            <li> Nothing mind blowing, but definitely fun!</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette products in the past and have always been impressed</li>
            <li> razor was originally provided to me through a gillette program</li>
            <li> First, the side grips on the razor gave me a better handle on it when shaving in the razor.</li>
            <li> Not sure how that&#x27;s going to fly with the Budget Nazi!  </li>
            <li> 3&lt;br /&gt;#2 original fusion</li>
            <li> With the claims of a revolutionary razor, I believe most of the hype to be exactly that, hype.     </li>
            <li> My shave feels much more comfortable, looks better, and even with 5 blades it works well against my sensitive skin which I already see improving.</li>
            <li> Well evidently their position is to now have millions more batteries going into our landfills.</li>
            <li> POWER BUTTON LIGHT IS COOL.</li>
            <li> If I were rich and spendthrift</li>
            <li> and I aslo discovered that the Proglide does not shave ANY closer than the original Fusion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item when it was originally introduced and enjoyed it at first.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to see what it felt like</li>
            <li> would save my money on this razor and go for the original fusion or even the quattro.  </li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion Power to try, not knowing what to expect, but wanting a better option for travel than my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Gillette Fusion today for the first time</li>
            <li> I compared them to the original Fusion, and saw a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> and I was excited about getting the pro glide version.</li>
            <li> I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how long my whiskers are it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I could feel the friction increase significantly.  </li>
            <li> I hope that the razor has a long life span because it&#x27;s a joy to shave with.</li>
            <li> &quot; I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when the power symbol lit up in a wonderful hue of blue light.</li>
            <li> I got the manual version a couple of month ago and was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the buck!</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> However, with the closeness of the shave obtained by the device, it may just be worth it!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the buck!</li>
            <li> I must say first of that I have used mostly electric razors.</li>
            <li> The razor all and all is pretty outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve had with it so far.</li>
            <li> if the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handle makes it cut any closer then the original fusion razor</li>
            <li> Still using the original blade.</li>
            <li> and I felt that I had a good control on the razor in general.</li>
            <li> This razor was provided through a program by Gillette and when it arrived I was excited to take it for a test drive</li>
            <li> She said that for areas like her knees (with funny angles), she&#x27;s never had a better shave.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power (what can I say,</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is a unique style of razor that uses vibration to help lift and separate stubble so that it&#x27;s easier to trim.  </li>
            <li> First off Gillette provided me with a power proglide to try and I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to see what it could do for me.  </li>
            <li> my first impression when I got it \\&quot;things have sure changed since I first started shaving in 1967\\&quot;, some for the better and some just for the change.</li>
            <li> I received the razor free through a promotion with Gillette, and I am now a true believer in this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine any significant improvements</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> far as the shaving went, I was very pleased with the performance of the razor.</li>
            <li> For the most part (once the first two shaves are out of the way)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed</li>
            <li> That aside, after shaving with it, I would be more than willing to pay for this product.</li>
            <li> That being said this razor still gave me an excellent shave and I will definitely be using more in the future.</li>
            <li> have tried both the power and non-power body; I like both but don&#x27;t notice a significant difference between the bodies.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than many others, but the difference in quality is substantial and impressive.  </li>
            <li> And then I received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor which, of course, came with a cool power handle.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really unique.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too noisy and actually was kind of soothing (but then I can also fall asleep as the barber buzzes my hair, so maybe it is just me!).</li>
            <li> Shaving has never been a favorite activity of mine, but the ProGlide definitely makes it more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes this razor unique from others in the market is the handle.</li>
            <li> What I found was a nice clean and smooth result when I was done, The power handle adds more to the shave I feel and definitely plan to continue using it!</li>
            <li> But I like it, a very smooth and comfortable shave, and also very close</li>
            <li> The LED lighting on the handle is a nice extra touch, and the device is very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The handle on the Fusion Proglide power razor that i received free through promotional program run by Gillette has a very comfortable grip, therefore making shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> Before the first time I used it I had around a 5 day growth going due to my playoff beard, but having to conduct interviews at work I thought it best to be clean shaven.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work just fine without being turned on, and is a good enough handle in that case.</li>
            <li> Truth is, though, I have found very good razors for much less long-term cost.  </li>
            <li> the size of the grips really gives a strong hold!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor for people who want to spend a little more on a razor without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette shaving products in the past and this has proven to be the most superior that I have experienced thus far.</li>
            <li> The best thing, to me, about the power handle is the vibrations keep me from having to press so hard to get my head as smooth as I want it.  </li>
            <li> When I received the Fusion ProGlide razor, I really liked the new grippier handle, drop in weight, and increased circumference which made it easier to hold and maneuver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then my gf, being a loving and caring gf, tossed it out one day and bought me a new razor.</li>
            <li> and, most importantly worked VERY well.</li>
            <li> After I received my free sample from a program Gillette was running, I used the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle and quickly saw and felt a change.</li>
            <li> The shave was effortless and the blades rinsed clean each time I ran them under the water.</li>
            <li> This razor by far gave the best shave possible.  </li>
            <li> By keeping my electric razor clean the thing lasts years and saves me a ton of money in the process.  </li>
            <li> Powers makes this shaver super smooth.</li>
            <li> It gets a super close shave and leaves a smooth face.</li>
            <li> This razor gives you the neat and clean feel without the effort.</li>
            <li> It gets a clean, close shave in no time.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I also got to try the all in one trimmer and found that I liked the thicker handle better.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any problems with the blades getting clogged, and shaving with this razor is super quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It offers the most enjoyable characteristics of both electric and non-electric razors.</li>
            <li> There is no question about the needs for a man to have a clean shave here and there.</li>
            <li> Super smooth shave, no nicks or cuts or anything.  </li>
            <li> They would clean house.</li>
            <li> They would clean house.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried most of the hyped-up Gillette and Schick razors over the years, and while they were a definite improvement over the throwaway kind, they were never all they were cracked up to be -</li>
            <li> I’ve always gone back to Gillette because the craftsmanship of the product always works best for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Colorful, easy to review, and caught-my-eye as I walked by.  </li>
            <li> I get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I tried this morning super smooth shave, no nicks or cuts or anything.</li>
            <li> I have a beard and got a close, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I received the power handle free from Gillette, and quickly noticed the soothing effects of the Gillette Fusion PowerGlide Power handle on my face.  </li>
            <li> The vibration feature is great for ensuring a close, smooth shave with minimal skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The vibration also helps clean the blade out easier when I rinse it which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> and Luckily I got this product for free via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I think it aids in getting that super close smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular ProGlide for a while and didn&#x27;t think I could find anything I liked better.  </li>
            <li> The result was a super clean and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> As far as razors go, and I&#x27;ve used many, this is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I was Shaving with a manual 5 blade razor and thought I was getting a close and clean shave&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really is the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I was able to try a free razor thanks to a program ran by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I used it to cleanly cut and trim my side</li>
            <li> It did rinse out cleanly after each use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor glides on your skin , giving you a super close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I got a super close and smooth shave with NO redness.</li>
            <li> I find it easier to clean the razor as well between the blades.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got ones with 60 blades, that vibrate, wash your car, clean your room and might even shave your face.  </li>
            <li> Rinses out incredibly clean under the faucet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, when the doorbell rang and I received my \\&quot;promotional product\\&quot;, I was excited to try it right then!</li>
            <li> I had been using the Gillette Sensor Excel razor for years and thought that it gave pretty good results, but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is battery powered so it is able to tackle the stubble a little more easily.  </li>
            <li> I just figured razor technology had gone about as far as it could go, and adding more blades or a gimmick like battery power were just oneupmanship between the two major brands to win market</li>
            <li> I got a nice close clean shave and my skin felt very soft.  </li>
            <li> It was a very nice shave on my long beard hair.</li>
            <li> The Fusion did add the single blade trimmer, which is great.  </li>
            <li> The single blade is great for under the nose and sideburns.</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide handle feels very good in the hand and the vibration, in combination with an excellent blade, provides an extremely close shave on a serious beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a Gillette promotion for free and have actually been very happy with it - it fits nicely in my hand, has a good grip to it, and the batteries seem to last a lot longer than my last razor (which really seemed to chew up batteries).  </li>
            <li> This is particularly true if you, or your spouse, is a gadget friendly guy like myself.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Power Proglide from Gillette for free as part of a program they are sponsoring to promote the product, the price was right so even though I am primarily an electric user I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> The feel of the handle was very comfortable and felt very natural in my hand!!</li>
            <li> To no surprise, I did receive a little bit a skin irritation, but all and all a very good shave.</li>
            <li> than that, I would recommend the pro Glide Styler to anyone interested in easy and comfortable shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the handle is decent, but I think most would be fine without the micropulse feature of the handle.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I love Gillette and have been a loyal user since I started shaving 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li> However, I really like the nice new handle design as well as being able to easier clean the hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on the other end of the handle was great for my sideburns, or if I wanted to go for a \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; look and not the smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li> get me wrong--the ProGlide Fusion Power delivered a very close, very comfortable shave...</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use a straight razor,  the angle where the  razor met the skin for shaving was very important.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that the light flashes when the batteries are low but why have the light on the whole time while you shave?</li>
            <li> Oh and for full disclosure I did receive this for free through a Gillette Fusion progam, which may attribute to my excitement because who doesn&#x27;t like free things right?</li>
            <li> I thought the ergonomic design and easy to hold grip were great, but as someone with sensitive skin, I found the pulsating action unneeded.  </li>
            <li> Its great when its new, but eventually, even with new batteries and heads, it&#x27;ll grow to weaken.</li>
            <li> I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProGlide by a special program from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I got this razor through a special promotion from Gillette.</li>
            <li> It does and the \\&quot;special lubricating strip\\&quot; wears out sooner.  </li>
            <li> I got this from a special program from Gillette, but use an electric razor, so I gave it to my wife to use.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette proglide razor as part of a special offer put on by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received this handle to test via a special program from Gillette.</li>
            <li> but was nothing special that was advertised.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is no exception to this rule with both cartridges and a handle that is specially contoured and vibrates.  </li>
            <li> , I think you&#x27;ll be a convert right away!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re almost better off buying a new razor each time the way the technology changes!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the clean, smooth shave every morning!</li>
            <li> I leave stubble on my face most of the time, and shave my neck clean, so I need to get a straight line under my jaw and chin.</li>
            <li> It really reduces the burning and helps give a clean smooth look!</li>
            <li> This razor cut through 5 days worth of stubble quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle offers a nice and clean shave.</li>
            <li> Overall good clean close shave.</li>
            <li> Getting a good, clean shave was simple with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it, so I knew the new version had to be better, right?</li>
            <li> The vibrate function is amazing and really adds a tingling feeling to the fact that I&#x27;m letting 5 incredible sharp blades get really close to my jugular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The grip is very good and allows you to maintain a firm grip while shaving.</li>
            <li> I found that the button for the on/off of the vibration wasn&#x27;t very easy to push and that it would have been better placed on the razor if it were closer to the blade by about an inch, or above the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made life easier when shaving around my jawbone (rough spot for me because I have some very strong gray hairs that don&#x27;t take kindly to razors).  </li>
            <li> My shave was a smooth process, no slipping of the razor handle and a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I was able to hold it steady and got all the hairs out with one swipe!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is a great little razor, perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The power handle fits very nice in my hand and does not slip or cause me to loose my grip.  </li>
            <li> I asked the hospital for special permission to allow a 4 day growth, got the OK and then tried the unit and WOW what a change!!!  </li>
            <li> the time I was done shaving, I was pretty happy with the handle overall.  </li>
            <li> you do use the vibration feature, this Proglide version of the razor has a BRIGHT LED that the regular Fusion did not.</li>
            <li> It shaves great and truly glides along my face, much better than the store bought brands I usually use.</li>
            <li> The grip is great, it never slips even when soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> After a long week, I found out I have a bit more gray in my beard than I would like, so I was eager to see how effective my shave was going to be.  </li>
            <li> Shaving every-other day as I normally do, I found the Fusion Power to provide a more comfortable shave than the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this razor gives an amazingly close shave yet doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> handle on this product is great even when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> , it looks kinda cool, too.  </li>
            <li> The powered handle seemed to increase the quality of shave and for someone who doesn&#x27;t shave very often, experiences like these make me want to shave more.</li>
            <li> but I enjoyed the shave so much that I am going to continue to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.</li>
            <li> In the spirit of full disclosure, I must mention that this product was provided to me via a program run by Gilette that I agreed to participate in.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle razor is a good mix of an electric razor with the convenience of a standard hand held razor.  </li>
            <li> The one thing keeping me from giving it the full 5 stars it that it seems like I do go through blades faster than with the proglide.  </li>
            <li> I think this product overall is good, however, I have a beard</li>
            <li> I highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Any product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to should probably almost full credit.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating head is also a cool addition, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it adds to my shave.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the sweet rims.  </li>
            <li> it looks cool, but doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> Realistically, I get just as close of a shave without vibration and anyone who says otherwise may just be fooled by the cool looks and neat vibration.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I try to get them (against the grain) I always cut myself, which is true with this razor.</li>
            <li> The result was a shave  which was surprisingly painless and left my face smoother than it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this item was it was good for when you do not have time to properly shave, but then again so are throw away blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For example, I really wasn&#x27;t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head.</li>
            <li> I might have appreciated some of the features more if I had understood what they were for</li>
            <li> This was true with power or not, with the Mach 3 or the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now these aisles are full of price-shocked guys standing around scratching their heads, wondering what to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my experience, the only better shave you can get is from a straight razor or good safety razor with the old-fashioned shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll get a good shave, relatively speaking.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> Instead of a razor blade lasting me for a couple of weeks, tops, when I use foam, my blade is good for six to eight weeks when I use hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> but this PROGLIDE is really even better.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a good investment for now.</li>
            <li> Secondly, this razor performs amazingly well, and gives a close, smooth, comfortable, and non-irritating shave.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product and I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think I can get a better shave.</li>
            <li> It would also be better for those with elaborate and finely detailed facial hair designs I would think.   </li>
            <li> stick with the tried and true and you won&#x27;t pay for $3 cartridges</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a super clean cut....</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 then came out which did seem to be a better razor and provided a closer shave with out much irritation so it was a winner.</li>
            <li> Then Mach 3 power nitro came out and the power aspect felt good but the results was basically the same.</li>
            <li> They look cool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use the Braun (which has a surprisingly good shave block) for daily shaving, and save the Proglide for trimming my sideburns and neckline where it excels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They made this razor very flexible, I&#x27;m guessing so that it will follow the contours of your neck better (maybe in the crook of the neck</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth like a baby&#x27;s skin and most important of them all, no blood anywhere.</li>
            <li> I alternate the electric with Gillete Mach III, which I would say are almost as good as these blades.</li>
            <li> Fusion Proglide does offer superior performance over standard disposables, of course.</li>
            <li> And it was cool</li>
            <li> After giving it a shot and trying both with it on and off, I feel it does help to stand the hairs up a bit better and really helps the blade slide across the face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cursed with fast growing beard that grows in many textures and directions.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was surprised with how much I liked this.  </li>
            <li> The power function is very neat and it seems to have a better shave with it on than with it off.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure how much of a difference the micropulses made.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a complimentary Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Pardon the pun, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> , so much so that I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get a safe grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> Overall a good razor</li>
            <li> The blades would have been good enough without the vibration.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go and buy this product without a coupon or sale because I think regular cheaper razors do just as good, but this product does work well.</li>
            <li> I used to think the vibration was a gimmick, but after years of shaving with one of these razors, I can safely say it gives you a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get a very close shave without the tugging.  </li>
            <li> The power handle made my face feel very relaxed during shaves, but I had to turn it off while shaving around the lips and side burns (for more control).</li>
            <li> They definitely did a good job with this razor&#x27;s handle.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> With the ProGlide Power, not only does the size fit me perfectly, but the feel of it is a notch above everything else.  </li>
            <li> I have used Gillette products for years and have always overall loved them.</li>
            <li> However, when I received a free sample through Gillette, I figured that it was worth giving manual razors another shot.  </li>
            <li> The overall shave was good</li>
            <li> That was always a clear indication that I would be shaving at my own risk if I did not change the blade.  </li>
            <li> Neat style and cool colors.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s literally the damage I&#x27;ll do with this razor in a full year.</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle was given to me by a Gillette-run program.</li>
            <li> The  blade on the top side is very convenient.</li>
            <li> But overall a good razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric for many years and this is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> it was just cool.  </li>
            <li> still think these types of razors are a bit overpriced, but I guess if you have to shave daily, and can find a great deal on them, it&#x27;s a pretty sweet handle.  </li>
            <li> It was a really cool product because the razor basically did all the work itself being powered by the battery.</li>
            <li> Having viewed a commercial for the product, I thought it sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I got a bit of razor burn, but not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this has more to do with selling more blades than an inability to find a longer lasting product that will work on the strip, but it is a little annoyance that gets tolerated because the product is pretty darn good!</li>
            <li> Which is great as unlike other razors the blade will not pop off when tapping it on the sink to clean out the stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that will change as the blade gets older and duller, but right out of the package this razor provides an easy shave.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Gillette for providing me with my new favorite razor form your free program.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor, the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor free through a program with Gillette, but this will be my new razor of choice.</li>
            <li> He was very impressed with smooth glide, the close shave and the razors that never seem to go dull!</li>
            <li> I have shaved with Gilette since high school and have tried everything they make including the original sensor, sensor excel, mach 3, disposable pivot plus, and my favorite the disposable Sensor 3 http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Disposable-Sensitive-Lubrastrip-Packages/dp/B001F51QWK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1281647873&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2 .</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting rid of any other blade and using this great product!!</li>
            <li> power button is easy to push and the battery compartment stays secure until you are ready to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> The handle has a good grip, so it doesn&#x27;t slip when wet, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Even when the handle got wet, it was still easy to keep a good grip and not lose control.</li>
            <li> The packaging was easy to open and it has a handily designed holder for the razor.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good upgrade over disposable razors but nothing great compared to other products in this league.</li>
            <li> The other feature that I was impressed with was that it will flash when the battery is low, much better than it just dying on you mid-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also weighted just right so that it provides a comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li> It make the razor smooth right over the skin</li>
            <li> My hair grows very quickly, so by the time the ProGlide Power was on my doorstep, its first challenge was rather visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the older version I could only get three good shaves at the most before feeling</li>
            <li> Well, I am now on my 14th day of my first Gillette Fusion Proglide blade and it&#x27;s still going strong (NO cuts or razor burn).  </li>
            <li> And the other cool thing is that these blades work perfectly on the Fusion Power chassis, so no need to buy the new Power Proglide razor (unless you just want to upgrade for the looks).    </li>
            <li> The handle is very comfortable and high quality.</li>
            <li> The grips are very nice and let you grip the razor no matter how wet it is.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided.</li>
            <li> I can say that I have seen the changes that have been made, the good from bad and now the close-to the best handle that feels right!  </li>
            <li> Imagine my delight when I turned it over and saw that there was perforations along the back for easy opening!!</li>
            <li> This razor is a little pricey and the blades aren&#x27;t cheap, but this stick will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li> Other razors have dragged or pulled the stubble causing great discomfort and razor burn.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s THIS great other than a profession Hollywood barber shave.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of other razors and after having this for two weeks it still shaves great with out any tugging or razor burns to the skin.  </li>
            <li> The handle has a great grip, stops the razor from sliding like my other razor does all the time.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting, durable, comfortable and it gives a great shave!</li>
            <li> it still provides a good shave but seems to tug a little more.</li>
            <li> For times when you have a little more time to shave, I&#x27;d recommend a good old-fashioned safety razor.  </li>
            <li> The newly designed edge trimmer is a lot better than the one on the original Fusion.</li>
            <li> Using it for 3 weeks now, I would say I am happy with not super excited though.</li>
            <li> Better yet was that my new close shave didn&#x27;t irritate my baby&#x27;s face in any way!</li>
            <li> As a handicapped guy I love my new fusion proglide!</li>
            <li> I love it and plan to keep it until I need to buy a new one just like it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say one is better than the other, but they are both nice and solid and they feel good in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your partner will certainly appreciate it!!</li>
            <li> Shaving with the Gillette was relatively easy and provides a great shave; especially with micro pulsation technology that Gillette has developed.</li>
            <li> On initial \\&quot;hefting\\&quot; the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Gilette is seriously the best a man can get.</li>
            <li> Now I will be a loyal customer</li>
            <li> However, after getting this product as a gift from someone, I quickly became a fan again.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;flexible firmness\\&quot; was definitely an advantage, and it worked exceptionally well in conjunction with the blade.</li>
            <li> It works in the shower and provides a quick and painless experience.</li>
            <li> In fact I enjoy the slightly larger diameter feels nice.</li>
            <li> It does seems to be a bit more smoother shave than older Fusion.</li>
            <li> I quickly opened it and took the razor out.</li>
            <li> and I quickly got used to it</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the overall results and definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Ok I have to say that when I received the Gillette fusion proglide power razor, via a program run by Gillette, I was skeptical at best.  </li>
            <li> I definitely have more control while shaving and end up getting a better shave.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close, smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure if it is the power or the configuration of the blades, but I definitely feel like it had a better shave than a &#x27;non-power&#x27; razor.  </li>
            <li> With the blades dulling so quickly and the use of a battery to drive the micro pulse technology, this increases the cost of this razor exponentially.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Gillette customer from there line of shaving gel to aftershave.</li>
            <li> But I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li> All that&#x27;s left is smooth skin, it&#x27;s amazing how close it gets.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of the more blades are better campaign</li>
            <li> The power vibrate seems more powerful but just as gentle while the blade has been improved to be even smoother on the skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no plugging in the razor as it&#x27;s battery operated and a nice feature is that the \\&quot;power on\\&quot; light flashes when the battery is running low and needs to be replaced soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent marketing ploy designed to influence Americans to buy whatever product big businesses want us to buy next.</li>
            <li> You can buy a good quality boar bristle shaving brush for $15, or as part of a set, which you use to apply the soaps from inside the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;For instructions and more information on the old art of traditional shaving, you can also check out The Art of Manliness blog ([...]), which is an enjoyable website for the cultivated man&#x27;s lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, safety razors and straight razors</li>
            <li> The Sensor was not impossibly wide/</li>
            <li> However, for those quick morning shaves before work</li>
            <li> and I have been a loyal Gillette razor users.  </li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;d need to be able to shave in a tenth of a second to justify $3.50 or more per cartridge.  </li>
            <li> While it seems to be bit more smoother than older Fusion when I shave with the grain, I don&#x27;t see any difference when I shave against the grain.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that Gillette was able to create another \\&quot;best shave</li>
            <li> When I bought this one, it has 3 dollars off promotional scheme and it was really worthy in term of money, value and usability.</li>
            <li> but I wished I bought it from a wholesale store I currently shop at where for just 15 more dollars I could have gotten 5 more blades.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would use a man&#x27;s razor because of the fact I have been a loyal consumer of Schick Quattro For Women.</li>
            <li> As far as multi-blade razors go, this is the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I went from standard disposables to this, and instead of getting a lot better shave and/or saving money, I got a marginally better shave for quite a bit of money.</li>
            <li> The power button also feels more substantial than the older models.</li>
            <li> Somehow the powered razor seems like its covering more surface area, making each pass more meaningful, which means less irritation.  </li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t think the power feature adds much to the razor, overall the razor provides a great shave, so I&#x27;m not taking off any stars.</li>
            <li> It was a quick, painless shave.  </li>
            <li> By far the most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was by far the easiest to handle razor and closest, most comfortable</li>
            <li> While the Proglide Power Blades do very well on their own, the Power Handle does make the shaving experience that much smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the old Fusion ProGlide (Manual), and body redesign has made the product way more comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the ProGlide and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> If you are a fast grower of facial hair, this will help a great deal.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Pro Glide styler for about a month now, and must say it is a tremendous improvement over the Gillette Track II razor I have been using.</li>
            <li> My only complain is that I wish the replacement cartridges were cheaper but overall this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product for sure.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is perfectly located and it&#x27;s set back enough so that it need not come in contact with water when rinsing the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving was quick and effortless using the Proglide.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Gillette to try and I got to say I liked trying this over the regular mach 3.</li>
            <li> and I got the box and quickly opened it with excitement.</li>
            <li> I would think that any adequately sharpened blade would also prevent \\&quot;tug and pull\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor on the market for me and my needs, the blades shave close and the trimmer on the back side is an added addition to have when trimming your facial hair or body hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anywho, a quick pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good razor and worth trying out.</li>
            <li> I was one of the luckily ones that got to try this power razor from a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> ever since Gillette hooked me up with my Proglide Power Handle, i feel like shaving has become quick and painless...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s immediately smooth, solid in the hand, and effective.</li>
            <li> razor is truly excellent, so why haven&#x27;t I been using a razor like this for the last ten years?</li>
            <li> The handle is bigger and has more grips for better control and even weight distribution.</li>
            <li> Cuts super close</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t think a vibrating handle would make much of a difference to a blade I already liked.</li>
            <li> It has more \\&quot;grippies\\&quot; kind of like suction cups preventing it from slipping in my fingers.  </li>
            <li> This has made my daily shaving routine a faster more enjoyable one.</li>
            <li> For a super close shave nothing beats the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many, many different razors.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a \\&quot;try me\\&quot; from Gillette and after trying it I think they have a brand new customer!!!!  </li>
            <li> After trying it for the first time I was very impressed; having just tried the Mach 3, I can state for certain that the vibrating motion in the power Fusion Proglide helps avoid snagging and makes for a much smoother shave experience overall.</li>
            <li> The grip was soft to touch and very easy to maneuver around my face.</li>
            <li> After trying the handle with the power off first, it was just like ant other blade handle, felt good in the hand, easy to maneuver, light...</li>
            <li> and he said it was great, although he mentioned that the blade was too large (due to the five blades) to shave under his nose easily</li>
            <li> Still better off with high quality disposables.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a better shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using a high end electric shaver for a couple of years now and absolutely love the ease and quality of shave</li>
            <li> A straight or safety razor would be as good, but really not better simply because this shaver did it perfectly.</li>
            <li> The new handle feels very comfortable in your hands.</li>
            <li> new handle for the razor is very comfortable and fits in my hand well.</li>
            <li> Most razors focus simply on the blades (which, by the way, even the blades for this razor are superb) and leave little attention to the handle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now mostly using my electric wet with a great gel I&#x27;ve found \\&quot;Nivea sensitive skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a huge deal once you&#x27;re aware of it, but remember the device vibrates.  </li>
            <li> First off, I would like to mention that I got this free to try through Gillette.  </li>
            <li> for the razor itself (which was provided free as a Gillette marketing program) after the first use, it looks like a winner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it does seem to work a bit better than my normal, non-powered Fusion razor.</li>
            <li> The first thing I tried after receiving it for free from Gillette was a side-by-side comparision with my Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette shaving products almost exclusively since the original Sensor debuted in the early 1990s, so I was eager to try Gillette&#x27;s latest shaving</li>
            <li> Let me first say, I do enjoy the &#x27;Power Handle&#x27; and I no longer think it is a gimmick.  </li>
            <li> Generally, I use Schick xTreme 3 disposables, so that&#x27;s kind of my reference point for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to my normal DE razor, this pulls/tugs a lot more, and chews my neck</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like to shave more than once a week</li>
            <li> This razor works great in the shower or out and the blade life is about average.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my husband&#x27;s take: Even when he hasn&#x27;t shaved in a week, this razor blades gives a smooth cut the FIRST time through...</li>
            <li> This product is really good to use, it is sharp and smooth, without burn and irritation.</li>
            <li> This razor is very soft on the beard and very smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first use, I could not believe how smooth the razor shaved.</li>
            <li> so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free as part of a program that was run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While not something we generally think about, this handle has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is a very stylish handle for a mens razor.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, it was so smooth that I stopped to check to see if the plastic cover was still over the blades.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle gives a smooth, consistent, and tug-free shave.</li>
            <li> The shaves after the first shave is what is important to me.  </li>
            <li> The unit is very modern looking too!</li>
            <li> Either way, I was very pleased to see that my tricky areas only required one pass of the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle was a bit more bulky than a \\&quot;normal razor\\&quot; but pretty comfortable and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> Overall I was very satisfied with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Clean, smooth shave, no nicks, no cuts and super fast.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this product and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the razor and the results that I received.</li>
            <li> Most razors tend to cut me or do not provide a close shave, however, this razor left me feeling smooth and cut free.  </li>
            <li> I was able to shave in the shower without losing my razor like I normally do.  </li>
            <li> I received a free shaving razor and carts from Gillette through a program they are running at this time and used it for the first time</li>
            <li> I enjoy this shaving handle and it actually seems to work better in vibrating to get a smooth shave, compared to the pro-glide trimmer kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Fusion was what an incredibly smooth shave it was.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to have mine given to me for free via a program run by Gillette, because I&#x27;m not quite sure I&#x27;d pay $10 for the handle and one cartridge, and then have to turn around and pay $32 (Amazon price) for a pack of 8 cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m more than happy with this razor and not planning to move back to any others for a while (at list till the next Gillette razor</li>
            <li> Cuts nice and close, much better than the other razors I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money, even if you spend full price on it.  </li>
            <li> The large handle makes it easy to maneuver across the face.</li>
            <li> You can tell that alot of thought went into the power handle because of the features like the auto off function that activates after a certain time or the easy to install/change battery compartment.</li>
            <li> The large handle makes it easy to maneuver across the face.</li>
            <li> My first shave sold me, very smooth and very close.  </li>
            <li> Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette.</li>
            <li> It pulls through my stubble cleanly without catching and I usually only have to do one pass through.</li>
            <li> but the battery vibrations must do something that makes the process so much easier and faster and it leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Hands down, it is the smoothest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> The sound of the vibrations were a bit louder from the older versions but nothing close to the sound of any electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> I liked the old version, but the lubricating strip wore away after only 4 shaves and I experienced discomfort frequently while shaving.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this power handle is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> anyone requires is the original twin blade Sensor - loud, proud &amp; simple.</li>
            <li> The Power handle was really nifty and cool as well!</li>
            <li> was that I really didn&#x27;t get that much better of a good close shave than any other pivoting head razor that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power and I can say, without a doubt, that I&#x27;ve found my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I love the handle on the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor.</li>
            <li> But I decided to try it as I love new toys</li>
            <li> Since I love trying out new products I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It is new and better technology.</li>
            <li> and I make sure to pop a new one in once a month.</li>
            <li> The new flexible one is even better</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Every time they create a new version, they make it a bit better.</li>
            <li> Love the new design of this razor</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using the new razor by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I like the new colors and that it has more of a futuristic look.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s brand new, and have used it, so for now, I&#x27;ll keep using both, and try and decide which is actually better.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a better shave with this new Power Fusion razor</li>
            <li> I can describe the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor in one word, FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> Coupled with the new Gillette razors I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sturdy power razor handle that provides a sure handed shave.</li>
            <li> Love the design of the new handle.  </li>
            <li> but it has always done a good job, felt solid in my hand and worked exactly like you&#x27;d hope a razor handle to.  </li>
            <li> The handle is very lightweight and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It is easy to think that a razor is a razor, but there really are differences.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my main shaver, but as a good back up / travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> It gets the job done fast and easy</li>
            <li> I thought the razor worked overall pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The tenth shave was just as good as the first shave with the same razor.</li>
            <li> It made it extremely fast, easy, and painless shave.</li>
            <li> With the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I found it easy to use in the shower thanks to the size/shape/construction.  </li>
            <li> It is very ergonomic and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> The power option does give a much smoother shave, and the bulkier handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which is prone to razor rash using most razors on the market.  </li>
            <li> Reading some other reviews here at amazon I have noticed something interesting, former Schick fans who have converted to Gillette saying the Proglide is better or superior and whatnot...</li>
            <li> Reading some other reviews here at amazon I have noticed something interesting, former Schick fans who have converted to Gillette saying the Proglide is better or superior and whatnot...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a quick, close shave that will leave your face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very surprised and pleased when I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle.</li>
            <li> Very nice, like getting a facial massage while you shave, the handle fits nicely in my hand and manuvers well, well made does not hav ethat plastic feel like alot of other handles.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, gives a closer more comfortable shave, with absolutely no nicks or cuts, no matter how carelessly or quickly I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is rare that I make the upgrade to a new handle, without buying a good supply of blades, these should be packaged with more than a single blade.</li>
            <li> Thank you gillette for the oportunity to try this razor first!</li>
            <li> She loves it better then her old razors!</li>
            <li> After the first shave - I was sold!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Gilette!!</li>
            <li> trim first!</li>
            <li> I was excited the first time I used this razor because it shaves so close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power does add something unique to the shaving experience, I can&#x27;t exactly describe it, but it just adds something to the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, the Fusion Proglide razor and handle are top of the line products!</li>
            <li> I am glad to replace my old razor with this!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more razor blades for this Power handle!</li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s new Fusion Power ProGlide is far superior to what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> It was still very effortless and a super smooth shave, but it wasn&#x27;t AS close as using the vibration.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first trimming around my beard because of the cartridge size, but it was exact and easy.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair grows kind of quick</li>
            <li> And the ProGlide blades provide a super smooth and very close shave.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily switch the way I was holding the handle several times while I was shaving.  </li>
            <li> Even when I was rushed and had to do a quick job, I was pleased with the results, whereas I might have tore my neck to pieces using my old razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades are really sharp and provide a nice clean, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Being in a professional atmosphere having a close shave is very important.</li>
            <li> I remember that I was surprised that the handle was very light, even with the battery installed.</li>
            <li> Since using it , my son says its the best razor he has ever got to sample..  from a very active 23 yr old.  </li>
            <li> Being frequently an electric shaver the buzzing in my hand felt natural and it was easy to hold and use, but honestly I think the vibration is just a marketing thing.</li>
            <li> When you first look at the handle and see that is bulky than the original ProGlide razor handle you laugh.</li>
            <li> Shaves pretty clean.</li>
            <li> The blades are smooth, cut easily through my coarse hair and leave me feeling baby smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the razor is excellent, I have very sensitive skin and this coupled with the Fusion Proglide Extra Sensitive Gel</li>
            <li> good, thanks, i will bus new one in future, hope it more cheaper than this time.</li>
            <li> handle is also really large and wouldn&#x27;t fit in my shower</li>
            <li> The 5 blade head, although rather large, gave an incredibly smooth  shave.  </li>
            <li> The little edge razor works great for squaring off the sideburns and beard.</li>
            <li> I have experienced little to no razor burn while using this product which cannot be said for all types of razors.  </li>
            <li> Great for medicine cabinets that have little room or bathroom counters that need all the retail space.  </li>
            <li> The handle could use a little tweaking, but overalla great</li>
            <li> It gives me a smooth clean shave without the irritation that normally happens.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a fine razor, but it&#x27;s a marketing (not engineering) upgrade with goals to charge you just a bit more per blade</li>
            <li> If the razor holds up fine for more than a year I may come back and up the rating</li>
            <li> This causes the razor handle to fit my hand more tightly which accomodates a much more controlled shave.</li>
            <li> Given the high prices of the replacement cartridges, this could prove to be the factor that deters me from becoming a convert.</li>
            <li> As is my typical experience with Gillette razors they work great for the first two or three shaves, then they degrade quickly.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little rubber pad near the head that is perfectly placed for your finger for added stability on the cheeks and</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it, because I have been a faithful Schick user for years, but always enjoy trying new products to compare.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone interested in a improved power handle from Gillette pick this up right now!</li>
            <li> This is a super sharp and good razor.</li>
            <li> The Gillette ProGlide shaver is my new shaving system, the powered handle has a sure grip and the micro pulses seemed to lift the hair on my face to give me a fast clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the free razor.</li>
            <li> I got this razor free from Gillette thanks to a program they were running.</li>
            <li> If any of this seems intriguing to you, though, you may want to try it out.</li>
            <li> The handle is truly amazing that in its larger size, it is lighter than any handle I have come in contact with.</li>
            <li> The rubber handle is comfortable, my grip doesn&#x27;t slip and the massaging lift and cut the gentle vibration of the handle</li>
            <li> This razor was provide free to me to try as a part of a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a power tool with a real sturdy feel.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> A great razor for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who wants a close shave while feeling comfortable during the shave.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a comfortable and close shave, this product works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the free razor.  </li>
            <li> I got a chance to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free  thanks to a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Very close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> So much for competition and the free market economy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The power version makes for a very irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li> The handle is still too light, too fat, and not balanced very well.</li>
            <li> The razor glides over my face with no catching, no scraping feeling, and no irritation, all while delivering an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li> After using this razor I exfoliated my legs with Perlier White Almond Sugar and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who wants a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a huge sum of money for it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for facial shaving.</li>
            <li> recommend this razor for anyone who wants that baby&#x27;s but smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and the gel strip built into the blade really does help.</li>
            <li> But thanks to a program run by Gillette, I had a chance to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free.</li>
            <li> The micropulses are amazing, I don&#x27;t know how I ever shaved before using a standard razor.  </li>
            <li> I Received the razor blade and handle free via Gillette as a test and has done very well for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for different hair types, as well, I have blonde, light hair, but it work for dark/denser hair as well.  </li>
            <li> The handle is very well fit for your hand.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a close, smooth, painfree shave.</li>
            <li> The handle is very sleek and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Like a babies bottom, my face is as smooth without much effort and rigamarole.</li>
            <li> I made sure i used the same shaving cream to get an accurate comparison.  </li>
            <li> It was smooth and a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for giving me a chance to try out your product for free.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the experience while shaving, but it did the job very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a free program by Gillette</li>
            <li> About the cost for the cartridges I firmly believe that the longevity and great shave will outweigh the additional cost.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the folks at Gillette for providing a free razor to test.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette, I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor free in exchange for the testing and review.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the things that makes the overall product amazing.</li>
            <li> The vibration from the handle really did make for a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And if that is the only downfall I am happy to sacrifice that extra blade for a consistently smooth and non-irritated post-shave glow.  </li>
            <li> but the shave was very close, and smooth.</li>
            <li> If I had to ding the product it would be here, it was not as comfortable with the handle on when shaving the much longer hair.</li>
            <li> Well I received the opportunity to try the razor for free thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for providing a free power handle for me to review</li>
            <li> Thanks to a free sample from Gillette</li>
            <li> The razor provided a very close and comfortable shave</li>
            <li> But the increased strip did make for a much smoother and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All round a great shaving tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was this light touch that allowed a close shave without hacking at my face and really digging into it.  </li>
            <li> Both had fresh batteries for comparison&#x27;s sake.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in a program Gillette sponsored for the Fusion Proglide Power razor.</li>
            <li> so they were worth it.</li>
            <li> The blades also clean very well with a quick rinse.  </li>
            <li> the handle is a nice size, it&#x27;s solid</li>
            <li> far as the con&#x27;s, there aren&#x27;t many but</li>
            <li> however like that they kept the extra blade on top of the head for precise grooming efforts.</li>
            <li> Because of the price, I don&#x27;t think its worth it.</li>
            <li> Knowing the brand and what I have come to  expect from the products, I knew it was going to be a fun product to try.</li>
            <li> make it a far better shaving experience than the Mach 3 without any cuts or nicks.</li>
            <li> This handle is a success.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> This razor did a good job overall and did not cause too much discomfort.  </li>
            <li> So far, this has been my favorite razor that Gillette has come out with.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a really nice handle.</li>
            <li> I will buy more blades for the Gilette and leave my old schick blades for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> In fact I think it be one of those rare instances</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not 100% used to it, and even after multiple shaves now, I still feel kind of uneasy about bringing it to my face, but hey</li>
            <li> Plus, the heft of the handle really felt good in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powered handle and the vibration it supplied to the blade definitely felt soothing when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was surprised on how better it was.</li>
            <li> The price of this razor just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I still enjoy Gillete products and look forward to trying more out in the future.</li>
            <li> The handle fit the hand well, and I was able to maneuver the blade well enough to get a close shave everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I do notice that there is a distinct difference in the amount of pulling that</li>
            <li> The grip is much better than the old Gillette Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li> I dont know if I would have went out and bought it, but I am having fun using it.</li>
            <li> I think it would be a fun gift idea.</li>
            <li> The second I got the ProGlide Power out of the packaging, I was thrilled to see that this wasn&#x27;t the</li>
            <li> /&gt;The extra heft and girth provided by the battery compartment gives the razor a nice balance.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that the power handle would make that big of an impact on how close the shave was and most of all how comfortable it was.</li>
            <li> I received this razor complimentary to try and review from a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> but this one is totally different because it comes with a nice gripe that does not hurt your hands.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money you will spend.</li>
            <li> Using this razor has left my skin smooth and rash free!  </li>
            <li> but I think it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the thinner blades or what, but this is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> well worth</li>
            <li> It was worth a try.</li>
            <li> The handle has a better grip than the old one too.</li>
            <li> For people with sensitive skin like me, they&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> The powerful vibrations sent through it never even affected my hand or the way of which I shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s defiantly worth the price.  </li>
            <li> As far as the power feature, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> but I can see how men might find it useful.    </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $11 or so to switch from the fusion</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve not used the non-power version, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether the vibration is a gimmick or does something useful.</li>
            <li> I suppose there is a degree of subjectivity involved when you make a comparison with fresh blades.</li>
            <li> Naturally, with a battery, there&#x27;s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason, Gillette appears to have completely bought into the notion that five blades gives a better shave than just two or three.  </li>
            <li> I now use a simple old fashion safety razor which works great</li>
            <li> Rarely causes nicks, never ingrown.</li>
            <li> Even on stuff I think is worth a review</li>
            <li> Wow that stuff interesting...</li>
            <li> Still LOVING this shaver almost a year later.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying things off of Amazon for a long time now, and this is my first ever review because this thing is simply the best razor out there.</li>
            <li> I have tried fresh batteries to no avail.</li>
            <li> I especially love the fact that even after several days of not shaving, I can remove the hair one of my cheeks with just one careful swipe.</li>
            <li> Is the motor worth it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had gillete manual fusion and pro-glide razors, I think this product is far better, and will recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> But if what happens to me happens to you, then it is worth every dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I come from a family of Gillette users and I have used virtually every kind of Gillette razor in the last 15 years however the day I ordered Proglide</li>
            <li> Which razor you use is really worth the money.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the razor works well and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The vibration is a nice touch but by no means necessary.</li>
            <li> who rarely had time to shave..  </li>
            <li> It is well worth upgrading to this newest Gillette model.</li>
            <li> I found it to glide over my face and it left me feeling smooth and uncut!I did receive this product free to try, but would buy it again!</li>
            <li> The Pro Glide wins by a landslide.</li>
            <li> The Pro Glide wins by a landslide.</li>
            <li> but you may find the comfort of the shave is worth it</li>
            <li> I am finding that to be quite useful in working under the lip and for sideburns.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, it&#x27;s economically advantageous to go with the Merkur Model 180.</li>
            <li> On a rare occasion I even shaved it three times.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s an epiphany that I can&#x27;t keep quiet about.</li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to provide me with a Fusion ProGlide Power Handle and blades.</li>
            <li> The handle has a good grip, even when wet.</li>
            <li> My shave is much smoother and faster in the morning, and I am delighted to be back with Gilette!</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I love this one just as much as my old one and will continue to buy refills for it.</li>
            <li> The precision trimmer is a nice feature if you have some facial hair you want to keep.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s provides a good clean shave and does everything you&#x27;d want from a razor, it just isn&#x27;t a noticeable improvement over any of the previous versions.</li>
            <li> So, since it had power (like an electric shaver), I thought this might be a nice middle ground - and it</li>
            <li> With a slightly larger handle it has a nice feel in your hand.</li>
            <li> I would say and this gets nice and low for a shave that lasts about 2 days.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this razor from Gillette, and overall enjoyed the shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps with more trial I would notice a bigger difference, but I felt the difference in getting a smooth, close shave was in the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using store-brand generic six blade razors, and quite honestly, they don&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> find the rear trimmer to be extremely useful as well.</li>
            <li> I like the smoothness of the shave, left me feeling refreshed with a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Worth the money...</li>
            <li> After using this razor for a while, it performed slightly better than my old razor.</li>
            <li> I must say, I never would have bought the razor myself, as I was not unhappy with my razor at the time</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was very happy about the performance of the blades themselves, I am confused as to the purpose of the handle.</li>
            <li> gave the second one I ordered away to a friend who liked it.</li>
            <li> The actual shave is noticeably more comfortable than the Mach3, but I feel that the Mach 3 delivers a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating handle-gimmick or useful?</li>
            <li> But if thee handle continues to perform as well as it has, they will be well worth the added</li>
            <li> Also the blue power button is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> everyone is different and will experience this product in their own way.  </li>
            <li> my skin is just too sensitive for a shave, with these blades I&#x27;m able to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using disposables for a year I can definitely say that the Fusion ProGlide is far superior than the cheap throw away razors.</li>
            <li> It definitely provides a smoother, more comfortable shave over a non-power razor.</li>
            <li> the action was smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> illuminated power button was a nice touch but not necessary.</li>
            <li> can honestly say that I&#x27;m a Gillette user now - and actually look forward to shaving again!</li>
            <li> But after experiencing this and have the dollar shave club products to compare to, it really is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and suffer from the dreaded razor burn and bumps when a blade gets used for more than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am giving this product only 4 stars through no fault of its own, but rather</li>
            <li> I initially received a free Gilette Fusion Proglide Power razor through a program Gillette was hosting, and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I felt it was worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> What I also liked about the power handle is that it has a slightly larger grip to accomodate the battery.</li>
            <li> Much better grips than my old razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I start my shave holding it near the top of the handle, I find that over the course of the shave, I wind up holding the handle lower over time.</li>
            <li> in all, the Pros far outweigh the Cons, and this is easily my favorite razor that I&#x27;ve ever used....</li>
            <li> During the shave the vibrations would cause the razor to occasionally pull on some of the hairs, though this was still more comfortable than shaving this length with the Mach 3 series of blades.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it to be raised above or in line with the rest of the razor since when im shaving in the morning</li>
            <li> With that said, I do love the Razor overall and am thankful that the Gillette provided me a free one to try.</li>
            <li> And if like me you think the vibrating handle is worth the difference in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me the feature that is worth talking about is the Power.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised to say that I am glad</li>
            <li> I love the variations Gilette offers in their product.</li>
            <li> The handle has a better grip than my old non power razor.</li>
            <li> for the shave, i think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this razor and I will definitely be getting some replacement blades.</li>
            <li> i just want to share my experience based on my own personal opinion and facts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good that I have no trouble with a \\&quot;fast\\&quot; shave completely against the grain with this razor -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s too straight, and not enough ridges on both sides to keep a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> notice that the vibration does anything useful.  </li>
            <li> The weight is good as well, not too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li> For a premium handle, its nice, but there definitely are nicer handles out there.  </li>
            <li> I always have a good handle on it even when its wet.</li>
            <li> As expected from Gillette Vary good over all quality.</li>
            <li> Overall, its a nice razor and worth trying for yourself.</li>
            <li> but it would totally be worth the price otherwise.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this handle if you&#x27;re a Gillette user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received a free razor through a program from Gillette, but I was already a loyal user and already had a Proglide power handle for months before.</li>
            <li> As a light bearded guy who can easily get by only shaving twice a week (unless something special is going on), I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time, money and effort on shaving.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away that the handle was larger, making it more comfortable to shave.  </li>
            <li> I am an individual who HAS to shave every day for work, not because I like to, therefore I want to make sure that my shave is not only enjoyable, but fast and that it delivers a nice clean look without much</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this for face-shavers who can afford it (refills are fairly pricey but should last a month or more); but for head-shavers who don&#x27;t hold the razor the way face-shavers do, I don&#x27;t suggest laying down the money to try this handle.</li>
            <li> With the power on, the razor cut through my stubble with the greatest of ease - and left my face smooth - much smoother than I have gotten with other</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and the electric function is a bit odd at first</li>
            <li> But this razor is worth getting if the price is right.</li>
            <li> Normally I get razor burn easily but not with this product.</li>
            <li> it conforms to his  face when he slides the razor over  his skin its easy to use.. not confusing to how others operate..  </li>
            <li> The shave was definitely a more pleasant experience in that the power handle caused less pulling frequent with the mach 3.  </li>
            <li> and it was easy to hold onto in the shower where I normally shave.  </li>
            <li> The blade seemed about on par with most other top of the line blades, however when combined with the Power Handle, something happens...</li>
            <li> I love this razor and while I&#x27;m sure practically no one will read this, I wanted to add my 5-star rating to the other 5-star ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I do know is that the razor almost slides out of my hand when I hold it lower because there is no black rubbery grip on the top part of the lowest part of the handle.</li>
            <li> The pulsing razor pulls all my hair so smoothly and shaves my face so nice that I can&#x27;t see using any other razor</li>
            <li> Lays well in the hand, not too heavy or too light and with the matching cartridges it gives you a nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li> but you get used to pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bonus that it even comes with a battery.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a worthy and capable product, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> but you get used to pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> As with any razor hair tends to get stuck between the blades but a quick rinse off cleans them pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They vibrate to shake the hairs from their rested position, and, as I&#x27;m the only one who can grow a full beard in my family, getting the closest shave is very important.  </li>
            <li> I love this new handle that features a  bigger, more ergonomic side grips, that allows me to get a good grip, even when wet.</li>
            <li> I am going to assume it works better than the 1-4 blade razors as there&#x27;s no other reason they would add the coveted 5th blade!  </li>
            <li> One neat part of this razor is the ability to clean up sideburns by pushing the top head back that has the gel coating.  </li>
            <li> The button quickly and easily turns on the vibration action of the handle.</li>
            <li> Other blades, even my beloved Fusion, would pull on my face when I shaved.  </li>
            <li> grip on the handle of this ProGlide is superior to other Gillette razors I must add.</li>
            <li> The ergonomic side grips helped and provided good grip even when the handle got wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other aspect of the razor that Gillette promotes is the battery powered micropulses activated by pushing a button on the razor.  </li>
            <li> I really believed that there wouldn&#x27;t be any significant difference in the shave quality or the experience.</li>
            <li> The groves on the hanfle seem to be in all the right places.</li>
            <li> Gillette you got this one done right.</li>
            <li> After turning this razor on you could tell a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> But then again, not everyone&#x27;s made of money right?</li>
            <li> But also, it takes finding the right one to suit all of your needs.</li>
            <li> I should say right up front</li>
            <li> and I went and tested my theory to see if I was imagining it all--and nope, I was right on the money.</li>
            <li> Warms your face right up.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> These were the right price for a razor.</li>
            <li> it slid right through them.</li>
            <li> it is just right and does give the sense of having an electric shaver in your hand.</li>
            <li> It has the right amount of weight</li>
            <li> Right out of the package</li>
            <li> I do have a beard right now</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> it was off in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I would say that this fits right in.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> While shaving using the vibration setting - the razor puts out the right about of vibration to give you the close shave without feeling that your hand is going numb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was very little irritation after I shaved, and for the most part, I was nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was really smooth and I would recommend it because it made a believer out of me, and I don&#x27;t like to try anything new!</li>
            <li> Plus the blue power light is very cool.</li>
            <li> The GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE is also very comfortable and easy to hold with its non-slip ergonomic grip even when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much had every razor style available.</li>
            <li> Weather using gel, foam or even a sugar-based shaving scrub, the Fusion ProGlide just glides across my face and consistently gives me a very close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides a much closer, faster, consistent, and comfortable shave with no ingrown hairs whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Gillette user, and i received this for free from gillette a trial program, and i must say that this razor is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is also really great and no issues with getting it wet, I use this for daily shaves in the shower and it is still running strong after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I also discovered quite by accident, that Consumer Reports did their own independant testing and came up with the EXACT SAME results.</li>
            <li> It had a good grip and was not difficult to handle after it got wet.</li>
            <li> noteworthy information was that the blades performed very well in the shave itself, providing a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, the razor is nice, but with the price point being higher than the Mach 3 Power, I don&#x27;t have any reason to switch.</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy with a decent amount of weight to help with the shaving process, and not feel like a cheap thing that will crumble in your hand.</li>
            <li> The blades cleaned out very easy just by runnung under water, tapping of the razor on the inside of the sink was no necessary.</li>
            <li> I always shave in the shower and the larger handle makes it very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> The battery compartment is also very easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li> While the handle is a nice size that fits comfortable in your hands while working up and down when shaving.</li>
            <li> While shaving, I made sure no other members of the household could see which side of my face was shaved with the Gillette and which side was shaved with the Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesnt pull at all, even when shaving against the grain and does not matter if you shave daily or have several days of growth, either way, the razor is quality and does not pull and tug at the hair, which is very nice and very important when you have sensitive skin like I do.  </li>
            <li> it just slides across my face like a VERY sharp razor should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close and comfortable - I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> To my amazement, it really does feel like an electric razor and was not tugging on the long hairs at all...and gave a nice, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how many shaves it&#x27;s good for but a AAA Duracel is holding steady.</li>
            <li> ( much like new grips on a golf club make for a better swing)  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I liked the new handle.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating action felt nice, like little hedge trimmers effectively getting everything.  </li>
            <li> I have shaved with it several times and i must say that it is quite comfortable and easily manuverable.</li>
            <li> far as performance, this razor makes my legs super smooth.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll probably just stick to my safety razor, since it offers a super cheap shave.</li>
            <li> My son likes this razor better than ones he&#x27;s previously used and I like it because he shaves more often.  </li>
            <li> Most people wont be able to notice a difference between this and any of the previous incarnations of the Proglide line.</li>
            <li> The low battery light easily tells you when you will need to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> I was able to get super close shave without having to keep going over the same spot.</li>
            <li> Battery life lasts for quite a while and blades are super durable lasting longer than most others.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor through a program offered from Gillette and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> The handle was nice and comfortable and help the blades move smoothly over without having to grip too hard for precision.  </li>
            <li> Regarding the shave - honestly both Gillette Fusion Razors, Power and Regular, provide great shave and it is hard to see the difference.  </li>
            <li> think this is a great buy, especially for those that have sensitive skin and get razor burn easily like I generally do.</li>
            <li> but since this isn&#x27;t new then maybe you&#x27;re fine with it.    </li>
            <li> When I got it out of the package, provided to me free by Gillette, I thought it would be just another normal shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette is know for great products in the past.</li>
            <li> price of Gillette&#x27;s ProGlide Power is a bit higher ($9.99 on Amazon) but it could be worth it.</li>
            <li> For instructions and more information on the old art of traditional shaving, you can also check out The Art of Manliness blog ([...]), which is an enjoyable website for the cultivated man&#x27;s lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> A small price to pay for a great shave.</li>
            <li> So my first try of the Gillete ProGlide was on ~3 days worth of beard.  </li>
            <li> It cleans amazingly and the blade lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It tickles at first, but is a fun novelty.  </li>
            <li> The battery gives a micro pulse that allows for the razor to cut with barely any sensation that the blades are touching the skin.</li>
            <li> The blade cartridges loaded and unloaded with ease, and the battery powered handle provided a smoother than normal shave that was nick, cut, and razor burn free; compared to a non-battery powered shaver handle.</li>
            <li> the interest of my overall shave, I&#x27;d prefer that companies like Gillette focus on practical innovations like making blades that last longer instead of trying to distract me with a bright light and a buzzing razor.</li>
            <li> had to laugh when I took the first stroke.</li>
            <li> I have a heavier than average beard and while this razor gives a good, close shave, there is no reason to go buy it if you are already using the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much good the vibrating function does for a smoother shave or whether it&#x27;s just a gimmick, but it was a unique sensation when shaving.</li>
            <li> Featuring bigger, more ergonomic side grips, allowing you to get a good grip, even when wet.</li>
            <li> felt kind of strange using it, and would probably use it again without the vibration.</li>
            <li> The blade and shave itself were very impressive, however the second and third shaves with the blade (and a few days growth) didnt seem to be as good as my normal razor.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor and have used no other razor (except to try one or two new ones that I got for free).</li>
            <li> Then you have the edger on the back, which is perfect for some of those tight spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the micropulses lead to a better shaving experience but the handle is easy to grip &amp; comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Turn the battery on and the handle vibrates a little, but the rubber gripping absorbs most of it</li>
            <li> I found that this Razor is able to handle my thick full facial hair with great ease.  </li>
            <li> This razor also has a single blade for trimming which is good over all but tends to clog up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> While I like the fact that it&#x27;s thinner and more easily-handled than most of the other powered handles I&#x27;ve used before, I guess I just really don&#x27;t like the vibration aspect.</li>
            <li> The holder even has a new look and it seems all these add up to a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li> the new pro glide doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes claims of important improvements on what I would have thought was unimprovable--after all it is just a razor with a new generation (it claims) of blades.    </li>
            <li> I used that new thermal scrub too (comes free with 4 pack blades).  </li>
            <li> The new Proglide is smooth and did the job without punishing my face.</li>
            <li> I was offered the oppurtunity to try this new one for free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Gillette had a free promotion offer to try out their new profusion power glide razors.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try out Gillette new product and this free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor free through a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> It sound to me like overkill because being a creature of habit, and not wanting to try anything new.  </li>
            <li> I just used my new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor that I received from a free promotion by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Admittedly,the shave I got was close and comfortable when this handle was coupled with Gillette&#x27;s new cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Through a free program with Gillette, I tested out their new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power side by side with the non-Power version.  </li>
            <li> and it had a light to let you know when it needs a new battery.</li>
            <li> At first it felt like it was going to slice right into my face</li>
            <li> Proctor &amp; Gamble stockholders and doing pretty well right now - maybe you should buy their stocks instead of the blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery last forever and the bottom line is that the razor provides a great shave for a low cost.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice the improved grip, although I guess that is a good thing since I didn&#x27;t have any problems holding it, even when wet.</li>
            <li> the five-blade design really does yield a better shave than an old single-blade shaver -</li>
            <li> The vibrations were so much easier on my facial hair and the handle has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with how easy it was to use and how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> I have used this razor now about a half dozen times and have loved the feel.</li>
            <li> The vibration it gives is just tremendous and shaves very close.</li>
            <li> The shave with the Gillette Fusion Proglide  is superior to the previous model, THe Gilette Fusion.</li>
            <li> And relative to my older manual 5 blade the handle on this Proglide is much more rounded and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It was smooth, comfortable, and left a swath of stubble-free skin that didn&#x27;t need an additional shaving.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak to whether there&#x27;s a good enough reason to switch from another razor, but if you&#x27;re like me and looking to go \\&quot;old</li>
            <li> was pleasantly surprised that P&amp;G Rep actually ready my comments here and wanted to know more.</li>
            <li> razors seem to be getting more and more gimmicky lately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to add nothing to the shave and it completely eliminates any tactile feedback, which I find necessary for a good shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is super smooth and 100 times better than my previous razor.</li>
            <li> But not so much better to make it worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and shave my neck and with this razor it made it so much easier to shave my neck with the bigger grips on the handle</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor left my skin feeling comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li> good quality, just don&#x27;t like black colour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a well designed handle with soft grip sections that make for easy maneuvering.  </li>
            <li> manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is great, I love the design and weight, but it&#x27;s not perfect.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, the texture of the handle allows for a comfortable shave, and facilitates a better grip even when wet.</li>
            <li> As i said with my review of the blades this razor is probably perfect for an everyday shave type person but for someone who lets their facial hair go for a week it just doesnt do the trick.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and handle for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly surprised with how balanced the handle was in my hand, and how easy it was to grip and slide the blades over my face.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a 5 blad razor and it shaves really smooth, so I was excited to try this new one, as I shave a beard and my head.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using razors for 25 years now, and I&#x27;ve tried a pretty good range of razors, from fancy razors down to the cheapo $1 razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I received the razor complimentary, I was under no obligation to provide a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than the single blade side clogging its a fantanstic razor and look pretty awesome too!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to people who get razor burn but miss that clean close shave.</li>
            <li> I got this razor and blades through a free program from Gillette and I am completely hooked!</li>
            <li> while the hype is still pretty big, I was surprised at how genuinely good this razor ended up</li>
            <li> There didn&#x27;t seem to be a natural contour to it so that I could get it to fit right between my fingers.</li>
            <li> The price is ok, especially since I was able to try it for free through a special promotion through Gillette, but the refills are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Compared to previous razors I&#x27;ve used it saves closer and more uniform, it&#x27;s great for people with facial hair because of the trimmer blade on the back, and it&#x27;s easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> vibrating handle which helps cut down on irritation has a power on light that blinks when you are running low on power which is great</li>
            <li> Not only during shaving is it the most comfortable shaver that does not pull your hair, it also creates such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Not only during shaving is it the most comfortable shaver that does not pull your hair, it also creates such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This very gentle gliding across the skin allowed for faster, smoother strokes, like there was no resistance.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a very comfortable razor to use.</li>
            <li> The vibrating razor flows very smoothly across your skin and although it may not feel as though you are shaving, the results are definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> It has very modern and sleek design.  </li>
            <li> I just applied a little bit of soap to the areas that I needed to shave, and that was all I needed to get a nice clean</li>
            <li> The new precise trimmer cuts better, overall a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> The idea of a blue light on the handle is a unique feature that reminds me to turn the shaving system off when  cleaned and finished.</li>
            <li> Precise and sharp, you cannot find anything better around.</li>
            <li> so it was important for me to make sure the blades are always sharp</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user of Gillette razors so was excited when I was given the opportunity to test out the latest one.  </li>
            <li> I recently received a free power razor through a program run by Gillette and was excited to try it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to try this product via a program from Gillette and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal and satisfied user of their Mach 3 model for a while now, and I was curious to see if it was worth it to upgrade to something like this.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out, I will say that the quality of the blade is up to par with Gillette&#x27;s standards.</li>
            <li> The handle is light, comfortable to hold, easy to control and that battery sets up a little vibrating action that keeps the blades moving smoothly and effortlessly across the skin.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer is very nice for a lot of the harder to shave areas the full razor can not get properly.</li>
            <li> Overall - another great product from Gillette, better than other brands, bigger size is a step up and vibrations make it easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> The main improvement is that blade now tilts back much more sharply, allowing you to shave at many more angles.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer provides a good shave with an easy to snap on razor blade that will not pop-off like other shaving blades due to an advanced locking mechanism.</li>
            <li> The razor head is easy to snap on and snap off , so all you really have to do is buy new razor heads.</li>
            <li> If it is not the right size or weight it is not easily maneuvered and the shave is not as good as it could be.</li>
            <li> However, that little fact has nothing to do with just how well this razor works and the good things I have to say about</li>
            <li> The powerhandle has a good grip but is a little noisy when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the new razor, I never used a \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor.</li>
            <li> So when I was approached by them to try their new product, I was really excited.</li>
            <li> I have used the pro glide for years and was was excited about a new product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try my new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived in the mail I was excited to try this new combo blade razor/electric razor.  </li>
            <li> However, when you turned the power on, there seemed to be much less \\&quot;pull\\&quot; - it seemed to move through the whiskers more easily.  </li>
            <li> I was given this product to try and I usually use disposables but when I used Gillette Fusion ProGlide I was very satisfied by the close clean feeling</li>
            <li> its slim and easy to maneuver around the contours of my face and makes for a quick and simple shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades have very good durability considering how thin they are.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a firm comfortable grip on the razor and the vibrating function makes it very easy to glide over your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> did find that the razor was very easy to clean with less hair being clogged between the blades.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying that if you&#x27;re absolutely settled on a cartridge razor system, this or the regular Fusion Proglide will probably fit the bill just fine.</li>
            <li> While cool looking and effective at trimming up edges, The bulky, vibrating, light-up handle seems extraneous, and I&#x27;m mainly scared to get it too wet.</li>
            <li> handle &amp; shave performance did not stand out as special during my side-by-side comparison with my normal Fusion.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing like the first clean shave of a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> Overall shave result was smooth, non-irritated soft skin with a very pleasant surprise, no bumps or pain after a few days.</li>
            <li> I never felt like the Fusion was a huge step up from the old Mach 3 Power.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised the vibration made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Very well designed!</li>
            <li> When I first saw the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I have to admit I thought it was just a marketing gimmick that would be used to up</li>
            <li> The first is the riveted handle itself.</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide Power handle was bigger in size and circumference, a tad lighter and had more tacky rubber to the handle than the Mach 3 Power handle.  </li>
            <li> The weight and ease of use was evident from the moment I picked it up.  </li>
            <li> First, the battery-operated razor makes for an easier, cleaner shave.  </li>
            <li> It not only costs more and makes the razor heavier, but it also downgrades the performance.  </li>
            <li> So this is my first blade razor that vibrates.</li>
            <li> and my fiance loves that i shave more regularly now!!</li>
            <li> I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette and so far, i have used it for about 6 or 7 shaves.</li>
            <li> The heft of the handle is comparable to handles of higher quality (and price).</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the design of the handle.  </li>
            <li> After the first couple of shaves, I get use to the vibration the have not had any issues with loosing my grip.  </li>
            <li> Just got this razor free as part of a Gillette program and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> But this is the first razor that I felt</li>
            <li> At first I did not notice a closer shave, but now after about 1 week of consistent use I have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> only thing that I still don&#x27;t understand is about the use of the battery or vibrations for a better shave....</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it outperformed the Gillette Mach3 Turbo razor that I&#x27;ve been using for the better part of ten years.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the vibrating was a gimmick.</li>
            <li> the handle for the Fusion Proglide is larger, more ergonomic and heavier; 2) the handle for the Fusion is powered (by a AAA battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all I will start off by</li>
            <li> With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving.</li>
            <li> I hanve never been able to use regular electric razors somI</li>
            <li> and i still get as close of a shave now as i did the first time....</li>
            <li> My skin has never been able to tolerate an electric razor, but the \\&quot;power\\&quot; series is different.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this razor because of the fact it viberates</li>
            <li> Upon the first use of the ProGlide Power, I immediately noticed a smoother cut and easier shave.</li>
            <li> The blue light was also rather cool addition to the handle.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the Fusion Proglide.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette regular Fusion razor for many years.</li>
            <li> I have to first shave with an electric trimmer and then follow up with the Fusion</li>
            <li> favorite part of the entire razor was the handle.  </li>
            <li> As a man that shaves his head I was, at first, nervous about using a vibrating razor on my head.</li>
            <li> Also, what I liked about this razor is I can wet my face with water and still get a close shave without the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I recommend Gillette products as my first option to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The handle has an on-board micro chip that is suppose to provide consistent power, shave after shave.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s certainly not uncomfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> It definitely seems like more a novelty than anything, and some people like that.  </li>
            <li> I liked that the razor is the same as my normal razor.</li>
            <li> takes 1 battery and got my shave MUCH MUCH Closer!</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever tried for difficult grain areas, like under the neck.</li>
            <li> The handle is attractive, well made, and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Well the ProGlide Power handle is clearly designed to provide the user with a comfortable, non-slip grip because I never once found myself reaching for a dropped razor while showering.  </li>
            <li> Glad to see Gillette is making strides to keep men shaving regularly.</li>
            <li> OK so this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power shaving system not only has a five-blade cartridge it has a handle that uses a battery...</li>
            <li> The only thing about this blade is when I was shaving it gave me a couple offcuts but that was nothing because most blades give people cuts while shaving anyways.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> I was interested in if the power made any difference</li>
            <li> I otherwise would miss the first time around.  </li>
            <li> From the first shave, it has been consistent.</li>
            <li> It is the only way I have been able to shave every day and eliminate razor burn.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how smooth this razor is.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> The blades last longer than most razors I have had as well.</li>
            <li> Much more than just my standard Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> It works pretty darned well, so I won&#x27;t be too skeptical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who is looking on getting a handle on a better shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, I find the fusion power proglide to be one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> despite what I&#x27;ve seen in some reviews, I actually do get a better, closer shave with the powered fusion over non-powered razors.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Dont buy the manual one (my very personal opinion, you can if you want :-) )  </li>
            <li> (i have not tried it though ;-)).    </li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I was looking for something different that could make my experience better.</li>
            <li> exactly how</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy the Proglide Power razor based on several outstanding reviews here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> , you buy several shaving soaps and soap dishes, for variety if you like, which are better for your skin than mass-market aerosol shaving gels.</li>
            <li> It is obviously marketed towards males, but I like the quality of the mens razors better than womens.</li>
            <li> pretty fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing I tried with this razor was a side-by-side comparision with my Mach 3 razor.  </li>
            <li> The most obvious problem it has is cost (just like the Fusion Power).  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve discovered this five bladed razor tends to nick my face more often than a double or triple bladed razor.  </li>
            <li> My first razor was a Mach 3 Turbo</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST SHAVED WITH IT</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to redo an area too many times, so you sense by feel where the patch is that needs extra attention.  </li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t believe a friend of mine when he gave me this tip.  </li>
            <li> First stroke drew blood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s FAR more comfortable than the regular Fusion Power.  </li>
            <li> With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving --</li>
            <li> But for most guys, it simply doesn&#x27;t deliver the closeness the \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough when I got out, I did not miss a spot.</li>
            <li> First of all, the pricing of the product is around $10.00, on Amazon and in stores.</li>
            <li> From the first stroke of the blade, I could feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the improvements!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.    </li>
            <li> cents\\&quot; worth, as shaving is very subjective and</li>
            <li> Anyway, this razor is really nice with a flashy colorful handle and nice grip.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for this one compared to the regular Fusion</li>
            <li> and this was the first time I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> I turned on the motor for the left side and it was even better.</li>
            <li> First, the closeness and ease of the shave are noticeably improved over the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> I bought it, and just tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I had seen a dermatologist many years ago to ask him why my neck always seems to break out in red bumps.  </li>
            <li> He pulled a couple of my whiskers to show me the exact reason.  </li>
            <li> I have used Schick Quattro the standard non battery one and its ok but for my head I use the Gillette Fusion power.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a \\&quot;powered\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette since my first razor--which, incidentally, was my first razor--and they have treated me well over the years.  </li>
            <li> Recently my wife tried a Schick Quattro razor, fell in love with it, and suggested that I try a multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I must say that from the first shave that I am hooked.  </li>
            <li> I only use Proglide razors and that is because my face and wanna be mustache and beard love it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s minimal pull on the skin, and I wound up with a nice close shave without any nicks or irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li> It doesnt wear out fast and you can buy replacement heads for them!</li>
            <li> I might have a defective one but thought I should enter a one star for others to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> I have been using mostly Gillette shavers for several years.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor really helps with this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female and use men&#x27;s razors because they work better.  </li>
            <li> I find that this allows a much better shave than before, especially around the nose.  </li>
            <li> The shave did not feel anywhere near as comfortable as it felt using the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li> While shaving, you will realize that is EXACTLY what it does.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I still have more use of the same razor.</li>
            <li> The shave did not feel anywhere near as comfortable as it felt using the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li> While shaving, you will realize that is EXACTLY what it does.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I still have more use of the same razor.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t test it first and got the bulk set from Costco.     </li>
            <li> At first I thought that OK maybe its was this specific blade I was using</li>
            <li> It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever.</li>
            <li> Fusion Proglide    Hydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> country.&lt;br /&gt;Today is the first time since I took birth that my shave did not give me any cuts, neither did I feel any irritation.</li>
            <li> I was fine with my old regular Fusion, but this you cannot even feel the hairs being cut, and gets my face super smooth.</li>
            <li> During my first run with this I saw that it was able to glide and shave all my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I am coming from using the Mach 3 for many years, but when I forgot it while on a trip I decided to try something different.</li>
            <li> I’ve used many brands of razors over the last 30 years.  </li>
            <li> When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating head isn&#x27;t just a gadget, it actually does assist in  producing a better shave.</li>
            <li> First off, yes I am a woman.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how smooth it was and for some reason I dont have to shave nearly as often as I did with Quattro.</li>
            <li> and I remember the first time I used the Gillette Proglide on my head</li>
            <li> The product that I found to give me the closest smooth head with the Power Proglide is the Nivea Shave Gel for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> After realizing I couldn&#x27;t justify $200 a year on cartridges, I was absolutely sure there had to be a cheaper way to shave that didn&#x27;t involve an electric razor which doesn&#x27;t get close enough.</li>
            <li> I have used power handles from gillette in the past, but the redesign makes me more confident while shaving in the tub or shower.  </li>
            <li> My shaves are now smoother, faster, and just overall more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first glance</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice rubber grip so there is no chance of slipping while shaving.</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t tried it, i recommend you do very soon!</li>
            <li> At first I thought that the vibrating handle was just a gimmick, if it is</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was pleased with how it made the shave go due to the changes and improvements they have made to their original handle.</li>
            <li> I really gave it a workout!</li>
            <li> Buzzing provided by the shaver massages the skin (get your mind out of the gutter ;)  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good experience and worth a solid try.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be getting more blades once these are done.</li>
            <li> first I thought the vibrations were going to be a gimmick, but gimmick or not, my shave was closer.</li>
            <li> I thought the whole \\&quot;power handle\\&quot; thing was silly, but I saw Gillette would let me try one free (and who doesn&#x27;t love free, razors ain&#x27;t cheap!)</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s exactly what I need,</li>
            <li> tried it first with the power on the razor seemed to pull.</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me a free sample of this razor and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> The thinner, finer blades give a close shave, so much better than my last razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However most of the time I only shave every 2-3 days</li>
            <li> Pretty darn well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors over the years, but I keep going back to my Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the micro comb, the thinner blades or the suspension system, but it really delivered a great shave.</li>
            <li> shaving needs might be a bit different from most guys in that</li>
            <li> First I have to say that I received this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> My first impression was &#x27;I wonder why this thing takes batteries&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> The product was also able to handle a 1 week shave with the same level of effortlessness.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a power razor before but the shave with this razor was the first time in my life that I felt no skin irritation or nicks at all.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle via a program run by Gillette, I was surprised how perfectly it fit in my hand,</li>
            <li> I also love the blue on button that glows when the vibration feature is on.</li>
            <li> The bigger, more ergonomic side grips made my shower shaving experience a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the Proglide Power Razor, it was like a hot knife trough butter.  </li>
            <li> I do plan on continuing the use the Gillette Fusion Powerglide Razor, even after the first cartridge is done.</li>
            <li> Not entirely uncomfortable, but still made me cringe.</li>
            <li> Overall I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it indicates when the battery is low.</li>
            <li> First The blades dont clog up with hair after shaving.</li>
            <li> This was the first Razor I have ever used that did not nick or cut me in one of the first two or three uses.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit more pricey but in the long run I see it will be well worth my money.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power from a program from Gillette and decided to put away my old razor and give it a shot.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the Proglide Power Handle come on the market, I dismissed it.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a power razor</li>
            <li> First off, I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor thru a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I got the Powerhandle with a coupon when my electric razor died and I have to say that I really like the shave that it gives!</li>
            <li> When I tried this handle for the first time I knew this was it for me.</li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice is the handle.  </li>
            <li> After the first shave, all those doubts went out the window.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with it, especially since it was free!</li>
            <li> 10 years ago, I received one of the first Gillette Fusion razors for my 18th birthday.  </li>
            <li> 10 years later, I participated in a program run by Gillette that gave me the opportunity to try out the latest version of this razor.  </li>
            <li> At that point, I almost wouldn&#x27;t consider shaving with the Mach 3 without first trimming.  </li>
            <li> short, the handle vibrations take a bit to get used to, but the shave is extremely comfortable and close!  </li>
            <li> I liked the grippy handle and found that it didn&#x27;t slip, even when wet.</li>
            <li> The rubber grip has a nice feel and helps keep the razor in your hand when its wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years, and most recently the Fusion ProGlide, but the Power part really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I found my last razor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> which is really what anyone cares about!  </li>
            <li> Firstly i thought how the battery will work in a razor,</li>
            <li> but that was taking care of by shaving after a got shower or using a damp hot cloth on my face before shaving.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the larger size helps me grip the handle better and provides a better grip, especially on days I shave while in the shower.</li>
            <li> It was the first time I have used a razor handle that vibrates.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious about this product at first.  </li>
            <li> Really the closest shave I have ever had!</li>
            <li> If you have the opportunity to get the power handle (or better yet, try your friend&#x27;s, if he&#x27;ll let you), I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide is a pretty proficient razor.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely doesn&#x27;t do any better of a job</li>
            <li> and I must say I was pleased overall with the razor.  </li>
            <li> When I actually began the process of shaving I found that the handle fit securely in my hand throughout the whole shave and my grip did not falter once.</li>
            <li> and I believe that is do to the handle being thicker and giving me better control than the razors on the market with the standard size handles.</li>
            <li> and this seems to do the job pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Upon first turning on the razor</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a reasonable product, I&#x27;d recommend this!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change in this aspect is to provide a better grip in the thumb area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, and don&#x27;t need to trim around sideburns or a goatee, you could do OK with this razor.</li>
            <li> The pulses seemed to work pretty well</li>
            <li> This is the first razor blade I have used that didn&#x27;t irritate my neck.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This razor gives you a nice shave with minimal razor burn, if any.</li>
            <li> Very well designed!</li>
            <li> The power option on the handle provides for better precision and allows me to shave faster, as it removes hair faster than a regular razor.</li>
            <li> If I shave frequently, I am more likely to have irritations occurring.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of a vibrating handle for a razor, I snickered to myself.  </li>
            <li> Also, the constant vibration, or \\&quot;power\\&quot;, only makes the awkwardness of the handle design more noticable and makes it even more</li>
            <li> I had to double check the shaved area to make sure the razors did its job.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I have ever used a battery powered razor.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t to hot though.</li>
            <li> When i used first time Gillette Fusion Power Proglide Handle  No difference,</li>
            <li> However, I have never had a problem with turning it on or off on the first attempt.</li>
            <li> When I first got my razor</li>
            <li> This is personal prefernce, but I don&#x27;t love the tingly feeling of the handle in my hand.  </li>
            <li> (and this is my first power</li>
            <li> I was first intrigued by the power handle and wanted to see what difference that would make.  </li>
            <li> If one thing is consistent, it&#x27;s that Shaving Technology continues to advance.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the work week, my face can get pretty irritated.  </li>
            <li> Regular handle has rubber part all the way to the top, and Power handle does not.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion the rubber piece on top side should be bigger.  </li>
            <li> Regular Handle provides better grip, but Power Handle is easier to hold.  </li>
            <li> If you have big hands - you should like Power Handle more.  </li>
            <li> It also seems that power handle has slightly better angle than regular one.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like more of a gimmick than something that would actually help the quality of my shave.</li>
            <li> I was scared to try my first shave, but after the first stroke I had to continue.</li>
            <li> I obtained a free razor via a program run by Gillette and was surprised by its size.</li>
            <li> Which leads us to my first point: The blades for the Fusion ProGlide are around 4 bucks each.</li>
            <li> The five bladed Fusion gave me a closer shave on top of the 3 bladed shaver I had been married to for the last 12 years.  </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that the power button on the updated razor is flush with the handle, making it a bit harder to turn on accidentally.</li>
            <li> I was also pleased with how simple it is to instal the battery and turn it on.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for providing the razor for me to review!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I wish it was compatible with the Mach3 heads as I personally feel that the Mach3&#x27;s are better than the fusion&#x27;s even without the vibrating feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many shaves the strip should last</li>
            <li> After only 2 shaves with this one, I found my irritation clearing up even more.</li>
            <li> This is the first handle I have owned that requires a battery.</li>
            <li> FIRST IMPRESSION -</li>
            <li> The same rubber that outlines the word \\&quot;PROGLIDE\\&quot; on the razor&#x27;s underside should also outline the word \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot; on its top side.</li>
            <li> I recently received the latest Gilette Fusion Proglide Power for free through a program with Gillette and was pleasantly surprised with the quality after being a longtime user of the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the vibrating was a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Definitely was better when used in the \\&quot;off\\&quot; position.  </li>
            <li> The only down-side I found was that the power button was not located in the most intuitive place.</li>
            <li> the top shelf 5 blade razors perform the same over time, so let me focus on the power</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product before I bought it, I will definitely be switching though.</li>
            <li> So this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a 4 blade</li>
            <li> I have ordered several more razors already.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor!!</li>
            <li> At first I thought that adding a battery powered handle was just some gimmick, suffice to say it did make a difference in the how the shave felt.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time this week</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vibration was a bit distracting at first, but after getting used to it</li>
            <li> So for me it really was worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first time I have ever used a battery powered handled razor blade.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; in this razor was just a gimmick.</li>
            <li> The power part causes the razor to vibrate and by doing so, allows the razor to cut hairs better than a regular manual razor would.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that this handle is larger than many others</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not 100% sure that the vibrating handle actually did anything</li>
            <li> Prior to this razor, I was using the Gilette Mach 3 turbo which gave me an ok shave.</li>
            <li> The handle was also much easier to control and handle!</li>
            <li> I am a believer and the way it helps lift the hairs up and makes a really close shave!</li>
            <li> The first shave was the closest shave</li>
            <li> I do not think my shave was any better than with my regular razor.</li>
            <li> The power part causes the razor to vibrate and by doing so, allows the razor to cut hair better than a regular manual razor.</li>
            <li> When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.</li>
            <li> I was interested in if the power made any difference</li>
            <li> Here is the funny part.</li>
            <li> it has a better gip than the standard Fusion Power.  </li>
            <li> only reasoning for the razor not being a 5/5 was that the top of the razor head where the lubricating strip is located was just a bit too large for me to be able to get the upper lip right under my nose area.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> I give 4 stars because it is an excellent razor but too expensive.  </li>
            <li> The handle is larger than most razors.</li>
            <li> It has a nice rubber textured grip and I didn&#x27;t find it slipping in or out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> At first it took some time to get used to the thing buzzing.</li>
            <li> When I first looked at the razor handle</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever tried for difficult grain areas, like under the neck.</li>
            <li> I first received my razor</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for many years, I used to buy Schick razors for test and possible replacement option once in a while.</li>
            <li> Overall better build quality.</li>
            <li> had my doubts at first.</li>
            <li> The grips gave me a good mechanism for firm grip.  </li>
            <li> The razor felt good in my hand and wasn&#x27;t too heavy or too lightweight.</li>
            <li> This razor is okay, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype, and, most certainly, not the price.   </li>
            <li> The handle itself is broad and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> I am able to shave every OTHER DAY, and I work in an industry that prefers men to be clean</li>
            <li> I am a loyal consumer of Gilette products, and in my opinion this product meets the high quality standards I have come to expect from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> This new handle really allows you to utilize all of the razors because it fits so comfortably.</li>
            <li> The new larger handle with grip is nice</li>
            <li> I was invited to get a free razor of a new shaving technology offered via a program run by Gillette, I was ready to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife has sensitive skin and loves the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power since she can touch my face without feeling like she is touching sandpaper.</li>
            <li> It does some like the blades stay sharp for a long time which is VERY good.</li>
            <li> The vibrating handle make it more smooth and less bothersome to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave itself didn&#x27;t seem to be any more comfortable then previous generation products.</li>
            <li> The handle was easy to hold and the grip was comfortable even when wet.  </li>
            <li> The handle was solid,  easy to grip, and was not slippery when shaving fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li> For most this expertise is easily acquired but for a few they never get the hang of</li>
            <li> Super smooth 7 hours later!  </li>
            <li> This is a radical change from previous Gillette razors I&#x27;ve used and was a more comfortable razor to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vibration also seems to help the blades move much more smoothly through the hairs with less pressure.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I was lucky to receive and sample a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> More smooth, less razor burn for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to test it out for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive them for free through a program for Gillette.</li>
            <li> I pay more for chewing gum, and don&#x27;t enjoy it half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have Gillette send me a free razor to try out</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have been selected to receive the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a similar non-power handle by Gillette for years, so this felt very familiar.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if it did a hugely better job, as I was still marveling at the clean smooth cuts from the blade itself, but it did seem to make it easier.  </li>
            <li> I can only compare it to other Gillette razors, but this is by far their best.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I never would have bought this cartridge as I&#x27;m a regular user of an old-school safety blade razor which works great for me.  </li>
            <li> The precision trimmer edges up nicely for the clean cut look, but after experimenting I also feel it&#x27;s a less risky shave than the main blades around the \\&quot;danger zone\\&quot; chin and neck area.    </li>
            <li> The handle shape is easy to grip &amp; with the side grips, there&#x27;s no slipping or dropping while I&#x27;m trying to shave.  </li>
            <li> I felt that I barely had to push down on the razor to get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free from gillette, which was awesome, and will definitely be stocking up on the blades, i am not crazy about the chrome color, but at the end of the day it is merely the color of your razor, not something to ruin your day.</li>
            <li> I use all sorts of different blades and have tryed many different kinds of blades and have noticed that no blade is good enough for me unless it is made in usa from chainsaws to stanley utility knife blades-carbide drill bits</li>
            <li> Right now, Amazon has a special offer for $3.00 off, so that pretty much zeros out the price difference with the cheaper (and less able) brands.</li>
            <li> This handle is that 16 year old with a tricked out shiny Honda Civic with loud exhaust and a cool sound system.  </li>
            <li> I finished shaving and was VERY pleased, so much so that I look forward to my next shave which never happened with the old model.  </li>
            <li> : the battery is tricky to put it, so be sure to look at the little slip that comes with the handle or you&#x27;ll be perplexed like  </li>
            <li> I normally purchase almost everything on Amazon, but I was fortunate enough to get this product in the mail for free from Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this razor as a whole but the handle of this razor is much different than others that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I also do not get nearly the quality shave that I get with the original blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this the other day from Gillette and I really liked this razor.</li>
            <li> It does provide a nice weight to the handle which makes it easier to hold and use on the face and other body parts.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference other than the vibration is kind of annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a little more time for shaving, and a little attention to technique, you can get shaves with an old safety razor that are as good or better than anything you can do with a Gillette Fusion.    </li>
            <li> The little moisture strip at the top of the razor seems to really help in allowing it to glide over your skin easily.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer was the icing on the cake for me; this thing really got the hard to reach spots under the nose and worked great at the side burns.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the original fusion for since it lights less bulky and</li>
            <li> So all in all I gave it a 4 star rating only because I feel that it is just as adequate as the original without needing the power handle.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe that this much more is actually better, but it is.  </li>
            <li> The blades did a great job of keeping my face smooth and clean for long but the handle was just like other average or cheap brands.</li>
            <li> I have been loving my new Gillette Fusion Proglide power handle since I received it a few weeks ago free via a program Gillette is running.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed with the Gillette Fusion my face is smoother throughout the day much longer compared to my old cheap razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I rate the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle 5 stars, because it really does fulfill what it is advertised to do and offers the closest shave a man can get, primarily because of the battery powered micropulses, flexibility, and ergonomic design.</li>
            <li> I do not mention this as a negative, but rather it is very sturdy and feels great in the hand.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to achieve a nice shave with its thin blades.</li>
            <li> In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean.</li>
            <li> so its more of a natural grip with makes for smoother shaving, less slips and quicker more percise shaving.</li>
            <li> , maybe it was just me, but the blade included with this razor, provided free by a Gillete program, wore out very quickly, prompting me to have to make a quick stop the next day to my local Walgreens to pick up a refill cartridge.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of trail shaving, I must admit that the Gillette is by far the most masculine looking razor I have ever used, however it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li> personally recommend buying a good quality handle, quality double edge shaving blades and quality shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll note again that while this difference was evident during the shaving process, the end result (the shaving closeness) was pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best advice for those with sensitive skin, stick with the old stand-bys from Gillette (the ones that don&#x27;t vibrate) and you&#x27;ll do better...</li>
            <li> Overall I felt the shaving performance and results were just as good as the regular Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Sure, for a few bucks you get an electric razor that is really fantastic.  </li>
            <li> (well, at least most men do most days)</li>
            <li> I mention this only because I feel this razor does such a good job why not pamper yourself and feel like you just had a spa experience.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling nice and soft after each shave.</li>
            <li> As i was shaving last week with my beloved Quattro, my hubby walked in and noticed how I was repeatedly shaving the same spot over and over.</li>
            <li> the only way it could be better is if you got one at a braber shop with a straight razor...</li>
            <li> Weight is evenly balanced with a solid grip and provides a clean quick shave.  </li>
            <li> Love the side grips and just really the overall color scheme and look of the product...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just not worth more than the non-power version.</li>
            <li> I recently was able to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle thanks to a sample provided by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I love the bigger handle with the ergonomic side grips that has made holding on to the handle and navigating it around my face and neck so much easier for</li>
            <li> this first thing I noticed was the the large grip.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It certainly costs a bit more than other razor, but you&#x27;re paying for a far superior overall experience</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the heads lasted a bit longer, but they do last as long as my old ones and with better results.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and worth the money.</li>
            <li> After using it a half dozen times, I love it!</li>
            <li> My face was super soft!</li>
            <li> Gillette needs to get back to basics by realizing it is much easier to keep a satisfied customer who gets a good, comfortable shave as opposed to introducing new brands of razors that have gimmicks, and that are, not to mention, ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> Most of the time this is because it is a hollow plastic, as a result I always need to grip tighter to get the right sort of control and pressure I want on the blade.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor through a program run by Gilette and Gilette has finally gotten it right with this system.</li>
            <li> The Proglide left my face super soft and the best part was I hardly got any bumps after using it for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing to mention is that replacement blades are a little pricey, but worth it for such a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schicks for a long time because they&#x27;re super lightweight and comfortable to hold while my arm is up in the air.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I notice is that it has a package that is easy to open...</li>
            <li> battery vibration seemed odd at first, but honestly I think it helps to make a smoother and closer shave.</li>
            <li> : is there a positive difference?    </li>
            <li> grip is positive and tacky.</li>
            <li> I have had a positive shave experience with the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First impressions were positive.  </li>
            <li> The grips are a positive addition.</li>
            <li> The thinner blades of the cartridge make for less tug and pull than some other razors; I&#x27;m sure the good grips, the swiveling head, and the concomitant enhanced maneuverability likewise contribute to the ease of shaving.  </li>
            <li> The difference is clear and can be compared to holding a full tang chef&#x27;s knife against holding a wood handled discount knife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gladly recommend the handle to anyone in the market as long as they wanted to go with the 5 blade option.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be too much of a gimmick to me at first glance.</li>
            <li> I have been using one blade for a month and it still shaves smooth with no drag.  </li>
            <li> really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power since the first time I started using it</li>
            <li> With the Fusion Power, I&#x27;d pretty much have to shave in the shower to avoid razor burn on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock sharp edge double edge blades (made in Russia) are great and inexpensive - $34 for      100 at the time of this review.              </li>
            <li> The straight razor ritual just takes too much time for me, but I totally understand whey some people would love it.</li>
            <li> if you really are into shaving and willing to shell out the dough.</li>
            <li> also provides a very close shave - which is exactly what I have been looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what this will do after a few more shaves.</li>
            <li> Even when wet, there was a nice grip that prevented it from slipping, giving me better control.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time and it works every time, I love it</li>
            <li> The vibration, though, is pretty much there for a gimmick.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed is that the handle is thicker with a beefy rubber grip.  </li>
            <li> the shave is super smooth and clean, I&#x27;m not sure if its the added vibrating option or just and overall better razor..</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the non-power version simply because I&#x27;m thrifty (okay, some might say cheap)</li>
            <li> This thing really works A quick clean close shave, even with an extra days growth.  </li>
            <li> A razor is pretty much a razor, right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.</li>
            <li> I was not sure how good the idea of a power razor was with shaving</li>
            <li> I had been using the \\&quot;Gillette Mach 3\\&quot; for the past couple of years and it was good.</li>
            <li> But if you think this matters, it is definitely true that the lubricant strip is heavier than on the old blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is superior to the razors I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It felt good in my hands, not too small, not too bulky.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not that far into using it to know if that is a true statement.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave and only shave once instead of going over and over the same area to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not exactly sure what difference the \\&quot;power\\&quot; makes shave wise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a proglide since it was new and got this new iteration as a free trial.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and keeps my face smooth for longer than my previous razor.  </li>
            <li> The slight vibration made for a comfortable and almost therapeutic shave on my easily irritated face.  </li>
            <li> I tried out this razor free as part of a The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor has a nice, solid weight to it, plus bigger, more ergonomic side grips compared to previous versions.  </li>
            <li> I liked that I dont have to use a new blade every single time I shave.  </li>
            <li> The thinner blades didn&#x27;t clog up and washed out pretty easy (which was a HUGE complaint about my older Fusion), and after using it for a few weeks, the blade is duller but not as nick happy as I thought it would</li>
            <li> microcomb feature aligns your facial hair so that it cuts in the right direction, which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> The razor glides right over my face with minimal effort (especially when using a good gel shaving cream).  </li>
            <li> Concerning the lubricating strip, it is a definite improvement, being more slick and lasting longer while the handle allows a more secure and comfortable grip than its predecessor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricier than non-power options, but for me it seems a better value than buying a full electric razor.</li>
            <li> Small, light, powerful, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, bigger is better to fit in my gorilla mits and this one is larger than its&#x27; predecessors, It&#x27;s very shiny, so it is aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> And the other great benefit is that your razor blades last much, much longer.  </li>
            <li> is the same as on the other Fusion razors, which help to make it comfortable and effective.</li>
            <li> All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.    </li>
            <li> The handle is balanced and easy to grip, and you need to get used to holding it a bit differently because of the system vibration.</li>
            <li> The handle is balanced and easy to grip, and you need to get used to holding it a bit differently because of the vibration.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was hassle-free and easy to open, requiring no scissors or additional patience to get through a barrier of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan on trying the power handle with a normal ProGlide cartridge, while also trying the enhanced ProGlide Power cartridge on a standard handle to see which component contributed more to the easiest and closest shave</li>
            <li> While the off mode gave a really nice shave, the on mode gave me a closer, smoother shave with a lot less irritation.</li>
            <li> I not only could feel the difference in holding it but a scale shows the difference easily.</li>
            <li> My Gillette Fusion Proglide experience has been nothing less than spectacular.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bulbous end to the handle, which is slightly larger than the rest of the handle, and it made it easy for me to pinch and pivot the handle in my finger tips to get under my neck and chin line.  </li>
            <li> I am very particular with the razors I use</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> I like the bigger handle and easy grip easier to helP me shave but the vibrating part I could do without.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is my finger can easily accidentally disable the vibrating pulse when changing grips.</li>
            <li> It is of solid construction and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was so simply to use and easy to load the battery into the handle.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m lucky, but my skin is fairly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> This battery-operated razor is easy to setup, and place in a simple AAA battery.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace, they last about 1-2 weeks per double-sided blade, dependng on beard thickness.</li>
            <li> yes, Gillette is clearly bullying the marketplace as we longtime loyal customers can no longer find our favorites in the stores.</li>
            <li> How much better can these possibly be than a normal razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me the opportunity to use the first razor free of charge, however, I will continue to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li> I noticed the places I normally have to hit two or more times to get a close shave only took one swipe.</li>
            <li> Did not slip and was easy to move around, even with my big meat hooks of hands.  </li>
            <li> The larger handle made for easy shaving</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, anyone who is minimally handy will figure it out in less then 30 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vibration seemed to make the razor slice through stubble twice as easy as before, as though it turned the stationary blades into a sort of oscillating saw you&#x27;d use to cut drywall, but on a much smaller scale.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor in a free package that Gillette sent to me and was cautious at first.</li>
            <li> and I quickly found out that I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> honestly didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in closeness, or less irritation, than I got with my Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle only takes 1 aaa battery which is easy to change.  </li>
            <li> The compartment that houses the batteries was easy to open and close thereby making it easy to replace them when necessary as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, I have a natural bias toward the traditional heavy metal type and consider most of the disposable razors on the market today as just cheap pieces of plastic which are better for women&#x27;s legs and underarms than a man&#x27;s beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I expected more automation from the Power razor.</li>
            <li> The batteries and razor blade were still going strong after shaving daily for over a week</li>
            <li> This product well engineered, and I strongly recommend you go to your local department store and pick one up!</li>
            <li> It is just slightly thickly then a normal razor, which is great since I have large hands.  </li>
            <li> For many years I’ve exclusively used a single blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the power component helped, but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> ProGlide Fusion Power features a large handle, a five-blade cartridge, and a battery-powered motor that produces \\&quot;micropulses\\&quot; (vibrations) during shaving.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do large volumes with it, but it works for its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> and I have no use for the vibration feature, but maybe certain genders do, who knows?</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from the brand to try out, but I will certainly be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I saw a large, end-cap display for these razors yesterday at CVS.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly is a convenient feature.</li>
            <li> I should start by saying I have large hands (think XL size gloves).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for certain.</li>
            <li> I am sold of this new product!!</li>
            <li> Next, the whole handle is waterproof, so you can take full advantage of the power feature in the shower!  </li>
            <li> My wife often finds great savings for these razor systems so it is possible toget it for a much lower price than the average retail cost.  </li>
            <li> Overall i&#x27;m pretty happy with it and will likely purchase more blade refills for it in the future, changing from a very long experience with the Shick Quattro Titanium.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only gripe; this new handle with the better grip works well for</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this product and the new larger handle.</li>
            <li> I was able to this new razor against my current Mach 4 razor to see what all the hype was about</li>
            <li> the blades are much different from what I was using but the application of them in this was is new and certainly better.</li>
            <li> I was exceptionally surprised when after my first shave I had decided that I would go out and purchase a replacement cartridge right away.</li>
            <li> I now go through one time all downstrokes, then a second time through going up, and with that little vibrating thing (doesn&#x27;t it seem like that would not be a good idea, for the razor against your face to shake really quickly while you&#x27;re using it?)</li>
            <li> The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise.</li>
            <li> start, the packaging was done very well...easy to open and easy</li>
            <li> The vibrations that the handle puts out are strong enough to distract me from what it really going on.  </li>
            <li> perhaps that actually has a bit more to do with the weight distribution of the handle than i attributed, but nevertheless these blades do a better job, hands down.</li>
            <li> in all, its a great razor, but its super expensive to buy cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Right then I decided to upgrade to a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Putting the battery in was easy and felt light a tight fit when I put the cover back on.  </li>
            <li> About twice as much per cartridge, not sure the trade off of a better fresh feeling shave would be worth the cost difference.  </li>
            <li> This is very important as I shave in the shower where my hands are always wet and often slippery from soap and shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> The single blade at the back of the blade head does a great job especially above the top and lower lip, and the soft blue glow of the power button does add a cool touch.</li>
            <li> While the slight vibration while shaving with the razor power on was pleasant, I did not notice a major difference in the closeness of the shave I got while using the razor with the power off.</li>
            <li> While I like my old comfortable razor that I have had for years - I REALLY appreciate the new Proglide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the battery is most of the weight, but the handle is also a little bigger and contoured (unlike the Mach 3 which is pretty much just a straight shaft).</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I used electric razors, Norelco and Braun types, and thought they were fine; I was a bit intimidated by manual shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure from a cost standpoint, this razor is going to be a lot more expensive to use on a regular basis than my trusty Mach 3, but I can&#x27;t argue that it provides a better shave.</li>
            <li> The commercials had me a bit skeptical at first, but once I tried it, I LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> A super close shave and my skin was left feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The handle is big for my women groomers, but fits my hand fine.</li>
            <li> All in all, a very clever design, and very slim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is actually pretty decent, and the Gillette brand is one I respect.</li>
            <li> At first glance it&#x27;s a close cousin of the older Fusion - 5 blades (+ a trimmer blade) on a vibrating handle.</li>
            <li> At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I&#x27;m getter older</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty particular since I shave my face and head.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had introduced me to this razor line and spoke very highly of it, but I ignored it thinking it was just another razor.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was able to sue this razor all five work days last week without much discomfort by the end of the week.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed if the power option really changes my shave at all, but time will tell and it certainly doesnt bother me while shaving.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it is waterproof and a little thicker with a nice grip</li>
            <li> Due to the greater time-consumption of maintaining a straight razor, I suggest trying a safety razor outfit first.</li>
            <li> liked the 5 blades and found that there was little to no pull and tug.</li>
            <li> It really made the razor handle look slick and like a product of exceptional quality.</li>
            <li> first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this razor is the high quality design.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to anyone that wants that close shave that you are always looking for!</li>
            <li> first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this razor is the high quality design.</li>
            <li> However overall this razor is very comfortable very well made and is a marked improvement over any disposable razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It still shaves very smooth, but I am not certain if the power function really does anything.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great little device.</li>
            <li> The mild humming is odd for a safety razor, but not disturbing at all, and the shave is fantastic.</li>
            <li> A really good razor is hard to find</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think the razor is a good value considering the quality and the longevity of the blades, it takes some time for the blades to dull.</li>
            <li> A really good razor is hard to find</li>
            <li> I was very surpised as this razor was very high powered.  </li>
            <li> I must note that the blade gets worn down very easily and gets clogged with shaving cream/hair.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face very easily and keep the shave time down to 2 days or so.</li>
            <li> I fully appreciate how this shaver helps cut down on the time to obtain a clean, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> While the Proglide provided a great shave, the Hydro 5 did the same job for much less...and with money tight the way it is these days, I need to cut corners where possible, and the Schick razor allows me to do that without sacrificing a fantastic shave in the process.</li>
            <li> While the Proglide provided a great shave, the Hydro 5 did the same job for much less...and with money tight the way it is these days, I need to cut corners where possible, and the Schick razor allows me to do that without sacrificing a fantastic shave in the process.</li>
            <li> I rated this 4/5 because it might not be the best option if you have very thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product, but I would probably not buy it because for how little I would use the vibration action, the price would not be worth it.</li>
            <li> so light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large groves on the handle were nice for gripping, especially since your hands get wet and possibly slippery when shaving with shaving cream or gel.</li>
            <li> so I got my free Power ProGlide from Gillette for trial and intended to use it with an open mind but was not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> I get a smooth shave with fewer strokes and the blades seem to last much longer than I am used to.  </li>
            <li> Few days later, I went out and got the Shick Hydro 3 blade, now this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> The vibration really allows a very close and very nick-free shave.</li>
            <li> Needing to shave everyday its one those items that need to last a bit, happy to say that the razor has held up for two weeks</li>
            <li> Even the luring blue light to show that it on is very aesthetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li> The wide handle is great for use in the shower because the grips help you hold on to it when wet and soapy.  </li>
            <li> Very visible blue light lets me know the razor is on.</li>
            <li> really like the thin blades which gives you a closer cut with out the irritation which is really great for people like me whose skin gets irritated</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette...</li>
            <li> I found the grip to be very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was suprised, it complements the Proglide blades and provides for a much smoother shave and experience than I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of this razor from a Gillete promotion.</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 blade moved around, but not quite as much.  </li>
            <li> And, when the power is engaged, you really feel connected to the razor handle.</li>
            <li> (I received them as a free demo through Gillette), and I&#x27;ve got mixed feelings about it.</li>
            <li> The vibration really does work.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of a vibrating straight razor.  </li>
            <li> The gentle vibration it has when turned on felt soothing to the face.</li>
            <li> I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave.</li>
            <li> The vibration really help with not getting any nicks.  </li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to the Fusion ProGlide Power razor by receiving a free sample through a program that Gillette was running.</li>
            <li> This is really an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; razor for me.</li>
            <li> That makes me very happy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, especially after getting the ProGlide Power through a free program by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only con that I have is the price but after receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free through a program ran by Gillette</li>
            <li> turned the power off and it was a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> The razor is a vary solid design and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; that the batter power provides really does let the razor get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I was ready.  </li>
            <li> When I recently had the opportunity to try one for free through a program run by Gillette, though, I decided to take my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades work really well, but I do not see the benefit of the vibration.</li>
            <li> but the whole vibration thing not so much.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any improvement in the shave over the non-powered version.  </li>
            <li> The robust design keeps the razor in my hands no matter how much water and shaving cream get on them.  </li>
            <li> I really like the power handle on this razor.</li>
            <li> That is what i think makes it very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> The blade currently seems to be holding out well and makes my skin feel soooo smooth.</li>
            <li> Using the power feature didn&#x27;t do much for my shave.</li>
            <li> This razor went straight through without a problem.  </li>
            <li> I received the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette, and I really like the handle and how the razor shaves, but I don&#x27;t really see or feel a big difference between shaving with it on or off.</li>
            <li> It is a smooth shave with a tiny massage while the hairs are coming off your chinny chin chin.  </li>
            <li> My thanks to Gillette&#x27;s promotional program that gave me the product to review.</li>
            <li> Turn on the power handle and get ready for the shake.  </li>
            <li> really gripped the skin (without irritation or cuts) and delivered a crazy-close shave.  </li>
            <li> The handle fits my hand comfortably and is simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Storage: I enjoy the simple plastic holder that comes with the handle.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually, it is much easier to just run the electric razor over my face on the way out</li>
            <li> i love how it never slips even when wet and</li>
            <li> With the handle \\&quot;powered up\\&quot; it vibrates, although not noticeably on the face, and the shave is much smoother with no tug at all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle gave me a very close shave and did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharper and leaves a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked very well.</li>
            <li> The contours on the handle made it much easier to grip and maneuver with.</li>
            <li> When you turn on the razor it vibrates which makes the shaving much easier and smoother.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked VERY well.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows really fast</li>
            <li> It is a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free one from a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> The rubbery grip stays in your hand very well</li>
            <li> The battery provides the \\&quot;Power\\&quot;, which is really just a vibrating motion to the razor blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li> and this one is on the light side, especially if you remove the battery.  </li>
            <li> now includes a \\&quot;power on\\&quot; light that flashes when you&#x27;re running low on juice, having that heads up</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
            <li> Recently received free Gillette Proglide power razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> The shave with this razor really is &#x27;closer&#x27; than the non-power 4 blade Gillete razor</li>
            <li> how much is power</li>
            <li> and I really like the performance of this one .</li>
            <li> I got this razor free from Gillette about a month ago and put it into my daily rotation.  </li>
            <li> I had always thought that the razor market was filled with commodity products, but this morning my eyes were open to what I have been missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work in the OR as a Surgical Nurse and we are demanded to be very close shaven.  </li>
            <li> The continuous vibration is coupled with a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor, simply helping bring hair to the surface for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It really is their smoothest shave yet.</li>
            <li> The vibration really made it feel like I could glide over my hair, rather than get that tug and pull that can happen so often when shaving.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Gillette products but it really depends on your needs.</li>
            <li> The Proglide really excels at that and keeps irritation to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> The appearance was very shiny.</li>
            <li> I was recently chosen to recieve the power fusion handle for free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette.</li>
            <li> vibrating feature does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a close, long-lasting, shave.</li>
            <li> The part I really like are these shavers with the lubrication strip.</li>
            <li> I tried the Power Handle and was absolutely blown away by the difference it made.</li>
            <li> I really like the grip and how the handle feels while I am shaving.</li>
            <li> It was very close.</li>
            <li> I was recently given a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I felt very indulged feeling the added closeness the micropulses provided.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely would recommend this razor to everyone, even the ladies.</li>
            <li> I have used out cheaper power handles and didn&#x27;t notice much of a change besides my a hand vibrating.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free Gillette Proglide Power Handle shaver through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Its sort of like a gentle vibration while you shave and it seems to help get a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> The handle vibration really enhances the shave quality and the functionality of the handle itself.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really want to have to change batteries as well as blades and the LED</li>
            <li> is a bit much.</li>
            <li> The handle of the Gillette Fusion had just the appropriate amount of rubber to stay in my hand, even when wet.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying&lt;br</li>
            <li> has not really increased and the shave is much better than before.</li>
            <li> The handle is much more&lt;</li>
            <li> Given that Gillette passed on a free one to try out, I will be purchasing them in the future.</li>
            <li> While the vibration is &#x27;neat&#x27;, it didn&#x27;t really seem to improve my shave.</li>
            <li> The aesthetics of the shaver itself makes it look cutting edge (no pun intended), futuristic, and impressive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews much</li>
            <li> * fast shave&lt;br /</li>
            <li> * very close shave as expected&lt;br /</li>
            <li> &gt;* very aesthetically pleasing design</li>
            <li> From a program run by Gillette for a free razor, I finally had no excuses to try it out.</li>
            <li> The handle is quite comfortable,but, I don&#x27;t believe there is much difference between the manual and the power razor.</li>
            <li> I also feel that there wasn&#x27;t much difference between my Mach 3 or either Gillette razor, except the price in the blades.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about using an electric that has real blades and the motion from the \\&quot;Power\\</li>
            <li> I also like the straight edge but for someone who would do precision shaping on a goatee</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much to where it&#x27;s noisy or annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need the battery operation and don&#x27;t think it makes any difference now that I have it</li>
            <li> close shave and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find there was much &#x27;glide&#x27; and</li>
            <li> and it seems to really minimize any tug and pull.</li>
            <li> , it really does make a difference</li>
            <li> , i bought this one, to know another type of razor, and i have to say that this razor is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gillette has done it again, smooth and silky shave system second to none!  </li>
            <li> It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box.</li>
            <li> Maintaining a straight razor at home is time-consuming.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shaving, and I put it off when I can, but the Powerglide has made shaving so fast that I&#x27;m no longer trying to avoid it.</li>
            <li> But give us the option of buying a simple twin Sensor blade at an affordable price and keep it readily available.</li>
            <li> This could be a big drawback for some, but I value the comfortable</li>
            <li> dunno about buying into the whole Gillette \\&quot;system\\&quot; of warm-up washes, Fusion creams, and cooling aftershave.</li>
            <li> I dunno about buying into the whole Gillette \\&quot;system\\&quot; of warm-up washes, Fusion creams, and cooling aftershave.</li>
            <li> Both shave very close.  </li>
            <li> I have all the products - the Merkur&#x27;s safety razors, the Gillette Fatboy, and as assortment of straight razors from Dovo and Thiers Issard.  </li>
            <li> That may be too much to ask.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was given a free [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> (non-powered type), and I tried it, but didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s already too much IMO.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all sizzle and not too much substance.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a tip that has really served me well:  </li>
            <li> use hair conditioner rather than shaving foam, and you will get a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I get much closer shaves.  </li>
            <li> Very well dsigned product.</li>
            <li> Now that he switched over to this one, his face is REALLY much smoother.</li>
            <li> Really...</li>
            <li> I know this is my first night using it, but i just want to let everyone know that i dont normally write reviews for stuff i buy on here</li>
            <li> This is a very well made razor.</li>
            <li> This is legit, and the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see any movement of the razor</li>
            <li> The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain.</li>
            <li> With the proglide I only have had to change the blades once in two weeks, and the performance has always been fantastic.</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t get the power thing.</li>
            <li> I have a friend that really likes his Proglide</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was a bit much.  </li>
            <li> Only had a day&#x27;s growth that night, but noticed that this was astonishingly smooth, non-grabby</li>
            <li> I do like the lore and beauty of a handmade straight razor and was thinking of one, but I shave in the shower, strictly by feel, and don&#x27;t take much time doing it.</li>
            <li> It really does glide over your face.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial and automatically thought the fusion was great this one must be better, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> The blades are pricey, but I doubt I&#x27;ll mind too much given the results.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the Power Razor as it really does make a difference while shaving</li>
            <li> and you will really see this ProGlide Power come to life..</li>
            <li> This razor works really well</li>
            <li> but this is as close as it gets without learning how to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I ended up with one of these as a sample, not expecting much from it.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea why the vibration works the way it does, but when used in the bikini area, it gives incredibly smooth, irritation-free results that I didn&#x27;t think were possible.  </li>
            <li> You should really give this razor a try.</li>
            <li> He has used it on facial hair abit longer and it still manages to shave his skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> Granted, the cartridges on this do cost 4 times as much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it without reservations to anyone!  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to me to aid much in shaving.  </li>
            <li> There has been so much hype around this razor.</li>
            <li> I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not looking for a religious experience when I shave - just smooth skin without irritation, nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see any movement of the razor</li>
            <li> when I look at it turned on, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> I need a firmer razor, one that doesn&#x27;t flop around as much at the head.</li>
            <li> Really like the power feature.</li>
            <li> Some of us may recall that the &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; our fathers used to shave with was called a straight razor.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret of getting a great shave depends on the pressure one applies to the shaving &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;,  </li>
            <li> I was really considering the safety razor route, but now I may not have to.</li>
            <li> so the sturdiness is appreciated.</li>
            <li> It conformed very well to my face.</li>
            <li> neither of them really got the chin and neck areas.  </li>
            <li> I rate this one highly!</li>
            <li> With the battery it vibrates giving your fingers that gentle relaxing massage while you shave your face.</li>
            <li> really gives a close shave w/o razor burn</li>
            <li> This razor works really well.</li>
            <li> I still think the expense is a lot but not so much</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> so I could really put this razor to the test.</li>
            <li> Moral of the story, if you like a smooth effortless shave, every time, us the vibration.</li>
            <li> As it turns out I dont really see the advantage.  </li>
            <li> Prior to getting this handle for free from Gillette, I was using the non-Power ProGlide version.</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to check out a Fusion ProGlide Power thanks to a freebie from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting the handle to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I seem to get a very close shave and with little/no cuts.  </li>
            <li> Fits really well in the hand.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> and I will say that the power doesn&#x27;t really make that much difference,</li>
            <li> I really like the power feature in the handle.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle and Razor from a program they were running, and couldn&#x27;t wait to open the package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well balanced.  </li>
            <li> I really like these battery operated razors.  </li>
            <li> I like the blue power light.</li>
            <li> I felt like it kept getting stuck and pulling too much.</li>
            <li> I received this free from gillette to try controlling my facial hair</li>
            <li> But the real question is how well does it work?</li>
            <li> it provided a very close shave</li>
            <li> I will need to see if the cartridge lasts a whole month as it is stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the non-powered version, I had to go over a lot of areas multiple times to get a smooth shave, which created irritation.</li>
            <li> I could really feel the battery powered micropulses in conjuction with the microcomb lift the hairs up and guide them in a uniform direction for a closer cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this one without paying much attention.  </li>
            <li> It really does help get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I feel that it really helped me get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I really like the handle</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It is very durable</li>
            <li> I also like the gentle microvibrations and feel like they lead to a closer shave.</li>
            <li> it made for a very pleasurable shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I really feel like it helps the shave</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the need for the battery component when you still have to manually move the razor.  </li>
            <li> but now I really like it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> You will go through several cheap disposable razors in length of time you use 1 of these razors.  </li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this razor thanks to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I have purchased the razor both prior to and after using the free product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor for several weeks after it was provided to me free from a Gillette run program.</li>
            <li> and I find myself not dropping it as much as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Now including a \\&quot;power on\\&quot; light that flashes when you&#x27;re running low on juice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets very close to the skin and have yet to have a cut.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended the power razor!</li>
            <li> I thought, \\&quot;who wants to put a vibrating razor to their face?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as part of a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> The smooth and sleek design of the rest of the handle gives the razor that extra appeal.  </li>
            <li> These really help the razor glide across your face, without any pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li> Well see how much the blades are and decide if she is going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always running around in the morning trying to get myself together, and tend to worry about nicking myself in my hurry to get ready for the office.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people think that the only important part of shaving is the blade.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> This razor, though convenient and smooth in some ways, does not rationalize the cost it would require for you to constantly change the head/blades.</li>
            <li> I got recently got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle for free to try out via a program from Gillte.</li>
            <li> I really like the comb on each blade</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for providing this to me as a promotion.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor through a program run by Gillette giving me the opportunity to try the product without the financial burden.  </li>
            <li> Much better than expected.</li>
            <li> I began waxing but that would take so much time</li>
            <li> though, I highly recommend this razor, for women too!</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s that much of a difference as to the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Also another feature that was improved on this model was the micro pulses that are generated by the power handle which has given me a much smoother feel after shaving.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor is very well made, shaves quite close and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Besides that, the handle performs very well.</li>
            <li> In combination with the the blades it provides a VERY close shave.  </li>
            <li> It works well with the power on, but you get a much smoother shave with the power on.  </li>
            <li> Our household likes it so much we have switched to using it exclusively.</li>
            <li> I really was anticipating getting this power handle in the mail.</li>
            <li> It still shaves me very closely.</li>
            <li> so I needed a handle that will be able to stick to my hand when shaving the harder areas like the jaw line.</li>
            <li> Getting the sideburns cut straight was a breeze.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for any one looking for a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The vibration really does make a difference, especially on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> really like the Power feature.  </li>
            <li> The shave is much closer and smoother than fusion.</li>
            <li> i was recently selected to receive a Gillette Fusion Proglide power for free from a program that Gillette is running.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the stabilizer does too much for me</li>
            <li> I will absolutely continue using this razor.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor recently from Gillette and have never been happier with a razor before.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette products before, to mixed reviews, but after doing my research, I decided to give the Fusion ProGlide Power a chance through a free Gillette promotion.</li>
            <li> Recently, I received the Gillett Fusion ProGlide Handle for free via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very picky about handles.</li>
            <li> However, once I started to shave, the power function didn&#x27;t cause any damage, so I am much at ease with it.  </li>
            <li> I recently received a free ProGlide Power Razor from a program sponsored by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> but I looked as though they didn&#x27;t leave as much razor burn as I would sometimes get.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery operated micropulses didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> and I could not comprehend how the 5 blades can make such a smooth shave and believe me it did.</li>
            <li> a very close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Having 5 blades is a bit much for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;After receiving a free razor through a program from Gillette, I am definitely making a switch again.  </li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t see myself paying what the Fusion ProGlide Power is selling for.</li>
            <li> It was very close.</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to mention that I don&#x27;t normally shave with a razor.  </li>
            <li> The handle has a power button that makes the razor vibrate gently while you&#x27;re shaving.  </li>
            <li> It really required a side by side</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t feel much difference in the smoothness of the shave itself, I did notice a difference in the act of shaving.</li>
            <li> The gentle vibration must do something to help reduce the risk of razor burn and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t nick his face as much and loves for power part of it.</li>
            <li> The handle makes it so much easier to shave your face.</li>
            <li> I Found it very convenient and very ergonomically suited to the palm of the hand.</li>
            <li> and it changed my whole shaving experience!&lt;br</li>
            <li> this handle are the same that fit the non-vibrating handle</li>
            <li> The price is higher than a normal handle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li> but there are HIGH VALUE coupons everywhere!</li>
            <li> i really didn&#x27;t understand the vibration.</li>
            <li> so darn much i am going to switch to an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I like the battery power light that provided indication of when the handle was on or off, and whether the battery powewas low.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a program run by Gillette, I had the opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this product.</li>
            <li> None really,</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> One thing that really helps is the conditioning strip on the blade itself.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a very close shave, there was no stubble when I was finished.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades seem to do really well at hacking the hair to pieces before it has a chance to tug.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different razors and I really enjoy this one.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I had a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Does it really make a difference?  </li>
            <li> In larger areas on the face, the razor did fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The power portion of the razor has a nifty blue led light when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li> The refills are reasonably priced considering how well they do</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the trial as I will stick to their four blade razor.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a Gillette promotion, and frankly wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First I did a normal shave without turning on the handle to get a sense of how well the razor worked with just the blades.</li>
            <li> The handle feels and looks like metal but is really just plastic.  </li>
            <li> The handle itself is extremely comfortable and simple to use.</li>
            <li> It really does change the shave.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this handle looks.</li>
            <li> As for the micropulses I don&#x27;t know if they really make a difference in the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> and I did not notice a real difference.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette.</li>
            <li> It cut micro-close and left my skin feeling smooth; even my girlfriend noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> highly recommend either of the Fusion Proglide razor bodies!</li>
            <li> I am a very frugal consumer but will not compromise on some products.</li>
            <li> It really glides well on ones face.  </li>
            <li> recently received a free razor via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Then, if it&#x27;s one of the days that I really want to be thorough</li>
            <li> I received this razor free via a program run by Gillette, but I&#x27;ve already ordered several razors for my family and friends to try for themselves.</li>
            <li> These blades get very close and do not cut me up like others do.</li>
            <li> 3: I feel like I can name a much needed change:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> It allows enough flex in the head to get a smooth shave all the way across.  </li>
            <li> A razor with 5 blades and a non vibrating handle gives the same smooth shave as this does so</li>
            <li> The 4 blade cartridge makes the difference; the power handle - not so much.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free Gillette Proglide Power Handle shaver through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Its sort of like a gentle vibration while you shave and it seems to help get a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> razor has never pulled any hairs and seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> The shave is close and thanks to the power gripe handle</li>
            <li> I did not feel the Mircopulses added much to the to the quality of the shaving.</li>
            <li> I really, really like the shave I get with their products, but feel like there&#x27;s a shaving arms-race going on and Gillette is just continuously trying to</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and I can really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it turns itself off after awhile</li>
            <li> my face is REALLY much smoother.</li>
            <li> The handle has a power button that makes the razor vibrate gently while you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;ve found that I can shave faster with this razor, because you don&#x27;t need to spend as much time lathering the shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth enough that you can almost use it without any shave gel.</li>
            <li> The finer blades help glide across my face without so much tugging.</li>
            <li> The indicator strip really lets you know when it&#x27;s time to change the blade, which in my case isn&#x27;t very often, thankfully.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t mind shaving.  </li>
            <li> but I really did notice a difference.</li>
            <li> The battery really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Mach Three was good, but this is the clearly the next big step in shaving.</li>
            <li> It fits in your hand and is nice and firm.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that even though the shave mas smooth most of the time I could not get a smooth shave when I shave against the grain which is what I was really hoping it could</li>
            <li> After using the Gillette ProGlide Power Handle provided by a Gillette run program, I have enjoyed many of its features but found the micropulses to be unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> I recently received the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER RAZOR through a program run by Gilette and after using the non powered version for years I was surprised at home much better the powered version is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Fusion blades without the power handle and they seemed to pull at my hair more than I like, however the vibration removed the pulling and helped me get a very close shave for my wedding day with minimal irritation (all of which cleared up in plenty of time for the pictures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I had to go back to my old Gillette Mach3 disposable which were 100x better then this.     </li>
            <li> handle had a nice feel but was slightly heavy</li>
            <li> My wife enjoyed the shave it gave so much that the biggest problem I have with it is keeping it away from her as she tries to steal it for herself.</li>
            <li> I have used, but with only using it once so far it could take more uses before I realize</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the point of the vibration feature and seems extremely more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> The Proglide Power handle is definitely something different, but I honestly have to say that I could do without it.  </li>
            <li> I have shaved with th Gillette Fusion Proglide Power a few times so far and have had a good experience with the power handle.</li>
            <li> The Power option is kind of gimmicky.</li>
            <li> As a special promotion, I received the new Gillette Proglide from Gillette, and its thin blades and powerized handle has been great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The addition of power, in other words, a vibrating surface gives a cleaner shave without pulling or tearing - even usable on very light growth without shaving cream or water.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are very comfortable and provide an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> Very smooth on the skin and the slight vibration seems to help achieve the closer shave compared to my previous (and well liked) razor.  </li>
            <li> While I usually buy most of my grooming supplies from Amazon, I was lucky enough to be a part of a promotional program by Gillette and received one of these razors for free in the mail.</li>
            <li> , it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide.</li>
            <li> , it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide.</li>
            <li> with the battery in the handle, the weight of the razor was just right, not overly heavy to burden my hand, not overly bulky either, just a good solid</li>
            <li> am thrilled that I am shaving less!</li>
            <li> I mean, is there much more important to a man than his face.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a great razor plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll briefly compare this to the other razors I&#x27;ve tried and tell you a honest view of mine about why this deserves only one star and which razors are better.    </li>
            <li> however with this Fusion ProGlide power razor I get a very close smooth shave without going back and forth many times like other</li>
            <li> Bottom line is, you&#x27;re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the black gripping on it.</li>
            <li> For the first few days, the Gillette razor provided a very smooth shave and was relatively knick free.  </li>
            <li> First new razor I&#x27;ve bought in years, and</li>
            <li> This is the first new razor I have tried since then.</li>
            <li> The first thing I needed to do was to get used to the new method of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use a razor in the new style.</li>
            <li> Love the idea of being to get a better closer shave with already 5 thin blades but the nice little humming and vibrating feeling from is Gillette Proglide handle!</li>
            <li> bottom line, the Fusion ProGlide powered or not - can glide right off the shelves into shaving history as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li> This is a true case of a product living up to the hype and being worth every single cent.</li>
            <li> having sensitive skin is though when finding the right razor.</li>
            <li> Love the blades so much I threw out the other razor I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> First I want to say I&#x27;ve shaved with most razors out there, even the Gillette Mach 3 ,Schick Hydro 5 , and this by far is the best closest ,least irritating shave I have had.</li>
            <li> Well worth it if your looking for that effortless shave and extremely close and smooth results.</li>
            <li> The razor handle itself felt very sturdy, much more so than other reusable razor handles I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Gillette products and was very excited to try out this new razor</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor if you have a tough beard and want a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My second, third and subsequent shaves were just as good as the first.</li>
            <li> Allows you to store a new pack of cartridges underneath for quick changing of an old one.</li>
            <li> Seriously, though, this is the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is you can&#x27;t really submerge the razor handle to clean it, and I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the shower or use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I really just shave to clean up the areas around my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this razor for anyone that wants a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle provides a firm grip for a clean and smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li> My initial concerns about water getting into the handle were quickly dispelled, as the seals for the battery compartment were nice and tight.  </li>
            <li> The weight and grip, give control of the razor at a more nuanced degree than any other disposable I have tried.</li>
            <li> I discovered they were a significant improvement over the regular Mach3</li>
            <li> Five bladed tends to nick my face more often than the Quattro or any other four bladed razor</li>
            <li> It could even be considered elegant among other grooming supplies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a pretty specific shaving routine because of my sensitive skin, so when I received a free &#x27;Pro-glide&#x27; razor from Gillette to try I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that I am quite pleased with it..</li>
            <li> The handle has more grip than other Gillette Handles.</li>
            <li> The Fusion power handle has vibration that is a significant improvement over a different power handle</li>
            <li> this blade does not provide any more protection against razor burn than any other blade.</li>
            <li> I really like the micropulses feature, which helps my sensitive skin feeling smooth without the tugging and pulling I&#x27;ve experienced from other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Back to my original Gilllette Sensor.</li>
            <li> but it is better than other brand razors</li>
            <li> Tried other brands too and this one is his favorite.  </li>
            <li> Get the Shick Hydro or any other disposable razors, they will do a better job.</li>
            <li> I tried during the same shave using the razor with the micropulses on and then off and did not feel a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> This is an improvement over my other razor handles as it does feel more ergonomic and easier to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next, the motor inside has received a significant boost.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a significant difference between the regular fusion and the fusion proglide.</li>
            <li> One caveat, however is the strip on the razor head - like many other razors, it soon fizzles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the shave was any better one way or the other.</li>
            <li> However, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge does not have this problem, despite having more blades than any other razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try it and left my stubble grow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a battery operated razor in my entire life, believe it or not, so this was a unique opportunity for me to try this out.</li>
            <li> While the blue light that lights up when the button is pushed up looks cool, I don&#x27;t think the Micropulses actually enhance the shave itself in any way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other razors and with all of them -</li>
            <li> Overall, I think Gillette has come up with a great new razor that I personally plan to keep using in the future.</li>
            <li> The blade on the Fusion ProGlide slides right through hairs without the tugging I often had with other cheap blades.  </li>
            <li> Like any other man, I typically do not like the act of shaving, but I liked using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> most razors are a little rough, this one actually feels smooth for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it does exactly, but it does feel a little funny at first, but it seems to work great</li>
            <li> wow, this is way better now that it has this new Flexball!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve seen the commercial where they show you</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide Power Handle was no different, it comes encased in a very comfortable rubber grip and the handle is large enough that it fits snuggly in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Further speaking to the cosmetic appeal of the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, the power button actually lights up a cool blue which is nothing more than pretty, but I like pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor, provided free from Gillette, proved to give a comfortable close shave without the irritation I usually have.</li>
            <li> i have become rather lazy and rarely use shaving cream any more.</li>
            <li> I have to bang the razor on the sink several times while shaving to clean it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really gives a closer shave compared to my older Gillette cartridges.</li>
            <li> old fusion shaver was already great, but I still experienced the issue of cutting myself in several places and the shave hurting when having too much facial hair.</li>
            <li> enable the razor to glide through my beard much quicker and with a much closer shave than I would normally have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one actually increased the tug i had to provide in order to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> The Proglide gives a good but not superior result, and Gillette&#x27;s instructions for an optimal shave require too much prep time.  </li>
            <li> , it does give me a clean, close shave; but only if I space out its usage.  </li>
            <li> and it felt like any normal smooth shave as if I was just removing some daily stubble.  </li>
            <li> The first was the Fusion Proglide Styler, but this turned out to be a better size option for everyday shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle was suitable for the different grips I use while shaving, such as the fingertip grip and the hand palm grip.  </li>
            <li> If used correctly(trial and error required) it will actually give a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> It has become my go-to razor for mornings when I have time and want to feel extra clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Only the center gets used the most, and thus, the blade wears out quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last, but I liked the feel of the vibration as I shaved.  </li>
            <li> In all, this razor exceeded my expectations and has totally replaced my old traditional Gillette razor - for sure!</li>
            <li> The company recommends to change the blade after every 4 or so uses but in my personal opinion, with such a clean and smooth blade, the blade can last you several more uses than that.</li>
            <li> The razor batteries last about a month and that is with daily usage,the blue power light will start blinking letting you know to change the battery which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this one too.  </li>
            <li> This goes really well with a badger brush and some high quality shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is a really well made razor, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The problem, if you ask me, which you have, is that the handle is very light, and the vibration motor is centrally located, which means not only does the blade vibrate, but the whole handle does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the optimum angle is, but I have trouble believing that every hair requires the same angle for a smooth cut, given that I have to shave in several directions.</li>
            <li> I tried the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor recently because I got it free through a promotion from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money on this new razor.  </li>
            <li> For those, who are looking for a new razor, which will give you an unbelievably comfortable shave, look no further than the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li> For those, who are looking for a new razor, which will give you an unbelievably comfortable shave, look no further than the Pro Glide.</li>
            <li> The new and improved handle glows with a blue light and provides a vibrate function to help eliminate the tug on the skin.</li>
            <li> I received my current Gillette Fusion razor through a special offer from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The vibration is enough to make the shave a little more comfortable, smoother and faster.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to grip when wet thanks to the ridges on both side, and the blade cartridge pops on and off with the snap of a release button.</li>
            <li> In comparison to the previous iteration I owned, not much has changed, but the things that have made me really happy.  </li>
            <li> As far as power options go, the Gillette Fusion Proglide is relatively quiet and the blade cartridge is easy to connect and eject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have always had a slight problem getting a really close shave, but this provided the closest - must be the vibration :).</li>
            <li> I can always get a good grip on the handle whether it is wet or dry</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed the Fusion Proglide Styler which I loved, I think a big part of it was the blades.  </li>
            <li> What a clean close smooth shave with little to no effort exherted onto myself!</li>
            <li> It was smooth and resulted in less razor burn than other razors I had used and gave a nice close</li>
            <li> It was very smooth and did not have the ripping effect of a typical shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get good results with The Gillette Fusion Proglide and the handle is easy to grip and to hold, recently using the bigger and thicker handle from the Styler</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the comfortable grip and overall heft of the ProGlide Handle.  </li>
            <li> Let me say I  received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for FREE via a program run by Gillette and will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Well I did not notice any how difference in my shave, how smooth my face was or how long between shaves.</li>
            <li> Works well, smooth shave and no irritation as long as the vibrate is turned</li>
            <li> I still get minor razor burn on my neck sometimes, but I can&#x27;t imagine another big-brand-name razor like this being this smooth.  </li>
            <li> the past couple shaves how nice the handle is.</li>
            <li> The rubber gripping on the bottom is deep and firm allowing for a light touch to control the handle.</li>
            <li> From a logical stand-point I am completely stumped as to how vibrations are supposed to add to the quality of a shave.  </li>
            <li> Of course, this has come with a cost as the average price of a disposable blade approaches $5, but the benefits are just as notable.</li>
            <li> It had been several days since shaving and at this point I usually only shave in the shower to get an easier and more gentle shave.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about the handle is that it has considerable heft to it compared to the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts even the first time I used it, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> When I used to use my old razors, the cuts on on my neck would bleed out and make it look like I came straight out of a horror movie!</li>
            <li> Cheaper razors that last longer and still give me a top notch razor-burn-free shave adds up to one very converted former Gillette fanboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I found that for ME, the opposite was true.</li>
            <li> but I found that for ME, the opposite was true.</li>
            <li> The razor is definitely of higher quality than the old one.  </li>
            <li> My \\&quot;qualified 5 star rating\\&quot; is given because the improvement of this razor over my first 5 blade manual Gillette is no where near the improvement seen in moving from the 3 blade to 5 blade system.  </li>
            <li> I got some razor burn going against the grain with it, but I have a pretty sensitive face to begin with, so I don&#x27;t hold that against the razor.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was skeptical of Gillette just creating another gimmick cartridge to take our money, but as far as their other razors are concerned, this one really is great.  </li>
            <li> but when by four year old electric gave out my first thought was not to impulse</li>
            <li> The only thing is you cannot use this to full effect without its battery but its built that way</li>
            <li> The vibration is a bit intense, but you can&#x27;t feel any of the tugging and pulling you normally feel when shaving.</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor first, then purchased the Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no \\&quot;open here\\&quot; arrow, so I was all ready to get the scissors to cut the top off, when I happened to pull on the back, and it tore off.  </li>
            <li> In addition, because I have a clef chin, I was not able to shave that area effectively without going over the spot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t be writing the same type of review with that type of use in mind.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and was worried that I would hit the power button when shaving the top of my head since I was holding the razor upside down.</li>
            <li> Then came the Fusion and then Fusion Pro which , hands down was better than any shave I&#x27;d ever had.</li>
            <li> Look for me to change once the cost comes down to more affordable prices.</li>
            <li> I guess with louder vibrations you also get stronger vibrations, able to handle when pressing down on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any other handle I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> It is a little more than most other razors, but for me it is work it.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for the better part of 15 years now, and I have to admit that I had tried just about all razors out there including other Gillette products like the Mach 3 and electric razors, but none have compared to the Fusion ProGlide Power Razor!</li>
            <li> You also have precision blade that can clean up the line after you use the flat side.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a nice close shave with a little vibrating action in the handle.</li>
            <li> a little pricey but simple shopping around can almost always result in a good price.</li>
            <li> Gillette gets an A+ on their new design, and I&#x27;m officially giving up my Schick razor!</li>
            <li> I received this new Pro Glide Power shaver and I have to tell ya&#x27;s, buy one NOW!  </li>
            <li> Gillette has a new user for life!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you, Gillette, for giving me the opportunity to try your new product!</li>
            <li> This product gets an A in my book and a new home in my shaving arsenal!</li>
            <li> This is my new razor!</li>
            <li> Thank you again Gillette for the opportunity to try the new product!</li>
            <li> In sum, I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to shorten their normal shaving time.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the shave very much, and this coming from a guy who usually uses an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Very few nicks, nice lines around my goatee with the precision trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s Fusion gives a really close shave and really leaves my legs and underarms smooth, for longer than any other razor.  </li>
            <li> This new system with a power blade works very well.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this razor to anyone who is looking to switch to something new.</li>
            <li> I really like the design of this new product.  </li>
            <li> This was a reasonably priced new handle.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t think of trying anything new.</li>
            <li> I have grown very fond of this new razor.</li>
            <li> The new Flexball™ effortlessly follows the contours of your face, providing a much closer, and smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re not going to use the power option, I&#x27;d assume there are cheaper options out there that use these same blades (which are great, by the way - super thin, sharp, and smooth).</li>
            <li> The new shape of the handle and the grip was so easy and felt soft to the touch yet with total control of where the blades were heading.  </li>
            <li> It might not be the second coming of Jesus, but it certainly beats sliced bread!!</li>
            <li> I found the handle to be very ergonomic, and slip free; even when wet.</li>
            <li> The handle is nice and sturdy, but also flexible allowing the most awkward of angles to be performed while shaving.</li>
            <li> It was easy to hold on to even when it was wet.</li>
            <li> Shaving is still not my favorite morning activity, but this power handle does make it much less of a chore.</li>
            <li> Much better than the previous versions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slip when it gets wet, and it is easy to grip.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to grab and it is no slip even if your hands our wet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to hold and the rubber grips make it stick in my hand when wet.</li>
            <li> It does the job better with a smoother shave with less pulling than before.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I could say that this version was leaps and bounds better than the previous ones.</li>
            <li> The side grips made it easy to handle the razor even when wet,</li>
            <li> For me I like the clean shave without the nicks and having to wear pieces of toilet paper to cover them that you get from the cheaper razors.</li>
            <li> It was easy to grip, even while in the shower with wet hands.  </li>
            <li> The handle isn&#x27;t much better than the previous fusion models.</li>
            <li> I thought once I added the AAA battery that it would give it more mass like a typical razor</li>
            <li> The handle is well made and easy to grip, I do not feel like it will slip out of my hand, even when wet.</li>
            <li> The handle was also easy to hold even when wet.</li>
            <li> For many shoppers who make purchases such as these based off the look in the package, such as myself, you might be losing some customers with this bump at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Some technology actually does make our lives better - this is one such convenience</li>
            <li> An exceptional shaving experience that left my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell that the overall shave is better with the handle turned on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The two main differences between what I&#x27;m accustomed to with the Mach 3 handle and</li>
            <li> (Occasionally I&#x27;ll try the latest hyped product from Schick but always come back within a week.)</li>
            <li> This review is particularly focused on the handle itself.  </li>
            <li> I came across this particular handle from a promotion Gillette was offering</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE October 19, 2013 - I&#x27;ve been using this razor regularly and have gone though several refills and still love it.  </li>
            <li> It feels good, heavy, solid in your hand.</li>
            <li> Surely there are more of you who have noticed this disturbing trend of late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then when I got a older</li>
            <li> It seems to struggle just as the older fusion against the grain.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Gillette Mach 3 line, but still have sensitive areas under the jawline, so I decided to try the alleged top dog in blades.  </li>
            <li> If you took out all the gimmicks, this would still be a decent razor.</li>
            <li> (Another use was when an older brother had his rear tanned when he got out of line!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, there is an extra blade on the top of the unit for precision trimming.</li>
            <li> I used this exactly nine times and you know exactly when you&#x27;ve shaved your last shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> Today I got my free Gillete Fusion PROGLIDE, and guess what the shave was the same as my old fusion.</li>
            <li> notable different is the various ergonomic grips running along the handle.</li>
            <li> As this review is essentially about the Power Handle itself, not the blades, I want to elaborate on why it&#x27;s been such a treat to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> than you would if you just bought a decent electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I still have one of the older model battery razors, and they have come along way.  </li>
            <li> The main benefit, as with the manual pro glide, comes from the 5 blades, which are well supported in an improved suspension system.</li>
            <li> and I would only give it 2 stars because of how quickly the lubristrip wears out.</li>
            <li> Oh the joys of getting older)  </li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll opt for something more basic.</li>
            <li> With the price of these razors that&#x27;s a plus, enjoyed the product and will definitely buy in the future and recommend.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this razor as part of a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I was comparing this particular razor to another Gillette Fusion razor I have</li>
            <li> It works especially well if I have more facial hair.</li>
            <li> I got one free to try from a Gillette program, and have to admit that while I use to think all razors are about the same, this one has completely made me rethink  that.</li>
            <li> trying it a 2nd time same results, maybe I just took more time in using it</li>
            <li> With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I got a decent shave</li>
            <li> I used to use the older Gillette Fusion power</li>
            <li> This particular razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a trial of this razor through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I want the shave to be as comfortable as possible.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use the same blade for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> I like to keep it steady</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve ever taken particular notice of my razor&#x27;s handle before....until now.  </li>
            <li> If you have to shave daily or at least quite often, that is a great feature.</li>
            <li> With the handle being larger I was able to control the shave a lot easier than my regular Fusion.</li>
            <li> but you just need to move your grip up to the main grip pads on the neck of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Fusion Power Blades and they have been doing a decent job.</li>
            <li> Although I do wish the handle itself was a touch bigger, overall i have no complaints at all and am looking forward to many shaves to come.</li>
            <li> Who would think that a simple powered Micropulses would give me any further benefit from an already outstanding razor</li>
            <li> I never would have purchased these blades or power unit before trying this, but we will be definitely be purchasing more in the future to keep these blades on hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really surprised with the close and smooth shave I got while using the power razor for the last couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used a Gillette Fusion manual razor for years with much satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> These did not seem to be any good, as the first one I ordered lasted less than a week, (shaving alternating days,) while other brands always lasted 3-4.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was concerned with the cost of the blades, but I&#x27;ve now shaved 8 times on a single blade and my shave this morning was as close and smooth as day one.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it had the power to leave a nice clean shave on such a small battery.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other razors in terms of price, since I got it free through a program run by Gillette, but I am certainly a fan of the shave.</li>
            <li> When I received the razor, it didn&#x27;t look much different than what I expected, however upon first use, I can say I love the Power razor feature.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide did OK, but the results definitely weren&#x27;t as smooth as his usual razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blade has not lasted nearly as long as the original fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> The wet shaving methods and products are far superior to other shaving mechanisms, but the time it took to safely use a double edge razor took up 25 minutes of my morning for a three pass shave avoiding major nicks along the way.  </li>
            <li> Razor blades that are sharper and probably last just as long as the cartridges (and perform better), for much, much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Functionality - the light is covered up by your hand when you are shaving, so there is not much point to it rather than perhaps looking cool and possibly draining a battery faster.  </li>
            <li> I really  thought the five blades were a gimmick and wasn&#x27;t going to try it, I really do like it better than razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer blade at the back edge of the new ProGlide cartridge gave sharp again comfortable and accurate results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gillette was running a free program to try out their new razor, the fusion profiled power, and as a long time fan of Gillette, I couldn&#x27;t refuse.</li>
            <li> The vibration IMHO does nothing to help the shaving, but get used to it, as long as I&#x27;ve lived they have seen fit to invent something new every couple of years to keep a revenue plan.</li>
            <li> The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.    </li>
            <li> I would usually use a trimmer to take off most of the hair before I shave if it has been this long between shaves but thought I would give it a shot without trimming it first due to the note on the package that the razor was good on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any additional utility out of that feature and feel it drove the price point up a bit too high for the item.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to all types of shavers out there.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to ANY one that shaves any part of the body, I give this a 5 Star rating out of 5.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you use Fusion blades and it feels like they pull a bit on your stubble, I highly recommend upgrading to the power handle.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is a 2-month supply, assuming each cartridge lasts a week which I highly doubt.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would have to use a set of electric clippers before shaving this much growth, but the Gillette blades are pretty open, so I skipped straight to shaving.</li>
            <li> As ad added bonus, I highly recommend the addition of the ProGlide Power Handle.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly encourage you to try it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a high quality shave.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these any day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor.</li>
            <li> My one caveat at for this early review is that I have not been able to determine how long the blades last but do not expect that to be significantly different, and if I am not mistaken the older blades still fit as well.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy electric shavers because the price is always really high, but since i received this from Gillette for free from a promotion i figured i would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it did not viberate a whole lot while shaving, most other electric shavers were vibrating so much that it made it hard to get a close shave, but this one was not like that which was very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first impressions were positive - the battery compartment requires a larger handle, which has been covered in a patterned rubber grip.  </li>
            <li> I remember that Consumer Reports was unimpressed with the vibrating Fusion when it came out, but I got one right away and liked it--even while aware that each \\&quot;improved\\&quot; razor came with ever-more expensive blades.     </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and a lot thicker than other razors I am used to so that makes it much easier to handle.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, but not much better than regular, and I expected better.  </li>
            <li> The grip on the handle is fine, it doesn&#x27;t get too slippery when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> There is no need to worry, the handle can get wet and will still work fine</li>
            <li> But, if your just a simple joe like me and just want a fast and easy shave, I&#x27;d suggest to stick with a regular Gillette Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li> My fears of nicks, cuts and a handle that is to large were completely unfounded.</li>
            <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t get the vibrating part, I tried it the first couple of shaves and really didn&#x27;t see much difference and forgot to turn it on at least 75% of the time after the first couple of tries.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be chosen by Gillette to try out their new pro glide power razor at no cost, and boy was I blown away.</li>
            <li> They do cost a little more  </li>
            <li> I prefer a little weightier handle, something more substantial that I can control and grip.  </li>
            <li> it has a little more weight and sturdiness.</li>
            <li> The vibration may cause the hair to lift a little more and it also helps agitate the face to stop irritation.</li>
            <li> did get a little more snuggle time from my wife.......</li>
            <li> The vibration feature left me confused because it seemed to do my harm than good - the vibrations caused me to nick myself quite a few times more than I would normally, and I felt like it made my overall experience much more cumbersome.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been blissfully ignorant of the innovation going on in the category until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I really enjoyed the shave that this little device provides.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I did notice is that the handle itself was a little more bulky and had a feel that you knew you were holding it, unlike some disposables that are</li>
            <li> a little more grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits my hand better and lets me twist and turn with little effort.</li>
            <li> The power button requires a little more force to turn on and off</li>
            <li> I never understood how my friends and family members were able to achieve a close and fast shave on a regular basis, while I would shave twice as slowly and get a shave half as good as theirs.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all and in fact is likely very light yet solid if you remove the battery.</li>
            <li> The micropulses, as Gillette calls it, gives me a very smooth cut every time and the vibrating action actually \\&quot;lifts\\&quot; the hairs allowing me to cut as close to my skin as possible without injuring it.</li>
            <li> Standard safety blades will do you fine, and they&#x27;re much, much less expensive than constantly buying cartridges which clog and wear out quickly (if you want the best safety razor blades, [...]</li>
            <li> The razor comes in packaging that is easy to remove without using sharp objects.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Panasonic Multi-flex electric razor, but mix it up every now and again when I feel like taking my time and looking a little better.</li>
            <li> It comes in a really nice hard case which you can set the blade on to.  </li>
            <li> will probably keep the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle and use it with my Mach3 cartridges (they seem to fit) and only use the more expensive Fusion ProGlide cartridges on special occasions when I need a particularly close shave.</li>
            <li> The blades really do glide over my face quickly and comfortably, and the shave is so close that no stubble appears for hours later than with previous blades.</li>
            <li> At first vibrations feel strange when you are shaving, but you get used to it very fast</li>
            <li> The handle is much more comfortable in my hand, and the power button is a little harder to press.  </li>
            <li> For a little extra thickness (holding one battery), the razor fit snugly in the hand and did not feel that difference in thickness, but when the button is pressed it did make the shave smooth.</li>
            <li> I used a new fusion blade on one half of my face and the proglide on the other, both provided a very smooth, comfortable, and close shave.</li>
            <li> Not entirely sure If I&#x27;m completely converted over to this new tech, but for now, I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t enjoying it!</li>
            <li> I did not have to repeat strokes as often as I did with my previous razor and the extra single razor it has on the opposite side of the cartridge was excellent for thinning my mustache.</li>
            <li> The Gillette is sometimes not the most comfortable shave (especially when the blades begin to dull) but it is always the closest.  </li>
            <li> Also glad that other gillette blades will fit since I have about five cartridges left from my regular fusion before I need to get new blades.</li>
            <li> because the high quality of the Gillette blades themselves and the high quality shave that they provide on their own render the added benefit of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle somewhat less essential.</li>
            <li> The pulsating action really does provide for a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> The handle has grips that make the razor feel secure in your hand, eliminating the worry about slipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and maneuver, with grips that prevent slipping.  </li>
            <li> I generally use a standard razor with disposable blades because I have experienced irritation when using electric razors in the past.</li>
            <li> The handle was comfortable to hold, even while vibrating and wet.  </li>
            <li> The Power handle allows for a much smoother closer shave than my old Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great products that may have brought me back from the disposable world.&lt;br /&gt;One note of constructive criticism, why not give us a few refill blades with the razor?</li>
            <li> I feel that I have sensitive skin and this razor is gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li> The flexibility of the shaver head and the lubrication pad made shaving smooth, effortless, and pulling was minimal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, but didn&#x27;t feel the need to try one until I received a free one as part of a promotional program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> But with cheap razors I found I&#x27;d end up with nicks and irritations no matter how carefully I shaved.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but a great razor.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t quite figure out why you&#x27;d want a battery operated razor, but he said he was surprised to find that it really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d make any difference at all, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> That said, I recently switched to the very inexpensive Dorco 6-blade system which is available only via mail order.</li>
            <li> If you do not care where it is made you&#x27;d be happy buying one at random without reading where it was made on the box.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t quite figure out why you&#x27;d want a battery operated razor, but I was surprised to find that it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> The blades were so gentle on my skin that I used them to teach my thirteen year old son how to shave.</li>
            <li> the vibrating action is very good,the aaa battery lasts about six months.</li>
            <li> I also really like the blue light that lights up; it provides almost not benefit, but it&#x27;s blue and shiny and I like that.</li>
            <li> Having been avid user of the Gillette Fusion Razor for the past three years, I didn&#x27;t think there was going to be much difference when I picked up the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, which I received for free via a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> and my skin was baby smooth with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see much difference from my old Mach 3 that I&#x27;ve been using for a number of years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The \\&quot;power\\&quot; aspect of the handle is a real wild card.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical before using this product but the results were great.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my everyday shave.  </li>
            <li> I even got the irritation lotion to use a long with it for the full experience.</li>
            <li> Definitely  a 5 star product worth your while and money.</li>
            <li> This was not my normal brand</li>
            <li> To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days</li>
            <li> The vibrating is different at first the results make it well worth the minor awfwardness at first.</li>
            <li> Normally I shave every day.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Although the first few shaves were smooth, I did not receive a closer shave than with the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> But, for me, the improvements in Gillette&#x27;s latest-generation shaving system aren&#x27;t compelling enough to make me switch.</li>
            <li> I purposely waited to let my stubble go for the weekend and shave on Monday like I do with my normal razor.</li>
            <li> Normally after 5 uses I would have irritation and bumps on my neck, but none with using the proglide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been trying to find a good razor, and I finally have found what i have been looking for over the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> Comparing this razor to the normal ProGlide and to the Schick Quattro, I choose the ProGlide Power.  </li>
            <li> Is this worth the extra cost?  </li>
            <li> It feels pretty much the same to me when I use the vibrating and when I use don&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> a normal Civic would not.  </li>
            <li> I have the used normal non-vibrating Gillette for some time now, and I don&#x27;t think this fancier looking, vibrating device makes any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Normally, I use electrics so I don&#x27;t break out in rashes.)  </li>
            <li> My facial hair grows pretty fast so even by the end of the day I sometimes notice some stubble.  </li>
            <li> When I shave with my normal razors</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t take the time to write a review of a razor, but in this case I couldn&#x27;t help myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the next step in shaving evolution will be as I feel this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money.</li>
            <li> this razor gives me and the extra cost is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t mind paying for something when it&#x27;s actually worth the extra money, and</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t mind paying for something when it&#x27;s actually worth the extra money, and</li>
            <li> I have the power one at work and the normal version at home.  </li>
            <li> To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days</li>
            <li> It did very well around the ankles, knees, behind the knees and under the arms it was nice and gentle.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the feel of the normal versions handle though, the power version is made of plastic and doesn&#x27;t feel as premium.  </li>
            <li> Overall, worth it.</li>
            <li> Normally I use an electric shaver, but when I received this one from Gillette, I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the only ones to get a good shave across those small pores.  </li>
            <li> I shave my entire head usually twice with the grain and twice or more against the grain using a moderate degree of pressure and I can truthfully say it leaves my head the smoothest of anything I ever tried.   </li>
            <li> For the longest time I simply used regular old Gillette Mach 3 disposables and bought some more every time I ran out.</li>
            <li> razor is worth the price and especially the cost of the blades.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it out, because it&#x27;s not normally something I would spend my money on.</li>
            <li> But these Fusion power blades turned out to be more than just a mechanized gimmick of the same old same old.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> So if you shelling out the money for manuals, just put in a few more bucks for the power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally as I tuck my son in to bed at night and kiss kim</li>
            <li> automatic shut-off feature is a nice touch, but not worth paying extra for.</li>
            <li> Since I work from home, I normally don&#x27;t shave until the evening before I go out.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was provided a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor System to use and review, complimentary of a program run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I did get this one complimentary, but I often buy a second system</li>
            <li> The wider handle and grips made my morning shave easier than normal.  </li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;ll have to wait a couple days or so between shaves or else</li>
            <li> For the price though, I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The handle is fatter the most razors which gives you a firm hold on the razor and makes it easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> but, I would definitely tell you that it is worth the asking price.</li>
            <li> , Power Handle is slightly bigger and thicker than regular one and blue light looks cool when you turn the handle on.  </li>
            <li> My normal razor is the Schick Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li> My normal razor is an Edwin Jagger safety razor.</li>
            <li> This handle is a very quiet and powerful handle.</li>
            <li> As usual, Gillette&#x27;s blades are superior, and this one is no different.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last overly long, but it&#x27;s way longer than most of its competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I feel like they really improved all the short comings of the first razor.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I use a Phillips Norelco SensoTouch 1160X electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and could probably shave twice a day, but this left me smooth for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I think its pretty much the same shave.</li>
            <li> Normally I use an Electric Razor to shave.</li>
            <li> The vibration sort of acted like a massaging effect that reduced the irritation that is normally associated with shaving.  </li>
            <li> question really couldn&#x27;t be answered until my first actual shave with the razor.  </li>
            <li> buy a new one but try a high end blade razor until I make my electric choice.  </li>
            <li> Engineered to last less, engineered to make your facial hair grow back quicker, and engineered to cost more and make more money for Gilette, is really what the marketing campaign should be like.</li>
            <li> first think i noticed when turning on the new razor, is it has a higher frequency vibration than the old one, which is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li> I got back from a 3 day trip and the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor left my skin feeling super smooth without any nicks and cuts that I normally get from a regular razor.</li>
            <li> give you a much closer shave, with less irritation, with healthier skin from traditional shaving soaps, that smell better, at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> give you a much closer shave, with less irritation, with healthier skin from traditional shaving soaps, that smell better, at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Mainly the reason for that is a still have a pack of twin blades for my old razor which work fine on my face, but are a tad rough on my head.</li>
            <li> I have needed a power handle that accurately shaves even if its wet and the side grips on this new power handle have done just that.  </li>
            <li> If I were starting out fresh and needed a new razor, perhaps this would be the product.</li>
            <li> were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).    </li>
            <li> With the generics, I would always have to go over my face at least twice (even with a new blade) to ensure a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this razor especially if you&#x27;ve been having trouble finding one that provides a clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates.</li>
            <li> The handle is big enough, easy to hold and maneuver.  </li>
            <li> When dry, it&#x27;s got a nice feel to it, but when it got wet, it lost all of it&#x27;s grip</li>
            <li> I have even been able to make the blade cartridges last up to 3 months by keeping it dry after using it and using shave gel instead of the foamy shave</li>
            <li> As with many manual razor blades you tend to look for the smoothest, closest shave with less irritation for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised that after two weeks using the Proglide that I have to say it does indeed provide a better shave than the previously mentioned model.</li>
            <li> It literally took me more than half the time to shave compared to my old one.</li>
            <li> The ProGlide Power handle provides a nice grip when shaving in wet and dry conditions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to grip and solid enough to give you that quality feel.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide because of the vibrating handle which is a huge plus for me due to my sensitive skin and it really makes shaving feel</li>
            <li> The rubberized handle is easy to hold in various positions to allow for an easy way to hold the handle when trying to reach those hard to reach parts of the face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and have endlessly been searching for a razor that will not only give me a nice close shave, but one that also won&#x27;t irritate my skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> Even with a new blade on a normal razor it does grab a bit.  </li>
            <li> The safety razor actually works better if you let your whiskers grow longer as since it&#x27;s single blade it never clogs.    </li>
            <li> Even when I was younger I have never been able to shave with a single blade razor.</li>
            <li> My big problem area is under my chin on my neck and right along the jawline.  </li>
            <li> The handle was very comfortable, and worked very well for getting at the hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> But that was really the only positive point that I found with this razor.</li>
            <li> Sure, it can make a shave more expensive in the long run, but it&#x27;s worth it (as far as I&#x27;m concerned).  </li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin and could not use an electric razor, so he wasn&#x27;t very keen on something that sounded suspiciously like it might be a hybrid of old and new.  </li>
            <li> The battery falls out when you open the package, so make sure not to loose it in the excitement.</li>
            <li> Although I did experice a little anxiety at first wondering if the extra power was going to end up with more nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the handle being really wide, it just didn&#x27;t feel very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> The pulsing, at first, was odd, but was quickly overlooked.  </li>
            <li> the past 6 years I&#x27;ve been using mainly the Gillette Custom Plus razor, and have been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor, right down to the packaging (the product popped right out, no fighting with the plastic).  </li>
            <li> It provides a smooth, close shave just like other razors of its class.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different razors including all the past versions of the Proglide and it provides one of the best close</li>
            <li> This razor gives an extremely close smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor from Gillette the other day for free to try and tell the world what I think.  </li>
            <li> I need a comfortable handle and a sharp blade.</li>
            <li> had thought the 5 thin blades were mostly marketing at work, but it&#x27;s pretty obviousnow that Gillette has really tried to make</li>
            <li> So I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide from a Gillette program the other day to try for free.</li>
            <li> I knew this was my new razor of choice.</li>
            <li> This new razor gives you the ease of using a blade shaver with the added benefit of enhanced experience of an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Press the razor into the new blade and it locks in</li>
            <li> I like the new grip too as it fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li> This was a totally new experience for me.  </li>
            <li> but that is something you do not have to worry about with the new ProGlide Power handle.</li>
            <li> You will see and feel the difference when you use the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor with the new handle.</li>
            <li> have been using Gillette razors for years, have upgraded each time a new one comes out and have to say</li>
            <li> Today we are going to talk about the new Gillette fusion proglide.</li>
            <li> It is now my new razor.</li>
            <li> Based on the hype, I decided to spring for the new Proglide.  </li>
            <li> In comparision the replacement baldes on the new proglide online range from about 3.50 to 4.00 before shipping per blade.</li>
            <li> I live in venezuela and here just arrive the Gillete Match3</li>
            <li> The Proglide will now be my new go to razor for the prework shave.  </li>
            <li> My  husband is resistant to trying anything new, so it took some nudging to get him to try this.  </li>
            <li> I just tried the new razor this morning.  </li>
            <li> Lots of razor burn and discomfort with that cream, even with a brand new blade (tried it for two days).  </li>
            <li> As for my existing fusion blades and the new proglide blades</li>
            <li> These new fangle-dangled battery-operated ones, however, are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The New Features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> To sum up, pass on the powered version and go with the cheaper &#x27;manual&#x27; version and be prepared to pay a lot for new blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Schick Quattro for years, and figured it was time to get a new razor.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Over these 10 years I tried just about every new razor there was on my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the new \\&quot;microcombs\\&quot; inserted between the blades, maybe a thicker \\&quot;protection strip\\&quot; or maybe thinner blades.</li>
            <li> If i had to buy a new one i would</li>
            <li> I would say if it is a gimmick to sell a new product then I would say that it works</li>
            <li> No, it just means you should wait until you nned a new razor or until you see it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a new fan and dedicated user from now on.</li>
            <li> But the opportunity presented itself to try their new Fusion Pro Glide Power and everything</li>
            <li> I have watched plenty of commercials about the new razors</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wanting to see how the Gillette Fusion Proglide would perform on a longer, thicker bit of growth, I let myself go for a over a week and resisted the urge to use my new Proglide.  </li>
            <li> It seems like Gillette comes out with a new version every year or so, so</li>
            <li> When I used this new blade, I didn&#x27;t have any of those problems.  </li>
            <li> Just a new way to get us to pay more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the new proglide from Gillette  to try out and</li>
            <li> I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I shave in in the shower and with the new grips on the side</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s talk about my new Proglide Power Razor.  </li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test the new Fusion Proglide Power Handle along with the Proglide Power Blade.</li>
            <li> One new concept came to the market that I didn&#x27;t understand or grasp.</li>
            <li> Now I think it is time to pack away he electric razor and start using this razor as my new razor.</li>
            <li> I bought new heads and my wife stole it</li>
            <li> I like the new handle</li>
            <li> with that said I wondered why it needed an upgrade with the new Power feature.</li>
            <li> I also got a really good shave in less time than other razors take.</li>
            <li> If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I&#x27;d go with this one.   </li>
            <li> Other than that, the new grip design is great, not super tacky, but still enough grip for decent control.</li>
            <li> The vibrator is very useful and its not overwhelming as it does not make your hand vibrate but only your razor, The vibrating transfers toward the razor giving you a smooth look.</li>
            <li> The reason my expectations were so high was because I enjoy all the other products that Gillette offers.</li>
            <li> Personally I did not see a huge difference in my shave as opposed to using a regular Gillette Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li> Being in the military, I am required to keep a clean shave on a day-to-day basis.</li>
            <li> Not at all - the handle is ergonomically designed to be bigger and have better grip, even when wet.  </li>
            <li> In just one swipe, the skin was left extremely smooth and didn&#x27;t require additional shaving over the same skin.  </li>
            <li> I felt as smooth a shave as if I were to use a more expensive electric</li>
            <li> I really like the shape of the handle as it made shaving different areas of my beard much easier and to my surprise the vibration did not make the razor jump and nick my skin.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this razor next time I need to do away with unwanted hair and be left with smooth supple skin.</li>
            <li> It fit snug, had tiny rubber grooves on the back that molded to my fingers, and wasn&#x27;t at all slippery.  </li>
            <li> things considered, this is really just an average handle that looks cool.  </li>
            <li> So it was much to my surprise when I tried the proglide only to discover that it was much, much smoother then fusion.</li>
            <li> This thing REALLY works, and works fast, and gives the ultimate cut while it&#x27;s at it!!!  </li>
            <li> And a puck of good quality shaving soap might cost $10 or less, and it will last you an entire year.  </li>
            <li> received the power version of this razor in a free trial offer and decided to give it a shot comparing it to the regular fusion proglide I use daily.  </li>
            <li> Wow, closest shave I have ever had and more importantly - no bleeding.  </li>
            <li> then earlier Gillette models, and really, not any better than some disposable blades.</li>
            <li> The power handle provided a much better shave for me without having to repeatedly drag blades across the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s early on in my shave process with this razor, but so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s light, but weighted enough (with the battery installed) to feel solid in the hand.</li>
            <li> Even if you keep it dry, the vibration mechanism weakens fairly quickly regardless of what batteries you use.</li>
            <li> The handle is much better than pervious models and when used properly you will get a quality shave and when your hands are wet</li>
            <li> I recently got a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power shaver for free and figured I would see if an upgrade from my previous razor would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> I do not see any stubble until late , late in the day, and for a guy like me, that&#x27;s impressive.  </li>
            <li> It featured a larger set of grips to be able to keep the shaver from slipping during a shave.</li>
            <li> I sent it all back like new!!!</li>
            <li> The little vibrating action of the battery powered handle really made a huge difference in how easy it was to shave, and the razor glided right through thick stubble with no problem at all.  </li>
            <li> I figured to keep it simple: fresh blades in my current Fusion and in the Fusion Proglide, one for each cheek; four down strokes over gel shaving cream on the left cheek for the Fusion and four more on the right for the Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> LED power button may be a little too bright for me in the morning (no bright lights, please), but it isn&#x27;t loud like my shaver, so no worries of waking the house accidentally with the buzz-saw sound of my shaver.</li>
            <li> Until I used them, I didnt think they would be any better than what I was currently using, but after having used a high quality five blade razor like this, I couldnt go back to the regular cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li> I did a side by side comparison of the old and the new by shaving one half of my face with the old version and the other side with the new version and for me, the old system gave me a smoother glide hence a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Definitely a high quality shave that far exceeds what you pay.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> that I have very sensitive skin and shave in the shower using shaving oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but did not have a problem with razor burn or cuts.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and is prone to cuts and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was wary of using a battery operated razor at first, but found out that not only is it shower safe, but I actually enjoy the vibration while shaving my face.  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Even when you get your hands wet and full of shaving cream, the new handle will not slip or slide.</li>
            <li> Upon using it the first time, I noticed how different it was with the new Power Handle.  </li>
            <li> Just got back from a trip with a 15 day old beard and it cut right through it without a problem.</li>
            <li> It was a little bigger than most razors and very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> To my surprise the new blade system feels the same as other multi-blade systems- until you press that magic button.</li>
            <li> recently received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;The new Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge is by far the closest and at the same time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very high quality and works very well, especially for pansy faces like mine (darn sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> When I was done, the was absolutely no irritation and my skin was so smooth, a better, closer shave than I have gotten previously with regular non-vibrating razors.  </li>
            <li> Even without shaving for 2 weeks I was able to shave quickly with a few strokes and my face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> I have always liked a hand held razor, but never really loved them.</li>
            <li> This is no ordinary razor.  </li>
            <li> I definitely got a defective one but please be aware this may happen to you too.  </li>
            <li> Didnt believe the commercials at first especially the vibrating handle...</li>
            <li> With most other razors, I can only shave once every 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> I am not completely sure if it has any effect on the quality of the shave, but I think it shaves better when the vibrating is enabled.  </li>
            <li> First I&#x27;ll note that I&#x27;m a female, and not the target audience for this item, so I handed it over to my boyfriend to do the testing.</li>
            <li> All of these are just lovely ways of saying - hey, we are not giving you a different colored fusion razor like the phenom or racecar or matrix of whatever they called the other Fusions.    </li>
            <li> Two weeks prior to purchasing the Proglide I purchase my first Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li> your facial hair doesn&#x27;t tug/ pull like so many other razors.</li>
            <li> In fact, it was about the exact same price as what I was paying for Mach 3 cartridges some 5 YEARS ago.</li>
            <li> He also loves the detailed cutter on the top of the blade to get precision cutting... comes in real handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most, I think razor companies have gone overboard adding blades, lubricated strips, hydro technology, and now power.</li>
            <li> I love the power and the blades with the extra blade compared to other razors.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> A bit surprised not to see even one spare razor though!</li>
            <li> This was exactly as advertised and definitely met my expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely noticeable but it really does help the blade slice through your hairs.</li>
            <li> But I also believe people shoudl try something first, as their faces and head will be different than mine.</li>
            <li> I tried every razor on the market starting with the Gillette sensor 2 blade when I first started shaving at around 14-15 years of age.</li>
            <li> I was proven wrong, the power handle was nice!</li>
            <li> i havent heard so many comments about how my shave looks smoother or how its lasting longer (due to closer shave)  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor delivered the smoothest shave I have ever had - not only on the first use but also after repeated uses.</li>
            <li> , I gave it a try and was I ever surprised!</li>
            <li> Had I not received it, I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it due to the upfront cost; but now, I do plan on purchasing the refill blades.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Mach III for over the past five years and have been satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li> Design is pretty in line with Gillette&#x27;s recent offerings and looks at home in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but is it that much better than the Mach 3 or other earlier versions?  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the shave after using the Schick Hydro for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> It looks and feels like my old razor with one exception, POWER!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a shavette for years, so when this promotion came up I wasn&#x27;t actually all that interested.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I thought at first it was the way I was shaving, but time after time I saw bumps on my face starting to form.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the blade was the overall presentation.</li>
            <li> And, just like every other Gillette razor I have used before, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> With this razor, I can use it several times and each time is just like the first in quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is my first time using a powered razor and it was definitely an experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the vibration wiggles those rascally whiskers out or what, but it is the most painless shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using the Gillette Fusion HydraGel), but this is the first time i&#x27;ve used one of the powered handles.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette Fusion Regular (non power) razor handle for the last 3 years and was excited to try the Power Handle.  </li>
            <li> However I recently had the option to try this over the first generation one I had been using for years..</li>
            <li> I currently have a Personna Magnum 5 razor, and I&#x27;m pretty stocked up on blades from Costco.</li>
            <li> I do encourage others to try the product out for yourself since you have to feel it in action to truly understand how well it works!</li>
            <li> At first I thought the handle was a bit big.  </li>
            <li> I also love the small vibration that the handle provides.  </li>
            <li> I think the concept is most interesting, but I prefer a simple razor, and this is a bit too complicated,</li>
            <li> with the Fusion manual razor, I would still get some razor burn if I shaved two days in a row, but the Fusion Proglide Power razor gives an unbelievably close and enjoyable shave, even in that circumstance.  </li>
            <li> I kick on the power feature and the pulsing action does a great job of eliminating the last traces of stubble without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> but they were equal in closeness at first.</li>
            <li> That is not usually the Fusion Proglide Power Razor but a sale or coupon</li>
            <li> For many years Gillette was above its competitor and I do remember only one razor in Schick&#x27;s line that I&#x27;ve used for some time before moving back to Gillette product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really thought that the vibrating feature would be more gimmicky, but it actually does lend itself to getting a close shave without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little on the high end of the price spectrum, but I received it for FREE via a program by Gillette, so</li>
            <li> At first glance, the razor looks to by typically made in the same high quality fashion that Gillette has made standard amongst most of their razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note that I was using a new Gillete Fusion ProGlide blade on my previous razor as well</li>
            <li> The vibration seems to be a little too strong to my liking.</li>
            <li> It was my first battery-powered razor that I had ever experienced, so I was a little skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> For me it came down to two huge reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides having razor blades that cost a tenth as much as the Fusion cartridges, a classic styled Merkur safety razor is a solid, well-made tool.  </li>
            <li> These are good razor blades, but the cons seriously hamper their overall value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this one for free as part of a program run by Gillette and I was not let down.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, I don&#x27;t have to worry about hiding out due to blemishes, and I owe it to Gillette and their Fusion Proglide Power Handle!</li>
            <li> I even sat and compared it to my Mach 3 Turbo Power handle (which, even at 5 years old, still looks exactly the same as the new Mach 3 Power handles, so</li>
            <li> The electric is very smooth, especially in the shower with some shaving gel, but this razor beats it hands down, and with no nicks or irritation.</li>
            <li> At first the handle seemed a bit large but is to be expected since there is a AA battery in there.  </li>
            <li> On most of my face it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference but on my chin and upper lip where the hairs get really stiff</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the handle is larger than the razor I typically use (Mach3), but it is pretty light</li>
            <li> In the past I typically would use Gillette sensor or Mach 3 razors, but as a promotion Gillette was having, I was able to try this product for free which was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Overall, the changes to the handle were slight, but left me with a very satisfied feeling over the improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use electric razors because i have extremely sensitive skin and razors irritate it very much.</li>
            <li> I have found that the extra blades actually leave me feeling more razor burn, and I keep facial hair (not a smooth shaver) and the size of the blade head is cumbersome while trying to shave in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> The blades cut close and provides a comfortable clean shave in less passes than other razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The size is good the normal size for a razor and not too bulky like other power razors I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> This little gripper definitely comes in handy while shaving and have shaving cream/gel/oil on your face so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand and cause you to cut yourself and of course it is a major plus if you shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> You also can use the old Fusion Power cartridges with the new handle.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating pulses in this new Gillette allow me to shave as close as the old style razor while still eliminating razor burn.</li>
            <li> My old one is now for work and this new one is for home.</li>
            <li> Gillette may have gained a new, young customer.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and no matter what I try (all those new razors with 5-6 blades, the lubricating strips, etc.)</li>
            <li> So far, after almost two weeks, the blade still feels almost new.</li>
            <li> , however, I am not 100% sure what is different between this new one than my previous power handle.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t go back to my older shaving tool; Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is supperior and top of it class, very confortable, excelent grip when hands wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the Mach 3 for a long time, but gave this one a try recently after I had received it for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it is a Fusion razor with a blue LED light and some minor changes.  </li>
            <li> smooth shave did not last long as promised ....</li>
            <li> While it fits comfortable in my hand, these felt slightly off.</li>
            <li> The first few shaves are fine but the blade does not last and soon you can feel it dragging across your face.</li>
            <li> Less drag on my face and a clean shave with nothing left behind was a great way to start out the summer!</li>
            <li> not, then I would say that this is an opportune time for the competition like Wilkinson Sword to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Hopefully that will now change.ord to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever used a regular razor I realized that my skin was just too sensitive.</li>
            <li> The handle provides a gentle vibration that seems to reduce the irritation normally caused by shaving, and the replaceable battery is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> For me, it was so uncomfortable that I couldnt wait for the shave to be done, instead of taking my time and enjoying my shaving time like a true gentleman.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle all the tugging I would get from my old razor.</li>
            <li> The handle is better than other Gillette handles as it is relatively light weight, but still heavy enough to feel well built.</li>
            <li> Being one with very coarse stubble, I can burn through blades pretty quickly, I&#x27;ve noticed that all though the refills cost about the same as my old SChick, they last longer, which is just an added bonus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy, not conducive to a reverse-grip, and the \\&quot;precision trim\\&quot; blade on the back keeps catching on my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally, with my Mach3, the hairs would get stuck inside the blades and I have to make repeat strokes over the same areas, but with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I was able to still complete the shave in single, deep strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ([...]) has cryo-treated safety blades that last five times as long as regular safety blades, so you save even more money).&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Gillette razors but always thought the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; version were just a more expensive gimmick - I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect any significant difference, but after using it and then going back to other manual shavers, the difference is noticeable.</li>
            <li> It actually took me less time to shave with Fusion ProGlide than my Electric to get even better results than the electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is the only part of it that is better than previous models.</li>
            <li> Despite the larger profile, it was easy to hold even when wet.</li>
            <li> All razors are more or less the same, right?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its comforatable enough and easy to hold without slipping.  </li>
            <li> other than a cool appearance the razor is just a down grade from the original fusion.</li>
            <li> They have five + one sharp blades that are easy to clean via simply tapping them and the stubble falls out from between the blades unlike with other blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I enjoyed shaving with the Power Fusion Proglide, I&#x27;m just not sure that extra blades and vibration are worth any extra money.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a razor through a Gillette program for free to try this sucker out</li>
            <li> Most razors dull after just 1-2 shaves, and even within the first shave will typically catch pretty</li>
            <li> It only took one stroke to remove all of the hair, and the added single blade on the back for trimming is a great little bonus.</li>
            <li> Back in the day I had one of the original vibrating razors and it was a bit odd to use, so I was skeptical - but the new blade configuration works great with the vibration.  </li>
            <li> Compared to disposable razors, this has a bigger handle with side grips that is easier for a man with large hands to hold on to.  </li>
            <li> It certainly was different then what I was used to in a shave - but</li>
            <li> I recently noticed that I would have to shave over certain areas about 5-10 times for it to do its job.</li>
            <li> and I would have to wait for the hair to grow back a certain length to wax again</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the head is a bit too large in my opinion, so when I was shaving my cheeks it was just a tad cumbersome.</li>
            <li> For me, the shaves have been much better with less irritaion, and so far the blades seem to last longer than the old version.</li>
            <li> The sensor 3 blade was a little closer and just as comfortable as the two blade.</li>
            <li> I received it from Gillette for free, and I was a little hesitant about the power feature.</li>
            <li> I let it glide smoothly over my scalp with just a little pressure and</li>
            <li> This may seem like a little unorthodox, but I primarily use a razor for my legs since I am a cyclist.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this new Fusion, since I have a Fusion already, and I gave it up for a safety razor with the old timey double edge blade, since that razor worked better than the Fusion did at giving me a comfortable</li>
            <li> To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the blade system was much more precise trimming around existing facial hair compared to other blades I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The handle is thick and sturdy feeling; comfortable for a guy with large hands.</li>
            <li> Secondly, at the end of a week or so, the Gillette razor started to pull on my face a little more because the blades were dulling even with the micro pulsations.  </li>
            <li> I thought the original Fusion Power was a slight upgrade on the Mach 3, but the Fusion Proglide Power is miles ahead of both.</li>
            <li> I like that this handle is a little larger, which allows me to grip it a bit better.</li>
            <li> It did seem to shave a little better than my current razor.  </li>
            <li> That could be a result of years of use or the Fusion Power has that much more vibe, it&#x27;s hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing glides along the face, hardly feeling like it&#x27;s touching you until you realize the hair is gone.</li>
            <li> When I need to shut it off I would rather not have to fumble with two hands to get to the button and push hard, I would rather be able to do this with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the battery powered Fusion, but after not shaving for a week and a long weekend, I was ready to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school I tried to wet shave for the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer to Gillette Razors for as long as I have been shaving, pretty much beginning with the Mach 3 and continuing on as new products were released over the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference either way until I shaved those hard to smooth mutton chop areas.  </li>
            <li> Sure, the blades are a little more expensive, but what&#x27;s it worth to make a chore that men do daily</li>
            <li> The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the ProGlide was slightly easier to clean with the vibrating head.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a couple year old Fusion handle that I had dropped at least three or seven times too many.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear</li>
            <li> The ProGlide handled this quite well, I presume the vibration helps the blades stay clear.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, a ton of thought and research went into designing this handle.</li>
            <li> To be clear, I was offered a Fusion ProGlide to test by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely coarse beard, and spent years searching for a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> But for me it is clear the micro-pulses/vibration that the razor has works wonders on getting a super-easy and close shave.</li>
            <li> The slight vibration that comes from the razor while shaving seems to make the razor move quicker and smother over my neck and face for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> This handle offers a very soothing and different shaving experience than just a stand alone razor.</li>
            <li> I received it free through a promotion and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I would encourage others with sensitive skin to use this product.</li>
            <li> was pleasantly surprised to get the Fusion ProGlide and get to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it was.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is also not too heavy or light.</li>

            <li> If price isn&#x27;t an issue and you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If price isn&#x27;t an issue and you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The ProGlide Power system really is a shave above the rest.</li>
            <li> It offers an inferior shave to the handle without power.  </li>
            <li> The power button was in a spot I could find and it was clearly marked.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I have found the handle design with its grip and vibrations to be a complement to the whole shaving experience.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised by the shave</li>
            <li> I would recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin as do</li>
            <li> The vibration action is a monumental help in getting hairs off the razor.  </li>
            <li> feel the one detraction from this razor is getting used to the vibration action.  </li>
            <li> In the last couple of days I really wanted to put it to the test</li>
            <li> Recently received a Proglide Power Razor via a program run by Gillete, and was absolutely amazed by the quality.</li>
            <li> How soft the handle is......which it is.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is WOW.  </li>
            <li> The unit is shorted out completely now.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Overall, it gave a very close shave.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely waterproof</li>
            <li> any sensitive skin/razor burn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the guy with bumpy sensitive skin that razors never work well</li>
            <li> To start with I have extremely sensitive skin around my neck and shaving can be killer.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely hooked and will never go back to anything</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and there was no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> My only real hesitation with continuing using this razor</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I had none of that.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;power\\&quot; part of these handles is simply a vibrator that shakes vibrates the razor much like the vibration ring on your cell phone.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then this razor is for you.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin but with the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide you will have no worries.</li>
            <li> Being busy, i don&#x27;t take the time to shave every day.</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion Proglide Power Razor is an updated version of their old fusion razors.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample to test via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li> I was surprised it didnt tug or nick</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> However, when traveling, it&#x27;s far easier to take the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor and use it.</li>
            <li> i think this razor was all looks no performance the old fusion</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference between the old Fusion and the Proglide Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Who would ever have thought a shaving system could have to near perfection</li>
            <li> This though isn&#x27;t completely one of them with the Gilette Fusion Proglide Power Razor.</li>
            <li> Simply put, safety razors and straight razors</li>
            <li> really - it does not last any longer than a twin blade!</li>
            <li> like the razor, but as soon as the vibrate gets turned on, it tears up my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> What I can say, is that somehow with all these \\&quot;innovations\\&quot;, they have managed to minorly improve an already stellar razor.  </li>
            <li> But is Gillette thinks they&#x27;ve gotten it complete figured out, they&#x27;ll stop trying.      </li>
            <li> The five blades makes for a really big shaving surface that I found I couldn&#x27;t really get to go where I wanted.</li>
            <li> The blade stabilizer and microcombs do appear to be a modest improvement in this regard.  </li>
            <li> JUST LOOKS PREMIUM AND MASCULINE.</li>
            <li> I have the power version and when you turn it on the whole razor buzzes and vibrates just enough that as your shaving</li>
            <li> 4pack and nearly $7 cheaper than the Proglides.</li>
            <li> and I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li> The vibrations (really, they are tiny micro-vibrations)</li>
            <li> I would not be surprised if the razor by Gillette testing is an improvement.  </li>
            <li> My husband tried this razor, and at the end of the week we compared it to his old two-blade razor.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use my old trusty Gillette Sensor 2-blade to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> This thing completely smooths my face out.</li>
            <li> They really are very different than anything I have seen before.  </li>
            <li> works about as well as my old gillette razor.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have an extremely sensitive skin and the thought of shaving gives me nightmares.</li>
            <li> (Try Alba Shave Foam or Aveeno Sensitive Skin brands) and this is heaven for your face.</li>
            <li> I would really like to try the razor that they use in the commercial that glides over</li>
            <li> it provides the closest shave you can possibly get without going into an \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; barber and getting a straight razor shave..</li>
            <li> Also, get rid of that crap-in-a-can gel or foam and get yourself some natural cream that you lather with a badger brush (Truefitt &amp; Hill, Proraso, etc)</li>
            <li> As far as this \\&quot;power\\&quot; part...</li>
            <li> He said it gives a much closer shave than regular razor.</li>
            <li> And last, you can get cuts much easier.  </li>
            <li> This one is not nearly as heavy as that old one.  </li>
            <li> and I hear a loud rattle.  </li>
            <li> find that the power vibrating head really does not improve my shave compared to standard units.</li>
            <li> He has extremely sensitive skin with tons of curly ingrown hair</li>
            <li> Then again I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.    </li>
            <li> So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I cannot tell a difference from the old Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li> and my sensitive skin has been deprived of</li>
            <li> Try using a Bic Sensitive razor or a bump fighter razor instead.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The addition of the vibration helps with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t believe how baby skin soft</li>
            <li> (Although, I believe you can use regular Fusion Proglide cartridges, although they aren&#x27;t much cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But overall, the power handle itself allows a much finer and closer cut.</li>

            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades last me through a whole work week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When Gilette sent me a free Fusion Proglide Power Razor to try, I realized what I was missing.</li>
            <li> The vibrating action makes this shave</li>
            <li> I knew my old razors would cause while trying to get through that growth.  </li>
            <li> razor has a battery powered vibrating action activated by a power button.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor for three weeks now and have been pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> It appears that most of the negative issues that I had encountered on the Gillette Fusion Power have been addressed.</li>
            <li> It really was noticeably smoother than the shave I was getting with regular disposables.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package and holding it in my hand, I felt like I was holding an old friend.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say - I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to Gillette, but I had been using their old razor technology for some time (Mach 3).  </li>
            <li> I like to &amp;#34;hear&amp;#34; the razor as it runs across my beard the vibrator completely dampens this out.</li>
            <li> The design of the razor didn&#x27;t really alleviate a problem for me, it actually created a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a Fusion ProGlide Power razor to try via a program from Gillette and was pleasantly surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so anything I can use to reduce the sensitivity I&#x27;ll give a try.</li>
            <li> This helped my sensitive skin, since there was no grabbing.  </li>
            <li> The power action did help keep it from getting stuck on the stubble.</li>
            <li> Aside from the cooler blue-and-black color scheme and the light-up power button that lets you know when your AAA battery is about up, the ProGlide handle is really quite similar to the Fusion Power handle.</li>
            <li> I had a week old vacation beard when I decided to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this a lot earlier in life because it would have saved me so much time, money, and pain.</li>
            <li> handle design is by far the coolest.  </li>
            <li> had I known how well it would compare to my old razor.  </li>
            <li> I currently use the mach 3 turbo razor and really wasn&#x27;t looking to change.  </li>
            <li> However, each of them has developed problems with the switch in that the razor turns on by itself and drains the battery.  </li>
            <li> The trim is handsome at least that&#x27;s what she says.</li>
            <li> so it follows the contours of your face really well without having to pull and stretch your face to get all those different curves.  </li>
            <li> It shaves extremely smoothly, so smooth that a few times I forgot to turn it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old fashioned razor user and I knock my razor against the side of the sink to get the razor trimmings off the blades.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with sensitive skin on my face and</li>
            <li> It lets me have complete control on what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li> Again, so far no complaints.</li>
            <li> The handle is solid, the battery compartment seems really watertight and it appears durable.</li>
            <li> This is where the product really showed that it is different.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide was markedly smoother.  </li>
            <li> but I was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it did in fact make a difference in the smoothness of my shave.  </li>
            <li> The handle is much thicker than the standard disposable razor, which makes it easier to grip.  </li>
            <li> The handle also has a generous rubber grip around the handle and another rubber grip area near the razor itself where you can rest your thumb or index finger depending on how you are holding the handle.  </li>
            <li> my wife and 9 year old son would feel my face and tell me which side they thought was smoother.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> took out my old trusty and shaved.  </li>
            <li> Goodbye tradition and habit and hello young lover.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a few strokes to get comfortable with the feel of the razor</li>
            <li> This FAR out performs my setup.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about trying a power razor but thankfully I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin where it always feels like the hair on my face is being pulled out by the roots.</li>
            <li> Kept thinking - can a handle really be that big a deal?</li>
            <li> OVERALL - I really like the handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problematic lowest part of the handle is also where the battery is loaded to allow for the Micropulse action.</li>
            <li> That was rightfully declared wishful thinking by the court, so I&#x27;m surprised to see products like this persisting in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Skin was soft with no cuts or nicks.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the powered version and the regular razor.  </li>
            <li> But.... how would my normally sensitive skin react to the close shave?  </li>
            <li> The pulses really seemed to help keep the razor moving in one fluid motion.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is a very well designed</li>
            <li> vibrating action seems to help lift the stubble and make the razor go through the hair easier.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin where it always feels like the hair on my face is being pulled out by the roots.  </li>
            <li> The skin under my stubble is quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> It very well may be part gimmick, but it actually works well.</li>
            <li> Above all, I really appreciate the grip.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for individuals who shave every day and are looking for the complete shaving experience.</li>
            <li> As a user of the standard Gillette Fusion razors for years, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference between shaving with those and using the power version.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is i don&#x27;t believe the \\&quot;power\\&quot; part really does anything.  </li>
            <li> Call me old fashioned.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I am cursed with what I call \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I have been somewhat skeptical of the whole \\&quot;vibrating handle\\&quot; razor phenomenon, but when Gillette offered to let me try one for free, I thought that it was worth</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is how it was much lighter than my non-power razor.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor.</li>
            <li> (it is much larger than the Mach3), and it was very balanced.  </li>
            <li> The handle is much thicker than the standard disposable razor, which makes it easier to grip.</li>
            <li> The handle also has a generous rubber grip around the handle and another rubber grip area near the razor itself where you can rest your thumb or index finger depending on how you are holding the handle.</li>
            <li> But the ProGlide definitely makes life so much easier for me.</li>
            <li> In addition it&#x27;s also supposed to imitate what an electric shaver feels like against your face complete with the humming and noise.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t got any irritation so far</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin and lots of shaving products</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor has completely changed my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I was a regular blade user it may have had more of an impression on me, but the vibrating thing just struck me as gimmicky.</li>
            <li> When Gillette introduced the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handles in the Fusion line a few years back I immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li> however, in all fairness I have discovered a 6 bladed razor that I have only found at Walgreens which shaves JUST AS GOOD as my Fusion--not to mention are cheaper (by at least $3 per refill), and would often stick with that in the last year</li>
            <li> The Blades seem to need more attention/cleaned multiple times during the shave when you skip a few days..</li>
            <li> I am now a convert, this is totally worth the extra money for the overall value in the product and the shave.  </li>
            <li> And the vibration seemed to make me go more slowly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this handle functions 100% and will give you a good shave, but it&#x27;s not because of the ergonomic grip and electronics.</li>
            <li> My old 2 blade Sensor does as good as the power glide so after I finish this expensive razors i purchased</li>
            <li> Although switching blades is normal maintenance that must be completed on a razor, this was a little premature for a blade to start dulling this quick.  </li>
            <li> I am going back to my old stand by !!!</li>
            <li> I will admit that I don&#x27;t grow anything thick in a day, so it wasn&#x27;t hard for it to give me an outstanding close shave with a  very clean and soft feel.(I</li>
            <li> I have so many random handles from defunct razors, or just ones that didn&#x27;t feel right.  </li>
            <li> blade pivots enough, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the right starting position</li>
            <li> These razors don&#x27;t last very long, and this is coming from someone who can&#x27;t grow a full beard.</li>
            <li> For the baby face like me who takes half a week to grow a 5 oclock shadow, the power option is pretty much</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of different Razor&#x27;s after using many I finally settled on \\&quot;\\&quot;Sensor 3\\&quot;\\&quot; as other razors do not suit me</li>
            <li> Ive always been a little sketchy about a vibrating razor on my face, but its WORTH it!</li>
            <li> attribute this little event to Gillette not caring for my original review here on Amazon (below)...</li>
            <li> (no more grizzly bear)! :)</li>
            <li> I mean, how much better could it be?  </li>
            <li> But this product gives such a smooth and clean shave that it makes the Mach 3 look like an extinct old generation product.</li>
            <li> The significance is that anyone with sensitive skin knows that running a razor blade over the same spot that&#x27;d been previously shaved over can easily irritate the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor gives an unbelievably close shave, and it is easy to handle, minimizing razor burn and cuts.</li>
            <li> Unlike other razors, it left my skin smooth and without being irritated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned one as I thought they were gimmicky, but it seriously helps make shaving more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The multiple thin blades and secure grips on the handle produce a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li> My face felt smooth hours later, unlike when I shave with some other, cheaper razors.</li>
            <li> The biggest plus for me is that the fit is different in my hand than other razors.</li>
            <li> This razor was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette and I must say that after trying this,I will never go back to any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and typically have no use for a razor and use a electric shaver just to trim.</li>
            <li> I have very thick/coarse facial hair, and this makes it difficult most times to shave consistently.  </li>
            <li> It provides a very close, smooth, irritation-free shave every time, and as long as you dry the blades regularly they shouldn&#x27;t dull too easily.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it provides a clean close shave as expected from a razor.  </li>
            <li> The button to turn on the vibration was easy to manipulate -- wet or dry.</li>
            <li> appears to do the job in the same way as old classic gillette mach 3 has been doing.</li>
            <li> I could even use it dry on my face for quick touch ups which I never could do with a regular disposable razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> At first I did not notice, but this thing can stand up right as well as flat down.</li>
            <li> The blades on the ProGlide are SUPER SHARP!  </li>
            <li> The large bulb at the bottom was kind of annoying to me and effects the overall aesthetics of the look of the handle, which overall is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Normally on the 3 day shave, I have significant regrowth by the end of the 2nd day but because of the closer shave from the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I didn&#x27;t notice the same level of regrowth until the middle of the 3rd day!</li>
            <li> Later with double blades I got \\&quot;passable\\&quot; results, but not s particularly close or easy shave.</li>
            <li> But other then that, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind</li>
            <li> But this razor works so well, and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with irritation, nicks or those unsavory missed spots that you sometimes notice half-way through your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades seemed to wear out faster than other razors I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s worth it to replace them for the comfort from this system.</li>
            <li> My beard is fairly course and it usually takes several passes to get an area closely shaved which in turn makes me press harder as well.  </li>
            <li> I have problems gripping things in my hand and most razors that I use the handle is small and thin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gone to buy new blades yet, but a quick Web search puts the prices in line with other blades of similar quality.</li>
            <li> About me: can&#x27;t grow a full beard, not very thick facial hair, used to shave once every 3-4 days, these razors have me shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the shave better, in fact it may hurt it slightly, since the last thing you want when shaving is tiny rapid movement of the blades.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product is more or less same like its predecessor.</li>
            <li> I received the  Fusion ProGlide Power handle and blade as part of a free campaign run by Gillette and BzzAgent After using for about a week and a half, i&#x27;m definitely a fan of it so far.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that due to all the rubber on the handle, but it was more slippery than my other razor handle.  </li>
            <li> handle appears essentially the same as the older Fusion Power, so if you have an older working \\&quot;power\\&quot; handle the ProGlide Power blades are interchangeable.</li>
            <li> I got a decent shave and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> i switched for the fusion razor to a classic safety razor and will never go back</li>
            <li> The basic razor (and especially the starter kit) are not expensive, for what they are.</li>
            <li> I never had the same problems with the older version of Gillette&#x27;s Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Several times during the first shave the only way I could tell that I was shaving was to look in the mirror and see the shaving cream gone from the area I had just shaved.</li>
            <li> At first was skeptical of the vibrating shaver and still not quite sure of it&#x27;s contribution</li>
            <li> I like the extra blade feature and combined with some decent shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I have found that electric razors have not been able to provide a close enough shave for me and have been using the Gillette Mach3 for the past</li>
            <li> I was glad that it only needs one small battery for whenever I will need to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Oddly, I am not even shaving that area</li>
            <li> This was evident in many of the difficult areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only downside may be price in the long run but if you want a quality shave it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> just different, so I was a little more conscious of my morning shave, which has become second nature to me.  </li>
            <li> So finally i looked into single blade shaving and found mt edwin jagger DE89 and have been using a brush to lather my cream, the combination of the two produces an almost irritation free shave and is musch cheeper once you have the basic equipment.</li>
            <li> From what I have noticed having used it now for over 2 months (still on the first original blade, too) is that the Hydro blades stay sharper MUCH longer than ANY previous Gillette product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> have been happy in the past with other Gillette products that I use, and I would recommend this razor to friends who were curious in trying it.</li>
            <li> The handle itself, minus the power feature, is designed very very well.  </li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide appears to be a bit different visually, but I don&#x27;t really see much functional difference over the regular Fusion razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have the same issue.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have the same issue.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment lock was a little tricky to figure out at first but is pretty simple and the button is a little tough, you really gotta give it a good push, but all in all</li>
            <li> There are no loose parts, it&#x27;s just a very solid feeling in the hand, like you&#x27;re using a very well crafted tool.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, it is starting to pull a little, but that is much more than I ever got out of a generic!  </li>
            <li> It feels as though there is less drag so shaving is faster and somewhat more effortless.</li>
            <li> but for wet electric shaving the exact right gel makes all the difference and other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I did not have high expectations when I first received the product but after using the razor for a few weeks I have completely made the switch to this product.</li>
            <li> Now for the razor blade itself, in the past I could only use a blade 3 or 4 times before I just had to get a new one, (which is another reason the big pack of disposables made the most sense).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razor&#x27;s for yr&#x27;s, I love these razor&#x27;s &amp; will never buy anything else, the razor&#x27;s last a very long time &amp; usually don&#x27;t need to shave for 2 whole day&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Well luckily for this lonely razor sitting on my desk for a week i was scheduled for a minor surgery in a fairly sensitive area and was notified i had to be shaven completely with a razor.</li>
            <li> The only positive I can see from this product is the larger handle which helps with grip and handling.</li>
            <li> Its design is sleek and fits comfortably in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette was kind enough to send over this bad boy</li>
            <li> Usually with these disposable razors the weight and feel of the handle itself is a bit on the light side.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the lubicating strip disappears long before the blades really need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> No more cheap razors for this guy.</li>
            <li> Like the previous series the handle is comfortable to hold and the vibration is noticeable but subtle and smooth - the razor doesn&#x27;t want to jump around while holding</li>
            <li> I usually use an electric razor, but after receiving a free ProGlide Power from Gillette I was sold after just a week of use.  </li>
            <li> Provides a smooth shave without the usual nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle (that I received for free through a program run by Gillette) for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I&#x27;m considering doing the ol&#x27;-fashioned</li>
            <li> so I think in the long run you end up going through the Fusion ProGlide blades much quicker.  </li>
            <li> after 5 shaves it is no more smooth ...</li>
            <li> usually use a Gillette Mach 3 as my primary tool to shave.</li>
            <li> It was comfortable to use, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the vibrating part is for.</li>
            <li> The vibration feature I felt wasn&#x27;t as smooth as the Mach III that I usually use.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed it left me with a much smoother face than my old razor.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and since I shave in the shower, I can attest to its waterproofness over the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange thing to have on a straight edge razor like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I need to make several passes; but not with the Fusion ProGlide.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t have to go over any spots on my face like I normally do with the non-powered version</li>
            <li> I normally use the regular Gillette Fusion razor weekly, so I thought why not try this one out.</li>
            <li> I consider myself an avid wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> Last but not least, just like its predecessor</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my Mach 3 Power for normal usage.</li>
            <li> I would like a normal non battery run handle with the same weight.</li>
            <li> you are a normal male, and part of the comfort of shaving is in the comfort of the handle, I would advise you not but the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power, you will regret shaving with this handle.</li>
            <li> Definitely not, or at least not at the current price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally shave with the buy in bulk razors from the local warehouse store.</li>
            <li> While one can use the front of the razor for straight cut areas like sideburns, the trimmer on the backside of the head does a better job at making a straight line and is easier to tell where you&#x27;re cutting.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the shave was very smooth, no nicks nor chafes which are so common with the traditional safety</li>
            <li> The handle is the same as the older Fusion Power with the only real difference being the color styling (blue instead of orange).</li>
            <li> Not a hard test, not enough for a review either</li>
            <li> I did not have to go over certain areas multiple times, like other straight razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine on the sides and neck but just doesn&#x27;t seem to get very close and is also irritating.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this product daily, it&#x27;s probably just fine, although the vibration with the battery seems gimmicky.</li>
            <li> close shave for men with fine to med thick beard or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There is also a single blade on the back side of the razor head to get right up under the nose.</li>
            <li> Considering how freakin&#x27; expensive Gillette products are, and especially how much more they charge for the Proglide than the Fusion, I&#x27;m sorry, but I would expect if the product cost 35% MORE, that the razor would actually perform 35% better, too.</li>
            <li> I tend to find razors with 5-blades overdoing it a little, but I&#x27;ve never gotten such a smooth shave with either disposables or women-specific razors, like the Venus.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit on the big side, but that makes sense because they need to fit the battery inside it.  </li>
            <li> I must admit that it turned out a little better than expected.</li>
            <li> I wish the colors popped a little bit more (although really, no one</li>
            <li> biggest problem I have had with razors in general is that they quickly become clogged, preventing the blades from cutting any more hair.  </li>
            <li> The handle is more bulky and a little harder to handle while shaving in the shower</li>
            <li> The &#x27;power&#x27; handle helps that process, allowing for a dull blade to easily cut through those whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i thought for sure since it was free it would be lame, but i was not lame in the least.  </li>
            <li> I ended up seeing a much better shave with less irritation than any of the other razors I tried.</li>
            <li> I ended up seeing a much better shave with less irritation than any of the other razors I ever used.</li>
            <li> In comparison the regular Fusion I previously used this is a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve had better shaves with other less costly razors.</li>
            <li> The other thing that I love about the razor is that I have cut myself using it less than any brand of razor than I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The results were much better than the other razors in this category I have previously used.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to believe that this razor could be better than my current razor</li>
            <li> On top of that, the precision trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge took care of the hard to shave area under my nose.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change would be to add different levels of vibrations so its not all one speed which appeared to be very high.</li>
            <li> I tend to shave every other day and the blade seemed to stand very well upon multiple uses for the whole week duration,</li>
            <li> I recently got a new schick power blade and after using for about a month I realized I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> As luck would have it, I caught a commercial announcing the new ProGlide was coming on June 6th.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m definitely keeping this one and buying new blades for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And if you have been using the Fusion, I would definitely recommend the upgrade to the new Fusion Proglide.  </li>
            <li> This new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle definitely makes all the difference in my shave.  </li>
            <li> this morning I had my second shave with the new razor.  </li>
            <li> From the disposable razor to multiple blades to ergonomic handles, there&#x27;s always something new in the Shaving aisle.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close enough shave when new, but the clogging was a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> S&amp;S. i reach for my brand new weapon of scruff destruction and commence facial battle.</li>
            <li> unlike the Hydro I was using I could only get 3 shaves and needed new blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I typically have to shave everyday with other razors - I just can&#x27;t seem to find anything that could cut my stubble well enough to leave my face smooth for more than a day at a time.  </li>
            <li> the Power Blade turned on, the sound and feel of the vibrations masked the feel and sound of the blade cutting hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same blade for 5 shaves now, and it still is cutting great.  </li>
            <li> I really like the classic black color.</li>
            <li> The real test for me was a dry shave.  </li>
            <li> is a bit strange at first, but I&#x27;ve actually grown to like it now.</li>
            <li> Overall, my shave was smooth and I had few issues.</li>
            <li> that said, as much as I really wanted to like this, this razor receives only 2 stars from me for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> handle allowed me to shave slowly, and cleanly without having to go over the same area twice, which really helped me avoid</li>
            <li> My only issue is for me personally after going over my whole face and neck</li>
            <li> This maybe because I properly wash my face before I shave so my facial hair is all ready to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will keep testing back and forth with my old one, but this one looks like a winner so far.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s such a weirdly-shaped and sensitive area, I&#x27;ve never had completely, baby-smooth underarms before.</li>
            <li> You definitely pay for the upgrade - it is twice as much as the regular Mach 3 blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have a boss that doesn&#x27;t say a word when I don&#x27;t shave for a few days at a time.  </li>
            <li> I was probably even more skeptical of the power handle than I was of the \\&quot;magical\\&quot; five-blade cartridges (but they won me over, too), so you can imagine my surprise when I discovered how much easier it was to shave with the power handle.  </li>
            <li> Yes blades can cost but really worth the money over the typical razor..</li>
            <li> my facial hair grows fast and sometimes I have to shave 2 x a day, if my facial hair grows a couple of days the blades snag on my hair.</li>
            <li> At first it was a bit strange that the entire razor was vibrating when powered on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and really didn&#x27;t feel like there was much of a difference with the shave.</li>
            <li> This feature is probably for the aforementioned \\&quot;burly\\&quot; men above who grow whole fields of hair on their face every day.</li>
            <li> Since the shave is so comfortable, I am finding that I am currently shaving everyday so this is not a problem.</li>
            <li> i will likely continue my use of this weapon here and now, or in a galaxy far far away.</li>
            <li> But here Gillette has us over the barrel and is literally forcing everyone to pay a premium for what many of us do not believe is any better (in fact - annoyingly worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Overall, a good razor at an expensive price.</li>
            <li> was a little timid at first since it was battery powered and vibrated on my skin, but I did not have any trouble with it shaving close and giving me a smooth face.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have realized I can usually only shave with razors that have two blades.</li>
            <li> grip is very soft and grippy, so I am not losing my grip on the razor in the middle of shaving.</li>
            <li> ; we will continue to purchase Gillette&#x27;s fusion line regularly due to its effectiveness (blades stayed relatively sharp for a good time in comparison to other products &amp; possible second-hand Gillette products); thank you!</li>
            <li> The handle was comfortable as long as the price came down I would buy it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> To test the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, I put a new blade in each of the two razors and proceeded to shave the left half of my face with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and the right side with the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test platform</li>
            <li> As a dad constantly on the go, it takes up very little counter space and it is easy to take on the go.  </li>
            <li> The major change in design this make is the micropulse vibrations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was one major difference however.  </li>
            <li> The power feature of this razor is a major downgrade.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette brand of razors in the past and was really excited to try this one out.</li>
            <li> With the cost of blades that is definitely a major drawback.</li>
            <li> There is no other way to shave,</li>
            <li> First I tried shaving without turning on the power and the razor felt sharp.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything would persuade him to going back to his old razors, and in fact, he did throw them out!  </li>
            <li> Major BS here by Gillette.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no math major, but I think that&#x27;s a savings of about $182.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had sampled the Gillette Fusion Power when it first released and was extremely dissatisfied with the experience, so I returned to my Mach3.</li>
            <li> This was the price I found at a major chain that carries the fusion refills.</li>
            <li> I received this to try out via a Gillette program and won&#x27;t go back to my old handle!</li>
            <li> It fits the hand like no other.</li>
            <li> Weighing the alternative of just throwing the razor in a shaving bag, I feel this provides a little more protection from the blade snapping off or any other issues</li>
            <li> My face actually felt as if I was again 12 years old and never had the need to shave!</li>
            <li> I only used hot water to prepare my face, so I can only imagine it being even easier with some regular preparation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it took a few strokes to realize that I really had to shave exactly the same as I would without the power model.</li>
            <li> I felt like it cut better and easier, and I didn&#x27;t have as much difficulty at the usual trouble areas.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had any nicks or cuts, and I glide right around uneven surfaces, even my chin.</li>
            <li> I especially like the design of the power handle, the grips make it easy to shave in the shower, no more dropping the razor.</li>
            <li> I typically wear a full beard but use the razor to shave my neck and face above the beard.</li>
            <li> right at first but goes dull immediately so until they come out with an american blade for this</li>
            <li> Definitely would look to purchase this handle in the future as long as the price was right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, a few notes on the packaging - the back of the package is perforated, so it tears open easily -</li>
            <li> Due to a significant recent career change, I&#x27;ve since had impetus to reevaluate my shaving method, for purposes of professional and personal travel both domestically and internationally.</li>
            <li> I was concerned, but again very positive impressions after a few days of shaving regularly with the new Gillette Fusion Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to dig in a little too much because I want my shave as smooth as possible, and with other razors I end up with some scrapes here and there.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that the very thin and flexible blades, along with whatever technology they use to sharpen the things, is the key here.</li>
            <li> so I need to be certain that the razor I choose won&#x27;t slip out of my hand while wet.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea how the vibration is supposed to help - it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> definitely got a better shave with this razor, although it&#x27;s hard to say how much of it was due to the pulsating handle and</li>
            <li> I have had issues with many razors in the past due to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The replacement blade cartridges can be a little pricey, but they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> The flexibility that it provides is very useful in terms of being able to get odd or uncomfortable areas when shaving, like parts of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> My beard is tough and it really dulls the blades on other razors but so far this razor has surpassed all the others.&lt;br /&gt;The single blade trimmer that is on the back of the blades is great for shaving right under my nose where I can&#x27;t get with the regular set of blades.</li>
            <li> Many of the features of this razor are slight refinements of previous designs.</li>
            <li> recommend this razor to anyone looking for a clean wet shave that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin bumpy and rough.</li>
            <li> In addition, clean up only took a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I only shave a few days a week, considering that it is not a requirement with my line of work that I be clean shaven.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the blade and design was a bit different, indicating probably why my shave was so different from an older model fusion blade.</li>
            <li> Tough too complain about this since I like the blade vibration on my face way more than I dislike the handle vibration.  </li>
            <li> While this made shaving my neck and most of my face quicker and easier, the larger head made shaving more \\&quot;precision\\&quot; areas like my upper lip and chin a little difficult as I felt like the razor was not able to contour easily to the chin fold or part of the upper lip just below the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The vibration will give you a smoother closer shave and your girlfriend will love it, your closer shave I mean, plus it&#x27;s waterproof!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a beard/mustache, and do some precision shaving, and the vibration seems to dull the feel I use to get an accurate line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could not, for the life of me, get the bottoms of my sideburns to look clean, and it actually nicked a small cut on the underside of my earlobe as I was shaving near it.  </li>
            <li> The light vibration means you don&#x27;t have to press as hard in those areas which avoids nicks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use cheap disposable razors, they are dull after one shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe a handle this grippy and comfortable is hiding a battery compartment.</li>
            <li> The light vibration means you don&#x27;t have to press as hard in those areas which avoids nicks.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this to the individual with limitied to medium thickness of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> and I know such an organization would only produce high quality products</li>
            <li> The overall awesomeness of this combination has convinced me to come back to Gillette, even with the high pricing of the blades.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend; my only issue is the high cost of the refills.</li>
            <li> The original blades would last at least a month, but not so with this new blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using these until the razors I currently have go dull (luckily that will take a while) and downgrade to the original Gillette Fusion Blades unless the price of refills goes down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I shave dry and these are much faster and much smoother than other razors</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked the shave that I was able to get with the handle, but I felt it was a little too annoying to use to really justify the closeness.  </li>
            <li> Due to the fact that I use this in the shower for my daily shave, I was hopeful that the razor would perform better than the previous version I had tried.</li>
            <li> It seems that in any situation where it might start catching(getting dull), this might help the blades last a bit longer, as it&#x27;ll be moving more to cut through the hair, without actually pulling.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor and the price isn&#x27;t all that bad.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s a failed attempt at what could be really amazing technology.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of shaving systems, but generally prefer Gillette.</li>
            <li> Turns out its the best solution so far to the pain I commonly have during cutting.  </li>
            <li> Not a bit of drag or irritation was experienced, so I let my beard grow for a week, thinking that this time it would fail the standard it now set.</li>
            <li> Just generally another marketing scheme I thought...   </li>
            <li> In general I still prefer an electric.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70yrs old and have been using an electric razor as long as I can remember because I have sensitive skin and get razor burn, I do, however, feel the shave of an electric razor isn&#x27;t as close as manual.</li>
            <li> Even with wet hands your grip never slips and it does not seem too small like so many disposables do.</li>
            <li> First off, normally a disposable razor would usually take me around 8 min even in the shower.</li>
            <li> My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor thru a free Gillette offer, I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> power function seemed to help with the shave and really helped cleaning the blades out&lt;br /&gt;Blades seemed to last a long time without dulling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was no drag or chaffing of my skin or hair, and</li>
            <li> I recently tried out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle razor and was pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li> There is no drag on any part of my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different multiple blade razors and electric shavers in the past, but have been exclusively using the Schick Quattro for the last 5 or 6 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Blades and lubricating strip do not last nearly as the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Changing the blades couldn&#x27;t be easier, just press the button on the back and the old blade pops off.</li>
            <li> Working at a corporate office, being in front of senior leadership, and trying to look as professional as I can at all times.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the battery compartment is water-tight, because I haven&#x27;t had any problems with using the razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> So, far I have used this same blade for almost a month and</li>
            <li> you are someone with sensitive skin, this will probably help as it only takes one pass to get a close shave!</li>
            <li> And I have been using this razor with the same blade in now for 3 weeks, and I still did not get razor burn with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> thought the blades were pretty average.</li>
            <li> I am used to nicking myself several times with my old razor.  </li>
            <li> my neck like the old Fushion would occasionally did.</li>
            <li> I believe this is because the hairs were too short but that may be something with me, sensitive skin or something</li>
            <li> I personally have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Applied Gillette Fusion shaving cream and tested it next to my old Fusion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the (old) Fusion to shave my head for several years now.  </li>
            <li> The only negative impressions I had were figuring out how to load the battery in the handle and the cost of replacement blades which are quite a bit more than standard disposable razor blades.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised how well it actually reduced shaving irritation alongside this razor.</li>
            <li> I always went back to my Mach 3, then Fusion and was pleasantly surprised to see that the Fusion was being re-tooled to be even</li>
            <li> through the amazon Vine program I received a Schick Hydro 5 razor back in early August.</li>
            <li> So far, after weeks of daily usage, I have not had a blade-change yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my  old razor.</li>
            <li> They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s back to his old two-blade.</li>
            <li> then I bought a ProGlide Power Razor about 2 weeks before it was actually released and all I can say is WOW...</li>
            <li> This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face, nick or cut you in any way...</li>
            <li> only one complain is i deleted my old addresses before ordering this</li>
            <li> I am 67 years young and for the last 20 or so have been an electric shave user.</li>
            <li> I thought the vibration may be preventing the razor from having too much sustained pressure on the skin, although I don&#x27;t generally use much pressure when using razors in general, so I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin, using a regular razor can be a daunting task.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that that the button lights up, rather than the old style, will burn up the battery faster.</li>
            <li> Not much pressure is needed for a very close shave with no nicks or burn.  </li>
            <li> I could barely feel it shaving my face.  </li>
            <li> The smoothness of each stroke made me feel as if I was not shaving at all because I could barely feel the razor on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to my old Schick Quattro.</li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, make the switch and save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This blade system has completely redefined the art of shaving and is the only reason why I&#x27;m not an electric razor user anymore.</li>
            <li> I can grasp it between my thumb and a finger and feel like I have the ultimate control for those sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> The mineral oil from the lubristrips also left my skin feeling soft and irritation-free.</li>
            <li> I would never go back to my old razors; and, trust me, I&#x27;ve experimented with all kinds.</li>
            <li> Unlike my old razor, the ProGlide massages my face such that I don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m shaving.  </li>
            <li> The multiple blades and vibration lift the hairs prior to trimming, resulting in a much closer shave than obtained using the regular model.  </li>
            <li> and I mus say that it is a vast improvement over my old Gillette Fusion handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> and I barely notice that it vibrates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the shave I received from the razor it seemed to be the same if I had the vibrating on or off.</li>
            <li> This handle works very well, but the vibration is stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually only shave once a week, as my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> the Gillette Fusion Power Razor has nearly an identical handle and weight (although the Fusion ProGlide has slightly larger rubber grips).</li>
            <li> The gentle vibration and micropulses definitely added to the overall closeness and smoothness of my daily shave.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the handle and how it didn&#x27;t slip out of my hand in the shower while my hands were wet.</li>
            <li> No slipping, no sliding, even with water and shaving cream on the handle.  </li>
            <li> I ditched my old brand because this razor simply works.  </li>
            <li> Definitely for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this Pro Glide Power Razor, even for guys, who, like me still use the old fashion safety razor.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shave with the Power model.</li>
            <li> This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face, nick or cut you in any way...</li>
            <li> I turned on the power a few times and first of all it did not feel natural to me</li>
            <li> Well, after only using the Gillette disposables for all those years, the Walmart blades were pretty bad(cuts, rough, etc.).  </li>
            <li> At first I was not sure if I would like this razor as the handle is a bit fatter then the normal non battery operated Gillette razor.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> The handle took 2-3 uses to get fully used to, but it&#x27;s possible I may never go back to a normal razor again.  </li>
            <li> I shaved off about a weeks worth of growth in a few passes, used the same old shave gel I always use, and viola, NO CUTS,</li>
            <li> The power handle makes it tougher to maneuver and tugs your hair more, irritating your skin.  </li>
            <li> so it was kind of uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The razor was sent to me by a program run by Gillette, I would have been kind of skeptical in buying a \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot;, a vibrating razor</li>
            <li> Gillette is on top of the razor game.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin on top</li>
            <li> The vibrations annoyed me more than anything</li>
            <li> I had experience with this product before and did not find it any better or worse than it&#x27;s name brand competitors.</li>
            <li> They even have rubber grip at the very bottom of the handle where batteries go, great for the last pinky finger as it curls the base.  </li>
            <li> After using this razor for the past few weeks, I can honestly say that I like it a lot and will continue to use</li>
            <li> The accompanying literature says that the built-in \\&quot;guide comb\\&quot; directs hairs into the blades, at the \\&quot;optimum angle\\&quot; for cutting.</li>
            <li> The idea of a battery-powered manual razor seemed kind of silly.</li>
            <li> I really like the new handle, its a little thicker and</li>
            <li> The precision edging blade is a really nice bonus for getting those extremely difficult little areas like right under the nose and for edging the sideburn area nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I quickly and almost effortlessly received an extremely close shave (MUCH closer than my typical recent</li>
            <li> I will admit that I don&#x27;t grow super thick facial hair, and that may be a factor for some people, but if you have normal facial hair growth, and sensitive skin, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> When it came down to my first shave, the Proglide seemed to get deeper on hairs</li>
            <li> First, the handle has slimmed down from what it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I have less irritation after using this razor than the usual which is nice.</li>
            <li> It seems like we are constantly seeing ads for &#x27;new&#x27; razors with an extra blade, closer shave, etc.  </li>
            <li> I got my brand new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power in the mail a few days ago thanks to a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> With this new razor not only does it work for my face but also for my head which i shave almost daily.</li>
            <li> These new ones now come in blue and chrome whereas the ones from last year came in gold.</li>
            <li> I just bought a new one in blue assuming it would be made in France just as my gold one I got last year was.</li>
            <li> One benefit in having a beard is that the blades last a very long time because I don&#x27;t have much to shave each day.  </li>
            <li> One of the big stand outs is the handle not only is it easy to hold but it has a vibrating function that makes for less tug when shaving (I have very coarse facial</li>
            <li> typically use an electric razor because of sensitivity, but the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER CARTRIDGE provided me with a smooth and long-lasting shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take me any longer than using the electric shaver, and the skin irritation was far less and the shave much closer.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t mean to sound like a salesman here, but I do have another suggestion.</li>
            <li> but a few days after it just felt like a much more even and lasting feel of the shave compared to other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually purchase a large package of shick and sometimes gillette disposable razors due to how quick the blades go out.</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; face; my facial hair naturally grows both thick and in multiple directions and tends to grow thick along my neck, yet my skin is sensitive, making a rotary shaver a good option.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I went a little slower than usual, but I expect that I&#x27;ll get back to my normal speed once I&#x27;m more used to the pulse</li>
            <li> After a half dozen shaves, the conclusion was that the Gillette gave a slightly better shave, but it was close enough that if I had not shaven half of my face with each razor, no one could have noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> is a bit odd at first</li>
            <li> Definitely less irritation today than with my first shave with the blade yesterday.</li>
            <li> and I noticed less \\&quot;breakout\\&quot; around my neck within the first week.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s JUST about time to change, but I could still probably handle another shave or two with no less comfort than I had with the regular Fusion Power blades.</li>
            <li> I found it much better than of the other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Having been using a regular Gillette razor for as long as I can remember I was a little hesitant when I got this one for free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have used many types of shaving creams with the Proglide razor like Nivea for Sensitive Skin, various types of Edge gell, Aveeno, Aloe Vera Gel, Shaving Secret oil, hair conditioner, bottled shampoo, moisturizers, shaving mug soap with brush and even dial bath soap brushed into a lather with my shaving brush.</li>
            <li> It normally took be 15 minutes to shave with a single razor.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this certainly gave me a close shave and minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> blades themselves are great, but the vibrating handle made me a little skeptical if this was a gimmick-product.</li>
            <li> and it shows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get razor burns with cheaper razors due to all the pulling and tugging, but thanks to the ProGlide</li>
            <li> Gillette provided one as part of a test program, and, having used other Gillette products I was very hopeful that it would perform well.</li>
            <li> Its just like its other non powered version (as the power feature doesn&#x27;t really change my shave).</li>
            <li> This product dwarfs any other straight razor I have used.</li>
            <li> the handle itself, it grips well, but feels beefy after using other disposable handles for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Issard straight blade with a careful four pass 15 minute shaving, but who has time for that!  </li>
            <li> The Fusion has put all other over the counter modern safety razors to shame.  </li>
            <li> (I had a credit) and shaved a 4 day old beard this evening in nothing flat.  </li>
            <li> Other razors cut reasonably close, the using the Fusion there are times when I can run my hand across my face and not detect even the tiniest bit of beard.  </li>
            <li> The handle is much easier to grip than other razors in this category.</li>
            <li> It cuts really close, closer than any other razor I have used including my $250 electric razor.</li>
            <li> how much was due to the blade.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grow facial hair that fast, so it takes me a long time to get through a razor (I only shave 2-3 times a week since I have the gift of a baby face).</li>
            <li> I find that this blade lasts me much longer than other brands.  </li>
            <li> However, I find that the refills last much, much longer than the refills of other brands and in the long run it at least compatible if not even more economic that the other leading brands.  </li>
            <li> or so when money has been tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally saved up and purchased a Proglide razor recently and found the shave to be pretty much as expected.</li>
            <li> Its a good shave but blade does not last long for me making it too expensive to continue with.  </li>
            <li> So I put a new blade on my old razor and shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion.</li>
            <li> So I put a new blade on my old razor and shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> The blades do not last very long and are expensive to replace but that is a minor inconvenience for the great results that the product provides.  </li>
            <li> and it is easy to maneuver big enough to hold small enough for comfort.</li>
            <li> This helps both in controlling the blade in your hand and also makes it feel less cheap than other blades.  </li>
            <li> The vibration is strong but not overpowering and the handle is thick enough that it&#x27;s not hard to keep a grip on with wet hands.</li>
            <li> They all recommend a safety razor - but you have to be very careful and it takes much longer.</li>
            <li> The subtle vibration makes the shave smooth and close.  </li>
            <li> I got this product for free from Gillette, and I was skeptical because I use a 3 blades, and I&#x27;m very picky about what razor I use.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is too light in my hand, even with the battery for the for the buzzer installed.  </li>
            <li> This one gives me such a smooth shave that I can keep stubble at bay for at least a day.</li>
            <li> It is substantial and solid, not like the cheap blades that are so common.</li>
            <li> When gripped by the black rubber portion that circles around the top, sides and back just below the neck of the razor, the razor fits firmly in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But there are moments, meetings, social events, and my wife&#x27;s request for a closer shave that no electric razor can accomplish.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handles I definitely recommend this version - especially guys with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and refuse to shave daily, even though I have fast-growing facial</li>
            <li> As far as I know, the micro-comb is the only thing that is different between the power and manual blades, which makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked this razor up last week and noticed a big difference in the closeness of the shave and the smoothness of my skin vs. my old razors.</li>
            <li> I would constantly get razor burn and bumps with my old Mach 3, but there was nary a red spot to be seen or felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The grooves within it allow for a more natural and less forced grip on the razor.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, so having a a razor I can keep a steady grip on even when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> Naturally, with a battery, there&#x27;s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.The downside, you might expect, is that the blades are about twice as expensive as the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Since my old razor never bothered me, I won&#x27;t be switching to these more expensive blades.</li>
            <li> With the power on though, I did not experience the same irritation that I have in the past when using full electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> were fixin&#x27; something that ain&#x27;t broken actually made it better.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I see no reason to switch from my old Fusion to newer and more expensive cartridges.</li>
            <li> For a heavy bearded person who shaves every day (or twice a day?), this will probably be worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Since my old razor never bothered me, I won&#x27;t be switching to these more expensive blades.  </li>
            <li> Frequent razor replacement in addition to the cost of a better quality shave cream is ridiculously expensive.  </li>
            <li> The handle feels nice in the hand, and the vibrating action - when turned on - doesn&#x27;t feel awkward.</li>
            <li> Normally those are areas where even new blades catch a bit and things get a little sketchy but this one went through without a hitch.</li>
            <li> However, other areas that were not as thick felt a very smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Gillette products in the recent past and was always pleased</li>
            <li> a little stubble.&lt;br /&gt;The proglide does a close shave with little to no pressure on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The real issue is: is it really worth $34 for 8 replacement blades where the hydro has 8 for just under $</li>
            <li> Starting out, this looks just like an ordinary manual razor with a swappable razor blade like so many other razors out there.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the handle looked to be a little bulky and going to an issue.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any major difference in the final result</li>
            <li> I like that you can use it in or out of the shower even though I was a little unsure about this at first.  </li>
            <li> I tried other brands in the past and did not like them, so I am a firm believer that Gillette makes a good product.  </li>
            <li> It provides an experience which is second to no other product out there.</li>
            <li> Extremely close shave, even closer than normal!  </li>
            <li> Its slightly thick for my taste makes it a lil hard to shave of certain areas in my neck, although together with the razor it creates an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> There was less irritation, and the shave was closer than with the Mach 3 (whether this is from the handle or the increased blades, I can&#x27;t be positive).  </li>
            <li> The blades were much sharper than the regular Fusion blades and gave him a very smooth shave without cutting himself at all.  </li>
            <li> The blades are much sharper than the regular Fusion blades and give me a very smooth shave without cutting myself at all.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a little bit on the sensitive side, and I also tend to get as much use out of my blades as possible, given the price of replacements.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin and it has been tough to find a razor that can give me a great shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, there are some ridges on the bottom that improve how well I can grip a wet handle, but the ridges still feel odd in my hand even after a full month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using it and it is well worth the small money spent upfront.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive the trial as I&#x27;m cheap when it comes to buying razors and go for the less expensive ones at Target.</li>
            <li> The blade sharpness seems to last about the same as other blades and it is evident from the razor drag when it is time to change to a new blade.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive thin skin and black course hair on my chin yet more soft hair on the sides.  </li>
            <li> Also in my experience, the cartridges are interchangeable between the different Gillette Fusion handles, so unless yours has broken or is very old I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this one expecting a significant upgrade.</li>
            <li> handle was comfortable to hold, when it wasn&#x27;t vibrating, otherwise the vibration went all the way down your hand, which made it feel less</li>
            <li> Because it takes fewer strokes and glides over my facial hair easily, I feel the process of shaving with this razor takes up less time than with my previous razors.</li>
            <li> Even though they are expensive and have a few cons, the resulting super-close shave is worth putting up with it, and I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet (</li>
            <li> I have to say that I generally use inexpensive store brand razors from one of the big box stores.  </li>
            <li> should also say that I generally use an electric razor during the week, and then use a traditional razor on Sundays after I&#x27;ve skipped shaving all weekend.  </li>
            <li> The lines on the razor are too straight, and the whole time while shaving it is noticable how uncomfortable of a handle it really is.</li>
            <li> I love the Fusion line &amp; will continue to purchase whatever is the least expensive Fusion available.  </li>
            <li> And when I factor in that the much cheaper Mach 3 shaves essentially as close as the other</li>
            <li> Being a regular Fusion user, I did not honestly see how a powered version of this device could make any significant difference.  </li>
            <li> It is a larger handle due to the battery inside, but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> In fact even when the blades are dull, I have kept it in my shower just to clean up my face after using a different razor my wife bought me.  </li>
            <li> I am a 33 year old life long electric razor user.  </li>
            <li> I cannot talk about length of use of the blades since I have only used it for a few days, but so far I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to me at least, the shave this gives my fairly sensitive skin and course beard definitely makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li> to me at least, the shave this gives my fairly sensitive skin and course beard definitely makes it worth the money.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be about the same as a normal Gillette razor, but it really glides over your face 10x easier than any of their other razors.</li>
            <li> first I don&#x27;t care for the waste of a battery operated razor.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you need that feel when you&#x27;re hunting for a few whiskers that escaped the first one or two passes.  </li>
            <li> my skin is ridiculously sensitive and these razors are smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind; no breakouts or red itchy bumps on my neck afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft and smooth, with no stubble left behind.</li>
            <li> Normally use a Bic disposable and never really feel I get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Usually buying a razor is one of my least favorite things to do, but not any longer!</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to shave even thick and hard beard, without any irritation.</li>
            <li> After 2 shaves, you&#x27;re paying 3 or 4 times for a shave that&#x27;s less close AND less smooth.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is very bristly and thick and the I felt like the vibration or the 4 blades made the facial shave less comfortable.</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the &#x27;pulling&#x27; of longer hairs and items that much closer on the day to day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first started shaving, I was a little taken back from the vibrations.  </li>
            <li> handle is fancy with lots of features, but its a little bit of an overkill unless you grow a lot of facial hair or if you are shaving for the first time after a week.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little hesitant about my razor actually vibrating on my face.</li>
            <li> This has been a problem for me when I&#x27;ve used other razors, which is one of the main reasons why I switched to an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been looking for a better shave lately and decided over the last four months to switch over to wet shaving with a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> I thought the feeling would pass after my first shave, but the handle just plain looks</li>
            <li> My first instinct was that vibrating a razor at my thoat was a bad idea, but it turns out that I didn&#x27;t get any more nicks or cuts with the Gillette than I did with the Schick.  </li>
            <li> Without hesitation I can say the Fusion was a much smoother and less iritating shave.</li>
            <li> Without hesitation I can say the Fusion was a much smoother and less iritating shave.  </li>
            <li> It is much wider than the typical razor and has ergonomic side grips.  </li>
            <li> After just one use I immediate realized that I was getting a much closer shave than my previous razor.</li>
            <li> only concern is the higher cost per shave that I envision, since the Pro Glide Power Blades are so much more expensive than my previous Track II blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> There appeared to be less drag, and I was able to shave quicker because I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the area again-which meant less irritation.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of shaves I actually had trouble keeping a grip of the razor.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, I am giving the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor three stars because it did do pretty well over the period of a week, but it did fall short in a few areas.  </li>
            <li> It did give a nice clean shave, but the vibration annoyed me and made it difficult to stay on track.</li>
            <li> It provided an effortless shave and left no irritation that I would usually get from the collars of my shirts after a fresh shave.  </li>
            <li> Most of the razor handles are small and narrow.  </li>
            <li> Also, rising out the razor along the way was extremely easy, no clogging up behind the blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first one that I&#x27;ve used that works well enough, even on a few days growth, to avoid it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I grow thick hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> The product advertises a precision trimmer, which is supposed to help with these areas, but I&#x27;m not sure it completely addresses the problem with maneuvering such a large cartridge.</li>
            <li> Who would&#x27;ve thought, but that little vibration helps this razor cut through my rather coarse facial hair like the proverbial hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the single AAA battery might make the blade feel a little heavy, but it was a very comfortable weight.</li>
            <li> &quot; so if you want cheap blades then expect a lousy shave with cuts and knicks..if you want an extremely close and comfortable shave with minimal effort then this is the razor for you...</li>
            <li> I am very grateful to have been included in the freebie program as I always wait for the last second to purchase my next batch of razors due to the costs.  </li>
            <li> I only had to do one pass over the bikini area which really cuts down on the rash, I appreciate that.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised by the Gillette Proglide and at first I was, but overall I would say that it would be hard for me to switch my razor to the Gillette if you are looking to save money.</li>
            <li> I packaged up the entire original package as new, including the box, original receipt, and the cheesy complaint card you are entitled to write as per their refund guidelines.</li>
            <li> As expected, this product offered the same, if not better, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> In general, my skin is a bit sensitive and my whiskers quite rough (especially the greys).</li>
            <li> Prior to this I really never put much stock into a power razor, having used Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 for a long time and being quite content with it.</li>
            <li> the blade narrower, our faces are curved, not flat pieces of paper.</li>
            <li> I normally shave my neck with a Braun electric due to issues with razor burn, but I didn&#x27;t experience any razor burn with the Fusion ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had the opportunity to learn about a Gillette program to evaluate their new razor, They sent me the Fusion ProGlide Power for a free evaluation, and was predictably skeptical.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference as to how the handle enhances my grip while shaving dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> I let it dry for couple of days and put in a fresh AA and nothing, no light on the button no movement.</li>
            <li> I let the unit dry out for 2 days and put in a fresh AA and nothing, no light on the button no movement.  </li>
            <li> Disposable razors are less expensive than cartridge systems, but I never realized they aren&#x27;t as good quality.</li>
            <li> , I grow facial hair quick and thick, and this still tears up my face.  </li>
            <li> Now I have very thick coarse hair that grows quite quickly and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> There was just too much width there to shave around tight corners in any direction without getting nicked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It received three stars due to the promises made by Gillette, and the fact there older products are just as functional as this newer, more expensive one.</li>
            <li> The only opportunity for improvement is that getting the battery in is not straight forward and the directions aren&#x27;t very clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the fact that I&#x27;m usually dealing with wet hands that could potentially slip on the handle on my razor, I felt the Proglide Power&#x27;s handle was secure the entire time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li> The next morning I pulled out  an old unused single blade disposable</li>
            <li> Having said that I still support the Gillette brand because, I think that compared to other brands that I have used in the past they are stillthe ones that I feel comfortable using on my face.</li>
            <li> generally use the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor because my face is sensitive to getting knicks and cuts from other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use the regular Gillette Fusion razors due to problems with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;ll stick with it, but it sure will be tough to leave this razor!</li>
            <li> I get such an amazingly close shave without the horrible razor burn or super sensitive skin afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The vibration of the razor tickled a little bit but it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> gives it a little added weight and makes it feel very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> After shaving, my face feels smooth, no razor bumps after shaving every day (usually if I shave with other razors daily</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t repeat what some of the other reviewers have said about how well the new Power Proglide shaves, but suffice it to say,</li>
            <li> and then I took out the new Fusion  blade on the block and shaved the other side of the face.</li>
            <li> The added battery also doesn&#x27;t add very much bulk to the product, which was another reason i&#x27;ve been hesitant to try these in the past.</li>
            <li> She buys the large 52 pack, making each razor about $0.65 - $0.75 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used those razors until the blue lubrication strip falls off, which turns out to be a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Also, the Fusion Proglide blades appear to last a little longer than the Fusion Power blades - but not by much.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would have to say that the vibrating razor might be a little too much for the every day user.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I hit the power button, but upon shaving I could actually feel the hair on my face standing up, ready to be shaved.</li>
            <li> The new Proglide version of the Fusion is considerably different than the other versions.  </li>
            <li> My skin is little extra sensitive, so i do get razor bumps near my throat, but i dont think thats because of the razor</li>
            <li> The handle was a little big as well but not so much as to make me not use it in the future.</li>
            <li> The powerful vibrations help give an extra close shave with no irritation, even when using an a dull blade, which increases the life of the blade.</li>
            <li> My beard grows thick and fast, and my skin is fairly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It does help with a thick growth, not a noticeable difference to me with an overnight&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Also if it&#x27;s not the right weight or size it can just be all around hard to shave.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have typically used a Gillette multi-blade razor and have always thought highly of the brand.</li>
            <li> This was evident from the smoothness of my skin after my shave as well as the absence of my usual shadow at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It provides the right amount of vibration during the shave to enhance the blade performance, but not so much that it makes it difficult to shave.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades are a few dollars more expensive than some other options I tried, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> All the electric razors I have had in the past have a very thick handle which makes it harder to get in certain areas of my face, this now allows me to do better triming as well.</li>
            <li> After I go a couple days without, I can usually look forward to a less than comfortable shave with some pulling and</li>
            <li> All in all though, this razor gives a very close shave and has come a long way from the previous version I owned.</li>
            <li> I also noticed there was less tug and true to its claims, does glide easier over trouble spots like under my chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype, and therefore not worth the added cost.</li>
            <li> As a man that has been shaving with a DE single blade razor for a few years I was interested in giving this item a try.  </li>
            <li> ergonomic design of the handle made it easy to grip but because of the large size of the 5-blade cartridge, I still found the product difficult to maneuver around the tight spots around the sideburns and below the nose.</li>
            <li> Scared out of my mind to put a sharp object in such a sensitive area i sucked it up and went to town.</li>
            <li> The handle itself is slightly thicker than my normal razor handle, so it felt easier to handle and control.  </li>
            <li> Much less resistance or the tugging feeling that can occur with normal razors.</li>
            <li> After one week the razor was also still very sharp and I noticed no dull feel as</li>
            <li> actually normally skipped shaving on some days with my previous razor because of the razor burn and irritation concern.  </li>
            <li> The blade, being so thin, doesn&#x27;t catch like most other blades.  </li>
            <li> Definitely going to continue using this razor as although the blades are slightly more expensive than its predecessors, they last a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> I almost always use shaving gel before and lotion after I shave, but a few times I&#x27;ve been lazy and skipped them and the razor worked fine.</li>
            <li> The handle of the blades is also a positive because I usually use razors with a plastic handle</li>
            <li> My single blade, double edged safety razor doesn&#x27;t clog, and I normally shave every other day.</li>
            <li> After using the free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette for a week, no more complaints a bed time from the little man.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating action from the battery powered handle helps make the difference between this and other non-vibrating handles.</li>
            <li> It has lasted longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about the whole battery powered handle thing, but when I tried it out, it seemed to actually help keep the shave</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s superiority in other categories far outweighs this.</li>
            <li> It has lasted longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Because of the multiple blades, it feels like a flat surface, not a knife edge.  </li>
            <li> Yes, an electric is far more expensive, but over a period of time and the convenience of using an electric, it&#x27;s not worth switching for, but that&#x27;s just me.  </li>
            <li> The vibrations make it glide better, but I usually have to go over the area a couple of times since it makes it hard to feel the razor working.  </li>
            <li> On my second look I thought  it was going to be a little chunky, but once I used it; it became very clear that that was simply a look.  </li>
            <li> I found the five-blade cartridge a little too large for shaving comfortably around the mouth and under the nose (the razor includes a \\&quot;precision trimmer\\&quot; that&#x27;s intended to solve this problem, but I found it difficult to maneuver precisely enough to achieve the desired results).  </li>
            <li> battery/vibrating aspect is still a bit mystifying to me (and potentially just added fluff), but it will be very hard for me to go back to my cheap disposables again.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with electric shavers way back when, and never used a razor of any sort for shaving, both for comfort and due to suffering lifelong high myopia that made me nervous to try a blade.</li>
            <li> When I tested this out initially, my stubble was quite a bit longer than I usually let it get, and the vibrations didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot to me in that situation.</li>
            <li> Other blades get clogged and are hard to get clean.</li>
            <li> It felt so comfortable and because I have to take so long to shave, my hand never cramped up or got tired of holding it.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t even considering waxing euphorically over common household implements, not even things that I use on a frequent basis, and I have never been known to even consider what my husband uses to shave.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders compared to other straight edge razors I&#x27;ve used (including other Gillette razors)</li>
            <li> So I really thought this was a silly gimmick when I first saw</li>
            <li> was it a much less irritating shave with more comfort and the same closeness as the fusion.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the power bit actually helps with the whole close shave thing</li>
            <li> The blades seem to stay sharp much longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It provides a clean shave without irritating your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used numerous Gillette products in the past and always find them to be of the very highest quality.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges last way long than Gilette says; I have been using the same one for the past...five or six months, I think.</li>
            <li> I tested it by shaving half with the Proglide and half with a normal Gillette razor and my wife checked to see which she liked, blind tests work great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I grow some pretty thick facial hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for something that gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li> The handle is not too large or too small.</li>
            <li> * much less painful than other shavers and therefore great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It glides very easily along my face, I don&#x27;t have a worry about cutting my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, we both recommend it hands down, and we will be tossing the old razors away for this one... and paying the extra for the refills on this one...</li>
            <li> I am generally an electric user - I last used a blade back in the days when 3 blades was considered extreme.</li>
            <li> blades themselves are super sharp, but very expensive and a pain in the butt to clean.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone who has to shave everyday as I do for work to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cheap razor but not at the high end either.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the fusion razor and was excited to see an update, unfortunately, I think these blades are inferior in every way to the regular fusion blades and are a blatant attempt to get users to buy more razors.</li>
            <li> The longer hairs on the first shave pulled a little, but compared to other razors was non-existent.  </li>
            <li> There is some heat that takes some getting used to at first, but after a while you hardly notice.  </li>
            <li> handle is similar to others, but has a few new features.</li>
            <li> However, I know it is far easier to find those items than for me to locate a conventional razor blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> major downsize of this is the price and maybe the extra power feature if you don&#x27;t have thick hair (i have very soft facial hair).</li>
            <li> With the new shaver, however, things changed and I suddenly got far fewer cute, a much less painful shave, and an even faster shave.</li>
            <li> razors give me a very close shave, with very, very little, to no irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The biggest reason for that is that with the vibration I felt less desire to push harder on my face with the blade in order to get a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ergonomic, light-weight, thin and easy to grip when wet.</li>
            <li> It is thick enough to easily grab and small enough not to be a brick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much it helps the shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it works, but it seems to make for a much smoother pull as I shave.</li>
            <li> The shave was very close, and since the head is still small</li>
            <li> I used senser excel before, and I think I am pretty late in trying this product.</li>
            <li> Too much force and a cut usually resulted.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this razor and these blades - no more 5:00 shadow either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much the power handle helped</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, as I usually use disposable razors, but Gillette has won me over by offering me a free razor through a promotional program.</li>
            <li> Usually after about a week, i really start feeling the difference in the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> The vibration isn&#x27;t really noticeable, and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s even a benefit, judging from the closeness of the shave, and the United States court system, which judged Gillettes claims about the razor to be \\&quot;unsubstantiated and innaccurate\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I know is sounds strange but the vibration of the power made it such that I couldn&#x27;t even FEEL the razor doing it&#x27;s thing.</li>
            <li> both of which I use regularly depending on how long it&#x27;s been between shaves.  </li>
            <li> The blades last a long time so</li>
            <li> How long to the batteries last (I&#x27;m guessing months/</li>
            <li> also wonder how long the battery will last.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;larger handle\\&quot; is not that big of a deal, compared to the fact that a Powered Fusion has roughly the same handle size.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that they might not last as long, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using multi-blade razors for a long time, and found that I preferred Gillette over Schick, the latter diving me a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no benefit to having the razor vibrating (and it barely vibrates anyway).  </li>
            <li> The shave is just as close as the standard Fusion Proglide I have been using for a year or so and takes just as long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the replacement blades are that costly, as long as they last 10 or 15 shaves.</li>
            <li> They long ago reached the technical apex for shaving with multi blade technology, after this it&#x27;s all sales pitch unless you hear they&#x27;ve got a laser model.</li>
            <li> They contour to your face, and they last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Another benefit is that the blade will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades seem to last as long as the Mach 3 as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades and lubricating strip do last as long as the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think in the long  run my overall shave will be closer and my face will be smoother everytime.  </li>
            <li> It uses AAA batteries and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> The rubber enhancements look strange, but only help you when maneuvering the razor around your face.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;larger handle\\&quot; is not that big of a deal, compared to the fact that a Powered Fusion has roughly the same handle size.</li>
            <li> When it comes to Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, everything else seems flat.</li>
            <li> but the blades do not seem to last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> I wonder how long the sharpness will last?</li>
            <li> They used to be all orange and no blue) for a long time and had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> I had long resisted by finally tried it.</li>
            <li> so it seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The replaceable blades seem to last as long, if not longer, than comparable-priced manual razors.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet used the product for long enough to see if the price justifies it&#x27;s useable life span, which may be longer than others.</li>
            <li> For the past few years I have gotten tired of spending way too much for a razor that would perform just slightly better than that big pack of disposables</li>
            <li> I am taking one star off my review due to the slight difficulty of shaving precision areas with the large blade head.</li>
            <li> The Fusion shaved smoothly and got all the little niches on my face (immediately under my nostrils is a hard place).  </li>
            <li> First, Gillette provides a single blade on the back of the razor that you have to flip over to use to get to those hard to reach areas, but I did prefer the feeling of four blades as compared to one from my normal everyday razor.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say its not much more different than the older Fusion.</li>
            <li> I just got a sample of this razor from Gillette and I have to say its not much more different than the older Fusion.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little chunky, not bad for me since I&#x27;m XL, but keep in mind if you have small</li>
            <li> I have a medium tough beard and after a week can absolutely tell I&#x27;m not getting as close a shave as I was with the old fusion.</li>
            <li> I only ordered it because I figured as long as I would be getting it for free, then at least if I did not like it, I could throw it away and not feel as though I had wasted any money.</li>
            <li> How long to the razors last (they&#x27;re pretty expensive, just like normal</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor was the razor that was going to tell me if I was missing out on anything over the past five years as I received the razor as a special promotion run by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> So yes, individually, the blades ARE more expensive than any other blade.</li>
            <li> The other major change is that there is a heavier lubricant strip.  </li>
            <li> I like Gillette razors, but see no major difference between the shave</li>
            <li> few weeks ago, I received an invite from a program run by Gillette to try their new Fusion Proglide Power Handle Razor.</li>
            <li> I have to say I have now found myself a new everyday razor.  </li>
            <li> And the blades last a very long time.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t worry, the regular Gillette Fusion cartridges will work with your new razor, just as well as the custom Proglide Power cartridges, in my opinion, which will save you a little dough!</li>
            <li> I feel like Gillette is in the unfortunate position of having to market this as a slight improvement on a stock Fusion rather than a new line altogether, despite the fact that it is really leaps and bounds ahead of the older model.     </li>
            <li> I have tried it with and without power and the difference is so huge I would never go back to a powerless razor.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have less skin irritation as well.</li>
            <li> A minor complaint, but something to be aware</li>
            <li> It also caused less of an irritation after shaving was complete.</li>
            <li> and I have to admit that the prospect of a \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; razor blade next to my face sounded more dangerous than appealing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach 3 Power previously and the blades had to be replaced frequently.  </li>
            <li> He said this is actually quite common and sometimes called razor bumps, but it is really ingrown</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s outrageous, but my wife does love a smooth face</li>
            <li> well I don&#x27;t know if maybe I am still skeptical and don&#x27;t want to believe it as I am trying to justify why my shave left me smooth and in one swipe.</li>
            <li> In addition, if you choose, you can turn the handle on and it vibrates to aid in a smoother and less sensitive shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I really have to say about it is that the refill blades are a bit pricey.  </li>
            <li> I obtained my razor through a free program via Gillete, and though I initially was skeptical of the power handle, I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I received the handle through a program run by Gillette a few weeks ago to review the product, and after a handful of uses, I can say with certainty that I&#x27;ll be going back to my old handle</li>
            <li> only gripe I have is; since the blade is five-blades-thick, it was a bit harder to reach the nooks and smaller areas around my lips and chin.  </li>
            <li> I handle was big &amp; &#x27;grippy&#x27; enough to handle while wet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit more difficult and rough than it should be.  </li>
            <li> My only change would to make the handle at the bottom less thick and more narrow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first time I&#x27;ve used a battery operated handle, so it was a little bit of an odd sensation against my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this with different lengths of hair from very small bristle (5 O&#x27;clock shadows) to very long borderline having to trim first (7mm hair length).</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at what a difference it made on my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I  pulled 10-15 blades across my face, but when using my standard single blade razor</li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s solution is to flip over to a single trimming blade on the back.</li>
            <li> The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think the cosmetics of either product have a positive or negative impact on their functions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m however under no obligation to post positive or negative reviews -</li>
            <li> I expected at least SOME tugging and resistance, but \\&quot;glide\\&quot; is the right word.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of a vibrating blade razor, but it really does lend itself to a super close shave.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was that it doesn&#x27;t allow for a flip type shaving (such as curving upside down around the back of my head)</li>
            <li> you can buy a pack and they will last you quite a long time before needing to purchase replacements!!</li>
            <li> With the old Sensor, we had the advantage of two blades hitting all the tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first just because I very rarely find a disposable or any razor that will cut through my thick beard.</li>
            <li> I mean, I usually use gentle straight strokes, and don&#x27;t wiggle the blade or anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although the refill blades are on the expensive side, I will also have to purchase less of them, as they last longer, and give a better shave than the generics anyway.  </li>
            <li> I actually tried shaving one side of my face with the power on, and the other - with the same cartridge, so that I was comparing apples-to-apples - with the power</li>
            <li> No particular difference in outcome, with a possible edge to the unpowered side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other similar razors (powered, multiple blades, etc), and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  </li>
            <li> This razor gave me the same shave as if I had used the ones I always do except it cost the same amount for one of these as it does for 12 of the other.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the refills faithfully and only used something different (Quattro) when I was traveling because I have a travel case for the other razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other day I went to a big-box store (sorry, Amazon)to buy more blades and saw this product.  </li>
            <li> To prove the effectiveness of the Pro Glide compared to the other razors, I temporarily went back to using the Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor because the preview set only has one usable cartridge.</li>
            <li> However, comparing this to other similar products, there was only one speed setting on this handle.</li>
            <li> I have tried various other 5 blade shavers and this tops them for various reasons.</li>
            <li> Other shavers after using them once or twice they begin to fill with hair and makes shaving much more difficult.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that is due to shaving different parts of my face in order each time and holding it differently as I go through the process?</li>
            <li> Whether that was because I didn&#x27;t press as hard on the powered side (for fear of making faceburger), or whether the vibration of the handle actually impeded the shave was unclear to me, but I don&#x27;t think that it gave me any particular</li>
            <li> Alas, this is not the case (and they seem to be of a different design than the other men&#x27;s gillette razors, so that you have to buy the special twice-the-price fusion heads?).</li>
            <li> The cartridge looks delicate, so I am choosing to prevent the blades from getting nicked by keeping it in the large packaging holder that came with it.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin, I was a little nervous.  </li>
            <li> - she did not get razor burn from a little kissy-kissy action.  </li>
            <li> It will take a little while longer to shave and some practice, but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality of shave and the lower cost.</li>
            <li> I consider these razors to be my toys as an adult; when I was little my toys were my inspiration and now as an &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; these practical gadgets are my toys.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised to find that there was little to no tugging on my face and the Fusion Proglide handled my weeks growth with ease.  </li>
            <li> I am a little hesitant putting it too far into water.</li>
            <li> At least for my particular needs, this is now my standard shaver</li>
            <li> If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I had tried power razors in the past and I did not have my hopes up too high.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, it&#x27;s hard to see what real advantage</li>
            <li> this one \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; blade is dull, the whole $3.00+ blade goes in the garbage!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a pretty heavy beard (a little boy once told me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell if anything is really being improved.  </li>
            <li> When I first received the Fusion power razor, I admit I was a little skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> It is slightly more expensive than a conventional one but</li>
            <li> are made well enough to last as long as you want to keep them....and its only necessary to replace blades as they dull and an occasional battery replacement.  </li>
            <li> I mean a HUGE difference... not just a little bit!</li>
            <li> I mean a HUGE difference... not just a little bit!</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide Power handle kind of reminds me of Terminator and Robocop all rolled into one and thus, I feel like one bad dude when I use it.  </li>
            <li> smooth feel any shave would give you, but it might become a bit expensive in the long run (depending on how often you shave).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from cheap disposable razors to expensive electric razors.  </li>
            <li> It is just too bright and annoying, and why bother?</li>
            <li> The trimming blade work out EXTREMELY FAST and the actual shave was not nearly as good as advertised</li>
            <li> I was skeptical by the marketing claims, but did receive a free razor through a Gillette program and decided to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can usually get about 5 complete head shaves (several times with the grain and against the grain) and beard shaves  with one razor before I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> It got close and lasted long without irritation.</li>
            <li> The lubricating strip was almost gone, whereas the Quattro lasts as long as I use</li>
            <li> But it was a lot of talk and no action.</li>
            <li> But after a few moments of hesitation, I tried it out, and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Being a long time Schick user, I was surprise on the quality of shave I received.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Braun electric razor user.  </li>
            <li> And the blade lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I was careful to switch it off.</li>
            <li> I also like the grips on the razor as when your hands are wet, especially in the shower, handle grips help to keep from dropping it.  </li>
            <li> Gillette has pride themselves on this feature especially when the handle is wet.</li>
            <li> I have to say they have made me a life long user with this razor.</li>
            <li> , so without a doubt, I&#x27;m going to be using this shaver for a long time.</li>
            <li> did find the vibration from the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; a bit strange.  </li>
            <li> &quot; i wait about a week so the hair would be almost too long for a hand held razor, but to my amazement it still managed to not have any tugging on the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;11/28/2012 Update: the battery ran out long ago</li>
            <li> Pricey, but lasts long time.</li>
            <li> Now they just have to make it in shades of baby blue and pink and market it to us gals.    </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have been a long time</li>
            <li> Total time for a wet shave with three passes was about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of the Gillette Manual Fusion Razor</li>
            <li> (like I did today) with a minor sandpaper face.  </li>
            <li> They have all, however, been rather minor.  </li>
            <li> The gel strip lasted longer than fusion but not as long as quattro titanium.    </li>
            <li> I will hold on to this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the handle slipping out of my hands, especially when I&#x27;m in the shower and my hands are wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the overall effect was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> my face when the hair gets too long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Norelco electric razor user(still have one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all sort of razors over the years, never really finding one that stood above the rest.  </li>
            <li> It was a strange feeling on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the Gillette Mach3 razor.</li>
            <li> The vibration from the handle definitely helps to reduce the drag or pull on the beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to using powered razors, so it felt somewhat strange to feel the vibration as I shaved</li>
            <li> It was obvious to me that Gillette spent a lot of time on the design of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this gave me the comfort of shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start my review talking about the handle.  </li>
            <li> The shave was one of the closest I&#x27;ve had in a long time - no pulling - no pain.</li>
            <li> The fact that it uses one triple A battery and still gives you the comfort of an electric with the closeness of a blade makes this a valuable product for someone like me who has been using electric razors for as long as I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected a rougher experience with the Proglide, but it definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> The rubber is essential if you use this razor in the shower, providing a no-slip grip when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> the Mach 3 has always been the razor of choice for me for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> have used multi-blade razors before and frequently I had trouble getting the stubble washed out from between the blades.</li>
            <li> I have only owned traditional razors in the past and recently received a Proglide power handle through a program run by Gillette and I am now a total fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but if it holds up I will definitely spend the extra few dollars for it next time</li>
            <li> Razor technology seems to have come a long way.</li>
            <li> This made shaving with the Gillette take twice as long as with the Schick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought that the vibration would feel strange on my face, but it actaully felt soothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have been using this razor for a long time</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same rough areas</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used disposable razors for so long, I had forgotten what a difference a substantial handle makes in the shaving process.</li>
            <li> It was this that led me to deduct a star from the rating, and if the blade had lasted long, this would no doubt be a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately in the past I&#x27;ve had razor burns, ingrown hairs, and to be honest it has been a bit embarrassing at times.</li>
            <li> With an occasional wet shave with a disposable razor, Now that I DO NOT have to shave every day to please anyone I found the electric shaver just was taking to long and not producing a satisfactory shave and</li>
            <li> This razor blade lasts me a full week of daily shaves without fail .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious how long the blade will last before I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> This gives you the closest shave you can get and the blades seem to last a long time, longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t skimp on razor blades, I use fresh, top-of-the-line blades and power-less handles, but apparently I have been buying the wrong ones.</li>
            <li> It makes playing with my baby easier, as I am not afraid of irritating her skin.</li>
            <li> This time I couldn&#x27;t even get one good shave from this crap.</li>
            <li> The product gets a 4 out of 5 due to the high price (which is not unique to this product).</li>
            <li> The vibration cuts down on friction to the face like an electric shaver and eliminates razor burn, while at the same time giving you the close shave only a manual razor can provide.</li>
            <li> I have been going around trimming my beard down and not shaving for the longest time because I dreaded using a razor, but this one may actually get me back in to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previously I had used Gillette vector plus razor, so this was a major upgrade for me.</li>
            <li> If the blade was smaller, maybe the prices of the blade refills would be less and then it would not be awkward to be paying only $1 more for the razor than</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not certain why the pulsation is necessary.</li>
            <li> The Power razor bring shaving to a whole new level with out having to spend a fortune on the expensive electric razors.</li>
            <li> Even their previous tries at sensitive skin razors don&#x27;t even come close to th eshave you get with this.  </li>
            <li> The shave is the same or inferior to the current fusion shave, and the blades wear out extremely quickly (less than 1 week of shaves) leading to nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less irritation since I have to hit the same spots multiple times.</li>
            <li> The extra blades make a difference and you feel like your getting an easier glide and closer shave with less effort although it still took me the same amount of time to shave.</li>
            <li> Similar to the Gillette Fusion, the ProGlide takes the Fusion to the next level by offering sharper blades and an updated cartridge design that provides a smoother stroke with less irritation.</li>
            <li> I found that the thinner/finer blades, combined with the larger lubricating strip, plus the micropulses provided by the Power handle definitely do seem to give me a closer shave with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the Gillette Fusion Proglide can be more expensive than comparable, I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m shaving less</li>
            <li> I know that some consider the battery operated vibration to be a mere gimmick, but having used a razor with the same capability for years I have found that my shave is always closer WITH the vibration, and I&#x27;m quick to replace the battery because of that.  </li>
            <li> I mean, it really is like the difference between a Chevette and a Cadillac.  </li>
            <li> After shaving, I must say the combination of the small blades and the newly designed microcomb helps take in an increased amount of hair with each stroke.</li>
            <li> Although I usually don&#x27;t like shaving, I gave a try to this new &#x27;power handle&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I did not incur a single cut to my skin and there was absolutely no irritation following my shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s quality seems to have slipped, as the blades do not keep their sharp edges long enough.  </li>
            <li> being said, I&#x27;m not sure how much of that was due to the handle.  </li>
            <li> The handle on the Fusion ProGlide Power is extremly bulky, much fatter than any other Gillette razor that I have ever tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first to if this vibration really did any type of benefit towards the shave.</li>
            <li> The blades are smaller and thinner than my regular non-power Fusion, and seemed to do a better job of cutting, rather than pulling, at a few days&#x27; growth.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and in the past when he rubbed his face against mine</li>
            <li> And although you get more blades, they are very thin and are literally less stable.  </li>
            <li> I moved away from razors like this due to the cost of constantly having to buy blades all the time.  </li>
            <li> The trimming blade also worked well, though I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between it and my regular Fusion, other than the thinness of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a long time user of Gillette razors, I have my opinions!</li>
            <li> The blade head is much larger than I am used to due to the 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Check it out if you&#x27;re tired of cuts, cheap plastic handles, or any of the other myriad complaints about the other brands.</li>
            <li> Personally if it cost $2.00 I would buy it other than that I will stick with buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a bunch of red bumps like I do from other razors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will ever go back to the other brand I used to use.</li>
            <li> Before I used the product I was thinking to myself that it does not look so different from the other blades that I used before</li>
            <li> There is no need to keep scraping across the same area like with my other razors.</li>
            <li> Little did my familiy know that my morning routine had become a major evaluation activity.     </li>
            <li> I was more than a little skeptical about the glorious claims, but the product was everything it was claimed to be.  </li>
            <li> To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.    </li>
            <li> As is the case with several other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Mach 3 for years.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with other razors that rip, tug and pull the hairs from my face (instead of actually shaving them)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the blade only needs 1-2 passes vs. 5+ with other disposable razors like the Gillette Custom</li>
            <li> The handle is a little bigger than my Mach 3, and since I have big hands, it made it easier to grip.</li>
            <li> I found that the lubricated strip wore out after the first use, the micropulses from the battery were weak and ineffective, and water leaked into the battery compartment causing damage to the product.</li>
            <li> Yes its a little bulky but its no big deal considering the overall performance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a lubrication strip similar to other razors to help with irritation.</li>
            <li> and I can not imagine going back to my other brand.</li>
            <li> The reason I am reluctant to get rid of the other razors I have a stick exclusively with the Fusion is simple....</li>
            <li> However, with this iteration I noticed a major change in how well it shaved and how little it irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> All the other cartridges I&#x27;ve used have left me with knicks and this feeling of stubble</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just strange to have a razor vibrate in your hand and on your face!  </li>
            <li> Quite long!  </li>
            <li> and it would grow back every day with any other razor that I have used</li>
            <li> The Micropulses only add a little bit of improvement over the regular handle.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really different than my other razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loading the battery on the unit is the same as my other model so no problems there.</li>
            <li> Also, these blades last longer than other razors.  </li>
            <li> The only thing was that the vibration from the handle made it a little trick to shave in smaller places on my face.</li>
            <li> OK, this seemed a little weird to have a razor handle that vibrates.  </li>
            <li> I think this has to do with the wide flat design of the cartridge blade.</li>
            <li> While the razor blades themselves are a tad expensive - they are well worth it!</li>
            <li> It reduces or eliminates the razor tug I got from other shavers when used daily.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the power razor might be hard to hold steady</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been careful to only rinse the razor itself, but some water inevitably runs down to the handle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery lasts a very long time, months for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AAA battery powering that handle lasts for a VERY long time...</li>
            <li> If you currently use the old Fusion then I fail to see any benefit in this new model.  </li>
            <li> That razor delivers an equally close and equally comfortable shave, and it does it at a lower cost--the replacement cartridges are less expensive, and it doesn&#x27;t require batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This is a smooth, close cutting razor that works well not only on the face but the head as well!</li>
            <li> I find myself having to thoroughly dry it</li>
            <li> Gets close dry shave.</li>
            <li> (this is not a simple circle like when screwing in a light bulb, but a slightly awkward battery compartment).</li>
            <li> Jumped in front of the mirror, pressed the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; button and began to test this vibrating handled razor dry.</li>
            <li> I came to the realization that I would have to stick to dry electric</li>
            <li> I was incredibly shocked that it actually did seem to bring the hairs on my face to the surface a bit more, and almost seemed to massage my skin as it shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But after using now for a few days, I&#x27;m definitely planning on buying a second one for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> Under running water all the trapped hairs come off almost instantly which for me is a big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now for both facial and occasional head shaving</li>
            <li> It definitely feels like you are shaving with a powerful expensive electric razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So - not only did I waste my time and an additional $12...but Gillette is wasting resources mailing this joke back to me...</li>
            <li> And if we do - they are now priced double of what they were just a few short years ago.</li>
            <li> With what I consider a medium heavy beard, I&#x27;m well into a third week on the same blades with no noticeable decrease in performance.</li>
            <li> Overall quality is not built to last for a few years.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> yet amazon still sent it to my last one which was confusing, though they fixed it outright.</li>
            <li> It gets expensive if you shave daily, but trust me, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It was not smooth it left me wanting to shave a second time.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for approximately 3 weeks and have used it several times per week, and the blades don&#x27;t seem to have dulled much at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin, a thick beard, and hair that grows in multiple directions.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and really thick facial</li>
            <li> i dint really find it that different from previous versions, it is just the same or even little less comfort than the previous versions i would sat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a single benefit from it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m spoiled with a single blade that rinses out with ease.</li>
            <li> bit the bullet and chose the single Fusion  blade and handle-</li>
            <li> After trying out the Fusion ProGlide Power, I can&#x27;t see myself going back to conventional razors.</li>
            <li> a single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten a single nick with this razor.</li>
            <li> and BAM right away It didn&#x27;t feel the usual usual feeling of shaving</li>
            <li> I found the vibration a little strange at first, but that was due to not using this type of razor in the past.</li>
            <li> This gillette razor is not unlike their other products, the feel is only slightly different from my previous fusion razor, but i think the difference here is the blades.</li>
            <li> I thought that the bigger handle might be a bit cumbersome and hard to use but, after trying this handle several times, I find that the slightly bigger size isn&#x27;t an issue one bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned, the shave you get from the cartridge razors is simply not as good as old-fashioned straight razor and safety razor shaves.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the lubristrip has started to wear out and appear white after 4 shaves, which means that I would expect that I would have to replace cartridges after ever 2-3 weeks of regular use (</li>
            <li> There are no more pulls and snags on my beard like my old razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact just like my, now, old razor.  </li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin, I usually use a Mach 3 razor.  </li>
            <li> As for the handle specifically; the \\&quot;power\\&quot; vibration seemed to be no more than a gimmick to upgrade from your old razor.  </li>
            <li> Thought I might not like the pulsing action, but had no issue with it as it isn&#x27;t excessive.  </li>
            <li> have average hands enough to just hold a basketball with one hand and slim fingers.  </li>
            <li> So while in general the feature may seem gimmicky, it&#x27;s benefits are undeniable.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I normally have to go over my face at least twice</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a small acne problem on my neck and always seem to nick my neck in a couple of places.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure it buys you much as far as a closer shave.)</li>
            <li> It has a battery in it so expect it to be larger than your average razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I do not normally use this type of razor, I cannot comment about the cost of replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> So the notion of a powered manual razor really confused me at first.</li>
            <li> Having been a long time user of Schick Hydro 5 razors, I kept seeing ads for this razor, and was curious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would still highly recommend this product to others for its unbelievably close shave!</li>
            <li> but if you knock the battery loose a bit it&#x27;ll stop vibrating.</li>
            <li> I like the flexibiliy on the head without being to loose.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the price of the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> For me, the cost weighs down the shave quality, and it is probably not something I would buy on a regular basis, but like I said, this might be what a lot of men are looking for.</li>
            <li> With the Proglide I&#x27;m tempted to give it a try but maybe later down the road</li>
            <li> Hands down the only razor I will use.</li>
            <li> the water does not fall forward but slides down to the bottom of the handle where the holder has a lip and scope that directs the water back or collects in the scoop.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have switched I will not go back to any other electric razor!</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and usually have to shave twice a day to keep my face smooth, but with the Proglide, I can shave once in the morning and my face stays clean-shaven all day.  </li>
            <li> for me the shave was not smooth at all and the vibrating is just weird , although kind of like a mini massage.&lt;br /&gt;I would not honestly say someone should pay the extra money for this.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and usually need to shave twice a day to keep a smooth face.  </li>
            <li> The second is that because this is a battery operated razor, and that battery is housed in the handle, you get that extra weight that is sorely missing from other disposables.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard; and this new blade system seems to glide almost un-noticed.</li>
            <li> Also the power button mid-handle is in an awkward spot making it easy to accidentally turn it off mid-shave while you&#x27;re maneuvering the handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to handle and isn&#x27;t awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> Once it regrew out to the usual short stubble, the micropulses actually seemed to help give me a smoother cut.</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide has a perforated zip panel on the back so that ordinary humans can actually get to the product.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t comment on how long the battery lasts as I&#x27;ve only used it a few</li>
            <li> resulting in fewer ingrown hairs (always an issue for me), less irritation, and an overall closer shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving requires less effort, and my skin seems less prone to irritation, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;The grip is a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> The one area for improvement I would would be for it to weigh a bit less, then it would be the ultimate razor.  </li>
            <li> and I suddenly noticed less pull and tug on my whiskers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;you need less work in your face for the same result that match3, I recomend 100%</li>
            <li> I cannot go back to the previous generations.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Gillette Fusion and the Shieck Titanium and the proglide out performs them by a big margin.</li>
            <li> Not likely the cost would be much less, so</li>
            <li> The five-blade head makes having to go over the same area several times a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> but you are actually getting less.</li>
            <li> Same razor and blades, 25% less....</li>
            <li> It felt same as the previous mach versions....</li>
            <li> No more cheap, flimsy poor razors for me.</li>
            <li> Overall it makes shaving an easier experience that&#x27;s less</li>
            <li> Gillette had previously sent me a standard Fusion ProGlide handle to sample</li>
            <li> a feature not present on my previous razor.</li>
            <li> Lastly, is the power feature itself, it makes the handle buzz ever so slightly in your hand, and it feels like it help to give you a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It took a lot of the \\&quot;work\\&quot; out of the shave, so there was less pulling on the hairs as the blade sliced them, which reduced the potential for razor burn.  </li>
            <li> was a bit intrigued by the addition of a battery, to vibrate the razor, with slight motion, possibly adding to it&#x27;s ability to shave even closer.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> I actually needed to break out my usual razor to trim up my goatee and sideburns, as the trimmer was just simply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used gillette razors in the past (Mach 3, fusion, fusion ProGlide, all with various brands of shave gel.</li>
            <li> I do not think I will be going back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> My only problem with it is the cost of replacement blades, pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> If the price is not much more than regular handle definitely go for it!</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I switched to Schick years ago, was simply because the razor caused less irritation on my neck than the Gillette I had been using.</li>
            <li> That, coupled with the fact that I cannot use the power feature while shaving the mustache area makes me lean toward the non-powered varieties for the future as they cost less.</li>
            <li> * \\&quot;improved blade suspension\\&quot; actually seems to restrict the swiveling movement of the cartridge a bit, compared to previous incarnations of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually stick with the standard non battery operated razor or an electric razor and alternate between both.</li>
            <li> I owned a Mach 3 razor previous to this, tried the Schick Hydro 5, and briefly used the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual, and what I came to realize, is that this razor gives me the closest shave in the easiest form.  </li>
            <li> Because of past negative experiences with electric razors I had not been tempted to try any of the battery-operated semi-power razors, but I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor for the past few weeks due to a free program from Gillette to try this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you how much I love these new blades because my wife is sick of hearing it!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure how long they last, but even if they lasted twice as long, they would still be almost three times the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having been a long time regular Proglide user I was skeptical about how much difference the power option would make, but now I am converted.</li>
            <li> i will buy these pieces of crap for the outrage of 1.00 or more per shave!</li>
            <li> have thick hair and tried my fair share of razors on the market, only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does this mean you shouldn&#x27;t pick it up when you need a new razor?</li>
            <li> To give some background, I have a tough, thick beard that grows back fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The only drawback might be it can&#x27;t get to the edge of those tight places (for me, under nostrils) because of the wider blade - for that</li>
            <li> I keep a standard 2-blade disposable close by for those really tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The action in this razor provides an extremely close shave in about half the time resulting in less irritation post shave.</li>
            <li> a few shaves longer than a standard single blade, but at what cost 10 - 20 times.</li>
            <li> There are no more red bumps, no more in grown hairs, and I feel like a new man.</li>
            <li> New blades are quite expensive, usually $3-$4 each, pretty steep</li>
            <li> only complaint is that that battery just doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> The blades last about a month , and I shave every other day on average.</li>
            <li> But they are way too wide to get at any tight spots like under your nose, upper lip, or any side-burn/mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> but it certainly does not make it any worse.  </li>
            <li> and I think it cut my shaving time down due to not having to  go back over areas ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also got this 1 little precision blade on the back to get the side burns with out trimming all your hairs off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little big, but i am comparing that to manual shavers and they dont have a battery compartment.</li>
            <li> It is definitely and upgrade from the other generic run of the mill disposable razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something about those little pulses that make it such a pleasure to shave.  </li>
            <li> and I do it as little as possible.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t feel the gratifying feeling of slicing through those coarse little hairs.</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky which to me removes some of the feed back that the blades are giving as you shave.</li>
            <li> first time I used the razor was a bit weird due to the different handle than I was used to and the vibrating feature.  </li>
            <li> but I was hoping for it to last a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide&#x27;s power button is a little larger and is illuminated when the razor is on.</li>
            <li> I found to be just a little too big.</li>
            <li> Who would have guessed that a little vibration actually gives you a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> The vibration(i believe it&#x27;s called Micro Pulses) are like a little facial and scalp(I used it to shave my head as well) massage, stimulating the hair follicles for a smoother and closer shave.</li>
            <li> it seemed that by 4 o&#x27;clock I was victim to the shadow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before using, I placed both razors on a flat surface and turned their power on, which is a slight vibration that is supposed to aid in removing hair for the areas you shave.  </li>
            <li> Little expensive, but you&#x27;ll enjoy every shaving time.</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time with shaving because of sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Although I do not have a tough beard, I do have sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> Plus, the slightly larger size of the base of the handle adds a little weight, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It appears to be the same as any other razor in this line, however once powered on, it truly glides across the beard and what typically took me 3 or 4 passes was achieved in 1.</li>
            <li> The razor head is still sharp and cutting strong.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick (coarse) facial hair, and I have used all kinds of different razors and electric razors as well.</li>
            <li> The handle did provide a nice vibration, but to be honest, it made me fearful of cutting myself due to the slight vibrations it produces.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Fusion ProGlide Power Handle Free from Gillette, I was wary of using it, only because I was afraid that it it would make it harder to shave, not knowing how much it would shake, and if it would m&#x3D;make a difference.</li>
            <li> and the blades are dirty cheap.  </li>
            <li> the most painful shaves i have had.</li>
            <li> Not sure on how long the battery will last, but it is still holding out well with 2+ weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I mean, what is a little vibration really going to do for your shave?</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think the power vibration feature added much if anything to the experience, and the vibration is really uncomfortable on my upper lip, so I end up turning it off before shaving that area.  </li>
            <li> Even when I get it wet</li>
            <li> It was just a bit slicker than I expected with water on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the proglide power through a campaign that gillette was running a few weeks ago and have been using it about every third day or so.</li>
            <li> only trouble I had was getting the cap off the bottom of the handle to pop the battery in.  </li>
            <li> When I tried it out I found that the power handle gently vibrates to help achieve a closer shave without irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;d just save a few bucks and go with the standard Fusion ProGlide -</li>
            <li> It keeps the razor from slipping and sliding while you shave as some of the disposable plasitic ones that are out</li>
            <li> On the center front of the handle, the power button is located.</li>
            <li> So I signed up and waited and after only a few days, the razor arrived.</li>
            <li> I was curious to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle.  </li>
            <li> we never really used the battery operated function though</li>
            <li> I fully expected the &#x27;power&#x27; functionality to make a negligible difference in my shave quality of comfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifelong Gillette user.</li>
            <li> It eventually died, When I opened the battery compartment, it was wet and the battery appeared to be leaking and corroding in the compartment.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say a few things about my recent experiences with the Gillett Fusion ProGlide Power handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to handle and harder to drop, even when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very close, non irritating shave.</li>
            <li> I purposely kept my hands wet</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower and the wide grip made it easier to hold and use with the water running.  </li>
            <li> Not much else&lt;br /&gt;Summary:</li>
            <li> No matter how wet it got, I never lost a grip at all.</li>
            <li> Which means i dont feel like there is a blade, they are so thin, its really glides on my face.  </li>
            <li> Probably spent thousands of dollars on these contraptions, and for what??--as</li>
            <li> people who already have a Mach 3 and didn&#x27;t care about the \\&quot;shaving process itself\\&quot;, there&#x27;s no real reason to change blades.</li>
            <li> am of Italian heritage with a heavy beard</li>
            <li> Perhaps the biggest fluff is the \\&quot;power\\&quot; feature.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say.  </li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> Though the blades are expensive, the comfort of the shave and the durability of the blade make this a well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> When I got around to changing the battery the sealed compartment was wet and the battery appeared to be leaking and corroding in the compartment.  </li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard, so others may have different experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> in all a close shave, but not much reason to pay to switch if you&#x27;re already using a Fusion handle.</li>
            <li> dont give as close shave as i expected</li>
            <li> This one is what I imagine it would be like to shave with a wet sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have never been big on a battery operated razor because I thought it was a waste.  </li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide Power Handle makes it even easier to shave while wet.  </li>
            <li> The power button is flush with the handle, making it harder to turn on accidentally.</li>
            <li> I actually thought this Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle was a gimmicky idea</li>
            <li> It was minimal, but sill the vibrations did help with</li>
            <li> I have used Gilette razors for years, but a few months ago I tried a competing brand with similar features.</li>
            <li> and this was a rough shave.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no nicks and cuts, glides like silk on my face.</li>
            <li> It also gives you a really jumpy vibration in your hand when holding it which could be irritating.</li>
            <li> Even wet there is no slippage and it feels so well balanced</li>
            <li> I never have a problem with it slipping out of my hand while shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether I would go for a manual or power blades - Lets see...there is not much of a price difference.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no difference in the shave it provided.</li>
            <li> These blades are so thin that it really feels like it is gliding on my skin.</li>
            <li> I will say I&#x27;m not really a fan of the power function but that might just be my preference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was curious to see if this razor would give a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected with a battery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit slippery when wet</li>
            <li> and it did not slip out of my hand even though it was wet.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it is a waste of a battery but</li>
            <li> An added feature is that when you are done and the unit is still wet</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s nothing worse than getting ready for a date, and showing up as if you&#x27;ve slaughtered your neck with a butcher knife.</li>
            <li> harder to find,plus the ProGlide Fusion has five blades versus the three of the MP3.I</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable reduction in the drag from the blades themselves.  </li>
            <li> and they were curious about it seeing how it felt and were looking to go out and give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Even after getting the Power Handle wet, I had no problems with this razor.  </li>
            <li> In fact I feel like it makes it harder to tell if the finer stubble has been removed because there is a lack of feedback through the handle with all the vibration and noise.  </li>
            <li> When my hand got wet those grips did their job.</li>
            <li> Minus the power feature</li>
            <li> This is a wet razor</li>
            <li> the reality is that the cost is minimal.</li>
            <li> I shave my head twice a week as I am in the military and like to do this during my shower.</li>
            <li> So, when I finished shaving and ran my hand over my face, I expected to feel a not too close shave.</li>
            <li> When the rear of the handle gets wet</li>
            <li> However, it did seem as though I had a smoother shave and absolutely no pulling and tugging with the power handle.  </li>
            <li> Even in the shower, I had no worries about it slipping out of my hand.</li>
            <li> I was always curious about the &#x27;power&#x27; handle, but thought the expense didn&#x27;t warrant trying.</li>
            <li> This was a curious thing when I saw that a battery was included.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few years I decided to come back to wet shaving</li>
            <li> One reason i&#x27;ve never used a powered handle up until now is that I wasn&#x27;t sure how annoying the vibration would get after using this handle regularly.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that needs my complete attention whenever I shave because something will get snagged.</li>
            <li> Although I am not sure why, I have noticed that the lotion strip on the blade has not faded to white as it typically does with the regular Gillette Fusion Razor blades.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;1. 5 really thin blades means it takes less swipes to get the same closeness that half a dozen (or more) swipes on my last razor failed to get.</li>
            <li> Non-powered on the right side, it was a dramatic improvement over previous multi-bladed shavers.</li>
            <li> This sucker cost me $10 shipped, and although it only includes one cartridge, it lasts me a solid 3-4 weeks, shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this razor especially for people like me who have a hard time holding the regular thin razor handles.</li>
            <li> The power part did feel a little funny at first, (after shaving my face felt a little numb, just not use to the slight vibration)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am used to using the regular plain ol jane gillete razor.</li>
            <li> This product works, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I feel that is an upgrade over the regular plain jane Gillette Fusion handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really certain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain</li>
            <li> I thought these new blades were much easier to work with, and less inconvenient, to raze through my below the neck hair.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;strip\\&quot; on them goes bad in about 2 weeks, and I don&#x27;t seem to get as close a shave as I did with the original Fusion razor, I find myself going over the same areas</li>
            <li> and I find that a shave takes just as long for maybe a slightly improved result.  </li>
            <li> I checked prices at a few stores and found that this product is comparable to other brands for similar features</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t come with a blade refill, like every other razor I&#x27;ve ever bought, so that was kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical as to how it would actually enhance the shave</li>
            <li> Months later (seriously - like 2 1/2 months later!)</li>
            <li> For my third shave I did half of my face with pulsing on and half with it off and did not notice a difference in comfort.</li>
            <li> and my suspicion was furthered by other reviews posted here, which said the proglide was not much of an improvement over the fusion.</li>
            <li> Just a feeling no real effort has been taken to reduce blade to skin friction over other products in this range.</li>
            <li> This helps balance your hand as you carefully glide over your stubble with the sharp cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a few razors in the past that are fairly similar, but I would recommend this one above them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would consider my beard full, and thick, just tough beard hair to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a highly recommended product, one that actually may make some difference in your life if shaving has been difficult for you.</li>
            <li> She has decided that generally speaking, razors made for women don&#x27;t get a close enough shave and that handles are hard to hold particularly when trying to shave difficult areas like knees and ankle areas.  </li>
            <li> For some stupid reason, the times when I need a new razor the most seem to be at the moments when I can afford it the least.</li>
            <li> It allows for a clean shave without the crazy price.</li>
            <li> The handle was awkward at first since it was larger than I was used to, but after using it a while found it to work well.  </li>
            <li> The blades also seem to last as least as long as any others I&#x27;ve used, so there is no increased cost for consumables.</li>
            <li> So I received this razor free from a promotion that Gillette is doing and of course i was skeptical because im not really sure why i need a razor with power.  </li>
            <li> I usually use an electric razor to shave off the \\&quot;steel wool\\&quot; on my face but there will be times when a wet shave is required using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> only real down side is the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He used it for a half dozen shaves, and the blade still has a little life left, which is on par with a Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gripe though is that the blades get quickly dull after a few uses and you&#x27;d either have to get a new set of razor blades, or consider buying a razor sharpener.</li>
            <li> My Mach 3 Turbo Power shave handle is getting a little long in the tooth.  </li>
            <li> I guess a little vibration goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The vibration seems to reduce the impression of pulling that I normally get when shaving my (very thick) beard.  </li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical going in, but really found that the micro pulses helped give me a closer shave without the pulling of my regular razor (which is also a gillette).</li>
            <li> With this shave there is no pulling or tugging, the blades seem so sharp they just glide over</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who wet shaves each morning knows the perils and pitfalls of the average razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp and I haven&#x27;t gotten any nicks or cuts, even working around the chin and</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li> Shaving without the handle turned is like any other shave.  </li>
            <li> It left a couple of small \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; marks on my neck.</li>
            <li> Regardless of wet or lotion hands, this handle stays put!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first..</li>
            <li> and it still seems as sharp as day 1.</li>
            <li> Will definately keep using in place of my other razor.</li>
            <li> so I never switched to any other.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not exactly sure if it is a difference maker in the overall shave.</li>
            <li> I have had problems in the past with other razors that the blade pops off in the middle of shaving or even if its dropped.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would recommend to any guy out there</li>
            <li> Power Handle itself was a scary concept at first.  </li>
            <li> How much is due to 5 blades instead of 4 and</li>
            <li> I also must add that I have never had a problem with any other razor I used in the shower.</li>
            <li> The fact that the Fusion Proglide is powered, sets this apart from other manufacturers razors.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t feel the price justifies the closeness of the shave as compared with other razors out there.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if I was going to like it, but it has turned out to be terrific.  </li>
            <li> So a couple of days went by and i had to shave again, since I couldnt find my other razor</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the Gillette power handle at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the razor before work every day for three weeks now, and I still get an extremely close shave without any &#x27;ouch&#x27; moments.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this could be related to hair type.</li>
            <li> (although I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s any proof to back that up.)</li>
            <li> With the Gilette Fusion ProGlide I have had no issues shaving every other day or even 2 days in a row.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to replace a razor handle for any reason, but I usually buy a second one</li>
            <li> I am not sure that the vibration actually improved my shave, but I&#x27;ll take their word for it that it did.  </li>
            <li> The blades are still sharp.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have problems with the tugging and tiny slices that my usual disposables cause.  </li>
            <li> Almost like they were made for each other, go figure.</li>
            <li> I know it won&#x27;t be the case for some other people but</li>
            <li> no more going over the same area two or three times because he has been lax in his shaving!</li>
            <li> but I heard that power razors stop working after while due to water penetration - while washing it up - to where the battery is placed ... if this happnes to my razor I will write another review ...</li>
            <li> The blades are still sharp and works as well as it did on day one.</li>
            <li> It left a couple of small \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; marks on my neck.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it actually helps or not though</li>
            <li> Battery on one side, unpowered on the other.</li>
            <li> Combined with the extra cost for the power blades and AAA batteries, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll make the switch permanent.</li>
            <li> First of all, yes - this is on the expensive end for a razor.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every other day</li>
            <li> Even if they have extremely small number of defects their attention to detail (like responding to my comments) is a big deal to me</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the end of the day my throat and neck area was extremely irritated and I had hundreds of ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for</li>
            <li> the extremely close shave!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus blade before having to change blades due to a dulling.  </li>
            <li> I was in Costco the other day and saw this battery power razor...</li>
            <li> I have tried other razors but nothing compares to Gillette&#x27;s Proglide.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I see no reason for the glowing button other than</li>
            <li> he wont buy any other razor on the market..</li>
            <li> That is where the similarity to other razors end.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There have been several minor design changes over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> They would stay sharp for months and wouldn&#x27;t clog if a shave gel was</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember having this issue with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other item of importance was the amount of  pressure applied to the razor during the shaving.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was time to test out other options.</li>
            <li> so I cannot comment about the battery life and other aspects of the razor.</li>
            <li> I recommend this razor to all the ladies out there that use Quattro, or any other razor for that matter.</li>
            <li> On the other side I shaved with the vibration OFF.</li>
            <li> Blades cut extremely close.  </li>
            <li> occasionally so sometimes I can get lazy about shaving.  </li>
            <li> I shave every day, both my face and head and insist on an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> The handle vibrates when you press the button, and it doesn&#x27;t slip due to the grippy design.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about a vibrating razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been lazy about shaving my head, so I had about ten days of growth going on.  </li>
            <li> When I had used the Gillette Fusion Power, I had noticed damage to the battery compartment due to water leakage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the razor under multiple conditions over the past three weeks: 1 day shave, 3 day shave, and 1 week shave.</li>
            <li> Other sites explained that there is a difference between the quality of blades used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this product at first</li>
            <li> I was of the opinion that mechanized handles, such as the electronic toothbrushes, were for the lazy ones among us.</li>
            <li> One other point, without the battery in Power Glide system, it would be too light.&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li> This razor is designed extremely well</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even bothered to try other brands on the market.</li>
            <li> While this did the job, I&#x27;m not really sure the power bit is needed actually.</li>
            <li> Still not sure my overall opinion on this one.</li>
            <li> this blows away any other razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away all my other razors.</li>
            <li> I can shave every day with no pain and the skin on my underarms is a lot lighter than when I would shave with any other razor.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The vibrations also seemed to reduce the tugging and pulling during my shave, but that may have been due to the blades.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same Mach 3 handle for the past 14 years</li>
            <li> Some days I feel like it does provide a smoother shave, and other days I don&#x27;t notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I then turn off the handle and used it that way on the other side of my face.</li>
            <li> It seemed to do a worse job on my face than my normal Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> then other razors I have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The five blades did not nick my face as often as the Quattro or any other four bladed razor</li>
            <li> I used it for a week with it turned on on one side of my face and not turned on on the other side</li>
            <li> and my other one has the thumb grip</li>
            <li> The blades on this are staying sharp with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> The Proglide razor head has stayed sharp all month and it just glides.</li>
            <li> other razors I have used.  </li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed - I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will never change to any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, it delivers an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t twist when you shave like some other models I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handle with some rubberized grips just like other razors.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first about the power feature of the razor</li>
            <li> It felt like any other five bladed razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving with the vibrating head has made my face feel smoother and for longetr than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I would have to point out that due to the vibrations of the power handle</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fall out of your hand as easily as other razors do.</li>
            <li> The grips on the razor are helpful and allow for precision shaving with no worry of dropping or fumbling around with the sharp blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attempted using other razors, but they don&#x27;t provide the shave that this razor does.  </li>
            <li> the other features (Lubrastrip, Blade stabilizer) work well.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Power handle makes the 5 Blade cartridge shave closer and smoother than any other razor I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just got this the other day through a Gillette sponsored trial.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> for the handle itself, it has a sharp appearance and I like how it has a substantial size to it.</li>
            <li> found the trimmer on the other side of the razor to be helpful.</li>
            <li> hadle isn&#x27;t as fat as other  power razors  </li>
            <li> The handle is also thinker and easier to grasp due to the rubber sides.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the small investment in upgrading from a manual razor to a Gillette Proglide Power razor.  </li>
            <li> ) use the razor as instructed with long firm strokes</li>
            <li> other shave you have had.</li>
            <li> Use the other side for close trimming of the beard and moustache.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> First of let me say I have been really skeptical as to why my razor needs to vibrate.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been using the manual Fusion blades (or some other brand), get this now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried electric razors in the past, but they never shaved quite close enough.  </li>
            <li> The blades were sharp and I did not notice any decline throughout the weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have see other brands over the ears but his Gillette razor is performs for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t pay for this, I decided to look up the price vs. other razors.</li>
            <li> with almost every other razor I have used</li>
            <li> I usually need to use 2 per week, but this can obviously vary by person.</li>
            <li> but I knocked it down to a 4 due to the power not really providing anything.</li>
            <li> although I cut myself much less than previous shavers, I still minorly cut myself in 1 or 2 places</li>
            <li> One down side is on occasion I would just wet shave without any shaving gel</li>
            <li> I have a crappy beard pattern so as a result, for years, I&#x27;ve been a daily shaver, since my hidden beard and a full beard look really bad.</li>
            <li> The vibration quickly became annoying in my hand, almost to the point of becoming uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was very curious as to the \\&quot;power\\&quot; portion of the razor.  </li>
            <li> As someone with very thick and coarse facial hair I was a fan of the fusion and the ProGlide with power option has been even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hi, I received this razor for Christmas and was shocked at how easy the shave went.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this razor after on a three day growth after a long weekend and it treated it like it was nothing, cutting effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> The motion does help reduce drag and allow the razor to glide across my face with less resistance.  </li>
            <li> This shaves super close without cutting or razor burn.</li>
            <li> Did one half of my face with it on and one with it off, no real difference.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the minimal vibration, but then again who wants something with blades shaking on their face.  </li>
            <li> could a razor with a vibrating handle work better than the boring old razor Ive been using for years.\\</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle system allowed me to shave without any irritation, anyone with sensitive skin knows that using an uncomfortable razor can ruin your entire experience with the product and brand all together.</li>
            <li> The only cons with the razor are that the vibration from the razor takes a little getting used to and can be awkward in your hand at first, and I would prefer it be rechargeable instead of requiring a AAA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One drawback I did find about this handle was it felt a little bit lighter than previous models I have used; some people may like this lightweight feel, while I personally like a razor that feels a little heavier in my hand.</li>
            <li> With the 1 day shave, where I had limited hair regrowth, I did experience a few nicks below the nose</li>
            <li> , seems to really make a difference in getting the pesky hair facing the wrong direction otherwise pretty difficult to snag.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as regular shavers and the replacement blades are very expensive compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I wound up giving the handle to my brother, he may use it at some point, but overall I can&#x27;t recommend this razor to anyone and have a hard time bringing it up other than to wonder why the heck it exists.</li>
            <li> I have a mustache and shaving close to the mustache is rather hard due to larger razor head.  </li>
            <li> gimmicky, bulky, and overpriced nightmare fails to last any longer than a simple Sensor twin blade - here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;The 5 blades here work well for the open expanse areas of the face...</li>
            <li> The blades seem to last a while, at least 3-4 weeks shaving every other day or so.</li>
            <li> My sink cannot handle wads of hair (nor should any other household bathroom sink), but water is the only way to wash these suckers of the hair stubble, but it also washes away some of the lotion attached (depends which cartridges you get).  </li>
            <li> While I was skeptical of having the movement on the razor, I found it to be almost massage like and certainly gave a close shave without leaving bumps or nicks.  </li>
            <li> With the power on the blades seemed to glide through the stubble effortlessly and with the power off there seemed to be a little drag across the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, the handle on my razor was a bit too skinny, and with wet hands, I fumbled with it a little bit.  </li>
            <li> The rubber pieces on the handle are a little slippery for wet hands.  </li>
            <li> it is a little harder to handle</li>
            <li> Having attempted this and failing miserably with the Quattro, I was amazed that the blades rinsed clean without any real effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it has less tug, less drag than the fusion.      </li>
            <li> I found the extreme swivel of the cartridge placed the handle at an odd position and sometimes close to 90 degrees to the shaving cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Finished shaving in less time and with a smoother closer shave than using other razors.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the thinner blades that seem to offer much less resistance both against the grain as well as with it, or one of the other features.</li>
            <li> I gave slight nod to the proglide due to the improved comfort strip</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the blade dull enough yet</li>
            <li> That means that you&#x27;re essentially holding this hard, slippery pencil in your hands.  </li>
            <li> but it is hard to sculpt as the head is much bigger than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Razor burn is often caused by improper facial lubrication and dull blades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades on my Arc 5 were finally starting to pull hairs from being dull and I didn&#x27;t have the $60 to replace them at the time, so I ordered one of these on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> but i believe this design will last forever or until gillette finds a way to improve it which will be hard to do.</li>
            <li> Because the blade cartridge is so mobile (flimsy), I had a hard time edging and trimming especially with the vibration.  </li>
            <li> The precision trimmer is definitely helpful in getting to the hard to get area of under the nose and for straightening out the sideburns.</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed was that the blades seemed to go dull quicker that I would have thought.</li>
            <li> I had a little drag where my facial hair was thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of razors because I had pretty bad acne when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> I was also shocked with how light the device is.</li>
            <li> I was truly shocked at how light handle itself is compared to I have been using which is the ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cost for replacement blade is the only negative I would have to say about the proglide.</li>
            <li> (UPDATE - well I mailed back my Proglide to Gillette to least take advantage of their \\&quot;Money-back</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I myself have not experimented much with the competition because of hit &amp; miss availability.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I myself have not experimented much with the competition because of hit &amp; miss availability.</li>
            <li> All of the above are secondary to the \\&quot;Yes,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth it</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> My brother tried it and had the same problem in his words the razor sucks.</li>
            <li> Yes, the blades are expensive but you really do \\&quot;Get</li>
            <li> The power feature helps on awkward places like above your lip where the razor may normally irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same razor for at least, 15 times.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same razor for at least, 15 times.</li>
            <li> The only negative for this razor is the price.   </li>
            <li> It is also longer than your average razor handle.  </li>
            <li> My grooming needs are minimal, having a short beard and doing no grooming below the neck, so I was skeptical if the Razor would provide any benefits over my current razor.</li>
            <li> But personally I am always running late</li>
            <li> which is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> It stays put too, no more slipping, or death grips to keep it from slipping.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the vibrating head adding much to a shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ll use it, and</li>
            <li> My last electric razor was one of those rechargeable rotary blade things, I never liked it.  </li>
            <li> Given the quick-growing, thick facial hair, I can be standing there shaving for 20 minutes, at times.  </li>
            <li> I seldom shave because my facial hair grows slowly</li>
            <li> /&gt;comfortable to hold and provides a closer shave without irritating my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but the power part of it was more annoying and a distraction.</li>
            <li> So now, not only are we being forced to fork over $3.00+ per blade...</li>
            <li> I was so amazed i was going slow and seeing how well this razor actually worked.</li>
            <li> As a Military member we have to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Like most men I hate shaving</li>
            <li> More than anything it becomes an annoying feature.</li>
            <li> So what I did was use the vibration on half my face and not use it on the other half.  </li>
            <li> I did an experiment where I shaved half my face with the power on and the other half with the power off.  </li>
            <li> I would really like the cartridge to last at least month and am disappointed that it has shown signs of wear after only limited use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to having to dip my razor in the water, tap it hard on the back, or some other way to unclog the blades after every few strokes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to having to dip my razor in the water, tap it hard on the back, or some other way to unclog the blades after every few strokes.</li>
            <li> I used to get at least 11-12, and on the 13th shave the blades would begin to slightly snag and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my only slight complaint is that the on/off button is in a place where I sometimes hold the razor, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were always slippery and the power buttons seemed to be in a position that allowed the razor to be turned off when I did not intend to power down.</li>
            <li> I use a pair of electric clippers to trim my beard down to \\&quot;shaveable\\&quot; levels and then have at it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Speaking of the shave it was hands down the closest, smoothest, shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> It may come down to whether you like the vibration.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just that the blades grab my beard so thoroughly that it slows me down, allowing the vibrating motor to do its work.  </li>
            <li> But, the power option allows the Gillette to just glide through even my stubs, and the oscillation lets me let the razor do the work of chopping down the thicker hairs that caused clogging and pulling of the FaceBlade.</li>
            <li> But nope, not even showing signs of slowing down yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just glides down my legs</li>
            <li> Hands down the smoothest shave ever</li>
            <li> Like the gods sat down and crafted this just for me to hold.</li>
            <li> I shaved one side of my face with the vibration ON, and it was almost effortless to glide down my face.</li>
            <li> and I think it help cut down on the irritation.  </li>
            <li> This was hands down the easiest razor product I have ever opened.</li>
            <li> it had never let me or my beard down.</li>
            <li> And I mean CLOSE (like close enough for the wife to comment on it).  </li>
            <li> I wont buy any other razor I SWEAR!</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razors for 4 years now and won&#x27;t use any other razor ever again!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I will never try any other razor!</li>
            <li> The multiple blades and conditioning strip mean there&#x27;s no razor burn afterwards.</li>
            <li> However trying to navigate it around your neck felt awkward, like you couldn&#x27;t get the right amount of pressure on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first, I was a bit leery of the \\&quot;power\\&quot; function because I was afraid to cut myself due to the vibrating mechanism.  </li>
            <li> As I shave in the shower, this is a usual concern as I hate cutting my head :) also as it is prior to really waking</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would pay the extra money for this product, but it may help for those with tough facial hair.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a fine razor, but the cost of blades and all of the unnecessary bells and whistles make it seem a bit silly to me.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a fine razor, but the cost of blades and all of the unnecessary bells and whistles make it seem a bit silly to me.</li>
            <li> I also feel those who shave there pubic areas, this blade will be a extra plus because of extra thin blades and very little space between each blade, less chances of cuts.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, but it is expensive!  </li>
            <li> Contrary to what a few of the other reviewers said, I feel that the vibration materially improves the feel of the shave-</li>
            <li> Not only is it no better than the non-powered model, it actually seems slightly worse.</li>
            <li> The whole vibrating thing is a little weird but works.</li>
            <li> and by the way... I have a very sharply trimmed goatee.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, but it is expensive!</li>
            <li> One thing that was slightly odd to me was that it felt a bit slippery when it got a lot of water on it.  </li>
            <li> Still has all the comfort and control as the heavier ones but at a weight of significantly less.</li>
            <li> The vibrating feature of the handle took some getting used to, as it tends to make my hand feel odd.</li>
            <li> The power in the handle creates a slight vibration while shaving and seems to help glide the razor over the beard and face.</li>
            <li> and I also find I have no irritation in areas that I previously did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I believe that having it on made a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> I am typically an electric razor user.</li>
            <li> I had less irritation with the ProGlide than the electric.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the Schick 5 blade I got on sale from the store (8 razors for $10 bucks).  </li>
            <li> , however the power was a lot less than I had imagined.</li>
            <li> The only downfall I found was the trim blade on the back is useless.</li>
            <li> I get much less tug and pull with this razor</li>
            <li> Like my previous Gillette razors, it worked well and did the trick.</li>
            <li> (I used a mach 3 razor previously) and the time it took to shave was reduced dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The slight vibration was not at all distracting, and made the blade glide to the point that you don&#x27;t even feel the blades cut.</li>
            <li> I typically use a double-edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> That, and it does it in half the time.</li>
            <li> but the comfort and ease makes shaving less of a</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using anything with less than 5 blades, give it a try.</li>
            <li> and being half price doest hurt either.</li>
            <li> Less pulling than the Mach 3.  3.</li>
            <li> He did the typical half-the-face test where he shaved each half with one of the razors.</li>
            <li> I find myself waiting until I get to work to shave to have less irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched to the regular Fusion blades (they are expensive enough) rather than the Pro blades.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t detect a noticeable difference between the Fusion Proglide version and the previous generation Fusion.</li>
            <li> I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream]] and a badger bristle brush.    </li>
            <li> The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.    </li>
            <li> 20 odd years ago I do not believe I would have made the switch to Electric.</li>
            <li> had another Gillette power handle previously.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fusion Proglide Power razor, and anticipated a slight improvement in comfort and shave closeness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The slight vibration makes is glide over your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this product, it took me less than 5 minutes, and got a closer shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After giving the Fusion ProGlide Power a shot, I&#x27;m sold and have made the switch from my previous razor (Mach 3).  </li>
            <li> then I tried the power, I found I needed less pressure with the power.&lt;br /&gt;The handle</li>
            <li> but it made it odd to feel in my hand at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice less irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> This razor is typical Gillette quality.</li>
            <li> With the typical disposable or cartridge razors I always have problems with them getting clogged.  </li>
            <li> I used the vibrating feature for maybe half of my shave, then had to finish with</li>
            <li> And definitely, less sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I will not be returning to my previous razor.  </li>
            <li> I shave in the shower typically</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the razor burn that always seemed to accompany me with my previous shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did half my face with the vibration on and half with it off.  </li>
            <li> This was meant to simulate the typical amount of time that a Grizzly Adams Man lets his beard \\&quot;go\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s use of 4 blades, and the thinnest used to date , that aid in less irritation, and a closer shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the previous version of this razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved half of my face with the power on and half with the power off.  </li>
            <li> It says that it make the shave less abrasive</li>
            <li> I typically get razor burn after I shave and after using this razor, I have zero.  </li>
            <li> Slight things i would improve and this Razor hits those improvments.</li>
            <li> The Fusion boasts 5 blades, and they tout them as being narrower than others, with a coating designed to cause less \\&quot;tug and pull\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have previously used the Gillette Fusion Manual razor and though I was suspect, I did notice a difference when using the power model.</li>
            <li> I was a fairly skeptical of the &#x27;power&#x27; aspect of this razor, thinking the vibration was more of a gimmick than anything else, but turns out I was wrong.</li>
            <li> There is way less \\&quot;tug and pull\\&quot; with this razor.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot less effort to shave my face now compared to the disposable razor I was using before I got my Fusion ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has eliminated the razor burn and irritation I have had with my previous blade.  </li>
            <li> &quot; - buying anything that had a 1 plus on the previous number, which has been stuck at 5 for a while now.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a substantial improvement over the thinner handles as there is less slippage in the shower.</li>
            <li> Not everyone will experience the odd discomfort</li>
            <li> * closer shave than previous Fusion models</li>
            <li> half asleep</li>
            <li> I did notice less irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> I typically get less than a week or so from a battery.  </li>
            <li> This makes the pulling of my face noticably less.</li>
            <li> It is a weird concept and I am not really a fan and will stick to my old way of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this razor after previously using a competing men&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly heavier than an all plastic handle</li>
            <li> While I do not believe it produced a closer or smoother shave than the un-powered fusion, it did seem to leave my face less irritated.</li>
            <li> Mainly the perception that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Also, I use that finger to add a little leverage/pressure as I shave down my face.  </li>
            <li> The non-slip rubber surfaces allow for usage in the shower with very little risk of the razor slipping, even when your hands are covered in lather.</li>
            <li> The reason for this, in my opinion, is that the vibration from the razor slightly desensitizes your skin while you shave and adjusts for any small inconsistencies in the contact between your face and the razor as the blade moves along your skin, which would otherwise result in a knick.  </li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> It gets wet, it doesn&#x27;t get slick.  </li>
            <li> Lots of times in the past, my razor would slip from being wet, since I would have to rinse the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers in the past and they would heat up making you shave faster and leaving a rough feel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor complaint</li>
            <li> I had to buy a replacement razor because I left the other one behind while traveling -</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I could possibly come up with is that the shave is so close I actually got a pretty nasty ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> here!&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges are very expensive, but worth every penny, since one blade lasts me about 5 shavings.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the previous generations of Gillette disposables, this razor does not \\&quot;drag\\&quot; and pull hairs that may be a little longer.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the battery power in a manual razor I shaved half my face with the power on and the other half with the power</li>
            <li> the razor seemed to get bogged down a lot.  </li>
            <li> and I have a hard time holding on to them resulting in several cuts and multiple times of trying to hold on to this skinny handle only for it to end up cutting my face and falling to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even in the tight places.</li>
            <li> Any difficulties maneuvering around the tight spots can be corrected with practice.</li>
            <li> I trust that this is really tight and genius to help make the product waterproof.</li>
            <li> The battery area seems to be water tight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downside - I still have an issue with the tight areas under my nose and around my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> It does have a precision trimmer, but the size of the head just makes it too unwieldy to get into those tight places.  </li>
            <li> I have tried--and rejected--several different Schick razors over the years simply because they were uncomfortable and left me feeling as though I had just shaved with broken glass using battery acid for shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Being a female, I have very thick, dark, stubborn hair</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if I will continue with the power razor when the one single blade I got gets dull.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when this new Fusion ProGlide came out.  </li>
            <li> Im usually skeptical about buying \\&quot;the new razor\\&quot;</li>
            <li> less waste.    </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and usually have poor experiences while shaving.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the power handle, though I&#x27;m still not sure if it really makes a difference or is merely a placebo effect.</li>
            <li> I tend to shy away from new products as my neck is very sensitive and will get a rash if I use the wrong razor.  </li>
            <li> when I saw that Gillette had a new Fusion Proglide Power razor, I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> I did like the handle enough to decide to get refills, but when I saw the cost of the refills I decided that I didn&#x27;t like it enough to pay the prices they wanted for them, think at least twice as expensive as other refill blades.</li>
            <li> I borrowed my brother-in-law&#x27;s once and on a brand new blade, got a MUCH worse shave than I did using my 1 month old--not to mention rather dull and oft-used Gillette Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> The vibration makes this Fusion feel a little like an electric razor -- or how I remember an electric razor feeling, because I haven&#x27;t used one in years.</li>
            <li> I have used it a minimum of 5 times and I&#x27;ve never gotten any cuts (unlike some other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past).</li>
            <li> It might be the little kid in me, but that blew my mind.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to try this product because it seemed to be a bunch of hype.</li>
            <li> I usually shave every other day and also tend to get an irritation on my neck in one spot repeatedly.</li>
            <li> and I did notice that it helped my shave just a little bit.</li>
            <li> Sometimes had to press a little firmer to get those stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I think it might be a little too fancy for my liking.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a little bit thicker, so it makes it easier to grip.</li>
            <li> so it vibrates a little when you shave.  </li>
            <li> It has a little heft, so to speak.    </li>
            <li> If i would have went a little faster probably like 3-4 min.</li>
            <li> They have innovated the smoothest shave ever, by giving up a little closeness.  </li>
            <li> The little trimmer blade works well.   </li>
            <li> Sometimes we need a little luxury in life.</li>
            <li> Too little force and hair  was not shaved off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the difference one little battery could make.  </li>
            <li> It was like a little neck message every morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a little over three weeks now</li>
            <li> \\&quot;What&#x27;s a little vibration going to do,\\</li>
            <li> I could never get a close shave with an electric razor - always a little stubble (or the 5:00 shadow appeared at 11am).</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little apprehensive about using a razor that vibrates.</li>
            <li> so I was a little concerned about it having a battery</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to, as I forgot to turn it</li>
            <li> In short: this razor is pretty terrible, clogging all the time and just giving an overall unsatisfactory shave.  </li>
            <li> It gives little pulses that help the blades massage my skin.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I get little nicks, but I didn&#x27;t with the power</li>
            <li> The blade gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years, with little to no nicks.</li>
            <li> I never worry about knicking myself like I do with other razors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The razor is a little noisy when turned on</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a little slower, but this could have been the battery that was included with the razor.</li>
            <li> :  The battery adds a little, but I like the weight and feel of the handle in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I notice that it&#x27;s a little slippery.  </li>
            <li> The vibration makes this Fusion feel a little like an electric razor -- or how I remember an electric razor feeling, because I haven&#x27;t used one in years.</li>
            <li> And now that I noticed that you can save a little bit on replacement cartridges with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe an Save program, I have to make the switch.  </li>
            <li> and I think it makes the shaving go a little faster.  </li>
            <li> It can feel a little plasticky at times, but over all it handles well.</li>
            <li> It seems to help cut my beard easier when it has grown a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I decided that I would do a little experiment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricey end, with the replacement blades also not being any cheaper, but</li>
            <li> I waited a little longer to shave to see how this razor would perform.</li>
            <li> think by reducing the manufacturing costs they could make the blades a little cheaper...</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle and Razor for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I opened the brown box that it came in, and saw that it was enclosed in the Adult-Proof plastic that is near impossible to open.</li>
            <li> I have baby skin, seems like all other razors would cut my skin up pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The five blades are extremely sharp, with virtually no tugging, even after missing shave day for the past week.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it was hard to do anything like trim a smart goatee or sideburns, not to mention the heads would wear out periodically, and were expensive to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sounded a little gimmicky - a vibrating handle?  </li>
            <li> just feels a little gimmicky to me.</li>
            <li> I think that it comes as a little too gimmicky for me.  </li>
            <li> gave this razor the tough test, plowing through coarse, three day growth.  </li>
            <li> This one beats out all others hands down!</li>
            <li> I only used it once through a very thick 4 day beard</li>
            <li> Some razor handles are hard to control and feel like they are slipping out of your control,</li>
            <li> Oh and the power feature, just makes it harder to feel if you are pushing too hard</li>
            <li> I really could tell no difference when it was on verses off as to it&#x27;s smoothness or cutting ability.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even worse and more painful.</li>
            <li> The Power razor simply massages your face; though, I do not believe that it actually helps with cutting the stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t improve the shave, if anything it made it more difficult as well as making my hand go numb.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing, didn&#x27;t seem to shave very well, but kudos on building up the brand.</li>
            <li> Recently, I received that newest Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ProGlide because of the five blade system used for cutting facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> the battery ran out and it felt like I was missing something while finishing the shave.  </li>
            <li> And in recent years Gillette has been a game changer in shaving comfort.</li>
            <li> but, after a few strokes it was no problem.</li>
            <li> wanted to use this handle for a few weeks before writing a review.  </li>
            <li> This razor is going to replace my vibrating three blade razor that everyone seemed to use a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> For a few years now I have been using the fusion proglide razors.  </li>
            <li> I got the fusion Powerglide through a program that Gillette was running and it has replaced my proglide for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating function and improved blades allow me to get a close shave on my head without making repeated passes on the contour areas (2 passes on those trouble areas may be needed).</li>
            <li> Just a waste of battery power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Felt some tug on my skin during the shave and had to use a few strokes over each area to get all the hairs cut.</li>
            <li> I often times have to work my schedule of shaving based on when I can let my neck heal for a few days before having to shave again.</li>
            <li> The razor cuts through, even a few days of neglected shaving.</li>
            <li> By bed, I have a few in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the vibrations because it maes me feel like I could be missing a spot when I shave.</li>
            <li> I had been using Gillette Mach-III till yesterday because proglide was not available in india.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but it just seems like it never clogs, even with some heavy growth to mow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but it just seems like it never clogs, even with some heavy growth to mow.</li>
            <li> Even after a few days of growth these razors cut through the hair with ease without pulling.</li>
            <li> For the quality of the shave you get, the cost of replacement cartridges is not justified.  </li>
            <li> it took me a few trials before I got it.  </li>
            <li> I been using it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> To the couple of reviewers that say they couldn&#x27;t tell the difference, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re either shaving wrong or do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what a lot of the reviewers are missing.</li>
            <li> But the difference I believe is too small to discern for an average user.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I was very skeptical about the Proglide, as opposed to my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; fusion.</li>
            <li> I need to shave everyday because I am in the Army</li>
            <li> I start to see red bumps all over my neck and worse</li>
            <li> in all, however, I will still keep this Fusion on hand for the comfort a Gillette shave provides, and will turn the vibration on to keep my skin massaged, and off when I end up missing some spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I have a rather heavy beard and shave every day, and would get 7 days out of each Atra</li>
            <li> This battery operated &#x27;thing&#x27; is a waste.  </li>
            <li> Save a few bucks and get the razor without a battery.</li>
            <li> The lubrastrip is STILL green.</li>
            <li> The lubrastrip is STILL green.</li>
            <li> I plan on shaving everyday</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve waited a few days before using, the Proglide is a dream.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ve noticed that if I shave two days in a row my skin gets irritated and the shave is nowhere near as close.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a Gilette Sensor razor everyday.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times, and I like it:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Gillette Fusion ProGlide for a few weeks now and these blades are everything they&#x27;re advertised to be.</li>
            <li> as any scientist would do, I waited a few days and decided to turn off the power and shave.</li>
            <li> The electric razor doesn&#x27;t handle the few days of growth.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> but after a few uses I got used to the weight</li>
            <li> If I went for a few days between shaves and used the Proglide the hairs would get caught in between the blades and it would be a pain to get them out.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to check and see if I was missing anything.  </li>
            <li> The razor is heavy.  </li>
            <li> Since I shave everyday for my job, I need a razor that won&#x27;t give me razor burn and destroy my face.  </li>
            <li> I let my stubble grow out for a few days to see if I could notice a difference</li>
            <li> I have a few opinions that I&#x27;d like to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks.  </li>
            <li> and it seems a bit gimmicky</li>
            <li> I have trouble not tearing my face off when getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> I tested it out after not shaving for a few days and the vibration mechanism helped to get a smoother, closer shave then</li>
            <li> The MACH3&#x27;s three-blade configuration was thin enough that I had some maneuvering room when shaving around the lip and chin area.  </li>
            <li> also noticed its a bit of an attention getter in the bathroom, when a few friends were hanging out the color popped of it</li>
            <li> I thought the \\&quot;power\\&quot; was going to be gimmicky, so I tried without the power on</li>
            <li> it would turn on and by the time I got where I was going the battery was dead.</li>
            <li> You put a few batteries inside and then twist it to close it.</li>
            <li> It seems gimmicky to me.</li>
            <li> Call me a luddite, but I don&#x27;t need gimmicky tech in a razor.</li>
            <li> now look forward to shaving everyday and will recommend this product to all the men I know.</li>
            <li> Even after I have not shaved for a few days.  </li>
            <li> so it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> It just seemed like a waste.</li>
            <li> used the razor everyday for one week.</li>
            <li> If you find the Proglide Power Razor too fat and difficult to shave with, then try the Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or bulky.  </li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be missing that</li>
            <li> I shaved everyday with the razor.  </li>
            <li> I did decide to shave my face a few times</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any hygienic task worse than shaving, I&#x27;ve yet to find it, so anything that makes it easier is well worth the added expensive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the few instances in which I have had to use plastic razors I have found them to be poor and require me to go over the same spots, causing a rash or shaving burn.</li>
            <li> The button to turn on the power switch is a little hard to press on/off due to</li>
            <li> The vibration thing is neutral, not really positive or negative, I noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical at how well it would work because the shell of the razor didn&#x27;t seem very thick</li>
            <li> The vibrations help mow down thick beard hairs, and the 5 blades uses less strokes than my 3 blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if your looking for a slightly closer shave and without the tug and pull from your ordinary razor.</li>
            <li> but no better then my previous fusion razor.</li>
            <li> Blister packs are HORRIBLY difficult to open, and often result in sharp lacerating edges.</li>
            <li> After that, they do begin to noticeably dull (although as I said, this may be due to my beard texture and shaving needs).</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide replaces the Fusion&#x27;s dull blades with sharp blades that don&#x27;t tug or pull on my skin, they just glide through and cut as they&#x27;re supposed to.  </li>
            <li> A lot of times with other razors, I catch myself pressing way too hard on my face as I use it but the Power ProGlide doesn&#x27;t make me do it.  </li>
            <li> They have a flat spot just behind the head to put my fingers and keep everything in line.  </li>
            <li> The handle however is very slick when wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster, it&#x27;s smoother, it&#x27;s just plain</li>
            <li> Power handle has plain plastic where I place my index finger when holding the razor for a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Other electric razors and trimmers usually have had moments of painful pinching of the hairs, but after several uses, I have not had any such issues with this product.  </li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re very careful, water will slowly leak into the battery compartment and corrode it, making it unreliable in the long-run if you plan to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> It seemed to make my skin raw and gave me an uneven shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER cut myself using this blade, because with the vibration turned on, it&#x27;s pretty much impossible for me to press down too hard.</li>
            <li> But here is where this entire concept fails: now we are down to the use &amp; life of just this one blade!&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> Yes, I still had a little razor burn, but NOTHING compared to the usual.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It provides me real razor blades with vibration for a less painful shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt far less worried about cutting my face since I always shave in the shower without a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like the price of the blade and refills to be less expensive however, after trying this and using it several times</li>
            <li> The grip on it made it near impossible to drop even when wet.</li>
            <li> I had a slight concern about the battery and the handle getting wet, but that turned out to be false.</li>
            <li> The ProGlide is the first razor system that I&#x27;ve used that has not torn up, or badly irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> The only real negative about the ProGlide razor is my son kept stealing mine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with this razor for the past few days.  </li>
            <li> Then I switched to an electric shaver and used it everyday for about the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> biggest thing I have to mention is going in to this, I have always been very skeptical of the whole \\&quot;power vibration lifts the hair for an easier shave\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Struggled with heavy two-day beard&lt;br /&gt;Refills a bit pricier than my usual Schick razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my razor almost every day for the past few weeks and still haven&#x27;t had to change the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my razor almost every day for the past few weeks and still haven&#x27;t had to change the battery.</li>
            <li> Although the blades are expensive, I have a hard time going back to my other 5 blade razor.  </li>
            <li> bad: my beard tends to be on the rough side, and with everyday shaving, I find that an average blade only has a 4-5 day optimal sharpness.  </li>
            <li> in all, if I needed a razor, and I couldn&#x27;t get my regular Schick, I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad in buying a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, but it would definitely be a second choice.</li>
            <li> The generics would be pulling the hair instead of cutting it, and we all know how much that sucks.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint has been the inability of previous razors to work well in the shower with my man hands.</li>
            <li> slight negative with this razor is the number of shaves I get.</li>
            <li> But that makes a mess and is hard to master.</li>
            <li> But that makes a mess and is hard to master.</li>
            <li> But with my thick black beard, &#x27;under the necks&#x27; hair is always a problem.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a little scared to put this vibrating razor on my face!  </li>
            <li> Trust me - the combination of the vibration and that little combing edge on the ProGlide Power blades makes all the difference!</li>
            <li> It seems to go dull a bit quicker than other razors, but that may be due to the fact that the blades are so thin and sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although not very great, I did notice a slight benefit in the comfort of the shaving process with the power model.</li>
            <li> One swipe and and your done, cutting down the time it takes to shave, and cutting so close, you still feel smooth after 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li> The size is a little thick in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This was all about economy, and very little about the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> WHat i discovered was that the less blades the razor has the less irritating.</li>
            <li> I have very thick stubble that dulls blades after one or two shaves.  </li>
            <li> : The blades seemed to dull after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m unhappy with the high price, so it loses a star.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the vibration works, but I still use it.</li>
            <li> The only downside would be that it&#x27;s an expensive proposition on a regular-purchase basis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Schick Hydro and MAC3 razors in the past.  </li>
            <li> it stays firmly in my hand!</li>
            <li> not sure what the vibration is supposed to accomplish, though.</li>
            <li> This is because one blade or 3+ blades usually pull and tug.</li>
            <li> In the past I have also had issues with the weight and size of a razor handle.</li>
            <li> gave me an unbelievably close shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I usually shave in the shower and there was no problem with the handle holding up with the water in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The vibration did add to the shave, although I am not sure it made my shave any easier.</li>
            <li> Thereafter, I&#x27;ve used it for the past two weeks every day</li>
            <li> so, my hands are usually covered in soap.  </li>
            <li> In the past those small handles have been a problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a disposable razor guy no more.</li>
            <li> I was also not able to tickle my kids with any stubble -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I like the handle thought.  </li>
            <li> I did not think made a difference, just made the  razor itself heavier, and not as sleek as others I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I used to use this as my regular shaving blade but the price for the cartridges got a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> (When I log into our account it shows my wifes nome not sure how to change it</li>
            <li> I have tried all the Gillette razors in the past, but this one takes the cake.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a lazy person when it comes to shaving.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure I would replace it.</li>
            <li> It was too small to trim anything.</li>
            <li> I usually rock.</li>
            <li> The vibration is not overwhelming but there are no doubts it is working.  </li>
            <li> I have used it every day for the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> So, to begin with, I should say that I&#x27;m not really sure how I feel about the handle.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure the Power handle is needed.</li>
            <li> that is that it&#x27;s pricey compared to my usual Dorco Pace razor.  </li>
            <li> For the past week, Ive switched over from the Gillette Fusion Disposables to Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I feel about the vibration though,</li>
            <li> It glides across the skin and does not cut me like others have in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am usually at the mercy of my (budget-minded) wife in what razors I use.  </li>
            <li> He also said it shaves as close as his ordinary razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who asked for their razor to shake in their hands</li>
            <li> I usually shave every day or two but to test this \\&quot;gliding\\</li>
            <li> , I got red angry patches on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Needlessly to say, now I only use hair conditioner for shaves.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t give product reviews.</li>
            <li> Usually I go about a day in between shaving.</li>
            <li> my beard hasn&#x27;t quit growing on me for the past 30 days, but amazon/gillette has.</li>
            <li> Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor.</li>
            <li> You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge.</li>
            <li> As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure if this is a gimmick or not, the proof seems to be in the proverbial pudding.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure what it was for</li>
            <li> Power seems like it should do something but not sure what.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hype is about</li>
            <li> the only con I have for this razor is the cartridges are insanely expensive</li>
            <li> I usually bought them at BJ&#x27;s or Costco.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what it does.</li>
            <li> It definitely provides a closer shave than my expensive electric razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant when using a traditional razor as I find them to be uncomfortable and I often cut myself.</li>
            <li> in the past month.</li>
            <li> I usually shave with an electric razor, but this might change my mind.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usual razor burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the blade ended up loosing its \\&quot;sharpness\\</li>
            <li> My husband, a man of few words, had a lot to say about this product!</li>
            <li> In a week or two of using a DE razor, I&#x27;ve made irritation literally a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> ive used Gillette in the past and had no idea</li>
            <li> If not for receiving from the promotion, I am not sure if I would have run out to buy it, but will continue to use it and even replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> No more Mach 3 for me.</li>
            <li> where in the past I would&#x27;ve dreaded getting around to the irritation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose is since I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with it on or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a bit on the expensive side, but with all the coupons that gillette gives, I think I will stick to using this one in the future</li>
            <li> and I usually drop my razor&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t had that issue with this razor.</li>
            <li> I expect the scab behind my ear to be gone any day now, with minimal scarring.</li>
            <li> Although the handle seems a bit small</li>
            <li> I usually just use a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what the point of the vibrating handle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but it does indeed work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using the past two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downfall in which I see is that the refills are quite expensive.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is slick looking and it seems to provide a closer shave than my Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Vibration/micropulses feel like your face is getting massaged but not sure how it benefits the shave.</li>
            <li> Not sure about that...</li>
            <li> I had used electric razors in the past, but changed to blades once I started shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when it made cutting through 3 days of stubble not a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power vibration I&#x27;m not sure what it supposed to accomplish.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves so close that it&#x27;s almost unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> This is the smoothest razor I&#x27;ve used in the past 25 years.</li>
            <li> No more razor burn.  </li>
            <li> No more dreading shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how expensive they are, both the razor and the replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what benefit this was supposed to provide to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Overall, I was not impressed with this razor and didn&#x27;t quite understand what they were going here for.  </li>
            <li> , I can just follow-up with a small disposable.  </li>
            <li> When I was shaving, I didn&#x27;t feel the usual \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; sensation like I was used to.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the vibrating.</li>
            <li> I user it just because I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I&#x27;m not sure that I would have purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the point of the power vibration.</li>
            <li> Upon getting this Gillette fusion ProGlide razor i have used this for the past week and have gotten the smoothest shave i have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it will do under continued use, but it shows promise.</li>
            <li> Tried out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor against my usual Schick Hydro razor as part of a promotional program by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> and I think it even went faster than my usual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue is that that blade refills are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Schick and I am thinking about switching...</li>
            <li> so I was anxious to try it.  </li>
            <li> I like the weight to the handle in the past when i had purchased razors</li>
            <li> Each cartridge is about five times the price of my usual economy blades.</li>
            <li> If not for receiving from the promotion, I am not sure if I would have run out to buy it, but will continue to use it and even replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> Usually I have irritation from shaving</li>
            <li> but whenever I shaved in the shower in the past, at some point the razor would end up on the ground, but not with the ProGlide Power.</li>
            <li> so I can usually pull it off, even in an office setting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bum cartridge with the handle or</li>
            <li> but I have used them in the past.</li>
            <li> The price of replacement blades seem expensive compared to the regular Proglide blades that I buy at BJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but this thing is slick.</li>
            <li> The only downside I will say is that the blades can be expensive.</li>
            <li> Fusion you are my only blade through thick and thin until you are no more!  </li>
            <li> It felt like the blades would cut half way through the hair, and then pull back before cutting the rest of the way through the hair.  </li>
            <li> Until now, I have had a tendency to use electric shavers because I don&#x27;t have time to deal with nicks and cuts in the morning, and blades were too difficult to use on anything but flat areas.</li>
            <li> For someone with big fingers the on off switch may be a little awkward.</li>
            <li> personally I haven&#x27;t used any expensive electric shavers and so its hard for me to compare.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see an extended life with these razors over other less expensive options.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve upgraded the grip on the handle as well, and there is definitely no fear of this bad boy slipping out of you hand.  </li>
            <li> It was really disappointing and not worth it in the long run on my face.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t take yourself seriously as a man and as a connoisseur, than by all means, stick with cartridge razors and waste money to boot.</li>
            <li> And you have to treat shaving with more care and caution, lest you bloody your shower as in a scary horror flick.</li>
            <li> I had settled on manual razors (only shaving with the grain) because it produced the least irritation and didn&#x27;t leave patches of uncut hairs like all the electric ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It started by reading a few articles online from serious shaving experts.</li>
            <li> I was not a big fan of the previous Gillette fusion because it irritated my skin and gave me very uncomfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> I bought the refills even though they were expensive, and will probably be sticking with this for a long time.just</li>
            <li> I bought the refills even though they were expensive, and will probably be sticking with this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will admit that when I decided to buy this razor, I did so with much skepticism, having been disappointed by the shave of the Gillette Fusion Power Razor.     </li>
            <li> Sorry for long review</li>
            <li> This razor proved me wrong, and I wished I would have realized it long before.  </li>
            <li> I was first hesitant in regards to trying a power handle which vibrated so violently in a plastic casing.</li>
            <li> In the past when I used a disposable razor I never liked the feel of the handles.</li>
            <li> Usually with razors I find I drop it at least once after I rinse it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an understatement to say I am shocked with results with this new razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: Since the razors are expensive, users can prolong the life of the razor by shaking all excess water out of the razor to the point, which the razor is dry.</li>
            <li> Tip: Since the razors are expensive, users can prolong the life of the razor by shaking all excess water out of the razor to the point, which the razor is dry.</li>
            <li> Well, not really, but I like to think that I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;m getting sucked back into buying blades instead of</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get those tight spots.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say about it, is that it still makes a mess in the sink.</li>
            <li> and you do not have to press hard for the shave.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think that will ever be an issue till they get dull.</li>
            <li> However, when they go dull, they go dull quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lil hard to use around the nostrils.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time telling where the razor is on my head with the vibration activated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He alternates this with the 2 blade sensor excel which I believe is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> Also, Gillette hints that the razor may dull after 5 shaves.  </li>
            <li> The power handle makes it easier to  maneuver around those hard to reach areas under the chin and nose.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this razor to all the guys who have a hard time getting up to shave like my self.  </li>
            <li> you can get them from amazon or ebay, cvs is a rip off and its hard to purchase them from a locked cabinet.  </li>
            <li> The large base allows me to feel like I&#x27;m in control of my razor.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little skeptical of a razor with a vibrator on it, seemed gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> and I grow thick hard beards.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin (I can&#x27;t use an electric, mine is so bad), don&#x27;t try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In summary, I have nothing negative to say about this razor and will be switching over to this model going forward.</li>
            <li> However, it too seemed to aid in the actual cutting process, by shimmying the blades minutely creating a tool that seems part razor,  part clippers.</li>
            <li> It had a lot of drag to it which made for an uncomfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This is a common feature but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave at least once a day  </li>
            <li> I was overly concerned that mixing a regular razor with a vibrating function would lead to my cutting myself up</li>
            <li> I have coarse facial hair and find that if I go longer than a day or two without shaving, this razor just can&#x27;t cut it without being uncomfortable or painful.</li>
            <li> To say the least this razor is a revelation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> His facial hair has always been somewhat on the thick side, so he goes through razor blades like crazy.</li>
            <li> If you have to shave at least once a day, I would not recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li> Second, if you use slower strokes, allowing the battery powered motion to do the cutting, the blade life is substantially increased.  </li>
            <li> nothing negative to say.    </li>
            <li> What is going on with the replacement blade rip off of late?  </li>
            <li> I took off a point because the cartridges are ridiculously expensive, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend you at least try it out.</li>
            <li> At least no measurable benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The negative is</li>
            <li> Now I can at least go 2 days between shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was definitely not thrilled with the razor over all.  </li>
            <li> , I recommend giving these a try if you&#x27;re unhappy with your current razor.</li>
            <li> least skin</li>
            <li> So, this razor isn&#x27;t really delivering a closer shave, it&#x27;s taking me longer to shave, and I found the vibration to be annoying.</li>
            <li> * hair may get stuck in blade when shaving too thick of a beard...</li>
            <li> Since I started shaving a few years ago I&#x27;ve been using the bottom-of-the-barrel cheapo razor blades and dealt with irritating tug, ingrown hairs, and skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the Gel is too thick and the blades are floating rather than getting closer to the skin.    </li>
            <li> 3 STARS because the hype that Gillette put behind this product is not justified.</li>
            <li> He could have a thick beard if he didn&#x27;t shave so for him,</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to like this razor, the ongoing gimmickry has become increasingly annoying.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and need to shave every day.  </li>
            <li> The advantage of the vibration, for me, doesn&#x27;t offset the need to make the handle so thick and stocky to accommodate the battery.</li>
            <li> helps cut through the thick scruff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt to shave, and no more shave bumps!</li>
            <li> I mean it has 5 blades</li>
            <li> Still, this can seem expensive compared with other options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thats unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> It is relatively expensive, but not exactly going to bankrupt me.</li>
            <li> at twice as expensive the Gillette proglide does not exactly glide...</li>
            <li> but you know what I mean).    </li>
            <li> And although I thought the vibrating handle was a gimmick and either wouldn&#x27;t help or might actually increase the likelihood of being cut, it turned out I was completely wrong!</li>
            <li> I have used other \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; razors and they tend to be bulky and difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;m one hairy beast and</li>
            <li> I went into it assuming this would be another failure for me.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the packaging is nearly impossible to get into.</li>
            <li> With base being chrome, blue trim highlights,  black rubberized grip and on button that lights up when the unit is on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been switching between the two over the course of a few weeks, and I have noticed what feels like a slight dulling of the ProGlide&#x27;s blades, where the Magnum 5 is still cutting smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of trying this razor, but it definitely does what it says.</li>
            <li> I hate nicks and the feeling of razor burn... plus I am not a big fan of the mess of the shaving cream and the stubble a razor leaves in the sink.</li>
            <li> the disposable ones were not much better and were irritating.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying another razor, especially after just buying the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I just glide the blade with or offset to the directions of my crazy beard and the smoothest shave with nearly never a nick and never razor burn.</li>
            <li> only downside to this product is that the disposable razor blades are very expensive.</li>
            <li> It seems that if it were thin, like my usual razors, it would jiggle around more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am however afraid to put it into the water for too long because it&#x27;s electric.</li>
            <li> not - I was quite surprised (and disappointed) with these results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing mows down my very tough beard in minutes without tearing up my face.</li>
            <li> but I hate these razors and they have me looking for a new brand.     </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price of the refill blades, but with a coupon and Amazon prices, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> , I was thinking it would be shaky</li>
            <li> There were subtle differences in the design of the blade, the handle, to how it operates on battery power.  </li>
            <li> you would think it would disrupt your shaving, but it is subtle and doesn&#x27;t make your hand shake at all.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, Gillette?    </li>
            <li> In fact he said it seems like it would be next to impossible to cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it seems like it would be next to impossible to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I do wish the refills were less expensive though.</li>
            <li> so I need a serious but versatile razor.  </li>
            <li> number of years ago I shifted from buying blades to razors in a effort to stop paying ridiculous amounts of money for razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Fusion razor series, but, unfortunately, for me these novelties were useless.</li>
            <li> In the past, he bought whatever was on sale and used it until he hated it and tried something new.  </li>
            <li> I shave in the shower and found the handle to be a little difficult to handle.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit expensive</li>
            <li> it was a little weird feeling the vibrating with the blades on my face.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades was a little scary to start with</li>
            <li> When I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I was a little skeptical of a vibrating razor.  </li>
            <li> but the blades are a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handle, but it works.</li>
            <li> (it pulled under the chin and along my problem area of my neck, badly), and I went back to my Norelco.</li>
            <li> Only bad is that it take battery&#x27;s and isn&#x27;t chargeable</li>
            <li> Normally a regular razor on longer hair is a bit painful if not done in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed that the handle has a microchip which ensures that the same amount of power will be delivered and not taper off as the battery is dying as my electric razor use to do which resulted in painful shaves as the hair would get caught in the blade.</li>
            <li> I also used it after a few days of hair growth and found that it had a difficult time handling the longer hair (lots of tugging even with the power</li>
            <li> and I came away with hardly any nicks and cuts!  </li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t a bad razor, the price point and unnecessary features will probably be cause not to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see and nicks or cuts, but it was not a pleasant shave.</li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that even though it has really thin blades it still irritated my skin really bad.</li>
            <li> and it is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pleasant experience to feel hairpulling on your face.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - does not work the same way as my other non-powered Gillette razors do.  </li>
            <li> I was also a bit disappointed with battery life, after about 15 shaves I feel like the battery is already getting low.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m sold on the vibrating, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s at least $192 a year just on cartridges!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical having tried one of the micropulse shavers in the past with</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it took the two of us a little time to figure what the battery was for (DUH!!!)  </li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and over the years it has gotten tougher</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power to any man with a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> The vibration also helps glide the razor along the skin, so it doesn&#x27;t catch on particularly tough bits of hair.</li>
            <li> This product has the fragrance of sandy beaches and ocean waves it is very delicate and lasts quite a longtime.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, shaving with a power razor felt a little awkward, though.</li>
            <li> There is no issues about slipping or dropping this bad boy.</li>
            <li> only thing bad is how expensive the cartridges are</li>
            <li> I am used to the Mach3 Turbo, with its relatively thin handle.  </li>
            <li> The extra base cost plus cost of batteries</li>
            <li> The handle is surprisingly thin to contain a battery.</li>
            <li> I was confused by it and thought my shave was smoother without it.</li>
            <li> I used to hate shaving... only trying to do it once a week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the science behind them is, but I know that when I turn on the vibrations, I don&#x27;t notice any pulling by the razor.</li>
            <li> something I never experienced with the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Shaving has been a frustrating and embarrassing experience for me for years.  </li>
            <li> it did a poor job.</li>
            <li> With a company that is standing behind its product I would like to think that the unit I had might have been defective but the company is committed to quality and excellence.</li>
            <li> I for one am tired of going to work with blood on my face from shaving.</li>
            <li> figured they were just trying to play to the Pulsonics popularity and try to snag some naive consumers that didn&#x27;t want to shell out for the expensive electrics.</li>
            <li> The razor comes with a couple spare razors loaded in the back of the carrying base.  </li>
            <li> course, the thin blades are the trademark feature of this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of paying for a cartridge system that doesn&#x27;t shave as well as an old-school safety razor, irritates my face, and costs literally hundreds of dollars a year.</li>
            <li> The vibration created by the power handle makes in the shower for the benefit of the steam seem unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Alas the Proglide razor.</li>
            <li> I hate struggling with plastic packages and this one did not make me fight to get it open.  </li>
            <li> I hate feeling like I&#x27;m going to lose a finger trying to open a package.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to this razor</li>
            <li> Thus, the hair in the test ranged in length from approximately 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch.  </li>
            <li> (although I&#x27;m always game for upgrades).</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t particularly expensive, but the cartridges are, at least comparatively.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve had this one for almost 2yrs, and it seems to be getting worse.  </li>
            <li> The vibrations in the handle literally cause the blade to glide over your skin in a way I&#x27;ve never experienced.</li>
            <li> Gillette just tweaks their razors a bit makes false claims and sells their refills for a lot of money to fool the consumers.</li>
            <li> Something I&#x27;ve vehemently hated about all other razors is that little strip gets used after like one shave.</li>
            <li> and I finally got so sick of the razor burn and irritation in general that i started trying cheeper razors, because i figured that i may as well save money if i was going to look and feel horrible after shaving.</li>
            <li> The Fusion&#x27;s blades are very expensive, maybe a little pricer than the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> I think if they try it, they&#x27;ll be hooked and end the bad habit with less inferior razors.</li>
            <li> Was a little shocked when I 1st treid this razor as it was noting like I had ever shaved with before</li>
            <li> and I was afraid that using it in the shower would make it act wonky.</li>
            <li> I threw these blades away because they are so bad, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so bad after a few days.</li>
            <li> Of course every person is different, but I hated shaving.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst razor ever.</li>
            <li> So the fusion proglide is the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
            <li> This razor is horrible for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My $13 down the drain within a year :(</li>
            <li> Other razors are somewhat awkward to hold to do the contouring of my beard but the ball on the ProGlide allows you to hit all of those difficult angles without having to twist your wrist into awkward positions.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up cutting my face, or worse, dropping the razor and for some forsaken reason, trying to catch it and cutting a nail.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this razor, I ended up giving away the other unused blades.</li>
            <li> I hate dropping my razor in the sink or having it slip in my wet hand while I&#x27;m shaving!  </li>
            <li> I found that shaving with a dull blade in power mode is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> However, for a 2-3 day growth, I found that it pulls on my skin badly, so I found it no better</li>
            <li> I usually let my beard grow out, get sick of it and then get rid of it.</li>
            <li> It also helps reach the tough spots to!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to see where you&#x27;re cutting when you get close to the edge of the mustache.  </li>
            <li> Nicks and cuts aren&#x27;t painful, but they are something you want to avoid and that can be tough to do without also running the risk of irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve figured out how to walk on the moon but, sadly, shaving can still be hit or miss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I found it difficult to hold on to.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to tell if it makes any difference.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of five because the price of replacement blades are expensive.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for this type of blade, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> However, I will go ahead and say it, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> A battery was included for the power/vibration function(I would be unlikely to buy</li>
            <li> although they appear expensive, on a per use basis, they are not.</li>
            <li> You wont go wrong buying this product.</li>
            <li> recommend you buy it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> but a lot of worse!)</li>
            <li> Lastly, the cost of the razor could be the worst thing about it.  </li>
            <li> just the power razor game!</li>
            <li> but I guess I was wrong because this is not a manual razor but operated for battery.</li>
            <li> Well my friend you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I turned on this razor because the blades don&#x27;t move, instead the razor just vibrates.  </li>
            <li> Also, the refills are expensive.</li>
            <li> (sorry, not having to shave would be perfection).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The downside, you might expect, is that the blades are about twice as expensive as the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely useless and IMO is just an attempt to add another disposable item to this razor.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a placebo and an expensive one at that.     </li>
            <li> Well, this thing is EXPENSIVE.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I still missed the close-shaves from the blade shavers.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is the worse razor I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> used to exclusively use electric razors, but after mine burnt up after erroneously trying to charge it in Europe (220v), I switched exclusively to razor blades.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed by the FaceBlade</li>
            <li> had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...blades got so expensive that shaving once every two-three days will cost you an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I always thought amazon has the cheapest rate, but I was wrong in this case.</li>
            <li> Nope, it was the Proglide turning itself on and off randomly.  </li>
            <li> But specifically focusing on the Flexball &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34;, I found it to be rather... forgettable.</li>
            <li> WRONG.     </li>
            <li> That being said, I have a difficult chin where the grain will vary from place to place.</li>
            <li> Sorry Quattro you are adios.</li>
            <li> One thing I dislike, would be the fact that you have a weird feeling in your hand temporarily after use.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a bit skeptical about the addition of the vibration from the handle doing anything to help in the shaving process going into it.  </li>
            <li> I was WRONG again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the vibrating \\&quot;Power\\</li>
            <li> and I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Refills are expensive.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say there is anything wrong with it</li>
            <li> The vibration makes it seem like an expensive electric razor but its a hand held blade razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just simply to expensive</li>
            <li> To me this is useless.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was skeptical about its effectiveness, but I have to say it did reduce the amount of nicks and cuts during my shave.  </li>
            <li> boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> and it was incredibly expensive.</li>
            <li> This Power Handle seems silly</li>
            <li> br /&gt;irritated, the blade is quite expensive as well as the refill.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical to try yet another blade</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this blade.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using them because they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> One issue I have with it is that it stops working for a bit if you hit it the wrong way.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about using a razor with a battery in it.  </li>
            <li> so I was initially skeptical to try this out.</li>
            <li> it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the power handle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the box does not do justice with explaining the function of the powered handle.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am in the process of getting a divorce.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have an answer.  </li>
            <li> The replacement blades are quite expensive, however.  </li>
            <li> It is however, rather expensive to buy, and I question the battery operation.</li>
            <li> But now I can tell it is going to be difficult</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> How silly of Gillette not to draw attention to this.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I thought that the idea of a vibrating razor was potentially the worst idea in the world.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a necessary evil.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and cut through it like butter.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, Go try it!!</li>
            <li> And you won&#x27;t look like you had a bad encounter with a dull pair of scissors!</li>
            <li> Weird, but a painful &amp; expensive fact nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seems to take the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; out of the shave - makes my fingers numb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out saying all razors cause me some pain during the cutting process.  </li>
            <li> and it did not feel awkward in my hand or during my shave.</li>
            <li> of knowing your cutting hair when shaving, is by feeling the resistance of the hair while pulling the blade across your face.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with what i was using.</li>
            <li> I did not have any issues at all with razor burn, or cutting myself.</li>
            <li> i end up cutting myself and have a crappy shave job.</li>
            <li> there is weight to it without feeling bulky or awkward in my hand.</li>
            <li> Inserting the battery into the compartment on the handle was a breeze although slightly awkward</li>
            <li> Still shaving can be inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> Afraid of your battery-powered devices powering up when traveling?</li>
            <li> This is an unacceptable design and desperately needs a flip-top to protect it.  </li>
            <li> The razor conforms to my face so I get a close shave without cutting myself and leaves no irritation.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the additional weight of the battery would throw that off, but it does not.</li>
            <li> Was I ever wrong!</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> But boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Damn, but they&#x27;re expensive!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> Sorry Schick, but Gillette has you beat!</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t go wrong with this blade!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> &quot; unpleasant in any way, but neither did I find that it discernibly enhanced the quality of my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The razor with out being turned on seemed to give a shave that was very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Takes forever, very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very uncomfortable to use and does not glide at all.</li>
            <li> one negative I can say is that the replacement heads are outrageously priced.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this after seeing it at the store.  </li>
            <li> have to say, I was VERY skeptical of the \\&quot;Power Handle\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was initially very skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as to what improvements my shaving experience would have.  </li>
            <li> If I show up with stubble or cuts all over my face it looks really bad and is, in face, against regulation.  </li>
            <li> No burning or bad spots after the shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s defiantly not as bad since I started used this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad part?  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t at all bad...</li>
            <li> I always shave against the grain and it was painful.    </li>
            <li> and it would be so painful to shave every day.</li>
            <li> I tried it, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Get this razor, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed by the power Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)  </li>
            <li> Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)  </li>
            <li> I was thoroughly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, give it a shot - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette and I have to say i&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I must say that I am slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Give it it try and I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> was disappointed with the multi-blades performance around my chin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried the Fusion ProGlide without the handle vibrating and the shave was everything I hate about blade razors.</li>
            <li> and it just gets annoying.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> I generally hate shaving because no matter what I use, I get skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I HATE shaving</li>
            <li> But the trimmer would get clogged with hairs, which is annoying.    </li>
            <li> Disregarding the guerilla marketing, Proglide isn&#x27;t totally worthless.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t spend you money on this overpriced crap.</li>
            <li> and I really hate to shave because of this.</li>
            <li> Thats when he introduced me to the Gillette Fusion Proglide because he felt bad for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated shaving.  </li>
            <li> One thing I always hated was when I was traveling</li>
            <li> I get very bad razor burn</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> At almost four bucks a blade for refills, this is simply outrageous and it&#x27;s a dealbreaker for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this razor and it is terrible.  </li>
            <li> which probably means I&#x27;ll be horribly wounded and disfigured soon but</li>
            <li> BAD DECISION!!!!</li>
            <li> Gillette has a nasty habit of over-hyping their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used were horrible</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> If that sounds terrifying, it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Pathetic.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;precision trimmer\\&quot; is awful.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an awful lot to spend on razors.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great shave. Wish the refills were cheaper. Not sure if the vibration works, but I still use it.</li>
            <li> Great grip! The mircopulses help create a smooth shave that does not irritate the skin. I was also shocked with how light the device is. I did get the product for free.</li>
            <li> The product was provided free through a program run by Gillette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a great product. Nice clean shave and fits comfortable in the hand to give a great shaving experience</li>
            <li> I received a sample Proglide Power System handle and blade from Gillette to try out. I have used a variety of shaving systems, but generally prefer Gillette. This new system with a power blade works very well. The handle is balanced and easy to grip, and you need to get used to holding it a bit differently because of the system vibration. Very nice, close, painless shave.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power razor and handle for free through a Gillette program. The handle is comfortable and sturdy. The rubber enhancements work well. The handle is balanced and easy to grip, and you need to get used to holding it a bit differently because of the vibration. Very well designed!</li>
            <li> I tried the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor recently because I got it free through a promotion from Gillette.  I found it to be a great product and provide a very smooth shave.  The handle was very comfortable and easy to maneuver and it really gives a great shave.  The only downside would be that it&#x27;s an expensive proposition on a regular-purchase basis.  That, of course, doesn&#x27;t take anything away from the quality of the product...just a matter of priorities when shopping!  Thanks Gillette...</li>
            <li> I got this razor through a program run by gillette, it is a great handle, comfortable and nimble enough to shave at any angle.  It is also weighted just right so that it provides a comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Schick Hydro and MAC3 razors in the past.  I noticed that Gillette was running a program for a free razor and I wanted to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest plus I saw with the Proglide was that the handle was battery operated.  Therefore, it should work very similar to a electric razor.  There is a push button on the front of the handle that allows for the razor to work electrically.  In addition, you just need to turn the bottom of the handle to open the part where the battery is stored.  A very simple process if you need to change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle was very enjoyable to hold.  As most razors are, this handle was made rubber.  I found the grip to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the design of this handle, however I still felt some tug on the overall shave on my face.  The thicker haired area of my face saw the all the tug (5-6 times around my chin).  However, other areas that were not as thick felt a very smooth and close shave.  In addition, clean up only took a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to the individual with limitied to medium thickness of facial hair.  I rated this 4/5 because it might not be the best option if you have very thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I am used to the Mach3 Turbo, with its relatively thin handle.  I shave in the shower and found the handle to be a little difficult to handle.  Between the vibration and the soap, it sometimes felt as though I was going to drop the razor.  I will continue using it and see if it is just a matter of getting used to it.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I have to admit I thought it was just a marketing gimmick that would be used to up prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was suprised, it complements the Proglide blades and provides for a much smoother shave and experience than I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the handle/razor free as part of a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of this razor from a Gillete promotion. Usually with these disposable razors the weight and feel of the handle itself is a bit on the light side. Most of the time this is because it is a hollow plastic, as a result I always need to grip tighter to get the right sort of control and pressure I want on the blade. With this razor however, there are two differentiating factors that negate this issue. The first is the riveted handle itself. The grooves within it allow for a more natural and less forced grip on the razor. The second is that because this is a battery operated razor, and that battery is housed in the handle, you get that extra weight that is sorely missing from other disposables. The difference is clear and can be compared to holding a full tang chef&#x27;s knife against holding a wood handled discount knife. The weight and grip, give control of the razor at a more nuanced degree than any other disposable I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love the micropulses handle with the side grips! Even when I get it wet it stays firmly in my hand! Best razor ever and thank you Gillette for giving it free! Now I will be a loyal customer</li>
            <li> Gillette has excellent products and I&#x27;m glad I got in on their promotion to try the razor and blades for free.  I&#x27;m a fan of the blades and handle to a point.  I like the close shave, control and feel of the handle.  I don&#x27;t care for the power feature as I felt I&#x27;d likely cut my chin using it there.  I&#x27;ll continue to use only without the battery.  The non power version is on my list to try next.</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin, no cuts or irritations. It is modern and easy to use, nice handle, great blades. It looks and feels great when using it, better than previous Gillette products. I am glad I was able to try it for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I was more than happy to accept this razor from the program by Gillette. The battery last forever and the bottom line is that the razor provides a great shave for a low cost. Before this razor I was using disposables and was going through them after 2-3 shaves. I feel like I get a better shave with this razor without no nicks. Great product.</li>
            <li> My Mach 3 Turbo Power shave handle is getting a little long in the tooth.  I&#x27;ve probably used it for well over 5 years but it has always done a good job, felt solid in my hand and worked exactly like you&#x27;d hope a razor handle to.  When I got the chance to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as part of a free program from Gillette, I was pretty happy to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the razor handle, I took it out of the package and got a feel for it.  I even sat and compared it to my Mach 3 Turbo Power handle (which, even at 5 years old, still looks exactly the same as the new Mach 3 Power handles, so I think the comparisons can hold up).  The Fusion ProGlide Power handle was bigger in size and circumference, a tad lighter and had more tacky rubber to the handle than the Mach 3 Power handle.  I can&#x27;t say one is better than the other, but they are both nice and solid and they feel good in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Fusion ProGlide Power handle looks quite a bit better than the Mach 3, but I don&#x27;t think the cosmetics of either product have a positive or negative impact on their functions.  The Fusion ProGlide Power handle kind of reminds me of Terminator and Robocop all rolled into one and thus, I feel like one bad dude when I use it.  Further speaking to the cosmetic appeal of the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, the power button actually lights up a cool blue which is nothing more than pretty, but I like pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using, I placed both razors on a flat surface and turned their power on, which is a slight vibration that is supposed to aid in removing hair for the areas you shave.  Both had fresh batteries for comparison&#x27;s sake.  The Fusion ProGlide Power handle jumped around the table like it was auditioning for So You Think You Can Dance.  The Mach 3 blade moved around, but not quite as much.  That could be a result of years of use or the Fusion Power has that much more vibe, it&#x27;s hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got to use the Fusion ProGlide Power handle to shave, I liked it quite a bit.  It continued to feel nice in the hand as I shaved my face and head.  One thing that was slightly odd to me was that it felt a bit slippery when it got a lot of water on it.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting that due to all the rubber on the handle, but it was more slippery than my other razor handle.  By no means a deal breaker, it wasn&#x27;t flying out of my hand or anything.  It was just a bit slicker than I expected with water on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I was done shaving, I was pretty happy with the handle overall.  It works exactly like you&#x27;d want it to, feels nice in the hand and just for a cherry on top, it looks kinda cool, too.  I&#x27;d gladly recommend the handle to anyone in the market as long as they wanted to go with the 5 blade option.</li>
            <li> Loved the razor!  It gave a comfortable shave that was effortless.  Worth the money, but it is expensive!  I would totally recommend it to anyone.  A really good razor is hard to find and I think I may have found my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit up front that I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this razor. I got it via a program from Gillette. But after using now for a few days, I&#x27;m definitely planning on buying a second one for my travel kit. This thing is loaded with great features to have a great shave with, but after getting used to the features at the top of the razor, I&#x27;ve been noticing the past couple shaves how nice the handle is. I&#x27;m guessing Gillette did some &#x27;beta testing&#x27; or focus groups or something, because the handle is great. It&#x27;s a bit bigger than what I had before, more suited to a man&#x27;s hand, and the contour is great. Very comfortable to hold. And, when the power is engaged, you really feel connected to the razor handle. Really nice.</li>
            <li> I tried out this razor free as part of a The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor has a nice, solid weight to it, plus bigger, more ergonomic side grips compared to previous versions.  I shave in the shower, so having a a razor I can keep a steady grip on even when it&#x27;s wet is important to me.  The thinner blades of the cartridge make for less tug and pull than some other razors; I&#x27;m sure the good grips, the swiveling head, and the concomitant enhanced maneuverability likewise contribute to the ease of shaving.  I switched to power razors years and years ago--don&#x27;t know whether the vibration actually helps, but I like the feel!  The razor has an automatic turn-off feature as well.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that Gillette came up with the first electric slim handle on a razor! All the electric razors I have had in the past have a very thick handle which makes it harder to get in certain areas of my face, this now allows me to do better triming as well. I would recomend this razor to anyone who uses an electrical razor on a regular basis. Now that I have switched I will not go back to any other electric razor! Thank you gillette for the oportunity to try this razor first!</li>
            <li> I was provided a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor via a program run by Gillette. The handle seemed to be over designed. I didn&#x27;t really notice the improved grip, although I guess that is a good thing since I didn&#x27;t have any problems holding it, even when wet. The large bulb at the bottom was kind of annoying to me and effects the overall aesthetics of the look of the handle, which overall is pretty cool. For many shoppers who make purchases such as these based off the look in the package, such as myself, you might be losing some customers with this bump at the bottom. As for the overall shave, it&#x27;s great. The powered handle seemed to increase the quality of shave and for someone who doesn&#x27;t shave very often, experiences like these make me want to shave more.</li>
            <li> Gillette has made a quality handle that makes shaving easy.  I like the grippiness of the Handle.  The micro pulses from the Duracell battery power make for an effortless close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Power Proglide from Gillette for free as part of a program they are sponsoring to promote the product, the price was right so even though I am primarily an electric user I gave it a try. It is no doubt a quality product &amp; gives a close shave, but I would not attribute any of that to the vibrating handle. It feels good in your hand but did nothing to enhance my shaving experience. Perhaps if I was a regular blade user it may have had more of an impression on me, but the vibrating thing just struck me as gimmicky.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my everyday shave.  It got close and lasted long without irritation. I received it free through a promotion and use it everyday. It comes with a nice holder to keep it save from kids and even has a reflective mirror for quick shaves.  The battery operated vibrations keep it smooth and comfortable.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for a few weeks now (I received them as a free demo through Gillette), and I&#x27;ve got mixed feelings about it. While I like the fact that it&#x27;s thinner and more easily-handled than most of the other powered handles I&#x27;ve used before, I guess I just really don&#x27;t like the vibration aspect. It seems to take the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; out of the shave - makes my fingers numb. I&#x27;ve got a beard/mustache, and do some precision shaving, and the vibration seems to dull the feel I use to get an accurate line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work just fine without being turned on, and is a good enough handle in that case. I prefer a bit more of an angle between the blades and the handle, but this straighter line seems to be where most newer handles are going. But, if you&#x27;re not going to use the power option, I&#x27;d assume there are cheaper options out there that use these same blades (which are great, by the way - super thin, sharp, and smooth).</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in a program Gillette sponsored for the Fusion Proglide Power razor. Gillette provided me with the power handle and the Fusion Proglide Power cartridge. I have been using their manual Mach3 for many years now and have been very satisfied. I have a tough beard and over the years it has gotten tougher (gray hair, LOL). I have always had my doubts about a razor that vibrates...until now. The combination of the rows of 5 blades and the vibrating handle allows me to shave in a short period of time without having to go back and shave over the same areas.  The vibration will take some getting used to, but the Fusion Proglide Power will be replacing my Mach3. That says a lot since I have been using the Mach3 for almost 15 years.</li>
            <li> I received the proglide power through a campaign that gillette was running a few weeks ago and have been using it about every third day or so. Coming from it&#x27;s non power counterpart the size increase to accommodate the battery is a bit strange at first, but I&#x27;ve actually grown to like it now. The handle is no heavier (if not lighter) than the non powered one, but this is because it is now plastic rather than metal. While I would have preferred metal, I doubt I would have like the weight it would have added. Other than that, the new grip design is great, not super tacky, but still enough grip for decent control. The major change in design this make is the micropulse vibrations. When I tested this out initially, my stubble was quite a bit longer than I usually let it get, and the vibrations didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot to me in that situation. Once it regrew out to the usual short stubble, the micropulses actually seemed to help give me a smoother cut. Not entirely sure If I&#x27;m completely converted over to this new tech, but for now, I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t enjoying it!</li>
            <li> I recieved a free sample from Gillete and was skepticsl after using multiblade razors for years.  The vibration really does work.  Smothest shave i hve ever had.  Use it in the shower and it works gret.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the free razor. The light weight and balanced handle felt great in my hand. It was easy to hold on to even when it was wet.</li>
            <li> I moved away from razors like this due to the cost of constantly having to buy blades all the time.  However, after getting this product as a gift from someone, I quickly became a fan again.  This vibrating power handle is really cool!!  I normally use an electric razor, but this razor provides a great deal more precision for my shave and the vibration is helpful to make for a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Recently I have been using disposable razors and noticed my skin getting irritated even after using moisturizing products. I switched to the proglide and have noticed a huge difference. I even got the irritation lotion to use a long with it for the full experience. Definitely  a 5 star product worth your while and money.</li>
            <li> I (Babetta&#x27;s husband) received his handle along with a cartridge from Gillette in regards to a feedback program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the design of the handle; it looked good, felt good and, most importantly worked VERY well. The \\&quot;flexible firmness\\&quot; was definitely an advantage, and it worked exceptionally well in conjunction with the blade. I could do without the power in the handle, but I admit to preferring to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a great combo product.</li>
            <li> I got a free trial of the pro glide power razor, and decided to try it. This was not my normal brand but I got a closer shave with no razor burn. It would be nice if the heads lasted a bit longer, but they do last as long as my old ones and with better results.</li>
            <li> First off, I would like to mention that I got this free to try through Gillette.  That being said, I love the weight and feel of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.  It fits my hand perfectly and makes shaving easier.  The power function may be a gimmick but it is one that I have come to rely on - the battery ran out and it felt like I was missing something while finishing the shave.  I have tried many brands but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is one of the best around.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from a program run by Gillette and I am very happy I did.  With my sensitive skin, I was a little nervous.  However the handle must have some magic to it as my face felt great after the shave.  That is outside of the norm for me.  I would encourage others with sensitive skin to use this product.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like shaving.  I usually end up cutting my face, or worse, dropping the razor and for some forsaken reason, trying to catch it and cutting a nail.  Yes, I have done this on more than one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to get the Fusion ProGlide and get to try it out.  It sounded a little gimmicky - a vibrating handle?  In the end, I was a believer.  The vibration made it feel like the razor was gliding over my face.  It allowed for a great shave, and I didn&#x27;t even cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t the vibration cause me to drop the razor?  Not at all - the handle is ergonomically designed to be bigger and have better grip, even when wet.  All in all - this one&#x27;s a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion pro glide razor as a promotion from Gillette. I was excited to try the new razor, I never used a \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor. After using it once I was hooked. I knew this was my new razor of choice. My face was super soft! I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it was. Best shave I have ever experienced! Love the blades so much I threw out the other razor I have been using for years. This is my knew razor of choice.</li>
            <li> I was offered the chance to try the Fusion Proglide Power Razor through a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve been a loyal and satisfied user of their Mach 3 model for a while now, and I was curious to see if it was worth it to upgrade to something like this.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out, I will say that the quality of the blade is up to par with Gillette&#x27;s standards. I get a consistently smooth shave without nicks or cuts. The handle is serviceable and provides good grip and maneuverability.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the vibration is supposed to accomplish, though. I found it distracting and obtained much better results after turning it off.</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette. I had been a loyal Schick Xtreme3 user for many many years.  Aesthetically, they are day and night.  The Gillette is bright blue and chrome and really looks good.  The rubber gripping on the top of the handle is perfectly designed.  The rubber gripping on the bottom is deep and firm allowing for a light touch to control the handle. ( much like new grips on a golf club make for a better swing)  I found the extreme swivel of the cartridge placed the handle at an odd position and sometimes close to 90 degrees to the shaving cartridge.  After a week of trial shaving, I couldn&#x27;t use the power feature any longer.  I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of a vibrating straight razor.  When the handle was vibrating, it felt as if I could not control the handle or cartridge.  This power feature is not for me.  The handle itself, minus the power feature, is designed very very well.  I have reviewed the cartridge in a separate review .  After two weeks of trail shaving, I must admit that the Gillette is by far the most masculine looking razor I have ever used, however it&#x27;s not for me.  I will continue the search for the perfect razor.</li>
            <li> I have used other Gillette products in the recent past and was always pleased so when I got this handle for free to try, I was excited. This handle is so light! Still has all the comfort and control as the heavier ones but at a weight of significantly less. I also have to say that I like the blue LED indicator.</li>
            <li> I just got the Gillette Pro Fusion handle through a promotion through Gillette. I tried it out, and I&#x27;m in love! It&#x27;s awesome, you can&#x27;t get any better handle then this! I even have to hide it from my wife and her hairy legs! She loves it better then her old razors! I will continue to use theses Gillette products and let everybody I know how good theses work! I even went out and bought 5 for stalking stuffers!!</li>
            <li> Impressed, I got it for free via a program run by Gillette.  i thought for sure since it was free it would be lame, but i was not lame in the least.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like the vibrations bring the hair closer to the skins surface for a closer more comfortable shave.  Awesome job Gillette!</li>
            <li> I was provided with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor to try and I was extremely pleased with the results.  The vibrations that the battery powered unit appear to almost lift the hairs to provide a closer shave.  The handle fits my hand and is easy to handle, almost as if it was designed just for me.  I keep the razor in my shower and have found that no water has penetrated the battery compartment after the last two weeks.  In summary, I have nothing negative to say about this razor and will be switching over to this model going forward.</li>
            <li> I was given by Gillette, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle to test. I found the handle to be a great fit for my hands. It has the feel of quality in the weight and balance. The time to set up the handle with battery and cartridge was very quick and easy. The gentle vibration it has when turned on felt soothing to the face. I am not sure how much it helps the shave but I enjoyed the shave so much that I am going to continue to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.</li>
            <li> First I want to say I&#x27;ve shaved with most razors out there, even the Gillette Mach 3 ,Schick Hydro 5 , and this by far is the best closest ,least irritating shave I have had. I got this from a  Gillette program but will be buying the blades. They do cost a little more  but I got about twice as many shaves out of them than with others so they were worth it. With this shave there is no pulling or tugging, the blades seem so sharp they just glide over you can cut with out any effort. The blade across the top is actually pretty handy , it shaved close to my nose and made sideburns even and easy. I also love the fact there was no irritation when shaving With this razor and I think it cut my shaving time down due to not having to  go back over areas ..I&#x27;d give it six stars if there were 6 to choose from.....</li>
            <li> First of all, it MUST be noted that Gillette has made a great effort to rethinking plastic blister pack design. Blister packs are HORRIBLY difficult to open, and often result in sharp lacerating edges. The Fusion ProGlide has a perforated zip panel on the back so that ordinary humans can actually get to the product. Love it, love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the first thing that pleased me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor itself (which was provided free as a Gillette marketing program) after the first use, it looks like a winner. The blades are smaller and thinner than my regular non-power Fusion, and seemed to do a better job of cutting, rather than pulling, at a few days&#x27; growth. The vibrating feature of the handle took some getting used to, as it tends to make my hand feel odd. However, it too seemed to aid in the actual cutting process, by shimmying the blades minutely creating a tool that seems part razor,  part clippers. The trimming blade also worked well, though I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between it and my regular Fusion, other than the thinness of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does seem to work a bit better than my normal, non-powered Fusion razor. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power and I can say, without a doubt, that I&#x27;ve found my new favorite razor. The handle is comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> The first thing I tried after receiving it for free from Gillette was a side-by-side comparision with my Mach 3 razor. So I put a new blade on my old razor and shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion. Without hesitation I can say the Fusion was a much smoother and less iritating shave. However, both razors seemed to give the same shave in terms of closeness. To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days and there was no appreciable difference. I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave. The battery power works in the shower, so that&#x27;s a nice convenience. Naturally, with a battery, there&#x27;s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.The downside, you might expect, is that the blades are about twice as expensive as the Mach 3. Since my old razor never bothered me, I won&#x27;t be switching to these more expensive blades. But if money is no object, or if you really need a more comfortable shave, this would be a good razor for you.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shave I got from  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.  I was a nice smooth close shave.  The vibration really help with not getting any nicks.  The handle was big, but something I could get use too.  Thank you, Gillette for providing me with my new favorite razor form your free program.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every razor on the market,most are ok, some better than the others. It seems that regardless of brand, the blades keep getting better and better, but I&#x27;ve never found one with a good trimmer...until now!&lt;br /&gt;When I received this free razor via a Program run by Gillette, I figured it would just be another razor to add to my collection of so-so products. Man, was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;I can talk about the blades, but I&#x27;ll just sum them up by saying they offer a smooth, effortless shave with 0 irritation, as good as it gets. The trimmer was the icing on the cake for me; this thing really got the hard to reach spots under the nose and worked great at the side burns. Before, I had to use a seperate,smaller razor just for those areas, but now I&#x27;m happy to say that I finally have my all in one razor!!</li>
            <li> This razor, provided free from Gillette, proved to give a comfortable close shave without the irritation I usually have. It works in the shower and provides a quick and painless experience. I would recommend this razor to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The new fusion proglide power handle is great.  The vibrating handle make it more smooth and less bothersome to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L R</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to the Fusion ProGlide Power razor by receiving a free sample through a program that Gillette was running. I noticed right away that the handle was larger, making it more comfortable to shave.  There&#x27;s grips to help you have a comfortable shave, and the razor handle contains a microchip that provides power every shave because the micro-pulse makes shaving effortless, smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have realized I can usually only shave with razors that have two blades. This is because one blade or 3+ blades usually pull and tug. I then get ingrown hairs and infections, razor burn, and irritation. I was very skeptical of trying this razor, but it definitely does what it says. Receiving this razor to try for free was definitely amazing. This will be my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; razor from now on.  This is really an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; razor for me. In the pst I&#x27;ve had to use multiple razors or devices to achieve my look. Now with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I can shave, use the mircro comb and the trimmer blade and be done. The razor is also very easy to hold and use, which is a plus. The handle is not too large or too small. It is also not too heavy or light. In the past I have also had issues with the weight and size of a razor handle. If it is not the right size or weight it is not easily maneuvered and the shave is not as good as it could be. Also if it&#x27;s not the right weight or size it can just be all around hard to shave. This is the perfect razor for me.</li>
            <li> This Gillette Fusion was given to me for free through a program run by Gillette.  I&#x27;m however under no obligation to post positive or negative reviews - just honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Gillete Fusion (non-battery operated version) that I&#x27;ve used for more than a year now.  The result is comparatively equal, with no noticeable difference in smoothness or (lack of) stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one major difference however.  The battery-operated version is much more efficient than its predecessor.  In just one swipe, the skin was left extremely smooth and didn&#x27;t require additional shaving over the same skin.  The significance is that anyone with sensitive skin knows that running a razor blade over the same spot that&#x27;d been previously shaved over can easily irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was hassle-free and easy to open, requiring no scissors or additional patience to get through a barrier of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on how long the battery lasts as I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it&#x27;s waterproof is a huge plus.  I shave in the shower and use a mirror that is specifically made to hang on a shower wall with anti-fogging technology.  Consequently, I need a razor that can stand up to water.  Any time you have a battery-operated tool, you are instantly weary of water penetration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a fantastic razor handle and would be perfect for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t already have a fusion razor, I&#x27;d suggest buying this pro glide, battery-operated version.  If you already have the non-battery razor, then stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe this is the best overall product for shaving on the market.  If price isn&#x27;t an issue and you have sensitive skin then this needs to be in your shaving arsenal.ou don&#x27;t already have a fusion razor, I&#x27;d suggest buying this pro glide, battery-operated version.

            <li> We&#x27;ve figured out how to walk on the moon but, sadly, shaving can still be hit or miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wet shaves each morning knows the perils and pitfalls of the average razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happily, a solution has been provided courtesy of Gillette.The ProGlide Power system really is a shave above the rest.This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten in years and it shows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get razor burns with cheaper razors due to all the pulling and tugging, but thanks to the ProGlide this is a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish these were a bit more affordable and that there was some sort of subscription club from Gillete itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I got this razor free of charge from a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I found the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE very easy to use. The large handle makes it easy to maneuver across the face. The power function is very useful it makes the shave smoother than without the power function.This is one of the best razors I have used hands down! Not only during shaving is it the most comfortable shaver that does not pull your hair, it also creates such a smooth shave.This product is amazing!It gave me an unbelievably close shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I received theGillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle as a promotion through Gillette. The weight and ease of use was evident from the moment I picked it up.  The only thing I would change would be to add different levels of vibrations so its not all one speed which appeared to be very high.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY, a blade that shaves the way I need it to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, the packaging was done very well...easy to open and easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power Cartridge shaved like a dream.  I have a very thick beard and usually need to shave twice a day to keep a smooth face.  With the Power Cartridge, the shave was so close, that I can wait until the next morning to shave again.  That makes me very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides so smoothly that it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.  It makes for a very comfortable shave. And best of all NO CUTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge.  This will now be my go to razor for the perfect shave!</li>
            <li> The Gillette ProGlide shaver is my new shaving system, the powered handle has a sure grip and the micro pulses seemed to lift the hair on my face to give me a fast clean shave.  Recommend it to anyone but especially those that have a stubborn beard.</li>
            <li> I was initially pessimistic about a battery-operated razor, and whether that would make a difference in my shave.  But I have been a huge fan of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide brand, so figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, especially after getting the ProGlide Power through a free program by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried it, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  First, the battery-operated razor makes for an easier, cleaner shave.  I felt as smooth a shave as if I were to use a more expensive electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the battery fits easily inside of the razor, so it&#x27;s very light to carry.  A plus considering that I throw it in my gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I can use this razor in the shower as if it were a non-electric shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trouble I had was getting the cap off the bottom of the handle to pop the battery in.  It wasn&#x27;t intuitive for me to use, and took 5 minutes for me to get the battery cover removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle since it came out. Fits into your and easily, light weight and love the vibrating feature!  The only con that I have is the price but after receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free through a program ran by Gillette I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. As a long time user of Gillette razors, I have my opinions! I started out using the Mach3 (3 blade) razor which I thought was ok. One day, I accidently purchased the Mach3 Turbo. I discovered they were a significant improvement over the regular Mach3 (could it be the lubrication strip?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this made me wonder if there was an even a better product out there and encouraged me to purchase the manual Gillette Fusion (5 blade) razor. I was very disappointed. It had a lot of drag to it which made for an uncomfortable shave. It seemed like this may have been because the blades were too close together but who knows - I just know it didn&#x27;t feel right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw that Gillette had a new Fusion Proglide Power razor, I was a little skeptical but I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. After the first shave - I was sold! I had the most comfortable shave I had EVER experienced! I know is sounds strange but the vibration of the power made it such that I couldn&#x27;t even FEEL the razor doing it&#x27;s thing. Now THAT&#x27;S a shaving success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned the power off and it was a very noticeable difference. I could feel the &#x27;pull&#x27; as is it cut my whiskers (this was still way better than the Mach3 Turbo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned the power back on and ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....it just slides across my face like a VERY sharp razor should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close and comfortable - I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I had never used a Gillette razor before,So when I was offered a free razor from Gillette as a program they were running,I jumped on the offer. I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power and I must say im impressed. The razor is a vary solid design and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Pressing the power button your welcomed with a bright blue power light and a very strong vibration that is focused on the head of the razor. The razor batteries last about a month and that is with daily usage,the blue power light will start blinking letting you know to change the battery which is a huge plus! All in all im extremely impressed with this razor and will recommend to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is super easy to use, and gives a nice close shave.  The \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; that the batter power provides really does let the razor get a closer shave.  The handle is big enough, easy to hold and maneuver.  The blades stay sharp and I haven&#x27;t gotten any nicks or cuts, even working around the chin and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGuide Power handle from a program sponsored by Gillette.  When I received it I thought that the power couldn&#x27;t make a difference.  I could have been more wrong.  When I tried it out I found that the power handle gently vibrates to help achieve a closer shave without irritating the skin.  I usually shave in the shower and there was no problem with the handle holding up with the water in the shower.  If your looking to get the closest shave you can get, this handle will help you achieve that goal.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor (Free) through a Gillette program I put it to use immediately.  As a man who has to shave constantly I was ready.  The ergonomic design made it a comfortable shave.  The handle made it easy to follow the contours of my face...giving me greater connection between face and blade.  The vibration did add to the shave, although I am not sure it made my shave any easier.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to review the Fusion Proglide through a program run by Gillette.  The shave is easily one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Virtually no tug or pull, and really smooth.  The blades also clean very well with a quick rinse.  My only concern is the design of the handle.  It appears that a lot of effort went into designing this razor - the handle is a nice size, it&#x27;s solid and it&#x27;s got a good weight to it.  My issue is with the rubber grip.  When dry, it&#x27;s got a nice feel to it, but when it got wet, it lost all of it&#x27;s grip and I found it difficult to hold on to.  I&#x27;ve now been careful to only rinse the razor itself, but some water inevitably runs down to the handle.  Great shave though - overall, 4 out 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I received this handle through a promotion being run by Gillette.  The handle has a good grip, so it doesn&#x27;t slip when wet, and is easy to use.  The power button is easy to find.  Wouldn&#x27;t mind if the handle were a bit thicker for bigger hands.</li>
            <li> This was a free razor program provided by Gillette.  The power feature of this razor is a major downgrade.  It not only costs more and makes the razor heavier, but it also downgrades the performance.  The power handle makes it tougher to maneuver and tugs your hair more, irritating your skin.  It offers an inferior shave to the handle without power.  Save yourself money and the hassle of changing batteries for and get the regular handle without the power.</li>
            <li> Just used the razor and loved it. the handle is very comfortable however the power button placement could be improved by being on the bottom of the razor. I shave my head and was worried that I would hit the power button when shaving the top of my head since I was holding the razor upside down. For normal use on your face it was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with this razor since I first used it. It provides the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, from any disposable or electric shaver. Gillette provided one as part of a test program, and, having used other Gillette products I was very hopeful that it would perform well. It has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the Fusion ProGlide Power shavers around for a while, but I&#x27;ve thought that they were probably a good way to make faceburger. When I recently had the opportunity to try one for free through a program run by Gillette, though, I decided to take my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that the vibrating blades did not slice my face into ribbons, and I did get a nice close shave from it.  I actually tried shaving one side of my face with the power on, and the other - with the same cartridge, so that I was comparing apples-to-apples - with the power off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly?  No particular difference in outcome, with a possible edge to the unpowered side.  Whether that was because I didn&#x27;t press as hard on the powered side (for fear of making faceburger), or whether the vibration of the handle actually impeded the shave was unclear to me, but I don&#x27;t think that it gave me any particular advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;d just save a few bucks and go with the standard Fusion ProGlide - the five-blade design really does yield a better shave than an old single-blade shaver - but I&#x27;d give a pass on the powered version.</li>
            <li> I got this razor through a promotion from Gillette. This razor is fantastic. The blades cut close and provides a comfortable clean shave in less passes than other razor cartridges.  The handle itself is slightly bigger than a standard razor handle because of the battery. I thought that the bigger handle might be a bit cumbersome and hard to use but, after trying this handle several times, I find that the slightly bigger size isn&#x27;t an issue one bit. In fact I enjoy the slightly larger diameter feels nice. The built in grips feel good and allow for great control.</li>
            <li> So this is my first blade razor that vibrates. I received it from a promotion by Gillette so I figured I give it a shot. The blades work really well, but I do not see the benefit of the vibration. I really could tell no difference when it was on verses off as to it&#x27;s smoothness or cutting ability. Being frequently an electric shaver the buzzing in my hand felt natural and it was easy to hold and use, but honestly I think the vibration is just a marketing thing. I would give the blades 5 * but the whole vibration thing not so much.</li>
            <li> While the blades on this free razor I received as part of a Gilette program are top notch, I have to be honest: I have no idea what the vibration is supposed to do.  It doesn&#x27;t make the shave better, in fact it may hurt it slightly, since the last thing you want when shaving is tiny rapid movement of the blades.  The vibrations didn&#x27;t make my stubble stand up on end.  It didn&#x27;t add any smoothness, or anything else for that matter.  From a logical stand-point I am completely stumped as to how vibrations are supposed to add to the quality of a shave.  If anything it was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one plus with the handle is that it is very easy to grip.  I used it in the shower as well as at my sink and in both cases this is probably the most comfortable grip I&#x27;ve had on any razor I&#x27;ve owned. So that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I got this razor free from Gillette and tried it out.  The handle was awkward at first since it was larger than I was used to, but after using it a while found it to work well.  It has a nice grip and fits well in my hand.  The blade swivels well on the handle too.</li>
            <li> First the pro&#x27;s:  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is light weight, easy to handle and maneuver and produces a great close shave with no nicks.  The package includes everything you need to get started including the battery.  As far as power options go, the Gillette Fusion Proglide is relatively quiet and the blade cartridge is easy to connect and eject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the con&#x27;s, there aren&#x27;t many but first I don&#x27;t care for the waste of a battery operated razor.  I really don&#x27;t see any improvement in the shave over the non-powered version.  Also the power button mid-handle is in an awkward spot making it easy to accidentally turn it off mid-shave while you&#x27;re maneuvering the handle.  For me that ended up being a plus since I could evaluate the \\&quot;power\\&quot; versus no-power shave with the same handle and cartridge and there was no discernible difference.  So I recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide non-power version as a more eco-friendly and wallet-friendly alternative with the same great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor free of charge to evaluate through a Gillette program. Since that time I have purchased more blades and will continue to do so though I have switched to the non-power version.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Handle gave me one of the best overall shaves that I can remember. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle all the tugging I would get from my old razor. The Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Handle made it a pleasant experience and flowed across my skin with a very gentile feel.&lt;br /&gt;A free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and gave me the opportunity to try this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Gillette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed.  I first tried this razor after on a three day growth after a long weekend and it treated it like it was nothing, cutting effortlessly.  Thereafter, I&#x27;ve used it for the past two weeks every day and I&#x27;ve not seen any change to the high quality shave.  My wife has used it in the bath tub as well, with the same flawless results.  Some technology actually does make our lives better - this is one such convenience and I&#x27;ll be using it from now on!</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of the skimpy, skinny razor handles...I hope.  I recently received a Gillette Fusion Proglide razor.  The razor is great.  Form fits function with this one.  The power button was in a spot I could find and it was clearly marked.  There was even an LED letting me know it was on.  You would think I should know it is on by the vibration (I do), but the LED helps as the vibration is smooth, yet powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the handle.  I shave in the shower, so, my hands are usually covered in soap.  With the Gillette Fusion Proglide, the razor didn&#x27;t fall out of my hands.  I did drop it however, and it kept on working.  Another sign of good workmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice that a company took so much time thinking about the handle as they did in creating the blades themselves.  Bravo Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of purchasing this razor, you are getting a product that is well built and well thought out.</li>
            <li> Through a program from Gillette, I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free.  The handle has a different shape than a standard Gillette Fusion ProGlide that I have used for years.  It feels much more comfortable to hold, probably do to the greater thickness.  The pulsing, at first, was odd, but was quickly overlooked.  It is difficult to tell if it makes any difference.  I plan on trying the power handle with a normal ProGlide cartridge, while also trying the enhanced ProGlide Power cartridge on a standard handle to see which component contributed more to the easiest and closest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle is a great new concept that makes my shave that much better. I was sceptical about how good this razor was until I recieved it free from a program sponsered by Gilette. The grip is perfect and allows one to get a great shave with easy strokes. However the power causing the hairs to stand up to get a deeper shave. The vibrating is different at first the results make it well worth the minor awfwardness at first. The Mach Three was good, but this is the clearly the next big step in shaving. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy with big hands.  In the past those small handles have been a problem.  Problem solved!  The robust design keeps the razor in my hands no matter how much water and shaving cream get on them.  Received this as a free demo from Gillette.  I&#x27;m a disposable razor guy no more.</li>
            <li> This  free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.  I love the look and styling of the handling.  It has a very ergonomic grip and a non-slip hold perfect for those rushed in-the-shower shaves.  The pulsating action really does provide for a smoother shave.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I got the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.  I went for 4 days without shaving prior to trying this one out.  Normally I shave every day.  The handle itself was nice and light even with the battery inside but the vibrating sensation was kind of different and something that you&#x27;ll have to get used to.  I&#x27;ve shaved with both the vibration on and off and didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  But the blade did give a nice close, smooth shave and it didn&#x27;t pull at all...I was very happy with the blade and will probably switch to use this one everyday.</li>
            <li> I really like the power handle on this razor. It fits my hand. Its comfortable and has a nice grip to it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much had every razor style available. And in recent years Gillette has been a game changer in shaving comfort. Of course, this has come with a cost as the average price of a disposable blade approaches $5, but the benefits are just as notable. My biggest complaint has been the inability of previous razors to work well in the shower with my man hands. They were always slippery and the power buttons seemed to be in a position that allowed the razor to be turned off when I did not intend to power down. I received a free razor through a program run by Gilette and Gilette has finally gotten it right with this system. The shave is excellent, but even better is that the frustrations I just mentioned have been minimized. Is it perfect? No, but it&#x27;s darn close. I don&#x27;t like that the lubicating strip disappears long before the blades really need to be replaced. I&#x27;m sure this has more to do with selling more blades than an inability to find a longer lasting product that will work on the strip, but it is a little annoyance that gets tolerated because the product is pretty darn good!</li>
            <li> got the Gelette fusion proglide over a month ago and actually enjoy shaving my face now. no razor burn, smoother face and my fiance loves that i shave more regularly now!! great idea for fathers day!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor through a program run by Gillette. I thought the razor was the ideal lovechild between a handheld razor and an electric shaver. The vibrations were so much easier on my facial hair and the handle has a nice weight to it. No more cheap razors for this guy.</li>
            <li> written by my husband Randy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this razor thru a program run by Gillette for free.  The handle is perfect in size, feels good in your hand while shaving. The razor gives you a smooth, close shave. I&#x27;m a fan of Gillette products, this one is good.</li>
            <li> I thought the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle was just a gimmick. But trying it changed my mind. I tried it in both the on and off modes. While the off mode gave a really nice shave, the on mode gave me a closer, smoother shave with a lot less irritation. I was really impressed. My only complaint is the price of the refill blades, but with a coupon and Amazon prices, it&#x27;s not that bad. Fortunately,I received the ProGlide Power Razor free in a program run by Gillette! But I will continue to use and buy the Gillette ProGlide Power Handle and blades!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have typically used a Gillette multi-blade razor and have always thought highly of the brand. In fact I had one I was using up until I received the Fusion ProGlide Power Handle in the mail! I felt the performance was very similar to the non powered razor and the durability of the product about the same as well. It gave me a nice close shave with a little vibrating action in the handle. Which brings me to my next point. I didn&#x27;t feel that  the power handle was necessary. I don&#x27;t feel that I received any better results from the power handle than I did from the original.I did however like that they kept the extra blade on top of the head for precise grooming efforts. So all in all I gave it a 4 star rating only because I feel that it is just as adequate as the original without needing the power handle. I will continue to use the amazing razor I received, but when the battery runs out I will hesitate to replace it.</li>
            <li> I receive this razor free- the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. That being said, I really enjoyed this razor, and have purchased it since. The handle itself is smooth and easy to hold. Overall, my shave was smooth and I had few issues.</li>
            <li> The Fusion shaved smoothly and got all the little niches on my face (immediately under my nostrils is a hard place).  The vibrating action felt nice, like little hedge trimmers effectively getting everything.  Now, granted, I don&#x27;t know how much the vibration helped, but it felt nice nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it passed the wife test - she did not get razor burn from a little kissy-kissy action.  I was also not able to tickle my kids with any stubble - all gone.  It feels smooth to my touch as well.</li>
            <li> I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProGlide by a special program from Gillette. I have shaved with it several times and i must say that it is quite comfortable and easily manuverable. It doesnt get slippery in your hand while shaving and rinsing it off. It fits in your hand and is nice and firm. Not too big, not too small. The groves on the hanfle seem to be in all the right places. That is what i think makes it very ergonomic. All in all i think that the handle is very good more than satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as part of a promotional campaign from Gillette.  I was impressed by by the ease of use simply by inserting the battery into the handle.  This razor makes it a joy to shave every morning and it saves time, too!  I will use thus daily.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as a promotion by Gillette. The Fusuion proglide provided a nice, smooth, close shave.  I&#x27;m not sure how I like the handle thought.  Power handle and battery I did not think made a difference, just made the  razor itself heavier, and not as sleek as others I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> This Gillette fusion proglide razor is amazing. the power button doesn&#x27;t get in the way as some might expect. The handle is the perfect size, easy to move around in your hands, and the shave you get from this is awesome. I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette and so far, i have used it for about 6 or 7 shaves. It just seems amazing. I used to use this as my regular shaving blade but the price for the cartridges got a bit expensive. Because of the price, I don&#x27;t think its worth it. Its just like its other non powered version (as the power feature doesn&#x27;t really change my shave). The blade currently seems to be holding out well and makes my skin feel soooo smooth. The grip on the handle is great. It keeps the razor from slipping and sliding while you shave as some of the disposable plasitic ones that are out there.&lt;br /&gt;The major downsize of this is the price and maybe the extra power feature if you don&#x27;t have thick hair (i have very soft facial hair). Using the power feature didn&#x27;t do much for my shave. I didn&#x27;t feel any difference in the overall shave and the feeling of the skin while using it and while not using it.&lt;br /&gt;So if you can afford it, i would definitely recommend this. It does give you the best finish and smooth feel any shave would give you, but it might become a bit expensive in the long run (depending on how often you shave).</li>
            <li> This razor gives me a great close shave every time. I would really recommend this razor to anyone who is looking to switch to something new.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette brand of razors in the past and was really excited to try this one out. I was provided the opportunity to try this razor via a program run by Gillette. When I received noticed it was coming, I was really excited.  Knowing the brand and what I have come to  expect from the products, I knew it was going to be a fun product to try. I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Power Handle for a couple weeks now and have nothing but great comments about the experience I have had with the handle and the overall shave it has produced. The handle has grips that make the razor feel secure in your hand, eliminating the worry about slipping. The power in the handle creates a slight vibration while shaving and seems to help glide the razor over the beard and face. I like he fact that even though the razor contains a battery, it is still safe to use in the shower. An added bonus is that if left on the handle will turn itself off after 8 mins. Overall, I have found the handle design with its grip and vibrations to be a complement to the whole shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power I received from Gillette. This razor gives an unbelievably close shave, and it is easy to handle, minimizing razor burn and cuts. I don&#x27;t always use the power function, as it works fine without it, but it is a nice option to have.</li>
            <li> Once Ireceived my free razor from the program run by Gillette, i couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try.  I was very surpised as this razor was very high powered.  I had pretty nice growth on my face and head.  This razor went straight through without a problem.  Will use this again.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle free from a program run by them. The handle was nice and I did like the thicker feel. I compared this side by side to my non powered razor and felt no difference. The shave itself didn&#x27;t seem to be any more comfortable then previous generation products. I gave this three stars since it did produce a nice, clean shave. It just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype, and therefore not worth the added cost.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 2 weeks ago and I won&#x27;t go back to my older shaving tool; Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is supperior and top of it class, very confortable, excelent grip when hands wet or dry. I love this product. Excellent, will recommend to everybody. Let me say I  received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for FREE via a program run by Gillette and will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I received the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette, and I really like the handle and how the razor shaves, but I don&#x27;t really see or feel a big difference between shaving with it on or off. It provides a great shave either way, and I love how the handle sits in your hand. Overall it&#x27;s a great product, but I would probably not buy it because for how little I would use the vibration action, the price would not be worth it. However, I love Gillette Fusion and it will still be my favorite razor!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a great razor.  The shave I get is so smooth!  I defiantly am going to stick with Gillette razors.  Thanks Gillette for the clean, smooth shave every morning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a shlick Hydro for a while now.  Gillette was offering free proglide power razor to try.  Though why not.  The power part did feel a little funny at first, (after shaving my face felt a little numb, just not use to the slight vibration)&lt;br /&gt;The razor did what it says and delivers a close smooth shave, I felt it was better than the hydro.  There is one spot on my chin that in all fairness both razors didn&#x27;t give a close shave, good shave yes but left a little stubble.&lt;br /&gt;The proglide does a close shave with little to no pressure on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The real issue is: is it really worth $34 for 8 replacement blades where the hydro has 8 for just under $20.&lt;br /&gt;The cost for replacement blade is the only negative I would have to say about the proglide.</li>
            <li> This new razor gives you the ease of using a blade shaver with the added benefit of enhanced experience of an electric shaver.  It is a smooth shave with a tiny massage while the hairs are coming off your chinny chin chin.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I must mention that this product was provided to me via a program run by Gilette that I agreed to participate in.  I am glad I did.  It has changed my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> The handle is better than other Gillette handles as it is relatively light weight, but still heavy enough to feel well built.</li>
            <li> Was a little shocked when I 1st treid this razor as it was noting like I had ever shaved with before but after a few minites of shaving I noticed it was a much closer shave then ever before and it was like getting a massage while you shaved. Not on nick or cut great design and blade another A+ for Gillette. (When I log into our account it shows my wifes nome not sure how to change it but I am a guy)I recivedcGillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor for FREE via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a hand held razor since I started shaving, just can&#x27;t remember when I started!! I have always liked a hand held razor, but never really loved them. After trying the Gillette Fusion Proglide I was utterly amazed!! There was no drag or chaffing of my skin or hair, and the best part of all it was a free program by Gillette!! The feel of the handle was very comfortable and felt very natural in my hand!! I am sold of this new product!! If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet do yourself a favor and try it I guarantee you will be astonished by the comfort of the shave and feel of he razor!!</li>
            <li> I recently tried out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle razor and was pleasantly surprised... I am used to either a regular razor or my cordless/electric one and gave the ProGlide a shot, hoping it wouldn&#x27;t irate me or cut me up. What I found was a nice clean and smooth result when I was done, The power handle adds more to the shave I feel and definitely plan to continue using it!</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Fusion ProGlide Power free from a program run by Gillette. Prior to this I really never put much stock into a power razor, having used Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 for a long time and being quite content with it. But since the opportunity came up to give this a shot I figured it was worth trying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately impressed with how smooth the shave was and how much closer it felt. The razor has a nice weight and balance and I definitely feel like the electronic pulses, combined with the thinner blades, make it a far better shaving experience than the Mach 3 without any cuts or nicks. Weather using gel, foam or even a sugar-based shaving scrub, the Fusion ProGlide just glides across my face and consistently gives me a very close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has become my every day razor, and I especially noticed the difference when I had to travel recently and used a travel Mach 3. It felt almost primitive compared to the Fusion ProGlide Power. Whether shaving with or against the grain, I don&#x27;t notice any difference in the ease of which it cuts hair and I also find I have no irritation in areas that I previously did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly costs a bit more than other razor, but you&#x27;re paying for a far superior overall experience and it&#x27;s well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I got this razor free from Gillette thanks to a program they were running. This razor seems similar to the regular Gillette Fusion (which is the razor I use), except this one has a AAA battery that makes it vibrate. The vibration makes this Fusion feel a little like an electric razor -- or how I remember an electric razor feeling, because I haven&#x27;t used one in years. The sensation wasn&#x27;t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave. In my experience, though, it doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m getting a shave that is any better or closer than I get with my regular, non-power Fusion. And the vibration seemed to make me go more slowly. So, this razor isn&#x27;t really delivering a closer shave, it&#x27;s taking me longer to shave, and I found the vibration to be annoying. It&#x27;s not something I intend to use. If any of this seems intriguing to you, though, you may want to try it out.</li>
            <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette. I gotta say this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have used it a minimum of 5 times and I&#x27;ve never gotten any cuts (unlike some other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past). It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin and I get a close shave. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of a vibrating blade razor, but it really does lend itself to a super close shave. The heft of the handle is comparable to handles of higher quality (and price). Definitely a must purchase!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I deliberately did not shave for two days to give this Gillette Fusion Proglide a run for its money and it passed the test with flying colors it gave me a clean smooth shave. A thumbs up goes to this razor!!!</li>
            <li> I received a free razor  provided via a program run by Gillette. Having viewed a commercial for the product, I thought it sounded too good to be true.  But I was pleasantly surprised by the shave the Gillette Fusion ProGlide provided.  The first thing I noticed was the design of the handle.  It is comfortable to hold and maneuver, with grips that prevent slipping.  The blade glides over the skin and leaves a close shave.  There is no drag on any part of my face.  I used a shave gel instead of cream with the razor and received a perfectly close shave.  I tried shaving with the vibration off and with it on and I believe that having it on made a slight difference.  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because the price of replacement blades are expensive.  Hopefully, I can go longer between blade changes.  I like the fact that it has an automatic shut-off after eight minutes in case of accidental activiation.</li>
            <li> Being in the Army, having a clean shaven face is incredibly important.  If I show up with stubble or cuts all over my face it looks really bad and is, in face, against regulation.  So having a razor that works is something I Need.  I was happy to receive the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power via a program run by Gillette to review as I&#x27;m always looking for a better razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to stick with Gillette razors anyways, but hadn&#x27;t tried this one yet.  When I saw that it is the #1 Dermatologist recommended razor my interest was peaked even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with this razor.  The thin/fine blades glided across my face, leaving me smooth yet still feeling good.  No cuts, no razor burn!  I have shaved almost every day with this (I have one other Gillette that I use, too) and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I switched from my mach 3 to this razor a month ago.  This thing is fantastic!  The handle is comfortable and the shave is sooooooo close with zero razor burn!</li>
            <li> The vibrations on the razor was a nice touch. The handle was comfortable as long as the price came down I would buy it.</li>
            <li> I just got a sample of this razor from Gillette the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Power handle and I have to say its not much more different than the older Fusion. It does seems to be a bit more smoother shave than older Fusion. The new handle is great and is comfortable to hold while I shave. Overall it provides a great shave and would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. An exceptional shaving experience that left my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind. I let my face go for 5 days and the razor had no problem powering through the rug on my face. The blades cleaned out very easy just by runnung under water, tapping of the razor on the inside of the sink was no necessary. The only downside was initially getting used to the power aspect of the razor. At first it felt like it was going to slice right into my face but, after a few strokes it was no problem. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> The handle is very lightweight and easy to maneuver. I tried shaving with the power on and off and the power function definitely is an improvement. I seems to reduce friction. Very good design. . My thanks to Gillette&#x27;s promotional program that gave me the product to review.</li>
            <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette.  I had seen this razor in store, but held off buying it because I thought the power feature was just a gimmick.  I was surprised how much I liked the new handle.  The handle was easy to hold and the grip was comfortable even when wet.  Paired with the power blade, I got a terrific shave with no irritation.  Definitely would recommend that you give this razor a try.</li>
            <li> When I first received the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide via a program by Gillette, I looked at the handle and laughed. It was only before I put the handle in my hands that I realized that I had one of the lightest handles I have ever used. When you first look at the handle and see that is bulky than the original ProGlide razor handle you laugh. The handle itself is larger in the core area (\\&quot;tip to razor attachment area\\&quot;) because of where the AAA battery is placed. However with or without the battery, the blade is lighter. I not only could feel the difference in holding it but a scale shows the difference easily. I was truly shocked at how light handle itself is compared to I have been using which is the ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the handle is easy. On the center front of the handle, the power button is located. Its position on the handle easily allows you to trigger the power without needing to feel around the handle for the button. Despite its bulkier width, I found that this handle was more user friendly. At no time did I find myself fighting to figure out how to use it. The handle is truly amazing that in its larger size, it is lighter than any handle I have come in contact with. I have to give this handle five stars as I have been amazed by it in my trial runs. Gillette did an amazing job in the design and features of this handle.</li>
            <li> I was provided a Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power handle free of charge to review by a program run by Gillete.  The Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power handle has a good feel in your hand.  It is not so skinny that you feel like you are going to drop it.  Shaving without the handle turned is like any other shave.  Turn on the power handle and get ready for the shake.  The first couple of shaves I actually had trouble keeping a grip of the razor.  I had what I called the ProGlide Shake.  After the first couple of shaves, I get use to the vibration the have not had any issues with loosing my grip.  You can definitely tell that the overall shave is better with the handle turned on.  This handle is a success.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is all that it says and more. I received a sample razor via a program run by Gillette to test the razor. It appears to be the same as any other razor in this line, however once powered on, it truly glides across the beard and what typically took me 3 or 4 passes was achieved in 1. I have recommended this razor to friends and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> It seems like we are constantly seeing ads for &#x27;new&#x27; razors with an extra blade, closer shave, etc.  I&#x27;ve got 1 Norelco electric razor and 1 standard razor....both of which I use regularly depending on how long it&#x27;s been between shaves.  They both work fine and I figured these ads are just another gimmick for another razor.....so I got my free Power ProGlide from Gillette for trial and intended to use it with an open mind but was not expecting much.  It had been several days since shaving and at this point I usually only shave in the shower to get an easier and more gentle shave.  I was in a hurry and needed a shave before leaving (no shower) so I figured it would be a good time to test this Powered ProGlide.  To my amazement, it really does feel like an electric razor and was not tugging on the long hairs at all...and gave a nice, clean shave.  I was very impressed.  Normally a regular razor on longer hair is a bit painful if not done in the shower.  I&#x27;m a fan!!  I will be continuing to use this razor</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Power is a great razor. I received the free razor from a program run by Gillette. I have used Gillette all of my life. I liked the power handle. When I shave with the fusion power it feels smoother than with a regular razor. I think my skin does not get irritated at easily. The handle grips are great it&#x27;s easy to hold to help prevent nicks. I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I received the razor via a program run by Gillette.The razor provides a very clean and close shave without causing any nicks or cuts. The handle feels good in your hand and the razor is easily cleaned. The only feature that I did not care for was the vibration one. I tried the razor with and without using the vibration function and did not notice any difference in the shave. However, this is till a great product to use.</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Power Glide Handle and razor from a gillette program.  I have tried all the Gillette razors in the past, but this one takes the cake.  My skin is smooth and it is not irritated.  Even their previous tries at sensitive skin razors don&#x27;t even come close to th eshave you get with this.  I have used Gillette razors since I started shaving, only because of habit....now I will use this one because it actually is the best out there.</li>
            <li> I tend to shy away from new products as my neck is very sensitive and will get a rash if I use the wrong razor.  I received a free trial of the razor so I gave it a shot.  This razor did a good job overall and did not cause too much discomfort.  I would recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received the ProGlide Power Handle and a free blade as part of a promotional program from Gillette. I was very impressed. The handle felt very good in my hand.  It was very easy to grip. I also got a very smooth and close shave.  I absolutely love Gillette products. They are always coming out with very innovative products.  So far, this has been my favorite razor that Gillette has come out with.  I will continue to use this razor for all of my shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out saying all razors cause me some pain during the cutting process.  These Proglide cartridge are the best of the bunch though.  I had never bought the power handle before even though it had been out for years. Frankly it caused my gimmick radar to go off.  Turns out its the best solution so far to the pain I commonly have during cutting.  The vibrations that the handle puts out are strong enough to distract me from what it really going on.  That or the vibrations cause the hair to get cut in a different pattern.  Either way, it&#x27;s got me back to using a manual razor after years of using an electric razor.  This review is based on a promotional sample provided by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different multiple blade razors and electric shavers in the past, but have been exclusively using the Schick Quattro for the last 5 or 6 years. I have not been able to find anything that worked better for me. I have even been able to make the blade cartridges last up to 3 months by keeping it dry after using it and using shave gel instead of the foamy shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I received an invite from a program run by Gillette to try their new Fusion Proglide Power Handle Razor. So I signed up and waited and after only a few days, the razor arrived. I opened the brown box that it came in, and saw that it was enclosed in the Adult-Proof plastic that is near impossible to open. Imagine my delight when I turned it over and saw that there was perforations along the back for easy opening!! I quickly opened it and took the razor out. For a razor with disposable cartridges, this one has the look and feel of a non-disposable one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st Shave (2 days growth)&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use. This was a nice feeling. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Shave (2 days growth)&lt;br /&gt;Same as first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd Shave (3 days growth)&lt;br /&gt;Same as before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th Shave and every shave there after&lt;br /&gt;It pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; marks on my neck. The lubricating strip was almost gone, whereas the Quattro lasts as long as I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always rinsed clean easily with no clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, as much as I really wanted to like this, this razor receives only 2 stars from me for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Blades and lubricating strip do not last nearly as the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;- Although the first few shaves were smooth, I did not receive a closer shave than with the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;- Cost&lt;br /&gt;- Five bladed tends to nick my face more often than the Quattro or any other four bladed razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is definitely a nay!</li>
            <li> I generally use a standard razor with disposable blades because I have experienced irritation when using electric razors in the past. Because of past negative experiences with electric razors I had not been tempted to try any of the battery-operated semi-power razors, but I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor for the past few weeks due to a free program from Gillette to try this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the handle is larger than the razor I typically use (Mach3), but it is pretty light and I quickly got used to it and it did not feel awkward in my hand or during my shave. The blade head is much larger than I am used to due to the 5 blades. While this made shaving my neck and most of my face quicker and easier, the larger head made shaving more \\&quot;precision\\&quot; areas like my upper lip and chin a little difficult as I felt like the razor was not able to contour easily to the chin fold or part of the upper lip just below the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor both with the power on and off. While the slight vibration while shaving with the razor power on was pleasant, I did not notice a major difference in the closeness of the shave I got while using the razor with the power off. With the power on though, I did not experience the same irritation that I have in the past when using full electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been happy in the past with other Gillette products that I use, and I would recommend this razor to friends who were curious in trying it. It&#x27;s a little pricier than non-power options, but for me it seems a better value than buying a full electric razor. I am taking one star off my review due to the slight difficulty of shaving precision areas with the large blade head.</li>
            <li> Just got this razor free as part of a Gillette program and was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ve used other similar razors (powered, multiple blades, etc), and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  But this is the first razor that I felt really gripped the skin (without irritation or cuts) and delivered a crazy-close shave.  And I mean CLOSE (like close enough for the wife to comment on it).  I don&#x27;t know if the power component helped, but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt.  Highly recommend this.  Check it out if you&#x27;re tired of cuts, cheap plastic handles, or any of the other myriad complaints about the other brands.</li>
            <li> Please note that I received this handle for free via a program run by Gillette.  However, the following review is not sponsored by anyone and is solely my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a lazy person when it comes to shaving.  I counteract this by using a Norelco SensoTouch 3D electric razor.  But there are moments, meetings, social events, and my wife&#x27;s request for a closer shave that no electric razor can accomplish.  For those shaves, I must use a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle will be my handle of choice, since it is such a great transition handle from my electric razor.  It provides me real razor blades with vibration for a less painful shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use this handle for a few weeks before writing a review.  Here are my conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vibration: I was excited by this.  Using an electric razor, I am used to not feeling anything, no snag or tug.  I was hoping that the vibration would reduce what I felt when using a manual razor.  So what I did was use the vibration on half my face and not use it on the other half.  Each time I did I could feel a significant increase in my shaving comfort with the vibration on.  I also tested the quality of my shave (I had my wife rub her hands on my cheek) and there was no difference.  I really enjoy the vibration feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel:  The handle fits my hand comfortably and is simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick release: This is a common feature but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage: I enjoy the simple plastic holder that comes with the handle.  It could even be considered elegant among other grooming supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the battery comes with the package: Thank you Gillette for actually having some consideration that your customers don&#x27;t have a stash of AAA batteries at home.  Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  I will still be an electric razor user 90% of the time, but for that 10%, this handle will help me achieve the close shave.</li>
            <li> I am typically an electric razor user. I hate nicks and the feeling of razor burn... plus I am not a big fan of the mess of the shaving cream and the stubble a razor leaves in the sink. Usually, it is much easier to just run the electric razor over my face on the way out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I say easy?&lt;br /&gt;Gillete gave me a free promo Fusion ProGlide to try out. It was like the best of both worlds. An electric handle and the closeness of a blade. And the best part is that the blade is so great it just takes on pass over each area to provide a shave much smoother than my electric razor could ever do. Normally I need to make several passes; but not with the Fusion ProGlide. It actually took me less time to shave with Fusion ProGlide than my Electric to get even better results than the electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be wondering if the vibrating electric handle is just a gimmick. Nope! Not at all. I tried the Fusion ProGlide without the handle vibrating and the shave was everything I hate about blade razors. Turn the handle on and it is smoother than the electric and it only takes one pass instead of several. I had less irritation with the ProGlide than the electric. \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to get back into the bladed razor world. I recommend the Fusion ProGlide. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that it still makes a mess in the sink. However... you can take this \\&quot;electric\\&quot; ProGlide handle into the shower (it is waterproof) so if you have a mirror in there, you are all set.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor, the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. I mostly love it because of the razors handle! It&#x27;s easy to grip, fits comfortably in my hand, and allows me a closer shave then ever before. It&#x27;s better than any other handle I&#x27;ve used! I always assumed the best shave came from the number of blades but nowadays, with razors having more and more blades than the last model, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. This new handle really allows you to utilize all of the razors because it fits so comfortably. I can hold it more tightly, and confidently, and get the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Gillette gets an A+ on their new design, and I&#x27;m officially giving up my Schick razor!</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle from a Gillette sponsored program. The razor handle holds a battery and when run the cartridge micropulses. I feel this product gives me a closer shave, and feels more comfortable when shaving. Normally I get razor burn easily but not with this product. The handle is comfortable and a lot thicker than other razors I am used to so that makes it much easier to handle. At first I did not notice a closer shave, but now after about 1 week of consistent use I have noticed a difference. I would recommend this product to friends and plan on continuing to use myself.</li>
            <li> I was curious to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle.  I got it for free from a program run by Gillette.  I was impressed by the ability to hold the handle firmly, especially when using straight from the shower.  Regardless of wet or lotion hands, this handle stays put!  My shave was a smooth process, no slipping of the razor handle and a nice clean shave.  I was very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I recieved the  gillette fusion pro glide for free by a program gillette was having. I was skeptical at first.. But let me tell you this is a great razor. I have baby skin, seems like all other razors would cut my skin up pretty bad. With the nice sharp  razors and the added vibration works great. what a great shave. I have been ranting to my friends about what a great razor this is</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor from Gillette and was asked to offer my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly the best shave I have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head provides great razor to face contact throughout the shave. The multiple blades don&#x27;t miss anything. There is also a single blade on the back side of the razor head to get right up under the nose. The powered head helps get every whisker. It also has a great ergonomic, non-slip handle. Changing the blades couldn&#x27;t be easier, just press the button on the back and the old blade pops off. Press the razor into the new blade and it locks in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Last days I received this razor via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the razor I only could say this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, The new ergonomic design is perfect, and it&#x27;s much better than the others in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you have sensitive skin as do I then this razor is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I still don&#x27;t understand is about the use of the battery or vibrations for a better shave.... They need to explain the benefits on the box or somewhere...</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette ProGlide Fusion Power razor in connection with a promotional program sponsored by Gillette.  I&#x27;ve used Gillette shaving products almost exclusively since the original Sensor debuted in the early 1990s, so I was eager to try Gillette&#x27;s latest shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide Fusion Power features a large handle, a five-blade cartridge, and a battery-powered motor that produces \\&quot;micropulses\\&quot; (vibrations) during shaving.  I found the handle comfortable to hold, though I suspect its size has more to do with the need to accommodate an AAA battery than with ergonomic design considerations.  I found the five-blade cartridge a little too large for shaving comfortably around the mouth and under the nose (the razor includes a \\&quot;precision trimmer\\&quot; that&#x27;s intended to solve this problem, but I found it difficult to maneuver precisely enough to achieve the desired results).  I didn&#x27;t find the \\&quot;micropulse technology\\&quot; unpleasant in any way, but neither did I find that it discernibly enhanced the quality of my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong--the ProGlide Fusion Power delivered a very close, very comfortable shave...but I don&#x27;t think it outperformed the Gillette Mach3 Turbo razor that I&#x27;ve been using for the better part of ten years.  That razor delivers an equally close and equally comfortable shave, and it does it at a lower cost--the replacement cartridges are less expensive, and it doesn&#x27;t require batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ProGlide Fusion Power is a perfectly fine product, and I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from buying it. But, for me, the improvements in Gillette&#x27;s latest-generation shaving system aren&#x27;t compelling enough to make me switch.</li>
            <li> My Gillette Fusion Proglide experience has been nothing less than spectacular. Working at a corporate office, being in front of senior leadership, and trying to look as professional as I can at all times. Unfortunately in the past I&#x27;ve had razor burns, ingrown hairs, and to be honest it has been a bit embarrassing at times. I&#x27;ve had to use creams, tweezers to get ingrown hairs, or have had to endure the blemishes that have been left. After I received my free sample from a program Gillette was running, I used the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle and quickly saw and felt a change. The blades are smooth and with the vibrations, are able to eliminate the ingrown hair situation that I had been experiencing. There are no more red bumps, no more in grown hairs, and I feel like a new man. My skin is smooth, I don&#x27;t have to worry about hiding out due to blemishes, and I owe it to Gillette and their Fusion Proglide Power Handle!</li>
            <li> I love the handle on the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor. I received the razor free through a program being sponsored through Gillette. The rubber handle is comfortable, my grip doesn&#x27;t slip and the massaging lift and cut the gentle vibration of the handle provides an extra close shave that my girlfriend loves! I would definitely recommend this razor to family and friends alike.</li>
            <li> I shave at least once a day  and I use the Gillette Fusion Proglide because I get the best shave I can get at home with it.If you want to know what smooth is just you this razor.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Gillette for many years. So when I was approached by them to try their new product, I was really excited. I was sent the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power. The cartridges are better than any I have used before, leaving me with the closest, smoothest shave I have had in decades. It makes playing with my baby easier, as I am not afraid of irritating her skin. The handle is ergonomic, an fits my hands easily.</li>
            <li> I love this razor so so much! it leaves the cleanest cut and the grip is amazing! i love how it never slips even when wet and the size of the grips really gives a strong hold! This razor is easier to use then many razors because of the strong grip! I received this razor free from a program from Gillette and i am so glad i did! It is the best razor, with the best blades, and the best grip!!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a really nice handle. I have been a Fusion Power user for years. They got rid of the battery indicator that I never used nor did I think was accurate plus they added a nice blue LED light which makes it more up to date with the LED craze. I like the new grip too as it fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li> I was given a Fusion Proglide Power handle to test by Gillette. I&#x27;m not sure why it works, but it seems to make for a much smoother pull as I shave. I have tried the handle with the power on and off and with it off it still provides a good shave but seems to tug a little more. With the handle \\&quot;powered up\\&quot; it vibrates, although not noticeably on the face, and the shave is much smoother with no tug at all. Shaving is still not my favorite morning activity, but this power handle does make it much less of a chore.</li>
            <li> I tried this razor handle with both the power on and the power off to see if there was any difference in my shave and there was. With the power on the blades seemed to glide through the stubble effortlessly and with the power off there seemed to be a little drag across the skin. The handle is light and fits well in my handle and provides a secure grip so that it doesn&#x27;t slip. I would highly recommend this product! This razor was free from a Gillette promotion.&lt;br /&gt;The blades on this razor a OUTSTANDING. I purposely waited to let my stubble go for the weekend and shave on Monday like I do with my normal razor. Other razors have dragged or pulled the stubble causing great discomfort and razor burn. Sometimes even ingrown hairs. This razor however cut through the stubble with no pulling or dragging. The shave was effortless and the blades rinsed clean each time I ran them under the water. Other blades get clogged and are hard to get clean. The lubricating strip glides across the skin and I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I haves used this same razor about 6 times now and it still seems as sharp as day 1. My beard is tough and it really dulls the blades on other razors but so far this razor has surpassed all the others.&lt;br /&gt;The single blade trimmer that is on the back of the blades is great for shaving right under my nose where I can&#x27;t get with the regular set of blades. This is a great option to have all in one product. I am officially switching my razor to Gillette Fusion Power!!!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle free of charge from Gillette.  I have been a long time user of Gillette products and was very excited to try out this new razor and I must say I was not disappointed.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle gave me a very close shave and did not irritate my skin.  I really like the shape of the handle as it made shaving different areas of my beard much easier and to my surprise the vibration did not make the razor jump and nick my skin.  Overall, I think Gillette has come up with a great new razor that I personally plan to keep using in the future.</li>
            <li> This is as good of an at-home shaving experience as you can ask for! The blades, the power, the combination of the two make this my favorite razor of all time. The blades seem to last longer than otehr blades I&#x27;ve used, even the standard fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I got the product as a free promotion from Gillette. At first I thought the vibrating was a gimmick. I enjoyed it once I tried it though. The vibrating gives you a slightly more comfortable feeling. It&#x27;s not like an amazing thing, but I found myself turning it on every day, even though it would be easy to just pick it up and shave. The weight of the handle and battery feels pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> When i got this sample Gillette Proglide Power razor i honestly didn&#x27;t know what to do with it. I have a full beard and typically have no use for a razor and use a electric shaver just to trim. Well luckily for this lonely razor sitting on my desk for a week i was scheduled for a minor surgery in a fairly sensitive area and was notified i had to be shaven completely with a razor. Scared out of my mind to put a sharp object in such a sensitive area i sucked it up and went to town. Much to my surprise it was effortless with the lubricating strip assisting the razor to glide over the nooks and uneven skin with the vibrating of the razor doing away with hair effortlessly. The end result was very smooth hairless skin even got compliments from the doctor and nurse. I will be using this razor next time I need to do away with unwanted hair and be left with smooth supple skin.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a little scared to put this vibrating razor on my face!  When I first started shaving, I was a little taken back from the vibrations.  Within a minute, I was loving it.  It really feels great and provided me with a wonderful shave.  The free razor was thin and did not leave me with any razor burn or stubble.  Awesome razor!</li>
            <li> I was previously using the Schick 5 blade I got on sale from the store (8 razors for $10 bucks).  It was comparable 5 blades, flex head, easy grip handle...etc.  I must say the Gilette is 10X better comparatively.  The blades are sharper and leaves a much closer shave.  I will buy more blades for the Gilette and leave my old schick blades for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free thru a program of Gillette. First off the handle has a great shape and really gives u a good grip on it while shaving. The battery operated vibration seemed to produce a closer shave. Also cleaning it was a breeze with the flow through design of the shaving head. Will definately keep using in place of my other razor.</li>
            <li> I got a handle and a cartridge for free from the manufacturer and decided to try it out.  Normally, I never would have bought this cartridge as I&#x27;m a regular user of an old-school safety blade razor which works great for me.  I have to say that the despite my happiness with my old standby safety razor, this new cartridge really did a great job.  I was surprised with how easy it was to use and how well it worked.  If you&#x27;re looking for this type of blade, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> This gillette razor is not unlike their other products, the feel is only slightly different from my previous fusion razor, but i think the difference here is the blades. i have become rather lazy and rarely use shaving cream any more. with these blades it is not a problem and they significantly reduce the amount of razor burn. perhaps that actually has a bit more to do with the weight distribution of the handle than i attributed, but nevertheless these blades do a better job, hands down. i received this product for free from gillette, which was awesome, and will definitely be stocking up on the blades, i am not crazy about the chrome color, but at the end of the day it is merely the color of your razor, not something to ruin your day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this around in stores and wondered why would buy a powdered razor.  It seemed \\&quot;gimicky.\\&quot;  The extra base cost plus cost of batteries - I just stayed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for good reason, since I&#x27;ve been using a normal Fusion Pro-Glide for years and it&#x27;s worked very well. Quite honestly I would not have ever had used a Fusion Pro-Glide Power if Gillete had not sent me one for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I like it alot.  In fact I think it be one of those rare instances were fixin&#x27; something that ain&#x27;t broken actually made it better.  And why?  For me it came down to two huge reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This razor shaves close and cleanly more so than the non-powered version on the first pass. I actually didn&#x27;t have to go over any spots on my face like I normally do with the non-powered version&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The vibration action is a monumental help in getting hairs off the razor.  Under running water all the trapped hairs come off almost instantly which for me is a big plus so I&#x27;m not sitting there banging my razor against the side of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the one detraction from this razor is getting used to the vibration action.  I&#x27;m still not 100% used to it, and even after multiple shaves now, I still feel kind of uneasy about bringing it to my face, but hey no cuts yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great razor that demonstrates a significant improvement over the original product.  While I&#x27;m not sure how long the battery will last, I say that the marginal cost over the non-powered version is worth it as an initial investment, and I don&#x27;t feel that keeping the thing juiced with AAA batteries is going to break the bank.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle razor is a good mix of an electric razor with the convenience of a standard hand held razor.  I was pleasantly surprised that it had the power to leave a nice clean shave on such a small battery.  Other electric razors and trimmers usually have had moments of painful pinching of the hairs, but after several uses, I have not had any such issues with this product.  The handle was comfortable to hold, even while vibrating and wet.  The razor is easy to clean just running it under the tap.  As a dad constantly on the go, it takes up very little counter space and it is easy to take on the go.  In the past I typically would use Gillette sensor or Mach 3 razors, but as a promotion Gillette was having, I was able to try this product for free which was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I received the razor free from a program by Gillette and boy was I glad.  The power handle helps the awesome razor heads give a nice close shave while still be comfortable and slick.&lt;br /&gt;The battery powered handle vibrates nicely letting you get the close shave.  The handle is comfortable and considering I shave in the shower, it has grips so I don&#x27;t drop it!  The power button, I have to say, it pretty awesome and glow blues.  It might be the little kid in me, but that blew my mind.  This razor is going to replace my vibrating three blade razor that everyone seemed to use a few years ago.  I would recommend it to my friends and family because of the comfort, style and ease of use.  Good job Gillette you got this one done right.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of different Razor&#x27;s after using many I finally settled on \\&quot;\\&quot;Sensor 3\\&quot;\\&quot; as other razors do not suit me so I never switched to any other. But then when I was given the opportunity to try this razor via a program from Gillette I thought why not.So I received my ProGlide and tried it the next morning and BAM right away It didn&#x27;t feel the usual usual feeling of shaving It just glided over my skin the vibrations were soothing and the well designed handle felt good in my hand.I will say that throughout my shave I felt nothing but amazing painless smooth shave. Now finally I have razor with which I do not have burning sensation after shaving. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion Proglide, which was acquired through a Gillette sponsored program for me to try out, I was excited.  There is nothing like the first clean shave of a brand new razor.  The handle feels great. Comfortable grip that allows me to feel in control of all the contours and hills on my face.  I enjoy the power option in the handle but I&#x27;m not exactly sure if it is a difference maker in the overall shave. I have used this razor now about a half dozen times and have loved the feel. It also holds the blade securely. I have had problems in the past with other razors that the blade pops off in the middle of shaving or even if its dropped. No problems with this one loosing it&#x27;s head. though I have not dropped it either.  Great overall handle!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to try this product because it seemed to be a bunch of hype. When Gillette sent me a ProGlide Power Razor I had nothing to lose. After years of being a traditional Gillette blade shaver I have seen a remarkable difference in the quality of the shave provided by the Power Glide. Great job Gillette!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power was given to me through a promotion run through Gillette. I did not have high expectations when I first received the product but after using the razor for a few weeks I have completely made the switch to this product. The Trimmer is very nice for a lot of the harder to shave areas the full razor can not get properly. The Power handle allows for a much smoother closer shave than my old Mach 3 razor. I was very impressed with how well this product worked and suggest it to anyone who shaves on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70yrs old and have been using an electric razor as long as I can remember because I have sensitive skin and get razor burn, I do, however, feel the shave of an electric razor isn&#x27;t as close as manual. This product combines the best of both technologies. The vibration cuts down on friction to the face like an electric shaver and eliminates razor burn, while at the same time giving you the close shave only a manual razor can provide. The batteries and razor blade were still going strong after shaving daily for over a week (my beard is coarse). I highly recommend this product to people who get razor burn but miss that clean close shave. Happy to report razor burn hasn&#x27;t been an issue at all since I switched!</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and was not disappointed.  Compared to disposable razors, this has a bigger handle with side grips that is easier for a man with large hands to hold on to.  I didn&#x27;t expect the battery in the hand razor to be very useful, but the vibration surprisingly helps during shaving and allowed me a very close and smooth shave that my wife loved!  I loved it because it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and seemed to be adequately lubricated.  After about 3 weeks I have not had to change the cartridge and the battery life is holding up as well.</li>
            <li> This Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor is the most amazing razor I have ever used. When I got it out of the package, provided to me free by Gillette, I thought it would be just another normal shave.Was I ever wrong! It is so easy to use and you do not have to press hard for the shave. I am still just totally amazed. It shaves more smoothly and faster than any razor I have ever used. Before this razor I dreaded going into the bathroom to shave. Now I jump up and get the job done. No burning or bad spots after the shave.</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide handle feels very good in the hand and the vibration, in combination with an excellent blade, provides an extremely close shave on a serious beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(FYI, I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor free via a program run by Gillette.)</li>
            <li> Up front: I was provided a free GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE for review via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave maybe once every 2-3 weeks. I usually let my beard grow out, get sick of it and then get rid of it. I use a pair of electric clippers to trim my beard down to \\&quot;shaveable\\&quot; levels and then have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I&#x27;ve used a Gillette Mach 3 razor and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it. Honestly, anything that scrapes the hair off my face and doesn&#x27;t leave me bleeding is pretty much OK in my book. But, since I was given a free razor to try out I figured I&#x27;d give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two main differences between what I&#x27;m accustomed to with the Mach 3 handle and the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor handle are 1) the handle for the Fusion Proglide is larger, more ergonomic and heavier; 2) the handle for the Fusion is powered (by a AAA battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the handle is that it has considerable heft to it compared to the Mach 3. I&#x27;m sure the battery is most of the weight, but the handle is also a little bigger and contoured (unlike the Mach 3 which is pretty much just a straight shaft). The contours on the handle made it much easier to grip and maneuver with. There&#x27;s a bulbous end to the handle, which is slightly larger than the rest of the handle, and it made it easy for me to pinch and pivot the handle in my finger tips to get under my neck and chin line.  Plus, the heft of the handle really felt good in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powered handle and the vibration it supplied to the blade definitely felt soothing when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I do enjoy the handle and I will continue using it for the time being. I like the size, shape and weight of it compared to the Mach 3 handle.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette to try out.  The razor works well and provides a close shave. However, I struggle with the necessity for battery operated vibration on my razor.  I didn&#x27;t get any additional utility out of that feature and feel it drove the price point up a bit too high for the item.  While this isn&#x27;t a bad razor, the price point and unnecessary features will probably be cause not to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a free promotion run by Gillette. The razor performed well and gave me a close up and neat shave. I have been using this razor well over a week. In the last couple of days I really wanted to put it to the test so I took it as the only razor while I traveled in the States. The razor performed flawlessly and as advertised.  The razor head is easy to snap on and snap off , so all you really have to do is buy new razor heads. When you turn on the razor it vibrates which makes the shaving much easier and smoother. The only complaint I have is the packaging is nearly impossible to get into.</li>
            <li> Recently received a Proglide Power Razor via a program run by Gillete, and was absolutely amazed by the quality. I have fairly sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m fairly picky when it comes to razors. I usually shave every other day and also tend to get an irritation on my neck in one spot repeatedly. To my amazement, no irritation after using the proglide power!!! The best part is the shaves actually seem to get better the longer I use it. Definitely a high quality shave that far exceeds what you pay. Very light and east to store. I would highly recommend this razor to all types of shavers out there.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette. I did enjoy this razor and I felt it gave me a very good shave, however the power was a lot less than I had imagined. I would buy refills for this product but I am not sure I would replace it. The price is actually pretty decent, and the Gillette brand is one I respect. I do like this razor overall.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best bladed razor I have used in a long time.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now for both facial and occasional head shaving and it&#x27;s worked VERY well.  I love that the vibration helps clean the blades.  I&#x27;ve been VERY happy with the razor and will definitely continue to use this as my go-to razor from now on.  The razor was provided to me by a free program from Gillette.  That said, I&#x27;d buy it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is great and gets extra close, but it seems like the battery runs out kinda quickly.  Like all Gillette products, I love the quality of the shave I get, and with this razor I can really trim up around my beard and have nice clean lines.  The price is ok, especially since I was able to try it for free through a special promotion through Gillette, but the refills are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from a program sponsored by Gillette about a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In comparison the regular Fusion I previously used this is a significant improvement. I found it hard to believe that this razor could be better than my current razor but I was surprised on how better it was. My only complaint is that even though the shave mas smooth most of the time I could not get a smooth shave when I shave against the grain which is what I was really hoping it could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the razor is a good value considering the quality and the longevity of the blades, it takes some time for the blades to dull.</li>
            <li> First of all I will start off by I received this razor for free in exchange for my honest opinion. So here it is. My hair grows really fast so I have to shave constantly. I usually purchase a large package of shick and sometimes gillette disposable razors due to how quick the blades go out. When trying this product they made it seem as though there was something new and great about it. How soft the handle is......which it is. And how there is a trimmer and razor together......which it is. But it was a lot of talk and no action. This razor gave me the same shave as if I had used the ones I always do except it cost the same amount for one of these as it does for 12 of the other. Yes there is convenience with the addition of the trimmer. But all they did was take to okay things and put them together, call them great, and charger more for refills. Personally if it cost $2.00 I would buy it other than that I will stick with buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from a Gillete sponsored program. This razor gave me the closest shave ever!!! I didn&#x27;t get a bunch of red bumps like I do from other razors. The handle worked great. I have to shave in the shower and never once lost grip of the razor. All around great razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from a program run by Gillette: So happy i got to try it! The power handle is awesome. I love that the first battery is even included, ive had mine for over a month and still haven&#x27;t had to change the battery either. The vibration from this razor makes the hair on my face stick up more so i get a great shave. It also helps energize me a bit by keeping me awake during my 5am shave every morning.</li>
            <li> The Gilette Fusion ProGlide exceeded my expectations for a manual razor. This razor was provided to me via a program run by Gilette. It is lightweight even with a battery for the vibration. The rubber grips helps me keep a handle on it since I shave in the shower. It is a very close shave with no irritation. The 5 blades and the vibration help limit the &#x27;snagging&#x27; around my jaw and chin. The only downfall I found was the trim blade on the back is useless. It was too small to trim anything.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. I find it very easy to use and the wife enjoys the close shave. The only down side is the price of the replacement blades. Other than that I would recommend to any guy out there</li>
            <li> my husband loves these! very easy and clean shave and very durable! we never really used the battery operated function though</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power for over a year.  I recently received a free one from a program run by Gillette.  I think this razor handle is one of the best around and I recommend it if you&#x27;re thinking about buying one.  The rubbery grip stays in your hand very well - I shave in the shower quite often and have no problems.  Apparently, the battery compartment is water-tight, because I haven&#x27;t had any problems with using the razor in the shower.  The battery provides the \\&quot;Power\\&quot;, which is really just a vibrating motion to the razor blade cartridge.  The motion does help reduce drag and allow the razor to glide across my face with less resistance.  All in all, this is a great razor handle and I enjoy using it.  If I could change anything about it, I&#x27;d make it heavier.  I like the feel of a hefty razor handle and this one is on the light side, especially if you remove the battery.  Otherwise, this truly is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick/coarse facial hair, and this makes it difficult most times to shave consistently.  Most razors dull after just 1-2 shaves, and even within the first shave will typically catch pretty often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the case with the ProGlide Power Handle and blade.  The blade, being so thin, doesn&#x27;t catch like most other blades.  Which makes for a very happy face afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The Power Handle itself was a scary concept at first.  I don&#x27;t want something buzzing on my face that&#x27;s also slicing so close to the skin!  But after a few moments of hesitation, I tried it out, and was pleasantly surprised.  It&#x27;s hard to say if it did a hugely better job, as I was still marveling at the clean smooth cuts from the blade itself, but it did seem to make it easier.  It seems that in any situation where it might start catching(getting dull), this might help the blades last a bit longer, as it&#x27;ll be moving more to cut through the hair, without actually pulling.  I haven&#x27;t gotten the blade dull enough yet after 2 shaves to be able to tell though.&lt;br /&gt;Even with the battery in the handle, the weight of the razor was just right, not overly heavy to burden my hand, not overly bulky either, just a good solid handle.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Proglide Power Handle as a promotion from Gillette, but I would be more than willing to make this purchase on my own.</li>
            <li> I love this new handle that features a  bigger, more ergonomic side grips, that allows me to get a good grip, even when wet. Me being a person who shaves in the shower Im not as nervous now that Im going to nick myself while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;It now includes a \\&quot;power on\\&quot; light that flashes when you&#x27;re running low on juice, having that heads up is great!!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
            <li> I received this as a free product sample from a program offered by Gillette Fusion Proglide. this is by far the best razor i have bought for my husband. he loved it. the handle was super easy to hold on to. will be buying this for him again, maybe even using one for myself.</li>
            <li> This was a totally new experience for me.  I received the razor via a program run by Gillette, and boy was I happy I did.  The razor handle was easy to grip and handle, and the vibrating handle made all the difference in the world for a nice, close shave.  I&#x27;ll definitely be using this from now on!</li>
            <li> Recently received free Gillette Proglide power razor via a program run by Gillette.Intially was excited to use it.The blades did a great job of keeping my face smooth and clean for long but the handle was just like other average or cheap brands.Would not spend my money on buying this one.</li>
            <li> Starting out I thought this would be a bit of of a letdown. I fully expected the &#x27;power&#x27; functionality to make a negligible difference in my shave quality of comfort. However, I will go ahead and say it, I was wrong. The shave with this razor really is &#x27;closer&#x27; than the non-power 4 blade Gillete razor I usually rock. How much is due to 5 blades instead of 4 and how much is power I can only guess. Lastly, I have less irritation after using this razor than the usual which is nice.</li>
            <li> I received this razor to try as part of a promo from Gillette.  I have to say I was definitely impressed.  It cam with Gillette fusion shave cream and between the vibrating razor and the cream, I got a comfortable close shave.  It also came with a scrub and a cooling balm which were nice, but the razor was the real star.  I am very particular with the razors I use and I really like the performance of this one .</li>
            <li> I am used to using the regular plain ol jane gillete razor. It is my favorite, my holy grail, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I was excited to step out of the norm and try this battery powered razor by gillete. I liked the razor but I think I will stick with mt regular gillete razor without the battery power. It kind of irritated my skin and just didn&#x27;t work for me. The price of this razor just isn&#x27;t worth it. I still enjoy Gillete products and look forward to trying more out in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this razor free from Gillette about a month ago and put it into my daily rotation.  I&#x27;ve used it almost daily since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: The handle was solid,  easy to grip, and was not slippery when shaving fresh out of the shower. The handle fit the hand well, and I was able to maneuver the blade well enough to get a close shave everywhere.  A battery was included for the power/vibration function(I would be unlikely to buy one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not sold on: The vibration functionality.  I shaved with the micropulse feature both on and off. I did not detect a noticable difference in the smoothness of the shave.  Perhaps I will have my wife act as an impartial observer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: The handle only came with one blade.It is rare that I make the upgrade to a new handle, without buying a good supply of blades, these should be packaged with more than a single blade.</li>
            <li> GILLETTE® FUSION® PROGLIDE POWER RAZOR was provided to me free of cost via a program run by Gillette. I am thankful to Gillette to provide me this opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;I would say it&#x27;s the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving.It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin too.This is a great razor and the electric function is a bit odd at first but you get used to pretty quickly.Like the Grip in the handle.Much better than the previous versions.</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette fusion pro glide razor free of charge through a program run by Gillette. I have to say I really liked the razor it was comfortable to hold and never slipped out of my hand when I was shaving in the shower.  I also must add that I have never had a problem with any other razor I used in the shower. It is a bigger handle then I am used to but it wasn&#x27;t a problem holding it or shaving with it.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from Gillette, and I was skeptical because I use a 3 blades, and I&#x27;m very picky about what razor I use. 5 blades seemed like a bit much, but I tried it because honestly, it was free and why not? This thing is so cool! The vibrations help mow down thick beard hairs, and the 5 blades uses less strokes than my 3 blade. It&#x27;s also got this 1 little precision blade on the back to get the side burns with out trimming all your hairs off. This was really smooth and I would recommend it because it made a believer out of me, and I don&#x27;t like to try anything new!</li>
            <li> After years of using cheap, disposable razors, I was given a Fusion ProGlide Power through a promotional program run via Gillette. The difference was incredible. I had always thought that the razor market was filled with commodity products, but this morning my eyes were open to what I have been missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery/vibrating aspect is still a bit mystifying to me (and potentially just added fluff), but it will be very hard for me to go back to my cheap disposables again.</li>
            <li> This is no ordinary razor.  I&#x27;ve used everything from cheap disposable razors to expensive electric razors.  This razor by far gave the best shave possible.  The fact that the Fusion Proglide is powered, sets this apart from other manufacturers razors.  This razor is very comfortable to handle which is important in a razor.  I tested to see if the vibrating handle made a difference in my shaving.  All I have to say is WOW.  The razor with out being turned on seemed to give a shave that was very uncomfortable.  After turning this razor on you could tell a difference right away.  This is a winner.</li>
            <li> For a few years now I have been using the fusion proglide razors.  I got the fusion Powerglide through a program that Gillette was running and it has replaced my proglide for everyday use.  I do notice that there is a distinct difference in the amount of pulling that I feel while shaving and my my shave does feel a bit smoother.  The one thing keeping me from giving it the full 5 stars it that it seems like I do go through blades faster than with the proglide.  With the cost of blades that is definitely a major drawback.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is a great product for creating a clean shave.  The handle was a nice size and easy to grip.  The addition of power, in other words, a vibrating surface gives a cleaner shave without pulling or tearing - even usable on very light growth without shaving cream or water. The razor was provided free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> When the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor was first released I was more than hesitant to give it try. It seemed to be too much of a gimmick to me at first glance. I was overly concerned that mixing a regular razor with a vibrating function would lead to my cutting myself up and if I wanted an electric razor I would use that instead.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide is the best of both worlds. I have used the razor for 3 weeks, shaving my face and head daily. The vibrating function and improved blades allow me to get a close shave on my head without making repeated passes on the contour areas (2 passes on those trouble areas may be needed). The handle is surprisingly thin to contain a battery. There is an improved grip on the blade side of the razor that allows a better hold when the handle is wet.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend giving this razor a chance. My fears of nicks, cuts and a handle that is to large were completely unfounded.</li>
            <li> I recieved  this  razor thru a program run by Gillette.This is a great razor and the battery power makes it even better. The blades last a long time so although they appear expensive, on a per use basis, they are not. Just got back from a trip with a 15 day old beard and it cut right through it without a problem. Best razor ever!</li>
            <li> I received this razor from a program run by Gillette. I shaved daily with this. First of all I love the blade. It has lasted me almost a month and that daily shaving, beard and head! It gives a nice shave too perhaps it is because of the micro built in comb in the razor blade. I however do not use the power on this razor. I turned on the power a few times and first of all it did not feel natural to me so it was kind of uncomfortable. Second, I did not notice a closer shave or anything of that sort when i turned on the razor. I did love the blade. I will definitely buy these blade again. I don&#x27;t know if the cartridges sold separately will be of the same quality or not.</li>
            <li> I am a 33 year old life long electric razor user.  After a couple weeks using the Gillette Fusion I definitely see the benefits of using a blade.  I could feel a definite difference in the smoothness and softness of my cheeks and neck and I only nicked myself once and it was just a tiny one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this razor is the price.  By keeping my electric razor clean the thing lasts years and saves me a ton of money in the process.  I think this razor is great (although I didn&#x27;t feel a difference using the vibrator vs not using it)but I&#x27;ll probably just use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Power razor free via a program run by Gillette. Being a long time Schick user, I was surprise on the quality of shave I received. I experienced a close, smooth shave with no irritation on my sensitive skin. Orginally I perceived the vibrating \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor as a gimmick, however, I did find out it did make the shave easier. I am very happy with the overall results and definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Braun electric razor user.  Overall, I feel the convenience of using an electric outweighs the closeness of a razor.  However, I was given the opportunity to try out this Gillette Fusion Proglide - as it was provided free by a program.  Overall, it provides a clean close shave as expected from a razor.  It is also very easy to use.  However, I don&#x27;t feel the price justifies the closeness of the shave as compared with other razors out there.  Yes, an electric is far more expensive, but over a period of time and the convenience of using an electric, it&#x27;s not worth switching for, but that&#x27;s just me.  If I were starting out fresh and needed a new razor, perhaps this would be the product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Doesn&#x27;t hurt to shave, and no more shave bumps! I will be using only this product from now on! I was very happy to be able to try this product for FREE via a program run by Gilllette!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.  I received the razor as part of a program run by Gillette.  This razor has been a regular in my rotation of razors prior to receiving this one.  I like the feel of the handle.  I prefer a little weightier handle, something more substantial that I can control and grip.  The razor gives a nice, close shave without any nicks or cuts and I did not have any problems with razor burn.  I like the personally prefer the vibrating handle.  It may be a placebo effect but I feel like I get a better shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife also likes the razor.  She has decided that generally speaking, razors made for women don&#x27;t get a close enough shave and that handles are hard to hold particularly when trying to shave difficult areas like knees and ankle areas.  She liked the feel of the razor and the smooth shave she got.  This is something that we will continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li> This razor was provide free to me to try as a part of a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a power tool with a real sturdy feel.&lt;br /&gt;Even when wet, the grip is real good, no slipping.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close and smooth. I like the Precision Trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best razor I have ever used.  I got the razor free through a special offer from Gillette.  I was not sure if I was going to like it, but it has turned out to be terrific.  Because of the multiple blades, it feels like a flat surface, not a knife edge.  It just glides over my face smoothly.  And the blade lasts a long time.  I have been using one blade for a month and it still shaves smooth with no drag.  I have given up using those cheap disposable blades forever.</li>
            <li> I received this new Pro Glide Power shaver and I have to tell ya&#x27;s, buy one NOW!  I work in the OR as a Surgical Nurse and we are demanded to be very close shaven.  I asked the hospital for special permission to allow a 4 day growth, got the OK and then tried the unit and WOW what a change!!!  I have been using the Original Fusion for years and this was awesome!  The new shape of the handle and the grip was so easy and felt soft to the touch yet with total control of where the blades were heading.  I highly recommend this to ANY one that shaves any part of the body, I give this a 5 Star rating out of 5.  GREAT job Gillette~!!  guyster7148</li>
            <li> I received this razor from a program sponsored by Gillette.  It is definitely and upgrade from the bag o&#x27; disposables sitting under my sink.  Adding/changing heads is a snap.  The handle of the Gillette Fusion had just the appropriate amount of rubber to stay in my hand.  The battery cover is a simple twist n&#x27; pull.  The power button is easily operable with the thumb, so no need to change hand position to turn on/off.  The vibration is not overwhelming but there are no doubts it is working.  The shave was definitely close.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor handle does a great job as it is designed. It has a great grip and is the perfect length for precision detail and complete control. Even with wet hands your grip never slips and it does not seem too small like so many disposables do. This is the perfect handle. This razor was given to me as a free demonstrator and it will be my go to razor from now on.</li>
            <li> Ok I have to say that when I received the Gillette fusion proglide power razor, via a program run by Gillette, I was skeptical at best.  For the past few years I have gotten tired of spending way too much for a razor that would perform just slightly better than that big pack of disposables and I have always thought the \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor was just a gimmick.  When I received the razor, it didn&#x27;t look much different than what I expected, however upon first use, I can say I love the Power razor feature. It really makes a difference on my sensitive skin.  The vibration helps the blade glide over my toughest shave spots.&lt;br /&gt;  Now for the razor blade itself, in the past I could only use a blade 3 or 4 times before I just had to get a new one, (which is another reason the big pack of disposables made the most sense).  So, far I have used this same blade for almost a month and while I can start to notice a bit of difference from the first shave, I am still impressed.  Normally after 5 uses I would have irritation and bumps on my neck, but none with using the proglide.&lt;br /&gt; Overall, great products that may have brought me back from the disposable world.&lt;br /&gt;One note of constructive criticism, why not give us a few refill blades with the razor?</li>
            <li> I hanve never been able to use regular electric razors somI have been trying to find a good razor, and I finally have found what i have been looking for over the past 30 years. I have used it every day for the past 2 weeks and i still get as close of a shave now as i did the first time....i am HOOKED! Even though this was given to me free from Gilette i will buy it in a heartbeat and will use the refills!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 for years. I received the ProGlide free and decided to try it out. Well I did not notice any how difference in my shave, how smooth my face was or how long between shaves. I did notice that the ProGlide was slightly easier to clean with the vibrating head. But that was really the only positive point that I found with this razor. For me I will stick with my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifelong Gillette user. (Occasionally I&#x27;ll try the latest hyped product from Schick but always come back within a week.) When Gillette introduced the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handles in the Fusion line a few years back I immediately fell in love. My skin has never been able to tolerate an electric razor, but the \\&quot;power\\&quot; series is different. The continuous vibration is coupled with a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor, simply helping bring hair to the surface for a smooth shave. The Fusion Power was a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now along comes the Fusion \\&quot;ProGlide\\&quot; Power. I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette and gave it a shot for a week. At first glance it&#x27;s a close cousin of the older Fusion - 5 blades (+ a trimmer blade) on a vibrating handle. Like the previous series the handle is comfortable to hold and the vibration is noticeable but subtle and smooth - the razor doesn&#x27;t want to jump around while holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, the shave was noticeably better with the ProGlide. Upon closer inspection I noticed a \\&quot;comb-like\\&quot; row along the bottom edge of the razor. This little comb seems to straighten out the hair as you shave so the hairs hit the blade at the perfect angle... resulting in fewer ingrown hairs (always an issue for me), less irritation, and an overall closer shave. Definitely an improvement over it&#x27;s predecessor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle appears essentially the same as the older Fusion Power, so if you have an older working \\&quot;power\\&quot; handle the ProGlide Power blades are interchangeable. If you haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handles I definitely recommend this version - especially guys with sensitive skin. Trust me - the combination of the vibration and that little combing edge on the ProGlide Power blades makes all the difference!</li>
            <li> It really is their smoothest shave yet. I used it and had no problems at all shaving with and against the grain. Just learn how to shave properly to avoid any problems.</li>
            <li> The unit worked for about about 7 months. Then one day I was walking by and I hear a buzzing sound. I noticed it was the Proglide on. I thought I had turned it on by mistake. Next time, I was careful to switch it off. And then one day after I switch it off, I notice it turns itself on and off. It eventually died, When I opened the battery compartment, it was wet and the battery appeared to be leaking and corroding in the compartment. I let it dry for couple of days and put in a fresh AA and nothing, no light on the button no movement. I definitely got a defective one but please be aware this may happen to you too.  The unit is shorted out completely now. My $13 down the drain within a year :(</li>
            <li> This razor works great.  Gives a nice smooth shave.  I feel that I have sensitive skin and this razor is gentle on your skin.  I am impressed with this product.  Fits comfortable in your hand while you shave.  Get this razor, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best shave I have ever experienced. It was close and smooth. But what&#x27;s the power for? I was confused by it and thought my shave was smoother without it. The shave was easily a 5 but I knocked it down to a 4 due to the power not really providing anything. It was great I got to try this razor free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> The best razor I have tried.  I usually use an electric razor, but after receiving a free ProGlide Power from Gillette I was sold after just a week of use.  This razor gives you the feel of an electric, but the closeness of a razor.  My 5:00 shadow doesn&#x27;t arrive till the next morning!  Well worth the investment in a razor, just make sure it says \\&quot;Power\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I recently got a new schick power blade and after using for about a month I realized I didn&#x27;t like it. So after switching to The Gillette Fusion Proglide, the razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, I&#x27;ve noticed I huge difference. I used to hate shaving... only trying to do it once a week. Now I don&#x27;t mind, even when I have to do it two days in a row. It is smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a razor burn. I like when I take it into the shower that it doesn&#x27;t get slippery either. The only problem is trying to keep my wife from using it on her legs...Gross!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an on and off user of Gillette since I started to shave and I&#x27;ve never been totally satisfied. But I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free via a program run by Gillette, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have sensitive skin and I always end up with some level of razor burn an after using shaving. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle, however, is a massive improvement. Really smooth shave and the razor burn has decreased dramatically since I don&#x27;t have to go over a spot multiple times. The vibration really made it feel like I could glide over my hair, rather than get that tug and pull that can happen so often when shaving. Great product, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor through a program run by Gillette.  It has a solid handle that feels solid in my hand.  It doesn&#x27;t slip when it gets wet, and it is easy to grip. I also liked the vibrations. I don&#x27;t know what the science behind them is, but I know that when I turn on the vibrations, I don&#x27;t notice any pulling by the razor. It feels like it improves the quality of the shave, and that&#x27;s what I like.</li>
            <li> Can i say that this is the smooothes shave I have ever gotten. Didnt believe the commercials at first especially the vibrating handle...but it actually works. I felt as smooth as silk and looked great. I wont buy any other razor I SWEAR!</li>
            <li> I received my Pro Glide Power as a part of a program that was ran by Gillette. I have to say that the Power is just amazing. I have never had a razor like it. The handle is shaped nice to fit into your hand and the power button is placed is a good position so that you aren&#x27;t turning it off during your shave. Overall, it gave a very close shave. I guess im just not use to it yet but when I am done shaving it feels like my jaw is still vibrating. 4.5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> I think this product overall is good, however, I have a beard so my shaving is primarily for neck lines and cleaning up.  I&#x27;ve always had a good experience with Gillette products and could probably save money with other razors, but I like to try the latest and greatest innovations.  One benefit in having a beard is that the blades last a very long time because I don&#x27;t have much to shave each day.  I would recommend Gillette products but it really depends on your needs.</li>
            <li> I really like the design of this new product.  The grip is much better than the old Gillette Fusion razor.  I definitely have more control while shaving and end up getting a better shave.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as a promotion and was eager to try it out.  The handle had a great feel to it and had a great grip so that it was not slippery.  I shave in the shower and it is important to not drop the razor.  The battery was easy to install.  I would definely recommend the ProGlide Power Handle.</li>
            <li> Comparing this razor to the normal ProGlide and to the Schick Quattro, I choose the ProGlide Power.  I get much less tug and pull with this razor and I can shave more often without my skin paying for it.  Plus there&#x27;s a three dollar coupon today.  Sounds like a win-win to me.  Time to go shave.</li>
            <li> I got this razor through a special promotion from Gillette. I was interested in this razor because of the fact it viberates and it promises a good shave. The first time I used it i didnt think it was all that great. So a couple of days went by and i had to shave again, since I couldnt find my other razor I used it again and man what a difference!!!! It was user error because I will say i was an awsome shave. I refuse to use any other.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call me the biggest fan of the Power Handle. I received a free power handle that was provided via a program run by Gillette. While it did create a smoother easier stroke while shaving, in a way, it made shaving a bit more difficult as well. let me explain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of knowing your cutting hair when shaving, is by feeling the resistance of the hair while pulling the blade across your face. Also, hearing the hair being cut as  well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Power Blade turned on, the sound and feel of the vibrations masked the feel and sound of the blade cutting hairs. This tended to make shaving take longer, as I found myself going over some spots more than ones unnecessarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the Power Blade made it easy and comfortable to hold, but I pass on the vibrations. I seem to get just as close a shave without it, as I do with it.</li>
            <li> This free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. This product dwarfs any other straight razor I have used. The shave provided was smooth, clean and took no time at all. I did not have to go over certain areas multiple times, like other straight razors. The handle is great and easy to get a good grip. The vibration adds to the good shave, and makes it more efficient. Even when the handle got wet, it was still easy to keep a good grip and not lose control. I had a slight concern about the battery and the handle getting wet, but that turned out to be false. Water does not leak into the battery compartment, nor do you get electrocuted (always a plus). The button to turn on the vibration was easy to manipulate -- wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say a few things about my recent experiences with the Gillett Fusion ProGlide Power handle. I received this through a test program run by Gillette. The new handle feels very comfortable in your hands. It is easy to hold and grip. Even when you get your hands wet and full of shaving cream, the new handle will not slip or slide. This comes in handy when you are trying to get a close shave, while avoiding any nicks. Some razor handles are hard to control and feel like they are slipping out of your control, even more so when you are using a powered razor, but that is something you do not have to worry about with the new ProGlide Power handle. The razor is rock solid in your hands and there is not a hint of vibration from the battery whatsoever. Plus no razor gives you as close a shave as one from Gillette. The Proglide really excels at that and keeps irritation to a minimum.  Glad that I had the opportunity to try this. If you are on the fence, don&#x27;t be! You will see and feel the difference when you use the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor with the new handle.</li>
            <li> Upon the first use of the ProGlide Power, I immediately noticed a smoother cut and easier shave. Shaving requires less effort, and my skin seems less prone to irritation, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;The grip is a definite improvement. It&#x27;s easier to handle and harder to drop, even when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bonus that it even comes with a battery.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a worthy and capable product, and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> After using the Gillette ProGlide Power Handle provided by a Gillette run program, I have enjoyed many of its features but found the micropulses to be unnecessary.  I thought the ergonomic design and easy to hold grip were great, but as someone with sensitive skin, I found the pulsating action unneeded.  With a good blade this handle works great, but did not feel superior to some of the other razor handles I have used.  Nevertheless, this handle felt great and is an exceptional partner to the ProGlide razor blade.</li>
            <li> My free razor provided by a program run by Gillette was just perfect. The grip was soft to touch and very easy to maneuver around my face. Love that it could be used in the shower and fits perfectly in my hands. The appearance was very shiny. The blue light was also rather cool addition to the handle. I highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the Gillette power handle at first. I was recently chosen to recieve the power fusion handle for free through a program run by Gillette. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like it or of it would even make a difference but I was wrong! The added vibration made me shave closer than ever! I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to try this out. I will not go back to a regular razor again!! This was a great product to try and now im hooked. Thanks Gillette.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the Gillette Fusion Proglide Handle has a POWER button! Love the idea of being to get a better closer shave with already 5 thin blades but the nice little humming and vibrating feeling from is Gillette Proglide handle! LOve the idea! THnx for life changing product Gillette! I recieved this Free Gillette Fusion Proglide handle through a program by Gillette</li>
            <li> I loved the razor. Got a great shave, very close and smooth. Got all the tricky spots without a hitch! The razor was sent to me by a program run by Gillette, I would have been kind of skeptical in buying a \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot;, a vibrating razor but now that I got a chance to use it, I love it, and it really works! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette power handle for free through one of their marketing programs and was a little impressed by it. It gave me a really pleasant feeling that reminded me of using my electric shaver and I did notice that it helped my shave just a little bit. I dont know if I would have went out and bought it, but I am having fun using it. I think it would be a fun gift idea. Nothing mind blowing, but definitely fun!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the Fusion Proglide.  It did a great job.  I didn&#x27;t have to go over any spot more than once.  I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts even the first time I used it, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  It gives a very close, smooth, comfortable shave.  I got it for free to try, from Gillete, but I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razoe for free via a program run by Gillette.  I am a loyal consumer of Gilette products, and in my opinion this product meets the high quality standards I have come to expect from Gillette.  The vibrations don&#x27;t bother me the way I thought they would, and the razor glides smoothly.  There is some heat that takes some getting used to at first, but after a while you hardly notice.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> While I was skeptical of having the movement on the razor, I found it to be almost massage like and certainly gave a close shave without leaving bumps or nicks.  Though I got this free via a program run by Gillette, I will be using from now on.</li>
            <li> Got the razor from Gillette as a product try out. A great razor for everyday use. Easy to use, rinse and shave with. Provides a smooth shave without the usual nicks and cuts. Finished shaving in less time and with a smoother closer shave than using other razors. Want a clean smooth shave without nicks then use this razor and you&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free via a promotion from Gillette. The handal is very comfortable and its simole to use. Ive always been a little sketchy about a vibrating razor on my face, but its WORTH it! Very close, non irritating shave. Even my gf loves using the razor on her legs! Gillette is on top of the razor game. You wont go wrong buying this product.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best invention in disposable razor history! The ProGlide Blades themselves are great but when used with the ProGlide Power Handle, they are unbeatable. The powerful vibrations help give an extra close shave with no irritation, even when using an a dull blade, which increases the life of the blade. It uses one AAA battery that seems to last forever and it&#x27;s completely waterproof so I can still shave in the shower. I received this as a free promotion by Gillette but I will definitely buy one for my travel bag and I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razors I have used hands down! Not only during shaving is it the most comfortable shaver that does not pull your hair, it also creates such a smooth shave. I don&#x27;t know if I will ever go back to the other brand I used to use. The handle is very comfortable to use and the blades are great. I cannot talk about length of use of the blades since I have only used it for a few days, but so far I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note i did receive this item from Gillette as part of a test program, but my review is honest about the product.**</li>
            <li> Love this product. Gives you a close shave with no tug or pulls. The vibrating handle help the blade provide you with a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. recommend you buy it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I received this handle through a free promotion run my Gillette. Like my previous Gillette razors, it worked well and did the trick. I like the power series a lot and think it does a great job, however, I am not 100% sure what is different between this new one than my previous power handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette regular Fusion razor for many years. The Fusion ProGlide appears to be a bit different visually, but I don&#x27;t really see much functional difference over the regular Fusion razor. These are good razor blades, but the cons seriously hamper their overall value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;+Extremely close shave--the best I&#x27;ve had with any manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;+Nice ergonomics and feel to the handle, and looks nice too.&lt;br /&gt;+Comes with an awesome plastic case that securely holds the razor and can clip in a 4-pack of replacement blades underneath. GREAT for travel!&lt;br /&gt;+Blades pop on and off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-Biggest CON: Not for those who don&#x27;t shave daily! I have coarse facial hair and find that if I go longer than a day or two without shaving, this razor just can&#x27;t cut it without being uncomfortable or painful. I have to first shave with an electric trimmer and then follow up with the Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;-The clog easily. I have to bang the razor on the sink several times while shaving to clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;-The vibrating feature does absolutely nothing for me. I don&#x27;t notice a single benefit from it and it just gets annoying. I stopped using the battery and just took it out.&lt;br /&gt;-If you do use the vibration feature, this Proglide version of the razor has a BRIGHT LED that the regular Fusion did not. It is just too bright and annoying, and why bother? Like we can&#x27;t tell the thing is ON when it&#x27;s vibrating? Just a waste of battery power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would still continue purchasing these razors after receiving this one for free from a program run by Gillette. Even though they are expensive and have a few cons, the resulting super-close shave is worth putting up with it, and I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet (but a lot of worse!) I would suggest buying the non-vibrating handle and saving some cash. All of the handles can interchange with all of the blades.</li>
            <li> I usually get good results with The Gillette Fusion Proglide and the handle is easy to grip and to hold, recently using the bigger and thicker handle from the Styler I noticed it is even better than the Fusion ProGlide Power Handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power since the first time I started using it and I&#x27;ve got it free from a Gillette promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really gives a closer shave compared to my older Gillette cartridges.</li>
            <li> This is a great handle that you can buy at a superstore/grocery store.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I received mine for free from Gillette to try out.  The vibrating handle is a nice touch and works with the cartridge just fine.</li>
            <li> I got my brand new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power in the mail a few days ago thanks to a program run by Gillette. When I got the confirmation that the razor had shipped, I chose not to shave until it came in so that I could give it a fair try.  My hair grows very quickly, so by the time the ProGlide Power was on my doorstep, its first challenge was rather visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of the entire razor was the handle.  Given the quick-growing, thick facial hair, I can be standing there shaving for 20 minutes, at times.  Most razors focus simply on the blades (which, by the way, even the blades for this razor are superb) and leave little attention to the handle.  That means that you&#x27;re essentially holding this hard, slippery pencil in your hands.  The second I got the ProGlide Power out of the packaging, I was thrilled to see that this wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the best grip that I&#x27;ve ever had on any razor in my life.  It fit snug, had tiny rubber grooves on the back that molded to my fingers, and wasn&#x27;t at all slippery.  You can definitely feel a difference with the side grips that are on the Power handle.  Between the superb handle and the tremendous razor, I found myself with the closest, smoothest, easiest shave-job of my life.  This is a product that I will buy over and over and over again.</li>
            <li> After testing the proglide from receiving it free through a promotion by Gillette I have a couple of thoughts.  The handle is cool looking, it feels solid and has a great grip. DId I mention that is looks great.  The one area for improvement I would would be for it to weigh a bit less, then it would be the ultimate razor.  It shaves great and truly glides along my face, much better than the store bought brands I usually use.</li>
            <li> As a man that shaves his head I was, at first, nervous about using a vibrating razor on my head. But I was given the opportunity to try this razor via a Gillette promotional program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra heft and girth provided by the battery compartment gives the razor a nice balance. The action in this razor provides an extremely close shave in about half the time resulting in less irritation post shave. This is definitely a razor I will be buying in the future.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty specific shaving routine because of my sensitive skin, so when I received a free &#x27;Pro-glide&#x27; razor from Gillette to try I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powered (ultrasonic?) handle allowed me to shave slowly, and cleanly without having to go over the same area twice, which really helped me avoid any sensitive skin/razor burn afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself was closer than I&#x27;ve had in years (I used a mach 3 razor previously) and the time it took to shave was reduced dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the razor before work every day for three weeks now, and I still get an extremely close shave without any &#x27;ouch&#x27; moments.  Even when I was rushed and had to do a quick job, I was pleased with the results, whereas I might have tore my neck to pieces using my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The couple of things I would like to know before I would buy this, personally are:&lt;br /&gt;1) How long to the razors last (they&#x27;re pretty expensive, just like normal refills)&lt;br /&gt;2) How long to the batteries last (I&#x27;m guessing months/year?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give the razor a 5 star rating because the size of the head caused me to shave off part of of my goatee, not the biggest deal but it is hard to sculpt as the head is much bigger than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle for free from a program sponsored by Gillette in return for my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say this is one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had! The vibrating action from the battery powered handle helps make the difference between this and other non-vibrating handles. It also helps that this uses a 5-bladed razor. I shave once daily and can tell that my stubble isn&#x27;t as defined when I go to shave now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone with sensitive skin, this will probably help as it only takes one pass to get a close shave!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the fact that using the powered handle makes shaving much easier. I am grateful that Gillette gave me the opportunity to test their product with no charge. What a difference when shaving with the powered handle that not using it. The fact that it makes for an easier shave is an awesome thing. You don&#x27;t have to provide any pressure on the handle it almost shaves you by itself. Very satisfied and will definitely purchase this in the future. There is no other way to shave,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for &#x27;gimmicks&#x27;, but i was given this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette so I gave it a try. Let me first say, I do enjoy the &#x27;Power Handle&#x27; and I no longer think it is a gimmick.  It does seem to help with a smoother shave.  I don&#x27;t know for sure if it is the power or the configuration of the blades, but I definitely feel like it had a better shave than a &#x27;non-power&#x27; razor.  Is this worth the extra cost?  I don&#x27;t know.  Does it work?  Yes :)</li>
            <li> I mostly use the cheapest razors I can find, but after getting a sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide power handle it&#x27;s a night and day difference between this razor and others. I&#x27;ve noticed with the Gillette Fusion my face is smoother throughout the day much longer compared to my old cheap razors.&lt;br /&gt;  I sure everyone has that one area of your face, chin, or neck that you just can&#x27;t get a close shave to. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide now makes it easier to get to the problem areas in a couple passes. Also, what I liked about this razor is I can wet my face with water and still get a close shave without the shaving cream. And I have been using this razor with the same blade in now for 3 weeks, and I still did not get razor burn with my sensitive skin. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a close, long-lasting, shave.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor provided via a program ran by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product I have to say I like this product. Gillette is know for great products in the past. Provided a close and smooth shave. Minimum pulling or tugging on hairs. I recommend Gillette products as my first option to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has an on-board micro chip that is suppose to provide consistent power, shave after shave. This feature I found didn&#x27;t provide any difference from when I used when I had the power on than if used with power off. For others this may be more useful. I am not sure if this could be related to hair type.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle (that I received for free through a program run by Gillette) for the past two weeks. It is a manly-man&#x27;s handle; plenty of girth and easy to hold. I go from shaving to brushing my teeth and immediately think, \\&quot;Gee, why can&#x27;t my toothbrush have the same handle as my Gillette Fusion ProGlide?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out the ProGlide for free through a program run by Gillette. I must admit that it turned out a little better than expected. The handle feels comfortable in my hands and easily maneuverable around my face and neck. Grips prevent slippage when hands are slippery with shaving gel. Gave a great shave as my skin tends to be very sensitive to razors. Felt some tug on my skin during the shave and had to use a few strokes over each area to get all the hairs cut. Sometimes had to press a little firmer to get those stubborn hairs. Very light weight even with the battery. Overall shave result was smooth, non-irritated soft skin with a very pleasant surprise, no bumps or pain after a few days.</li>
            <li> So, to begin with, I should say that I&#x27;m not really sure how I feel about the handle.  Gillette gave me an opportunity to try it out and I gave it 3 stars, but that&#x27;s because it gets the job done.  Any product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to should probably almost full credit.  With that in mind, I think it might be a little too fancy for my liking.  The grip on the handle is fine, it doesn&#x27;t get too slippery when it&#x27;s wet and it&#x27;s certainly not uncomfortable to hold.  The vibrating head is also a cool addition, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it adds to my shave.  It feels pretty much the same to me when I use the vibrating and when I use don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I am stuck on with this handle is that it reminds me of a teenager and his car.  This handle is that 16 year old with a tricked out shiny Honda Civic with loud exhaust and a cool sound system.  Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the sweet rims.  But the problem is just that-- it looks cool, but doesn&#x27;t do anything a normal Civic would not.  This razor looks and feels awesome, but at the end of the day it still shaves my face just like any other razor would.  I have the used normal non-vibrating Gillette for some time now, and I don&#x27;t think this fancier looking, vibrating device makes any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, this is really just an average handle that looks cool.  It definitely seems like more a novelty than anything, and some people like that.  Objectively, however, I think that the \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; this handle helps provide is more mind over matter.  Realistically, I get just as close of a shave without vibration and anyone who says otherwise may just be fooled by the cool looks and neat vibration.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this handle functions 100% and will give you a good shave, but it&#x27;s not because of the ergonomic grip and electronics.</li>
            <li> I was given a free razor from a program run by Gillete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle:&lt;br /&gt;When using the razor I thought the handle was comfortable with lots of grip. Having a handle with a good grip allowed me to have smooth strokes  reducing nicks and cuts on my face. It is a solid handle without any bend to it. It is thick enough to easily grab and small enough not to be a brick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades:&lt;br /&gt;I thought the blades were pretty average. I didn&#x27;t hate it but I didn&#x27;t love either. I&#x27;m the guy with bumpy sensitive skin that razors never work well on so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. When using the shaver the blades seemed to cut great. I mean it has 5 blades, I don&#x27;t think that will ever be an issue till they get dull. The part I really like are these shavers with the lubrication strip. My only issue is for me personally after going over my whole face and neck I still get hair that are missed. The lubrication strip makes it smooth with the grain..but anytime I rub my skin against the grain I can feel the hairs. Whenever I try to get them (against the grain) I always cut myself, which is true with this razor.</li>
            <li> received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle as part of a Gillette sponsored trial. I have shaved with it for 1 week and I think it works well as a shaver. The vibrating shave is nice. I liked that the razor is the same as my normal razor. All Fusion blades fit all Fusion handles. I had gotten away from Gillette in favor of the disposable razors and can honestly say I am wondering why I switched. The Fusion Proglide blades are truly smooth can be used with or without cream and it glides smoothly. Another plus is the fact I am 4 shaves in (every 2 days) and the blade is still going strong!</li>
            <li> I used this razor too shave my head and the handle is comfortable and amazing to use...the power feels like a massage at the same time as shaving..so nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle for free through a trial being run by Gillette. I have always wondered about those power handle shavers but have never tried them before. To start with I have extremely sensitive skin around my neck and shaving can be killer. I get very bad razor burn and then the next time I shave it&#x27;s even worse and more painful. I often times have to work my schedule of shaving based on when I can let my neck heal for a few days before having to shave again. I tried the Power Handle and was absolutely blown away by the difference it made. I had no idea that the power handle would make that big of an impact on how close the shave was and most of all how comfortable it was. Yes, I still had a little razor burn, but NOTHING compared to the usual. I am absolutely hooked and will never go back to anything but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free Fusion ProGlide Power handle from Gillette on a trial and was pretty impressed. The grip did not slip when I was shaving around the corners of my face and I felt like the vibration was providing a closer shave (although I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s any proof to back that up.) Definitely would look to purchase this handle in the future as long as the price was right.</li>
            <li> The Power Handle was much more powerful than I thought it would be.  takes 1 battery and got my shave MUCH MUCH Closer!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work. I have never used an electic handle before that uses regular cartidges. I was very impressed. The vibrations help you to get an even coverage with the razor without tugging or razor burn. I would reccomend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Through a promotion with Gillette I received a free  Fusion pro-glide power handle  razor.  I have to say that I generally use inexpensive store brand razors from one of the big box stores.  To say the least this razor is a revelation.&lt;br /&gt; It gave me one of the closest shaves I have ever had. I have sensitive skin and there was no irritation at all.  One of the big stand outs is the handle not only is it easy to hold but it has a vibrating function that makes for less tug when shaving (I have very coarse facial hair).&lt;br /&gt;One slight negative with this razor is the number of shaves I get. It seems to go dull a bit quicker than other razors, but that may be due to the fact that the blades are so thin and sharp.&lt;br /&gt; I always shave in the shower and the larger handle makes it very easy to handle.  It gives you a firm comfortable grip on the razor and the vibrating function makes it very easy to glide over your face.&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert, I am ditching the cheap razors the Fusion proglide with power handle is what I will be buying from now on.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor via a program run by Gillette. I am glad that I received it. I really like the grip and how the handle feels while I am shaving. I also got a really good shave in less time than other razors take. I recommend this product for anyone who wants a close shave while feeling comfortable during the shave.</li>
            <li> I got this free razor via a promotion run by Gillette. The handle had a superior grip. I received the best shave of my life. It was very close. Best of all, I have not cut myself. I absolutely love this razor. Highly recommended for great shave.This is the best razor I have ever tried for difficult grain areas, like under the neck. The light vibration means you don&#x27;t have to press as hard in those areas which avoids nicks. I got to try it for free from Gillette, and I am very happy that I got the opportunity.The five blade shave plus the single blade edger plus the electric handle equals the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I was recently given a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor via a program run by Gillette. The razor comes in packaging that is easy to remove without using sharp objects. Included in the package were the razor, a stand, and a AAA battery. At first glance, the razor looks to by typically made in the same high quality fashion that Gillette has made standard amongst most of their razors. The razor has a good weight to it when the battery is inserted and it looks and feels like it could withstand just about anything.  Shaving with the Gillette was relatively easy and provides a great shave; especially with micro pulsation technology that Gillette has developed. For the first few days, the Gillette razor provided a very smooth shave and was relatively knick free.  The flexibility of the shaver head and the lubrication pad made shaving smooth, effortless, and pulling was minimal.  Cleaning the razor was very easy and removal and re installation of the razor was simply a button push and a click away.  After use, the razor fit snugly into its holder and provided the best position for drying the razor until the next use.  In my opinion, I am giving the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor three stars because it did do pretty well over the period of a week, but it did fall short in a few areas.  First, Gillette provides a single blade on the back of the razor that you have to flip over to use to get to those hard to reach areas, but I did prefer the feeling of four blades as compared to one from my normal everyday razor.  Secondly, at the end of a week or so, the Gillette razor started to pull on my face a little more because the blades were dulling even with the micro pulsations.  Although switching blades is normal maintenance that must be completed on a razor, this was a little premature for a blade to start dulling this quick.  Lastly, the cost of the razor could be the worst thing about it.  With the blades dulling so quickly and the use of a battery to drive the micro pulse technology, this increases the cost of this razor exponentially.  I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised by the Gillette Proglide and at first I was, but overall I would say that it would be hard for me to switch my razor to the Gillette if you are looking to save money.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promo from Gillette.  It works relatively well.  As is my typical experience with Gillette razors they work great for the first two or three shaves, then they degrade quickly.  I got a lot of nicks from this razor around my jaw line.  The vibrations make it glide better, but I usually have to go over the area a couple of times since it makes it hard to feel the razor working.  I would probably not pay the high price for this razor or the replacement blades.  The handle is nice and has good grip.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor as part of a program run by Gillette. I normally use the regular Gillette Fusion razor weekly, so I thought why not try this one out. I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the handle, but as for the power part, I didn&#x27;t care for it. It did give a nice clean shave, but the vibration annoyed me and made it difficult to stay on track. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the non-powered Fusion razor handle. The price is high, so I want to be very happy with a product before spending that kind of money.</li>
            <li> I received one of these razors free during a promotion by Gilette.  I have had issues with many razors in the past due to sensitive skin.  Prior to using the razor, the best shave I could get that was mostly painfree was with the Gilette Fusion (non-battery operated version).  I have to say, this razor is so much better than even that one.  I get such an amazingly close shave without the horrible razor burn or super sensitive skin afterwards.  With most other razors, I can only shave once every 3-4 days.  With the Gilette Fusion ProGlide I have had no issues shaving every other day or even 2 days in a row.  I get a smooth shave with fewer strokes and the blades seem to last much longer than I am used to.  The handle is also a neat part of this razor.  The grip is great, it never slips even when soaking wet.  You get used to the vibrating feature fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Thanks Gilette!!</li>
            <li> I received this razor complimentary to try and review from a program run by Gillette.  Although I received the razor complimentary, I was under no obligation to provide a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Gillette razors for years, have upgraded each time a new one comes out and have to say, I am always happy with these razors.  This review is particularly focused on the handle itself.  I love the vibrating handle.  I am not completely sure if it has any effect on the quality of the shave, but I think it shaves better when the vibrating is enabled.  I also like the grips on the razor as when your hands are wet, especially in the shower, handle grips help to keep from dropping it.  The handle is attractive, well made, and will last a long time.  I&#x27;ve never had to replace a razor handle for any reason, but I usually buy a second one so I have one in the shower and one out.  Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Gillettte always presents a great quality product and this was no exception.</li>
            <li> I recently received, thru a program run by Gillette the Fusion ProGlide razor.  I was impressed with this razor as a whole but the handle of this razor is much different than others that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I shave often times in the shower so I need to be certain that the razor I choose won&#x27;t slip out of my hand while wet.  Well the ProGlide Power handle is clearly designed to provide the user with a comfortable, non-slip grip because I never once found myself reaching for a dropped razor while showering.  And even though the blades of the razor provided me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had both with the power on or off I felt very indulged feeling the added closeness the micropulses provided.  I absolutely would recommend this razor to everyone, even the ladies.</li>
            <li> I recieved my razor from Gillette to give it a free try.  I loved the razor but I am not sure the Power handle is needed. I think I would get just as good of shave without having the \\&quot;power feature\\&quot;  It was great to try and I will continue to use the Fusion products as I love the nice close nick free shave that I had by using this product just not sure the vibration added anything to the experience.</li>
            <li> I received the razor free as part of a promotion, but I did look up the price for the handle and replavement blades.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a great razor plain and simple.  I am not sure that the vibration actually improved my shave, but I&#x27;ll take their word for it that it did.  The shave was very close, and since the head is still small I was able to shave under my nose.  My only real hesitation with continuing using this razor that is that it&#x27;s pricey compared to my usual Dorco Pace razor.  I will have to wait for the blades to go on sale and use a coupon before refilling my blades.  It does some like the blades stay sharp for a long time which is VERY good.</li>
            <li> I got the chance to use this razor courtesy of a program run by Gillette and I can&#x27;t thank them enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip on this thing is immense. There is no issues about slipping or dropping this bad boy. The rubber sticks to your hand and is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button on the back is placed well and is placed well enough that you won&#x27;t accidentally shut it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great overall design and power! Glad to see Gillette is making strides to keep men shaving regularly. Thicker than a regular handle but it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re reinventing the wheel...just the power razor game!</li>
            <li> OK so this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power shaving system not only has a five-blade cartridge it has a handle that uses a battery... What??? Where are the cameras? But... because a special program by Gillette gave me the opportunity to try out the  Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free, I decided to give it a try and have been using it for a couple of weeks now. Well it turns out the ProGlide Power is no joke. It gave me the smoothest most comfortable shave I ever had, especially on my neck which has always been a problem area for me. The handle is light, comfortable to hold, easy to control and that battery sets up a little vibrating action that keeps the blades moving smoothly and effortlessly across the skin. You can buy a cheaper razor, but I doubt you&#x27;ll find one that will give you a smoother, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a good handle that my hand can wrap around.  The grip makes it easy so not to slip when water and/or shaving cream drips.  I found it easy to maneuver, but what I didn&#x27;t understand was the battery-operated micro pulses that are supposed to make the shave even smoother.  I tried it with it on and without and felt no difference - my shave was smooth either war.  Is it supposed to give you the feeling of an electric shaver?  That&#x27;s my only gripe; this new handle with the better grip works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor for review via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I got the ProGlide Power Handle free as part of a promotional program from Gillette.  Generally, I use Schick xTreme 3 disposables, so that&#x27;s kind of my reference point for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does an excellent job on the face, and I have no complaints in that regard.  It&#x27;s a quality handle with an excellent blade that does a great (albeit expensive) job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gripes come from the perspective of a head-shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using the Schicks for a long time because they&#x27;re super lightweight and comfortable to hold while my arm is up in the air.  They have a flat spot just behind the head to put my fingers and keep everything in line.  This battery-loaded handle, although it provides an interesting vibration feature, is none of those things.  It&#x27;s very heavy, not conducive to a reverse-grip, and the \\&quot;precision trim\\&quot; blade on the back keeps catching on my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d strongly recommend this for face-shavers who can afford it (refills are fairly pricey but should last a month or more); but for head-shavers who don&#x27;t hold the razor the way face-shavers do, I don&#x27;t suggest laying down the money to try this handle.</li>
            <li> I recieved this razor free from a special Gillette program. I was very happy to use the razor! Great handle on the Gillette Fusion razor. The handle is a little bit thicker, so it makes it easier to grip. It also doesn&#x27;t slip in my hand. I like the power feature as well.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy. Able to hold on to it and shave with confidence. Good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The gillette fusion pro glide handle is ok. I received it free from Gillette to try out. I like the bigger handle and easy grip easier to helP me shave but the vibrating part I could do without.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference it actually annoys me</li>
            <li> I got a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as a promotion they were running. It was a great smooth shave but I loved the handle grip and weight. IM a big fan of gillette.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle free through a program Gillette was running.  I was not sure how good the idea of a power razor was with shaving, I was thinking it would be shaky and I may cut myself.  I was pleasantly surprised when I had none of that.  Another innovative concept from Gillette!</li>
            <li> I would like to thank our sponsors for letting me try out this fabulous shaver I would like a huge applauses for Gillette. Today we are going to talk about the new Gillette fusion proglide. Before I used the product I was thinking to myself that it does not look so different from the other blades that I used before but I guess I was wrong because this is not a manual razor but operated for battery. I love the way it shaves because I was able to shave without having any hair tugged out of my skin. The only thing about this blade is when I was shaving it gave me a couple offcuts but that was nothing because most blades give people cuts while shaving anyways. The handle of the blades is also a positive because I usually use razors with a plastic handle but this one is totally different because it comes with a nice gripe that does not hurt your hands.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver for review as part of a program by Gillette.  The handle is the same as the older Fusion Power with the only real difference being the color styling (blue instead of orange). The \\&quot;power\\&quot; part of these handles is simply a vibrator that shakes vibrates the razor much like the vibration ring on your cell phone.  For me this feature doesn&#x27;t make a difference, the shave is the same with or without the \\&quot;power\\&quot;/vibration turned on.  Often though I just forget to turn it on because there is no difference.  So I&#x27;d say the \\&quot;power\\&quot; part is just gimmick.  The good news is that the handle is fully compatible with the Fusion Power cartridge and vice versa. So there is no need to upgrade to the Proglide handle to use the Proglide cartridges.  You also can use the old Fusion Power cartridges with the new handle.  Both the Proglide and Fusion Power are nice handles and needed for the high quality Gillette blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> Note: I received a free Proglide from Gillette as part of a trial program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proglide combines the best aspects of an electric razor (comfort, no nicks) with the best of a hand razor (close shave). It actually feels something like a facial massage (I wished I had more face to shave). So far, I have less skin irritation as well.</li>
            <li> A free razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette. The handle is slim, but heavy-duty and easy to hold. It didn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. I like how you have the option to use the vibration feature and that it can be used as a standard razor.</li>
            <li> I tried power handle and cannot find any possible reason for it. It seemed to make my skin raw and gave me an uneven shave.  It was really disappointing and not worth it in the long run on my face.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay extra for this feature.</li>
            <li> got a close shave and was impressed with the difference between my nonpowered razor and this one.  Shave was closer and I suddenly noticed less pull and tug on my whiskers.  I guess I had gotten used to that as part of shaving, now I don&#x27;t have too.</li>
            <li> I am in love with my ProGlide Power razor.  I have always used proglide razors but never tried the power version. Gillette sent me one to try through a program they are running and I have to say that I wish I would have gotten one along time ago.  The razor is awesome.  It gives me a smooth clean shave without the irritation that normally happens. I have always had sensitive skin and it has been tough to find a razor that can give me a great shave without irritating my skin. Well the proglide power has definitely proved itself among the best razor I have ever used.  Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle free to try from Gillette and I am very happy with my experience. I have used Gillette products in the past and have always been impressed so I was happy to give this handle a try. I have used out cheaper power handles and didn&#x27;t notice much of a change besides my a hand vibrating. On the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle there is a noticeable difference in shave quality and comfort with the power on and off. Powers makes this shaver super smooth. Battery life is also really great and no issues with getting it wet, I use this for daily shaves in the shower and it is still running strong after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free Gillette Proglide Power Handle shaver through a program run by Gillette. I was interested in if the power made any difference and it did. Its sort of like a gentle vibration while you shave and it seems to help get a smoother shave. The handle is comfortable and I think it evens cleans better under running water while it&#x27;s on. One down side is on occasion I would just wet shave without any shaving gel (Yes, I know) and this does not work good at all with the power handle or blades. Other than that I am quite pleased with it..</li>
            <li> I must say I really do love Gillette&#x27;s handles for their razors. Always been a fan on how durable they are. I came across this particular handle from a promotion Gillette was offering so I took a shot at it. Its slightly thick for my taste makes it a lil hard to shave of certain areas in my neck, although together with the razor it creates an outstanding product. The vibrator is very useful and its not overwhelming as it does not make your hand vibrate but only your razor, The vibrating transfers toward the razor giving you a smooth look. Its design is sleek and the blue light indicator is a great feature. It has a very great grip on the sides and does not slip. Gillette has pride themselves on this feature especially when the handle is wet. My only change would to make the handle at the bottom less thick and more narrow.</li>
            <li> As with many manual razor blades you tend to look for the smoothest, closest shave with less irritation for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve always been a loyal Gillette customer from there line of shaving gel to aftershave. For the past week, Ive switched over from the Gillette Fusion Disposables to Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power. There were subtle differences in the design of the blade, the handle, to how it operates on battery power.  The handle has more grip than other Gillette Handles. I believe it&#x27;s meant for bigger hands and is like the lighter version of the Proglide 3-1 styler kit. When it came down to my first shave, the Proglide seemed to get deeper on hairs I otherwise would miss the first time around.  I tend to shave every other day and the blade seemed to stand very well upon multiple uses for the whole week duration, 4 times at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if your looking for a slightly closer shave and without the tug and pull from your ordinary razor. Well my friend you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received the razor free through a Gillette program and this review is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Fusion ProGlide Power Handle Free from Gillette, I was wary of using it, only because I was afraid that it it would make it harder to shave, not knowing how much it would shake, and if it would m&#x3D;make a difference. After trying the handle with the power off first, it was just like ant other blade handle, felt good in the hand, easy to maneuver, light... then I turned it on. Not only did it make a difference, it made shaving a pleasure. The slight vibration was not at all distracting, and made the blade glide to the point that you don&#x27;t even feel the blades cut. One swipe and and your done, cutting down the time it takes to shave, and cutting so close, you still feel smooth after 8-10 hours. Get one, and you won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li> I got to test the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide thru a program run by Gillette and it is the best razor that I have ever had. It gives the best shave and makes the skin feel so smooth. If you have sensitive skin then this razor is for you. The vibration it gives is just tremendous and shaves very close. I have always had sensitive skin but with the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide you will have no worries. This product is well worth the money you will spend. Thank you for getting the best razor on the market.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy electric shavers because the price is always really high, but since i received this from Gillette for free from a promotion i figured i would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it did not viberate a whole lot while shaving, most other electric shavers were vibrating so much that it made it hard to get a close shave, but this one was not like that which was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little big, but i am comparing that to manual shavers and they dont have a battery compartment. I did like the grips on the handle, it was very comfortable to grab and did not slip out of your hand when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all i would reccommend this shaver, it was a great shave, not a lot of vibrating and was a comfortable grip to hold on to.</li>
            <li> I tried this Razor as it was provided free via a program run by Gillette.  I found that this Razor is able to handle my thick full facial hair with great ease.  The power function combined with a great blade kept my face smooth and clean after shaving and did so in no time at all.  It runs on one triple A battery and it seems to last quite some time before having to be changed.  The handle is easy to grip and the on/off button for the power function is easy to use.  This will be the only razor I use to shave from now on!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which is prone to razor rash using most razors on the market.  I have been using a free Gillette Fusion Proglide through a promotion from Gillette and the results have been phenomenal.  Using this razor has left my skin smooth and rash free!  I would recommend this razor to all my friends and family.  Not only do I shave my face with this razor but I shave my head as well and have loved the results.  Gillette has hit a homerun with this product in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS RAZOR.  WHAT A GREAT WAY TO GET A TRUELY SMOOTH SHAVE AND THERE IS A GREAT GRIP FOR SHOWER USE!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor! From the first shave, it has been consistent. I have bee shaving with the same blade cartridge for over 2 weeks; that&#x27;s 2 shaves per week too! The blades are still sharp. My shaves are still smooth. I will never buy another brand of razor to shave my manly face. I think my wife has even stolen a shave or two with this razor; she has no clue I&#x27;m onto her! I can&#x27;t blame her. This razor shaves awesome! I&#x27;m telling everyone about this razor and recommending everyone buys one. I think if they try it, they&#x27;ll be hooked and end the bad habit with less inferior razors. I did and I have not regretted it once.</li>
            <li> Awesome razor! I received the product free through a campaign run by Gillette. I wanted to try it before I bought it. It is now my new razor. It gets a super close shave and leaves a smooth face. It is a bit pricey for the cartridges but I think it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I was sent this razor to try through a progrsam with Gillette. I seldom shave because my facial hair grows slowly but I have to admit this razor is a winner. The handle is easy to grab and it is no slip even if your hands our wet. I purposely kept my hands wet and I enjoyed a nice nick free shave. Speaking of the shave it was hands down the closest, smoothest, shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Got this for free through a Gillette program and have used it a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t feel the power glide actually provides a closer shave. Seems it is just a gimmick.  Compared to my normal DE razor, this pulls/tugs a lot more, and chews my neck up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is better then the Gillette Power trimmer.</li>
            <li> Having used this for about a month, I have to honestly say I love it. Very comfortable and easy to use. Pick this up. You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing, but I had to get used to the fact that it vibrated, or as they call it \\&quot;Micropulses\\&quot; a bit when I shaved.  It is battery operated so it vibrates a little when you shave.  I thought this was going to be another gimmick, but it actually worked somehow.  I sometimes get ingrown hairs when I shave and it didn&#x27;t happen with this.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the thinner blades or what, but this is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I got this razor free from a program that Gillette was running, and it is great marketing on their part because I am no longer using my old razors.  Looks like they will be getting my money from buying the replacement blades.  Good job guys.  Good job.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I am an actual guy reviewing this, just under my wife&#x27;s account.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is an amazing device that enhances a truly smooth shave. As part of a program sponsored by Gillette, I had the opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free. The grip design is ergonomically created in such a way that it allows for a smoother, easier shave. The rubberized handle is easy to hold in various positions to allow for an easy way to hold the handle when trying to reach those hard to reach parts of the face. The button that releases the blade is quick and easy to use. When changing blades this button works great. It is so easy to change blades based on the design. There is no muss or fuss and you don&#x27;t even have to touch the blade to remove it from the handle. The vibration factor is easy to use. The button quickly and easily turns on the vibration action of the handle. The handle vibration really enhances the shave quality and the functionality of the handle itself. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle improves the smoothness of the shave and allows for a clean and easy shave. The handle is a truly revolutionary design, and I am so happy to have had the opportunity to try this new and exciting way to shave.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth, close cutting razor that works well not only on the face but the head as well! The vibrating handle allows this thing to give a great shave! Excellent product Gillette, just go easy on the price!</li>
            <li> This is the best shave i have ever had. Mix it with the gillette shave gel and it is awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a proglide since it was new and got this new iteration as a free trial. I will say that the blade is an improvement. It pulls through my stubble cleanly without catching and I usually only have to do one pass through. The handle I feel is more of a gimmick. I will say that it is waterproof and a little thicker with a nice grip but I don&#x27;t really want to have to change batteries as well as blades and the LED is a bit much.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power as part of a Gillette run program. I have had the best shaving experience with a mukti-blade razor than ever before. I typically use a double-edge safety razor. It is the only way I have been able to shave every day and eliminate razor burn. The vibrating pulses in this new Gillette allow me to shave as close as the old style razor while still eliminating razor burn. That, and it does it in half the time. The handle is easy to grip and maneuver around my face. The only downside is my finger can easily accidentally disable the vibrating pulse when changing grips. A minor complaint, but something to be aware if none the less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was an excellent experience.</li>
            <li> Being busy, i don&#x27;t take the time to shave every day. The gillette fusion proglide power razor worked out well for me. Unlike other razors, it left my skin smooth and without being irritated. It is slightly more expensive than a conventional one but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This razor was originally provided to me through a gillette program but i have bought another one since.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from a program sponsored by Gillette. It is definitely and upgrade from the other generic run of the mill disposable razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. Easy to change heads. The handle of the Gillette Fusion had just the appropriate amount of rubber to stay in my hand, even when wet. The battery cover is simple to open and close. The power button is easy to use, just flick your thumb. I found the vibration a little strange at first, but that was due to not using this type of razor in the past. But I quickly got used to it. Overall, this certainly gave me a close shave and minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I recently received the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER RAZOR through a program run by Gilette and after using the non powered version for years I was surprised at home much better the powered version is. It gave a smoother feeling shave, and was a closer shave. It also caused less of an irritation after shaving was complete. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Recently I received this razor through a promotion from Gillette.  I had been using the Gillette Fusion Power before this, and I&#x27;d say this is a step up for me.  The handle is much more comfortable in my hand, and the power button is a little harder to press.  That&#x27;s actually a good thing when you&#x27;re throwing something in a travel bag and don&#x27;t want it to accidentally activate.  I get a close comfortable shave from this, and use it over my electric razor any time I need to look my best.</li>
            <li> I received this thru a program run by Gillette.  I was surprised at how smooth this razor is.  I am used to nicking myself several times with my old razor.  With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I did not nick myself at all.  I will be using this from now on.  Go try it for yourself and you will see how smooth a shave you can get.</li>
            <li> For about three weeks , I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Shaving system as part  of a free trial offer from Gillette. I am really enjoying&lt;br /&gt;the smooth shave with an easy to grip handle. The idea of a blue light on the handle is a unique feature that reminds me to turn the shaving system off when  cleaned and finished. The unit is light weight and has an easy to hold and maneuver handle that provides a smoother shaving experience. It stores easily in its upright holder.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free in a program run by Gillette.  The shave was nice, and pretty close.  I am not sure how I feel about the vibration though,</li>
            <li> Through a promotional program by Gillette, I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to try out for free.  I have to say I have now found myself a new everyday razor.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power gave me the closest most comfortable shave that I have ever had at home.  I shave in the shower and the wide grip made it easier to hold and use with the water running.  I was very curious as to the \\&quot;power\\&quot; portion of the razor.  It certainly was different then what I was used to in a shave - but in the end it was the most comfortable shave that I have gotten at home so I guess I am now a power convert.</li>
            <li> I got a fusion proglide power razor in a program sponsored by Gillette.  This razor is the best ever.  The fusion handle is ribbed so you get a nice tactile grip that doesn&#x27;t slip and it gives you a very close shave.  Touch the button and you get a vibration...you would think it would disrupt your shaving, but it is subtle and doesn&#x27;t make your hand shake at all.  All that&#x27;s left is smooth skin, it&#x27;s amazing how close it gets.</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion Proglide Power Razor is an updated version of their old fusion razors.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample to test via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Cost has not really increased and the shave is much better than before. The handle is much more&lt;br /&gt;comfortable to hold and provides a closer shave without irritating my sensitive skin.  Good job,&lt;br /&gt;Gillette!</li>
            <li> I have used the pro glide for years and was was excited about a new product. what I found was that the razor still shaved well but the power part of it was more annoying and a distraction. this is not a product I would pay the extra money for. I like the good ol reg razor better  for me</li>
            <li> After receiving my Gillette Fusion Proglide razor through a promotional program from Gillette, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  I have always had issues getting a nice clean shave, but thats not the case anymore.  Although the razor itself gave a clean shave, the handle was easy to hold and very light.  Once you push the power button, it makes all the difference combining a great blade with vibration gets you an even closer shave. All in all a great tool for getting that clean shave you desire!!</li>
            <li> I have to say they have made me a life long user with this razor. Given that Gillette passed on a free one to try out, I will be purchasing them in the future. Less drag on my face and a clean shave with nothing left behind was a great way to start out the summer!</li>
            <li> I saw a program that Gillette running. Gillette was  giving away a free Fusion ProGlide Power handle. Razor was included. It was worth a try.I was unhappy with what i was using.As soon as I received the Power handle I used it.I liked the way it felt in my hand.What a great shave it was.My face never felt so SMOOTH.Now for the big test.My body in the shower.Arms,legs and chest.Never happier.Razor never slipped out of hand.I credit this to the bigger grips.This is a good razor.Closest shave i ever had.I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of the more blades are better campaign so for the most part I just used the cheapest i could find and tossed them after one use. I got this razor and blades through a free program from Gillette and I am completely hooked! This has got to be the smoothest shave I have ever had! Does not matter what type shaving cream , it just glides across my face. There is no need to keep scraping across the same area like with my other razors. Gillette has a new user for life!</li>
            <li> I received a Fusion ProGlide power handle through a Gillette promotion. I was a bit apprehensive since I used a power handle with a different razor before and did not like the way the vibration felt in my hand. The Fusion power handle has vibration that is a significant improvement over a different power handle I tried a couple years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Fusion blades without the power handle and they seemed to pull at my hair more than I like, however the vibration removed the pulling and helped me get a very close shave for my wedding day with minimal irritation (all of which cleared up in plenty of time for the pictures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the handle itself, it grips well, but feels beefy after using other disposable handles for over 10 years. Also, there are some ridges on the bottom that improve how well I can grip a wet handle, but the ridges still feel odd in my hand even after a full month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you use Fusion blades and it feels like they pull a bit on your stubble, I highly recommend upgrading to the power handle.</li>
            <li> This product works, plain and simple. If you are looking for a comfortable and close shave, this product works very well. I sampled this product as part of a free trial from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity by one of Gillette&#x27;s program to try out the Fusion ProGlide Power Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat, the \\&quot;micro pulse\\&quot; feature of the razor was quite interesting and the thinner blades made the shave more comfortable and smoother result. I would recommend others to give this product a try if/when given the opportunity.  I normally don&#x27;t like to shave more than once a week but the comfort and ease makes shaving less of a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of Gillette&#x27;s ProGlide Power is a bit higher ($9.99 on Amazon) but it could be worth it.</li>
            <li> Usually buying a razor is one of my least favorite things to do, but not any longer! This gives you a very close shave and the power function is awesome. It definitely feels like you are shaving with a powerful expensive electric razor. Plus the blue power light is very cool. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This razor is great!! It glides across the skin and does not cut me like others have in the past.  The power element of it reduces razor burn, and itching.  The handle is comfortable and does not slip.  This razor was provided for me for review free of charge by a program that Gillette offered.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the free razor.  This razors power function made my shave the closest I have ever had.  Even if you are not using the power it is still a good shave but it is way closer with the power going.  The blades last longer than most razors I have had as well.</li>
            <li> I just tested the Gillette Fushion Proglide.provided to me free by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on a four day growth and it gave me a smooth nick free shave.I was surprised it didnt tug or nick my neck like the old Fushion would occasionally did.The handle has a better grip than the old one too.</li>
            <li> This razor is hands down the best that money can buy. This is my second gilette razor. My old one is now for work and this new one is for home. The feel is comfortable in the hand. The shave is surpassed by none. Awesome look and trendy. Great product all around.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. The ProGlide is the first razor system that I&#x27;ve used that has not torn up, or badly irritated my skin. (Normally, I use electrics so I don&#x27;t break out in rashes.)  To my surprise the new blade system feels the same as other multi-blade systems- until you press that magic button. The seemingly simple vibration or \\&quot;micro pulses\\&quot; make a world of difference. The result was a shave  which was surprisingly painless and left my face smoother than it&#x27;s been in years. The handle is easy to hold and glides effortlessly towards shaving perfection. Thank you Gillette for sending me this amazing product to try. You&#x27;ve earned yourself a customer! refill&#x27;s are a little pricey but simple shopping around can almost always result in a good price.</li>
            <li> I got a chance to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free  thanks to a program run by Gillette. At first I was a little skeptical at how well it would work because the shell of the razor didn&#x27;t seem very thick and I was afraid that using it in the shower would make it act wonky. But boy was I wrong! I absolutely love this razor. First, the side grips on the razor gave me a better handle on it when shaving in the razor. Much more than just my standard Gillette razor. Also, the micropulses were AWESOME! They gave me an extra close shave. My wife even commented on the fact at how smooth my face was. Better yet was that my new close shave didn&#x27;t irritate my baby&#x27;s face in any way! And it has lessened the amount of times I&#x27;ve had to shave in a week. In all, this razor exceeded my expectations and has totally replaced my old traditional Gillette razor - for sure!</li>
            <li> I received this as a freebie, and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t pay for it. While the vibration is &#x27;neat&#x27;, it didn&#x27;t really seem to improve my shave. The thicker and heavier handle was not helpful to me at all.</li>
            <li> Gillette was running a free program to try out their new razor, the fusion profiled power, and as a long time fan of Gillette, I couldn&#x27;t refuse. I have a fusion shaver from a couple years ago which may seem very similar, but I found a particularly different experience.&lt;br /&gt;My old fusion shaver was already great, but I still experienced the issue of cutting myself in several places and the shave hurting when having too much facial hair. With the new shaver, however, things changed and I suddenly got far fewer cute, a much less painful shave, and an even faster shave. I noticed the blade and design was a bit different, indicating probably why my shave was so different from an older model fusion blade. The power vibrate seems more powerful but just as gentle while the blade has been improved to be even smoother on the skin. For people with sensitive skin like me, they&#x27;ll love it. The aesthetics of the shaver itself makes it look cutting edge (no pun intended), futuristic, and impressive. The holder even has a new look and it seems all these add up to a fantastic shaver. The company recommends to change the blade after every 4 or so uses but in my personal opinion, with such a clean and smooth blade, the blade can last you several more uses than that. I don&#x27;t write reviews much but I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Clean and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;* fast shave&lt;br /&gt;* much less painful than other shavers and therefore great for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;* very close shave as expected&lt;br /&gt;* power vibrate function gives an even smoother and closer shave&lt;br /&gt;* very aesthetically pleasing design&lt;br /&gt;* good grip&lt;br /&gt;* inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;* blade lasts quite a while&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* although I cut myself much less than previous shavers, I still minorly cut myself in 1 or 2 places&lt;br /&gt;* hair may get stuck in blade when shaving too thick of a beard... trim first! This goes for any shaver&lt;br /&gt;* Not much else&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Highly recommended blade and I can&#x27;t think of anything else that&#x27;s THIS great other than a profession Hollywood barber shave. But then again, not everyone&#x27;s made of money right? Affordable and amazing shave that anyone can get in my eyes, so without a doubt, I&#x27;m going to be using this shaver for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Handle. It is of solid construction and easy to use. Believe it or not, but the vibrating handle does work and add to the closeness of the shave. I would highly recommend using it and it is well worth the small money spent upfront. I would never drop hundreds of dollars on an electric shaver again.</li>
            <li> As a man that has been shaving with a DE single blade razor for a few years I was interested in giving this item a try.  When Gillette offered me the opportunity to try this for free I was ecstatic. I have to say I was highly disappointed.  The only good thing about this item was it was good for when you do not have time to properly shave, but then again so are throw away blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this blade does not provide any more protection against razor burn than any other blade. Razor burn is often caused by improper facial lubrication and dull blades.  By using this razor I  pulled 10-15 blades across my face, but when using my standard single blade razor I only pull 3 blades across ...  My math may be off, but that is significantly different.  The blades themselves did last a few shaves longer than a standard single blade, but at what cost 10 - 20 times. The trimming blade work out EXTREMELY FAST and the actual shave was not nearly as good as advertised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think the vibrating handle did anything, but annoy me.  This maybe because I properly wash my face before I shave so my facial hair is all ready to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally recommend buying a good quality handle, quality double edge shaving blades and quality shaving soaps.  It will take a little while longer to shave and some practice, but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality of shave and the lower cost.</li>
            <li> I did expect it to be as great as it was.  The balance in the handle was just perfect for going around my chin and the blade was great.  I was able to shave 5 times without noticing any problems.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a close and comfortable shave.  Did I forget to tell you that this Razor was provided to me for Free through a program from Gillette</li>
            <li> I got this as a \\&quot;try me\\&quot; from Gillette and after trying it I think they have a brand new customer!!!!  My wife loves the close shave I get.</li>
            <li> This razor gives you the neat and clean feel without the effort. The razor cuts through, even a few days of neglected shaving. Well worth it if your looking for that effortless shave and extremely close and smooth results. The only reason for the docked star is because I believe it cuts too close. By bed, I have a few in grown hairs. I believe this is because the hairs were too short but that may be something with me, sensitive skin or something but this razor provides an effortless smooth result.</li>
            <li> Having been using a regular Gillette razor for as long as I can remember I was a little hesitant when I got this one for free through a program run by Gillette. Truth be told tho, it does an amazing job, is very gentle (important to me since I have eczema). It gets a clean, close shave in no time. I will keep testing back and forth with my old one, but this one looks like a winner so far.</li>
            <li> I am usually at the mercy of my (budget-minded) wife in what razors I use.  However, I was given the Proglide Power Razor thru a Gillette sponsored program so it was out of her hands!  I do have sensitive skin and refuse to shave daily, even though I have fast-growing facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the ability of the Proglide to give a smooth, comfortable shave.  I didn&#x27;t have problems with the tugging and tiny slices that my usual disposables cause.  I have never used a power razor before and it was great.  I was even able to use it in the shower.  The Lubrastrip was a pleasant addition, and the handle was very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Downside: I went to the store and saw what the blade refills cost.  Not sure how that&#x27;s going to fly with the Budget Nazi!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the Mach 3 for a long time, but gave this one a try recently after I had received it for free from Gillette. I got a decent shave and will definitely continue to use it. I&#x27;m not a fan of the fact that it requires a battery to operate though, I&#x27;m perfectly content with and actually prefer the battery-less options.</li>
            <li> I personally have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. When I used to use my old razors, the cuts on on my neck would bleed out and make it look like I came straight out of a horror movie! A friend of mine had introduced me to this razor line and spoke very highly of it, but I ignored it thinking it was just another razor. From a program run by Gillette for a free razor, I finally had no excuses to try it out. The shave I received from it was beyond amazing. It was so simply to use and easy to load the battery into the handle. Speaking of which, the handles grooves and sleek designed helped me to easily and smoothly glide the razor across my neck and face. No matter how wet it got, I never lost a grip at all. As I held it, I doubted it would ever slip! It felt so comfortable and because I have to take so long to shave, my hand never cramped up or got tired of holding it. The powerful vibrations sent through it never even affected my hand or the way of which I shave. I highly recommend this product to anyone. Trust me, it is well worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using a Mach 3 for years and am quite happy with it. I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and I have tried the Regular Gillette Fusion Razor as well. The handle is quite comfortable,but, I don&#x27;t believe there is much difference between the manual and the power razor. I also feel that there wasn&#x27;t much difference between my Mach 3 or either Gillette razor, except the price in the blades. The Gillette blades are more expensive. I also find that the quality of shaving Gel that you use makes a huge difference. I will not be changing from my Mach 3</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  The added vibrations it gives off does give a closer shave than using a traditional razor.  It&#x27;s defiantly worth the price.  My facial hair grows pretty fast so even by the end of the day I sometimes notice some stubble.  It&#x27;s defiantly not as bad since I started used this razor.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor free through a program by Gillette. I like the shape of the handle it&#x27;s easy to hold and the rubber grips make it stick in my hand when wet. The size is good the normal size for a razor and not too bulky like other power razors I&#x27;ve tried in the past. As far as the power feature, it&#x27;s OK I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the vibrations because it maes me feel like I could be missing a spot when I shave. The beauty of this razor is I can use the power if I&#x27;m in the mood or not.</li>
            <li> This was a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.  The handle was very comfortable, and worked very well for getting at the hard to reach places.  It was easy to turn on, and the buzzing made it feel like I was at the barber shop.  It does not slip in your hand which is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I received this razor via a program run by Gillete and I liked the Gillete Fusion Proglide because it glided along my face smoothly.  I&#x27;ve used Gillete razors before and this razor felt smoother than the others I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;d recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, but didn&#x27;t feel the need to try one until I received a free one as part of a promotional program run by Gillette.  Gotta say, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a Schick Hyrdo 5-blade razor and, after four uses of the Fusion ProGlide Power, the Fusion ProGlide Power definitely gives a closer shave.  The head of the Fusion razor is more compact and I feel like it gets closer to my skin and does a better job getting into the tricky part under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the vibration from the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; a bit strange.  I was a bit nervous about using an electric that has real blades and the motion from the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; definitely felt different.  Frankly, it&#x27;s hard to see what real advantage the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; provides over just a regular Fusion ProGlide.  I&#x27;ll have to try it with the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; turned off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wonder how long the battery will last.  And how will I know when the battery is losing power?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power did provide a clean, close and comfortable shave -- regardless of whether the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; made a difference or not.  It works pretty darned well, so I won&#x27;t be too skeptical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best -- if not the best -- razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I was able to receive a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor through a program run by Gillette. I must say the handle on this product is great. It&#x27;s ergonomic, light-weight, thin and easy to grip when wet. I love being able to use this in the shower and not feeling like it&#x27;s going to slip out of my fingers.  I really like the micropulses feature, which helps my sensitive skin feeling smooth without the tugging and pulling I&#x27;ve experienced from other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. There&#x27;s no plugging in the razor as it&#x27;s battery operated and a nice feature is that the \\&quot;power on\\&quot; light flashes when the battery is running low and needs to be replaced soon. The design and color scheme is very sleek looking for a razor and the best part is that it actually lives up to the Gillette brand name. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who is looking on getting a handle on a better shave.</li>
            <li> I found this razor a great substitute for an electric razor, which I have used for years. However, when traveling, it&#x27;s far easier to take the Gilette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor and use it. It gives a similar close shaving but also the feel of an electric razor. Absolutely a great product!</li>
            <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor from a program sponsored by Gillette. I had never used a power handle before, so thought I may have issues with it. I ended up liking the power razor better than the manual. I seemed to have a better, closer shave with the power turned on. I did not have any issues at all with razor burn, or cutting myself. I only gave it 4 stars because I also got to try the all in one trimmer and found that I liked the thicker handle better.</li>
            <li> Being in a job where I need to shave every day, having a quality razor, and one that&#x27;s economically sound is very important.  I&#x27;ve used a variety of razors including the fusion, hydro and Mach 3.  Overall, I find the fusion power proglide to be one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: despite what I&#x27;ve seen in some reviews, I actually do get a better, closer shave with the powered fusion over non-powered razors.  I find the blades shave smoothly, with no noticeable pulling along or against the grain.  The blades are also fairly forgiving on skin (I tend to shave without shaving cream and rarely experienced any razor burn with the fusion power).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: my beard tends to be on the rough side, and with everyday shaving, I find that an average blade only has a 4-5 day optimal sharpness.  After that, they do begin to noticeably dull (although as I said, this may be due to my beard texture and shaving needs).</li>
            <li> I racived this razor in the mail free along with the schick hydro 3 from going on their websites . i think this razor was all looks no performance the old fusion Manuel was way better in my opinion and cheaper. the new pro glide doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth. and after i have compared both of thoses i tried the schick hydro 3and that was the best of them all it is much smother and moist and the replacement razors are the cheapest of the three and my 5oclock shadow came in later than when shaving with fusion pro glide as for closeness they are all the same. go to the companys websites and get them for free too .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO&lt;br /&gt;#1 schick hydro 3&lt;br /&gt;#2 original fusion&lt;br /&gt;#3 Fusion pro glide&lt;br /&gt;#4 Quattro</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I turned on this razor because the blades don&#x27;t move, instead the razor just vibrates.  However, this razor is absolutely wonderful.  I shaved my entire body except for my head and torso and it gave a close shave.  First I tried shaving without turning on the power and the razor felt sharp.  However, once you power it on, the vibration allows it to glide smoothly over your body.  When I shave with my normal razors I always get pin hole knicks all over my body (about 8-15) and come out of the shower bleeding. With this razor, I only had one knick--simply amazing. Because it gives a close, smooth, and knick-free shave I absolutely love it--5 stars all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had my boyfriend try it and he said it was great, although he mentioned that the blade was too large (due to the five blades) to shave under his nose easily but he could get use to that. He also said it shaves as close as his ordinary razor. He gave the razor 4 stars instead of my 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE October 19, 2013 - I&#x27;ve been using this razor regularly and have gone though several refills and still love it.  I only cut myself about three times in the three years I&#x27;ve used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE June 23, 2014 - After 4 years, this razor has finally died. The seal holding the battery compartment is no longer leak-proof so now I will order another one. I love this razor and have used no other razor (except to try one or two new ones that I got for free).</li>
            <li> With the claims of a revolutionary razor, I believe most of the hype to be exactly that, hype.     Took a shower, washed my face. Applied Gillette Fusion shaving cream and tested it next to my old Fusion. No difference, what so ever. The \\&quot;larger handle\\&quot; is not that big of a deal, compared to the fact that a Powered Fusion has roughly the same handle size. The shave was no closer, it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide. Having said that, I can&#x27;t complain, they sent it too me for free.     It&#x27;s an excellent marketing ploy designed to influence Americans to buy whatever product big businesses want us to buy next. Having said that, I see no reason to switch from my old Fusion to newer and more expensive cartridges. It received three stars due to the promises made by Gillette, and the fact there older products are just as functional as this newer, more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Since I started shaving a few years ago I&#x27;ve been using the bottom-of-the-barrel cheapo razor blades and dealt with irritating tug, ingrown hairs, and skin discoloration. So, it goes without saying when I figured I had enough of my face and chin looking like a rocky road I was bound to notice improvements when I picked up this razor, and I did.    Quality isn&#x27;t an issue here: the razor looks great, and gives me a very smooth shave. There is also a vibrating function which I choose to use since it eliminates just about any tug I feel on my skin. My shave feels much more comfortable, looks better, and even with 5 blades it works well against my sensitive skin which I already see improving. The precision trimmer edges up nicely for the clean cut look, but after experimenting I also feel it&#x27;s a less risky shave than the main blades around the \\&quot;danger zone\\&quot; chin and neck area.    So now, I got my free razor from Gillette, love it and plan on getting more razors/blades...whats the catch? At almost four bucks a blade for refills, this is simply outrageous and it&#x27;s a dealbreaker for me. I&#x27;ll keep using these until the razors I currently have go dull (luckily that will take a while) and downgrade to the original Gillette Fusion Blades unless the price of refills goes down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the (old) Fusion to shave my head for several years now.  Based on the hype, I decided to spring for the new Proglide.  I didn&#x27;t see a difference between the old Fusion and the Proglide Fusion.  No more/less irritation, pulling, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation ...if you&#x27;re an existing Fusion user, don&#x27;t bother.  If you&#x27;re using anything with less than 5 blades, give it a try.</li>
            <li> since the trend to powered razors has started I&#x27;ve tried several and haven&#x27;t been very impressed.  the M3 was the best I had tried before, but this new Fusion Proglide actually is pretty comfortable.  I only have to shave about every 3 days so I&#x27;m lucky, but my skin is fairly sensitive.  most razors are a little rough, this one actually feels smooth for the most part.  of course to me it&#x27;s more about the shaving cream and the after shave, but figured I&#x27;d throw my 2cents in and recommend this razor if you&#x27;re like me.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with Gilette since high school and have tried everything they make including the original sensor, sensor excel, mach 3, disposable pivot plus, and my favorite the disposable Sensor 3 http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Disposable-Sensitive-Lubrastrip-Packages/dp/B001F51QWK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1281647873&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2 . For me I get these at local grocery store 4 pack for 5 6 bucks which comes out to 1.50 a razor. In comparision the replacement baldes on the new proglide online range from about 3.50 to 4.00 before shipping per blade. Defnitley a smooth shave with the vibration or without. I like this better than the original fusion for since it lights less bulky and the razor head itself seems smaller and therefore closer to my face. I also like the straight edge but for someone who would do precision shaping on a goatee this is not the best choice. I personally like the gilette product that i provided a link to. and being half price doest hurt either.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail for free when Gilette was promoting the release of this razor. Since I have a unisex name,  I occasionally get men&#x27;s products. Anyway, I gave this a try, and I really love it. I&#x27;ve never used a razor with the vibrating feature on it before, but I found this great for my legs, especially my knees and ankles. I&#x27;ve NEVER cut myself using this blade, because with the vibration turned on, it&#x27;s pretty much impossible for me to press down too hard. It doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much to where it&#x27;s noisy or annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance, this razor makes my legs super smooth. I can go 2-3 days between shaves, and when my hair starts to regrow, the hair is finer and not as \\&quot;stubbly.\\&quot; I tend to find razors with 5-blades overdoing it a little, but I&#x27;ve never gotten such a smooth shave with either disposables or women-specific razors, like the Venus. I also love that this works so well on my underarms. Because it&#x27;s such a weirdly-shaped and sensitive area, I&#x27;ve never had completely, baby-smooth underarms before. This shaves super close without cutting or razor burn. And my legs are smooth ALL day, even if I shave at 8 in the morning. They still have that wonderful, smooth feeling against my sheets when I climb into bed that night. Ladies, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the blades getting clogged, and shaving with this razor is super quick and easy. The blades seem to last a while, at least 3-4 weeks shaving every other day or so. However, when they go dull, they go dull quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I didn&#x27;t like about this razor: one, it didn&#x27;t come with a blade refill, like every other razor I&#x27;ve ever bought, so that was kind of annoying. Also, the refills are expensive. Don&#x27;t buy the \\&quot;power\\&quot; refills if you don&#x27;t use the trimmer- that&#x27;s the only difference between the \\&quot;power\\&quot; blades and the \\&quot;manual\\&quot; blades, and there&#x27;s a dollar difference between the two. I don&#x27;t use the trimmer and it kind of freaks me out that it&#x27;s just an exposed blade on the opposite side, but I can see how men might find it useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is my favorite razor. I bought the refills even though they were expensive, and will probably be sticking with this for a long time.just an exposed blade on the opposite side, but I can see how men might find it useful.    Overall, this is my favorite razor. I bought the refills even though they were expensive, and will probably be sticking with this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This razor does a good job of what it is intended to do - give a clean, close shave and not cause razor burn in the process. The blade sharpness seems to last about the same as other blades and it is evident from the razor drag when it is time to change to a new blade. The only negative impressions I had were figuring out how to load the battery in the handle and the cost of replacement blades which are quite a bit more than standard disposable razor blades. If comfort and a close shave is more important than price then this is a good razor for you.</li>
            <li> My husband liked this razor very much. The price was about a third of store cost. He received it in one day. Great job Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever owned.  It is nice to have a close shave!!!</li>
            <li> Fair price great service.  First new razor I&#x27;ve bought in years, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the comfort and performance.  I didn&#x27;t really need the battery operation and don&#x27;t think it makes any difference now that I have it but it&#x27;s still the best razor I used in years.</li>
            <li> close shave for men with fine to med thick beard or sensitive skin. close shave and gentle on skin. excellent product and seller. excellent xmas gift for men.</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas as I wanted to see what the &#x27;power&#x27; feature was like.    Very disappointed - does not work the same way as my other non-powered Gillette razors do.  I didn&#x27;t find there was much &#x27;glide&#x27; and the razor seemed to get bogged down a lot.  It seems that a different technique is required with this razor...and thats something I&#x27;m not prepared to change.    Tried it 3 times and have gone back to my un-powered approach.</li>
            <li> I bought this for $4 on Amazon in July&#x27;10, I must say that this is the best razor I have ever owned. It has been almost six months since I have started using it, I have not even replaced the cartridge yet and it still gives me a close shave. Awesome.</li>
            <li> I had been using Gillette Mach-III till yesterday because proglide was not available in india. I bought it on amazon and used it in NJ. Here is my take on this Razor:    1. The handle grip is awesome, very confortable.  2. The blades, where are they ? does it have blades? Which means i dont feel like there is a blade, they are so thin, its really glides on my face.  3. Vibrations, they are soooo soothing, i think i would recommend a buy not without it, it doubles the gliding pleasure. Dont buy the manual one (my very personal opinion, you can if you want :-) )  4. The shave is so close, even if you shave against the grain, it works like WOWWWW.  5. My skin is little extra sensitive, so i do get razor bumps near my throat, but i dont think thats because of the razor, i get in all Razors or electronic shavers (i have Norelco Speed XL).  6. I use it with art of shaving kit. Its the best partner.   7. I also feel those who shave there pubic areas, this blade will be a extra plus because of extra thin blades and very little space between each blade, less chances of cuts. (i have not tried it though ;-)).    The best deal is when you buy it with the extra Cartridges.    The shipping was prompt and on time.    Overall i am impressed, give me some more stars to add :)</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I was looking for something different that could make my experience better. I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to shave on a daily basis so was looking for something that could speed up the process a bit. This razor does that! I&#x27;m not sure exactly how but the battery vibrations must do something that makes the process so much easier and faster and it leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. It&#x27;s at a great price, more affordable than any other store I&#x27;ve seen them at. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> why do we need a razor to vibrate? it doesn&#x27;t make a difference whether it vibrates or not you get the same shave. i switched for the fusion razor to a classic safety razor and will never go back the shave is closer and at a fraction of the cost.  good by Gillette!</li>
            <li> I generally hate shaving because no matter what I use, I get skin irritation. I figured I&#x27;d give this razor a shot and it seems to really minimize any tug and pull. I highly recommend you also try [[ASIN:B0057D7Y36 Gillette Fusion Proglide Irritation Defense with Extra Moisturizers Shave Gel]], it really does make a difference and I was pleasantly surprised how well it actually reduced shaving irritation alongside this razor. Almost like they were made for each other, go figure.</li>
            <li> I live in venezuela and here just arrive the Gillete Match3, i bought this one, to know another type of razor, and i have to say that this razor is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you need less work in your face for the same result that match3, I recomend 100%</li>
            <li> The best shave ever, smooth and close.  In the past several months, I&#x27;ve been getting razor burns from my  first generation Fusion razor.  I had to buy a replacement razor because I left the other one behind while traveling - so I decided to buy the Proglide Power razor based on several outstanding reviews here at Amazon.  I am so glad that I did (all things do work together for good...). My beard grows thick and fast, and my skin is fairly sensitive.  My first shave sold me, very smooth and very close.  I was able to pivot the razor and change directions with ease, no cuts, no nicks, and no razor burns.  My second, third and subsequent shaves were just as good as the first. Who would ever have thought a shaving system could have to near perfection (sorry, not having to shave would be perfection).</li>
            <li> Without doubt this product provides the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. It offers the most enjoyable characteristics of both electric and non-electric razors.</li>
            <li> There is no question about the needs for a man to have a clean shave here and there. But also, it takes finding the right one to suit all of your needs. This though isn&#x27;t completely one of them with the Gilette Fusion Proglide Power Razor. This battery-operated razor is easy to setup, and place in a simple AAA battery. The gripe though is that the blades get quickly dull after a few uses and you&#x27;d either have to get a new set of razor blades, or consider buying a razor sharpener. It does handle well otherwise, but Gilette needs to find less-expensive ways to get a shave that fits for what it is worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convience: C+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: C 1/2+</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t changed razors in years.  LOVE the Proglide Fusion which I received from Gillette.  Super smooth shave, no nicks or cuts or anything.  LOVE the vibration - it feels like I&#x27;m NOT shaving.  No razor bumps.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t take the time to write a review of a razor, but in this case I couldn&#x27;t help myself. I was hesitant to buy the proglide since I knew it was just an \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version of the fusion. I figured this was just an attempt to sell us something all us fusion owners already had and my suspicion was furthered by other reviews posted here, which said the proglide was not much of an improvement over the fusion. But I decided to try it as I love new toys and though I really like the fusion I don&#x27;t think it is perfect as occasionally it does give me razor burn. So it was much to my surprise when I tried the proglide only to discover that it was much, much smoother then fusion. I don&#x27;t want to overstate things, but this is the smoothest, easiest shave I have ever experienced. Like I said, I liked the fusion, but didn&#x27;t think it was perfect. But the proglide is so good I&#x27;m not sure what the next step in shaving evolution will be as I feel this is as good as it gets. Definitely worth the $11 or so to switch from the fusion</li>
            <li> Gillette has done it again, smooth and silky shave system second to none!  Keep it up guys!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Gillette Mach 3 for many years. This is the first new razor I have tried since then. I compared it to the Mach 3 and this is what I&#x27;ve determined:    PROS:  1. Very close, smooth shave. It is noticably closer than the Mach 3.  2. Less pulling than the Mach 3.  3. Razor handle has a nicer and more expensive \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to it. It has a little heft, so to speak.    CONCERNS / ISSUES:  1. The razors are materially more expensive than the Mach 3. It&#x27;s a close call as to whether it is worth paying the extra money. If your neck is sensitive and easy to burn with other razors, I&#x27;d go with this one.   2. The razors are thinner. I was concerned that they might not last as long, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.  3. Amazon has great info and instructions. The razor itself does not. It really would have been helpful to have instructions and a discussion of the features on the razor box. For example, I really wasn&#x27;t sure of the purpose of the vibrating head. I might have appreciated some of the features more if I had understood what they were for and that is not always obvious from the packaging.</li>
            <li> I used Gillette cartridge shavers for years; Sensor Excel, Mach 3, the 4-blade system (forgot the name), and Fusion Power. Probably spent thousands of dollars on these contraptions, and for what??--as I&#x27;ve learned, the shave you get from the cartridge razors is simply not as good as old-fashioned straight razor and safety razor shaves. If you don&#x27;t take yourself seriously as a man and as a connoisseur, than by all means, stick with cartridge razors and waste money to boot. But if you value the lofty experience, the pinnacle of manly class and style, try out traditional shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to a safety razor rather than move up to the Proglide. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;The best shave you can get, of course, is from a professional barber with a profesionally-maintained straight razor. But that&#x27;s an occasional treat, unless you have the time to go to your barbershop every morning and afternoon for shaves (I hope that tradition makes a comeback, though). Maintaining a straight razor at home is time-consuming. And you have to treat shaving with more care and caution, lest you bloody your shower as in a scary horror flick. The good medium compromise is the famous safety razor, which is making a comeback these days. You buy a safety razor handle, made of heavy metal, usually stainless steel. It feels good, heavy, solid in your hand. You buy an inexpensive supply of safety razor blades. Easy to replace, they last about 1-2 weeks per double-sided blade, dependng on beard thickness. Standard safety blades will do you fine, and they&#x27;re much, much less expensive than constantly buying cartridges which clog and wear out quickly (if you want the best safety razor blades, [...] ([...]) has cryo-treated safety blades that last five times as long as regular safety blades, so you save even more money).&lt;br /&gt;Then, you buy several shaving soaps and soap dishes, for variety if you like, which are better for your skin than mass-market aerosol shaving gels. The mass-market stuff is junk. Traditional shaving soaps last months, are good for your skin, and smell wonderful. The women will love you and your close, clean-smelling shave. I keep five different soaps in my shower in separate bowls so i can switch depending on my mood for scents. You can buy a good quality boar bristle shaving brush for $15, or as part of a set, which you use to apply the soaps from inside the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;For instructions and more information on the old art of traditional shaving, you can also check out The Art of Manliness blog ([...]), which is an enjoyable website for the cultivated man&#x27;s lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, safety razors and straight razors give you a much closer shave, with less irritation, with healthier skin from traditional shaving soaps, that smell better, at a much lower price. And btw, a quality aftershave treatment will also be very good for your skin, it does make a difference.

            <li> First I&#x27;ll note that I&#x27;m a female, and not the target audience for this item, so I handed it over to my boyfriend to do the testing. He&#x27;s been shaving a beard for decades and has tried out many, many razors during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His current razor is a Mach 3, so he did side by side comparisons between that one and this Fusion Proglide. He did the typical half-the-face test where he shaved each half with one of the razors. He did comparison tests where he tried it powered and non-powered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of these tests, the result - the shave closeness - was about the same. This was true with power or not, with the Mach 3 or the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the *process* of shaving. running the Fusion Proglide with the power off felt similar to using the Mach 3. However, when you turned the power on, there seemed to be much less \\&quot;pull\\&quot; - it seemed to move through the whiskers more easily.  I&#x27;ll note again that while this difference was evident during the shaving process, the end result (the shaving closeness) was pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was expecting the trimmer blade to be pretty useless - but it turns out it was pretty convenient for trimming. You can&#x27;t do large volumes with it, but it works for its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He used it for a half dozen shaves, and the blade still has a little life left, which is on par with a Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who already have a Mach 3 and didn&#x27;t care about the \\&quot;shaving process itself\\&quot;, there&#x27;s no real reason to change blades. People who are having issues with tugging and pulling might appreciate the smoother shaving experience with the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the issue of blade cost, if you buy the Proglide blades in bulk, you can get blades closer to $3 a blade. Still, this can seem expensive compared with other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end we&#x27;re hoping when we run out of Mach 3 blades that the blades for this one might have dropped in price and we&#x27;ll move over to the Proglide. However, but it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;d toss out the Mach 3 and the existing blades in order to use this.ike we&#x27;d toss out the Mach 3 and the existing blades in order to use this.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by how smooth this glides over my face.  I cannot go back to the previous generations.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a good quality razor and gets the job done. It is obviously marketed towards males, but I like the quality of the mens razors better than womens. This razor works great in the shower or out and the blade life is about average. The massage feature is more of a novelty than a bonus, but overall it is a good product that I will continue using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you how much I love these new blades because my wife is sick of hearing it!    I thought the original Fusion Power was a slight upgrade on the Mach 3, but the Fusion Proglide Power is miles ahead of both. The blades really do glide over my face quickly and comfortably, and the shave is so close that no stubble appears for hours later than with previous blades. I don&#x27;t like shaving, and I put it off when I can, but the Powerglide has made shaving so fast that I&#x27;m no longer trying to avoid it.</li>
            <li> (UPDATE - well I mailed back my Proglide to Gillette to least take advantage of their \\&quot;Money-back Guarantee\\&quot;. I packaged up the entire original package as new, including the box, original receipt, and the cheesy complaint card you are entitled to write as per their refund guidelines. It cost me $12 to send all of this. Months later (seriously - like 2 1/2 months later!) they sent me back a letter &amp; my receipt claiming that they cannot fulfill my request because I \\&quot;did not include the UPC code\\&quot;. The UPC code was on their packing!!! I sent it all back like new!!! More than they asked for!!!&lt;br /&gt;So - not only did I waste my time and an additional $12...but Gillette is wasting resources mailing this joke back to me...hence their costly product.&lt;br /&gt;I attribute this little event to Gillette not caring for my original review here on Amazon (below)...they knew it was me because my letter was basically a copy of this review!...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey America! Are why are we falling for this? Surely there are more of you who have noticed this disturbing trend of late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am of Italian heritage with a heavy beard - I shave more whiskers in one stroke than most peach-fuzz Caucasians shave in a whole week...&lt;br /&gt;So if I don&#x27;t need all these blades &amp; tacky gimmicks - then no one does.&lt;br /&gt;All anyone requires is the original twin blade Sensor - loud, proud &amp; simple. Easy to use with well-balanced quality &amp; \\&quot;spring blades\\&quot; to eliminate nicks. That was the Gillette I stuck with for many years. The Sensor was not impossibly wide/no annoying rubber fins/no vibrations/no batteries/no hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gimmicky, bulky, and overpriced nightmare fails to last any longer than a simple Sensor twin blade - here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;The 5 blades here work well for the open expanse areas of the face...great. But they are way too wide to get at any tight spots like under your nose, upper lip, or any side-burn/mustache trimming. Gillette&#x27;s solution is to flip over to a single trimming blade on the back. But here is where this entire concept fails: now we are down to the use &amp; life of just this one blade!&lt;br /&gt;Get it?&lt;br /&gt;Once this one \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; blade is dull, the whole $3.00+ blade goes in the garbage!&lt;br /&gt;So really - it does not last any longer than a twin blade! With the old Sensor, we had the advantage of two blades hitting all the tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there is this useless &amp; goofy \\&quot;power\\&quot; business. So now, not only are we being forced to fork over $3.00+ per blade...but now we also have to start buying batteries. Gillette&#x27;s stance on the environment? Well evidently their position is to now have millions more batteries going into our landfills. Lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, Gillette is clearly bullying the marketplace as we longtime loyal customers can no longer find our favorites in the stores. And if we do - they are now priced double of what they were just a few short years ago. In fact, last time I found my Sensors at Walmart - there was a big sticker on the box asking the customer to call a 1-800 number to inform them if we \\&quot;see this product being sold elsewhere\\&quot;!! So much for competition and the free market economy!&lt;br /&gt;I remember everyone used to just go into the shaving aisle at the stores, grab their fave blades and leave. Now these aisles are full of price-shocked guys standing around scratching their heads, wondering what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I understand that Gillette cannot effectively inventory all the retailers with every generation of product they ever made. I also believe in the evolution and optional availability of an evolved product. But give us the option of buying a simple twin Sensor blade at an affordable price and keep it readily available. But here Gillette has us over the barrel and is literally forcing everyone to pay a premium for what many of us do not believe is any better (in fact - annoyingly worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not, then I would say that this is an opportune time for the competition like Wilkinson Sword to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price. They would clean house. Unfortunately, I myself have not experimented much with the competition because of hit &amp; miss availability. Don&#x27;t want to find something one week - and then get stuck without the next. Hopefully that will now change.ord to step up and hit this sweet spot by heavily marketing that sorely missed twin blade at an reasonable price. They would clean house.

            <li> Works well, smooth shave and no irritation as long as the vibrate is turned OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the razor, but as soon as the vibrate gets turned on, it tears up my sensitive face.  If you have sensitive skin (I can&#x27;t use an electric, mine is so bad), don&#x27;t try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best advice for those with sensitive skin, stick with the old stand-bys from Gillette (the ones that don&#x27;t vibrate) and you&#x27;ll do better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I used electric razors, Norelco and Braun types, and thought they were fine; I was a bit intimidated by manual shaving. Then when I got a older I disliked the fact I could never shave very close with those razors, leading to afternoon beard shadows. Plus, it was hard to do anything like trim a smart goatee or sideburns, not to mention the heads would wear out periodically, and were expensive to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I moved to shaving cream and manual razors, and it was like graduating to the big leagues, or moving from an automatic transmission to a stick-shift. I felt more in control and got a much better shave that lasted all day. But with cheap razors I found I&#x27;d end up with nicks and irritations no matter how carefully I shaved. I&#x27;m the type of shaver who goes against the grain; otherwise, I&#x27;d never get close enough (my beard grows pretty fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried most of the hyped-up Gillette and Schick razors over the years, and while they were a definite improvement over the throwaway kind, they were never all they were cracked up to be - I just figured razor technology had gone about as far as it could go, and adding more blades or a gimmick like battery power were just oneupmanship between the two major brands to win market share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until I decided to give this Fusion Proglide Power a shot. I should say right up front, I&#x27;ve not used the non-power version, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether the vibration is a gimmick or does something useful. But I will say I haven&#x27;t had a better shave except from a barber! The basic razor (and especially the starter kit) are not expensive, for what they are. The \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; cost, of course, is the price of the blades (and the Fusion creams if you choose to use their brand). This could be a big drawback for some, but I value the comfortable, nick-free shave this razor gives me and the extra cost is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, the only better shave you can get is from a straight razor or good safety razor with the old-fashioned shaving soap and brush. But that makes a mess and is hard to master. I was actually going to try that route before I bought the Proglide... now, I don&#x27;t have to! This razor does what it says, and the space between the blades stays remarkable clean as well. I&#x27;m used to having to dip my razor in the water, tap it hard on the back, or some other way to unclog the blades after every few strokes. Not so with this one. Maybe because the blades are thinner? I don&#x27;t know, but it just seems like it never clogs, even with some heavy growth to mow. That&#x27;s another big plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dunno about buying into the whole Gillette \\&quot;system\\&quot; of warm-up washes, Fusion creams, and cooling aftershave. I think those products are overpriced and I can surely find cheaper brands that work just as well. But as to the razor itself (or more precisely, its blades), I have to give this product 5 stars. Do I wish the blades were cheaper? Sure. But I don&#x27;t mind paying for something when it&#x27;s actually worth the extra money, and to me at least, the shave this gives my fairly sensitive skin and course beard definitely makes it worth the money.

            <li> Very good razor.  I had no complaints with the last razor, but I was in need of new blades and figured I might as well get the latest and greatest.  I have both versions of this razor, power and regular.  The power version makes for a very irritation free shave.  I have the power one at work and the normal version at home.  I find myself waiting until I get to work to shave to have less irritation.  I don&#x27;t notice and closeness difference between the two.  Both shave very close.  Even after a few days of growth these razors cut through the hair with ease without pulling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using multi-blade razors for a long time, and found that I preferred Gillette over Schick, the latter diving me a smoother shave. I suppose there is a degree of subjectivity involved when you make a comparison with fresh blades. I remember that Consumer Reports was unimpressed with the vibrating Fusion when it came out, but I got one right away and liked it--even while aware that each \\&quot;improved\\&quot; razor came with ever-more expensive blades.     Now there is the Fusion Proglide Power Razor. It makes claims of important improvements on what I would have thought was unimprovable--after all it is just a razor with a new generation (it claims) of blades.    So the question is this: is there a positive difference?    I read the information that came with the razor and on the web and was impressed by Gillette&#x27;s audacity (for instance, a circuit board to keep an even flow of juice to the vibrator motor even as the battery runs down, and special groves to feed whiskers into the onrushing blades as the user draws the Fusion Proglide across a cheek!).    I figured to keep it simple: fresh blades in my current Fusion and in the Fusion Proglide, one for each cheek; four down strokes over gel shaving cream on the left cheek for the Fusion and four more on the right for the Fusion Proglide. Little did my familiy know that my morning routine had become a major evaluation activity.     Well, there is a difference. I like a smooth shave and this razor and blade gives the best shave that I&#x27;ve come across outside of barbershop.    I liked it and you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I consider myself an avid wet shaver.  I have all the products - the Merkur&#x27;s safety razors, the Gillette Fatboy, and as assortment of straight razors from Dovo and Thiers Issard.  There is nothing more that I enjoy than lathering up my Rooney silvertip badger and shaving on a weekend morning.  However, for those quick morning shaves before work I always turn to my trusty Gillette, ranging over my shaving career from the Sensor Excel to the Mach III to the Fusion and now the Proglide.  I have to say, each has been an improvement over the previous, with the newest generation being the best.    Gillette loves to throw in the marketing gimmicks - the \\&quot;enlarged lubrastrip\\&quot;, the \\&quot;redesigned precision trimmer\\&quot;, the \\&quot;micro-combs\\&quot;, and the \\&quot;thinner, finer blades.\\&quot;  All of these are just lovely ways of saying - hey, we are not giving you a different colored fusion razor like the phenom or racecar or matrix of whatever they called the other Fusions.    What I can say, is that somehow with all these \\&quot;innovations\\&quot;, they have managed to minorly improve an already stellar razor.  It does what it says, it glides better on your face.  It have me a 9/10 shave with one pass with the grain in 1 minute of time with no irritation.  You maybe able to get a 10/10 baby butt smooth shave with a Thiers Issard straight blade with a careful four pass 15 minute shaving, but who has time for that!  And it has less tug, less drag than the fusion.      Gillette has always been the King of shaving.  The Fusion has put all other over the counter modern safety razors to shame.  This just follows their precedent.  Yeah, it is a Fusion razor with a blue LED light and some minor changes.  But hey!  It&#x27;s great.  It is an all around great razor.  The Proglide will now be my new go to razor for the prework shave.  I give it four stars because it is a great razor, it&#x27;s the best on the market, but it isn&#x27;t perfection.  Gillette is striving towards it.  I want that 10/10 shave.  That may be too much to ask.But is Gillette thinks they&#x27;ve gotten it complete figured out, they&#x27;ll stop trying.      Good job, Gillette.  You know shaving.</li>
            <li> I was more than a little skeptical about the glorious claims, but the product was everything it was claimed to be.  I was not working during Memorial Day week, and decided to give the razor a test by not shaving for five days.  I expected at least SOME tugging and resistance, but \\&quot;glide\\&quot; is the right word.  It was almost as if there were no blade at all -- except that my week-old beard disappeared without a trace.  The mild humming is odd for a safety razor, but not disturbing at all, and the shave is fantastic.</li>
            <li> As a light bearded guy who can easily get by only shaving twice a week (unless something special is going on), I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time, money and effort on shaving. For years, the [[ASIN:B000052YHS Gillette Mach3 Shaving System, 1 System]] was all I used, and that was enough. Recently, I was given a free [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]] (non-powered type), and I tried it, but didn&#x27;t really like it. The five blades makes for a really big shaving surface that I found I couldn&#x27;t really get to go where I wanted. It shaves nicely in the large, easily accessed areas of the face, but around the nose, mouth and chin, I found it more cumbersome than precise. So I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the battery powered Fusion, but after not shaving for a week and a long weekend, I was ready to give it a shot. The five blade surface still feels a bit unwieldy, and the battery powered vibrations are, for me, disconcerting. But the shave was really nice. I felt like it cut better and easier, and I didn&#x27;t have as much difficulty at the usual trouble areas. The shave was very close, possibly the closest I&#x27;ve had in a few years. I&#x27;m pretty sure from a cost standpoint, this razor is going to be a lot more expensive to use on a regular basis than my trusty Mach 3, but I can&#x27;t argue that it provides a better shave. For a heavy bearded person who shaves every day (or twice a day?), this will probably be worth the extra cost. It may even shave close enough for some guys to not have to touch up in the evenings. A lot of subjectivity and personal preference goes into facial care, so I would say, if you are on the fence about these powered manual razors, you ought to give it a try, it might be what you are looking for. For me, the cost weighs down the shave quality, and it is probably not something I would buy on a regular basis, but like I said, this might be what a lot of men are looking for.</li>
            <li> The first thing I tried with this razor was a side-by-side comparision with my Mach 3 razor.  So I put a new blade on my old razor and shaved one side of my face and neck, and the other with the Fusion.  Without hesitation I can say the Fusion was a much smoother and less iritating shave.  However, both razors seemed to give the same shave in terms of closeness.  To be sure, I let my hair grow out a few days and there was no appreciable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this to anyone who needs a very sensitve shave.  The battery power works in the shower, so that&#x27;s a nice convenience.  Naturally, with a battery, there&#x27;s more heft than an unpowered razor like the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside, you might expect, is that the blades are about twice as expensive as the Mach 3.  Since my old razor never bothered me, I won&#x27;t be switching to these more expensive blades.  But if money is no object, or if you really need a more comfortable shave, this would be a good razor for you.</li>
            <li> I am always trying to find shaving products to give me a closer and more comfortable shave.  I&#x27;ve experimented with this razor for the past few days.  I will not be permanently upgrading to this.  For some reason, Gillette appears to have completely bought into the notion that five blades gives a better shave than just two or three.  Like the Fusion Power, the Fusion Proglide Power has some of the same problems.  The most obvious problem it has is cost (just like the Fusion Power).  For the quality of the shave you get, the cost of replacement cartridges is not justified.  To be fair, I have noticed a slightly more comfortable glide with this over the Fusion Power.  The blade stabilizer and microcombs do appear to be a modest improvement in this regard.  Also, the Fusion Proglide blades appear to last a little longer than the Fusion Power blades - but not by much.  The micropulses still do not provide a greater degree of comfort over a razor that lacks this feature.  Also, I have not noticed a closer shave with this razor over the current one I am using (which is now the Schick Hydro 3).  When comparing it my current razor, the Fusion Proglide Power definitely lacks the level of smoothness and comfort.  Last but not least, just like its predecessor, I&#x27;ve discovered this five bladed razor tends to nick my face more often than a double or triple bladed razor.  Gillette needs to get back to basics by realizing it is much easier to keep a satisfied customer who gets a good, comfortable shave as opposed to introducing new brands of razors that have gimmicks, and that are, not to mention, ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> With a $4 off coupon and 5 EC buck offer from CVS I was able to land this razor free.  Since I love trying out new products I decided to give it a try.  My first razor was a Mach 3 Turbo and I have been a loyal Gillette razor users.  Two weeks prior to purchasing the Proglide I purchase my first Fusion razor.  I was extremely disappointed by the power Fusion.  I always shave against the grain and it was painful.    This problem has been eliminated with the Proglide.  It is a smoother, easier shave.  I HATE shaving but this razor makes it quick, easy, and painless.     I would recommend it for anyone.  The blades are costly but with sales and coupons it should be managable.</li>
            <li> The Gillette razors always provide a nice shave but their ever increasing price of blades pushed me away years ago.  I now use a simple old fashion safety razor which works great and the blades are dirty cheap.  Now I won&#x27;t disagree that the Fusion cuts fine and I can shave in record time without fear of removing my Adam&#x27;s apple but $4 a blade is just robbery.  For the most part I think I&#x27;ll stick to safety razor for the bulk of my shaving and then finish up the \\&quot;scary\\&quot; areas with the Fusion.  This prolongs the life of the Fusion.  The safety razor actually works better if you let your whiskers grow longer as since it&#x27;s single blade it never clogs.    If you currently use the old Fusion then I fail to see any benefit in this new model.  I&#x27;m sure they have some lovely marketing but in the end it&#x27;s 98% the same and I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  Perhaps the biggest fluff is the \\&quot;power\\&quot; feature.  It&#x27;s completely useless and IMO is just an attempt to add another disposable item to this razor.  I&#x27;m not sure who asked for their razor to shake in their hands but that&#x27;s not what I want while I&#x27;m shaving around my lips or throat.  I wound up keeping it off while I shave.  I&#x27;m also still not a fan of the flip back behavior of the Fusion... I prefer the head to stay still but since this isn&#x27;t new then maybe you&#x27;re fine with it.    Overall it&#x27;s a fine razor, but it&#x27;s a marketing (not engineering) upgrade with goals to charge you just a bit more per blade but it&#x27;s already too much IMO.</li>
            <li> FUSION PROGLIDE IS DEFINITELY BEST SHAVE IVE EVER HAD AND IVE BEEN A FUSION USER FOR 3YEARS. DEFINITELY LOVE THE POWER VERSION. GRIP FEELS GREAT IN HAND. DOESNT SLIP. POWER BUTTON LIGHT IS COOL. JUST LOOKS PREMIUM AND MASCULINE. WHEN I FIRST SHAVED WITH IT IT WAS SO SMOOTH I HAD TO CHECK WHETHER I WAS SHAVING AT ALL. CLOSE SMOOTH AND COMFORTABLE. A WINNER.</li>
            <li> This razor does actually \\&quot;glide\\&quot;! I have the power version and when you turn it on the whole razor buzzes and vibrates just enough that as your shaving your facial hair doesn&#x27;t tug/ pull like so many other razors. I usually shave every day or two but to test this \\&quot;gliding\\&quot; i wait about a week so the hair would be almost too long for a hand held razor, but to my amazement it still managed to not have any tugging on the hair. This razor also has a single blade for trimming which is good over all but tends to clog up pretty fast. Other than the single blade side clogging its a fantanstic razor and look pretty awesome too!</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t even considering waxing euphorically over common household implements, not even things that I use on a frequent basis, and I have never been known to even consider what my husband uses to shave.  That all changed when we received the Fusion Proglide Power Razor.  My  husband is resistant to trying anything new, so it took some nudging to get him to try this.  In the past, he bought whatever was on sale and used it until he hated it and tried something new.  He has very sensitive skin and could not use an electric razor, so he wasn&#x27;t very keen on something that sounded suspiciously like it might be a hybrid of old and new.  Once he used it, he was delighted. In 30 plus years, I have never known his face to be so smooth and free of stubble. This is possibly the best shave he has ever gotten, and it left his skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s face, and in great condition.  The shave was close, smooth, and he actually enjoyed using the razor.  He also told me to leave it alone, and to buy my own!  There are coupons in the papers this week, so I am going to do just that, and buy the one made for women.  This is a really great product.  It fits nicely in the hand, it&#x27;s got an interesting shape, and it does what it promised to do.  I have very sensitive skin, and in the past when he rubbed his face against mine, I got red angry patches on my cheeks.  Not even a hint of it this time, so we are both very pleased with this product.  It seemed to float over his skin, and it left it in the best condition that I have ever seen.  I don&#x27;t think anything would persuade him to going back to his old razors, and in fact, he did throw them out!  This is a great product, and we highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The big difference with this product is that it&#x27;s powered so my review will focus there.  One AAA battery (included) goes into the handle.  Just press the blue button and you get a vibrating disposable razor.  Very cool, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.  For one, the marketing materials included in the package make no claim to any incremental benefit of using the vibrating razor function, only that it turns itself off after 7 minutes.  There are plenty of claims about the thinness of the blades, etc. but nothing about the power function.  In fact, it&#x27;s distracting, and in some cases for me, interferes with the tactile nature of shaving.  Sometimes you need that feel when you&#x27;re hunting for a few whiskers that escaped the first one or two passes.  You don&#x27;t want to redo an area too many times, so you sense by feel where the patch is that needs extra attention.  This razor made me realize how tactile in nature blade shaving can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rest of the features, I&#x27;m sure Gillette made some incremental improvements but I can&#x27;t tell.  I do think the first shave out of the package was just marvelous.  If I were rich and spendthrift I would only use each blade once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/28/2012 Update: the battery ran out long ago and I&#x27;ve never gotten around to replacing it.  I&#x27;ve since switched to the regular Fusion blades (they are expensive enough) rather than the Pro blades.</li>
            <li> This razor is okay, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype, and, most certainly, not the price.   It&#x27;s all sizzle and not too much substance.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong you&#x27;ll get a good shave, relatively speaking.  But I&#x27;ve had better shaves with other less costly razors. I&#x27;ve used the Fusion, both manual and power, and the Mach 3.  After shaving for a number of years with both Fusion power and manual, I&#x27;ve detected no difference between a \\&quot;power\\&quot; shave and a manual one. The Proglide is no different.  The \\&quot;power\\&quot; option with battery and all sounds great, but doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It&#x27;s a placebo and an expensive one at that.     I&#x27;m going back to using Mach3.      Here&#x27;s a tip that has really served me well:  use hair conditioner rather than shaving foam, and you will get a much closer shave.  At first, I didn&#x27;t believe a friend of mine when he gave me this tip.  But it&#x27;s true.  I get much closer shaves.  And the other great benefit is that your razor blades last much, much longer.  Instead of a razor blade lasting me for a couple of weeks, tops, when I use foam, my blade is good for six to eight weeks when I use hair conditioner. Needlessly to say, now I only use hair conditioner for shaves.  And I don&#x27;t have to tell you, this translates to not only getting great shaves, but to saving a lot of money!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this new Fusion, since I have a Fusion already, and I gave it up for a safety razor with the old timey double edge blade, since that razor worked better than the Fusion did at giving me a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, the Proglide Power was FANTASTIC!  The little vibrating action of the battery powered handle really made a huge difference in how easy it was to shave, and the razor glided right through thick stubble with no problem at all.  The thinner blades didn&#x27;t clog up and washed out pretty easy (which was a HUGE complaint about my older Fusion), and after using it for a few weeks, the blade is duller but not as nick happy as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while the hype is still pretty big, I was surprised at how genuinely good this razor ended up being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad part?  Well, this thing is EXPENSIVE.  The handle is affordable, but you&#x27;re paying $22 for 6 refills.  Thats unbelievable!  Especially since I can get 5 blades for a dollar with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its a great razor, but its super expensive to buy cartridges.  If you can afford it, you&#x27;ll like it.  But I&#x27;ll probably just stick to my safety razor, since it offers a super cheap shave.</li>
            <li> The shave with the Gillette Fusion Proglide  is superior to the previous model, THe Gilette Fusion.</li>
            <li> A lil hard to use around the nostrils.  It does and acceptable job.  it is a different king of mounting system of the blade.  it took me a few trials before I got it.  I been using it for a few weeks now.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a month now. I shave my head rather than my face with it though. Mainly the reason for that is a still have a pack of twin blades for my old razor which work fine on my face, but are a tad rough on my head. I&#x27;ve been keeping a bald head for about 6 weeks now and this razor is a huge improvement from the twin. Several men&#x27;s bald type websites had noted advantages with the 5 blade. Some say power, some say not. If I space it, and use the razor without the power- I notice it on cleanup for sure. My hair was thin on top so either way- that area is smooth. It is the back and parts of the sides that the power delivers on. Now it is written.</li>
            <li> Very well dsigned product. I thought the FUSION was the best but this PROGLIDE is really even better. I recomment this shaver as the best on the market!</li>
            <li> I have been a longtime fan of Gillette, having used their razors for easily 95% of my shaving life. I have tried--and rejected--several different Schick razors over the years simply because they were uncomfortable and left me feeling as though I had just shaved with broken glass using battery acid for shaving cream. I always went back to my Mach 3, then Fusion and was pleasantly surprised to see that the Fusion was being re-tooled to be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter HOW great my shaves have been using Gillette products, invariably I wince each &amp; every time I go into a store to purchase replacement blades. Damn, but they&#x27;re expensive! For some stupid reason, the times when I need a new razor the most seem to be at the moments when I can afford it the least. Weird, but a painful &amp; expensive fact nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swore off using Schick products shortly after the release of the Quattro model several years ago. I borrowed my brother-in-law&#x27;s once and on a brand new blade, got a MUCH worse shave than I did using my 1 month old--not to mention rather dull and oft-used Gillette Mach 3 razor. After that I simply gave up even considering purchasing Schick products EVER again. I have always stuck with Gillette since--however, in all fairness I have discovered a 6 bladed razor that I have only found at Walgreens which shaves JUST AS GOOD as my Fusion--not to mention are cheaper (by at least $3 per refill), and would often stick with that in the last year or so when money has been tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally saved up and purchased a Proglide razor recently and found the shave to be pretty much as expected. But as I began to take stock in all the models I have used over the years, I found something interesting...and I went and tested my theory to see if I was imagining it all--and nope, I was right on the money. The simple fact of the matter is this: all things considered, the Mach 3 razor shaves I would say about 98% as close as the Fusion 5 blade razor...and I aslo discovered that the Proglide does not shave ANY closer than the original Fusion. NONE. Considering how freakin&#x27; expensive Gillette products are, and especially how much more they charge for the Proglide than the Fusion, I&#x27;m sorry, but I would expect if the product cost 35% MORE, that the razor would actually perform 35% better, too. Not so. And when I factor in that the much cheaper Mach 3 shaves essentially as close as the other two MUCH more expensive razors, well I think you can figure out where I am going with this...I also discovered quite by accident, that Consumer Reports did their own independant testing and came up with the EXACT SAME results. Interesting, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one additional thing to add: through the amazon Vine program I received a Schick Hydro 5 razor back in early August. I only ordered it because I figured as long as I would be getting it for free, then at least if I did not like it, I could throw it away and not feel as though I had wasted any money. I was exceptionally surprised when after my first shave I had decided that I would go out and purchase a replacement cartridge right away. Yes, it was THAT good. From what I have noticed having used it now for over 2 months (still on the first original blade, too) is that the Hydro blades stay sharper MUCH longer than ANY previous Gillette product I have used in the past. Imagine my surprise when I went to purchase a replacement 4pack cartridge and discovered it was just under $5 cheaper than the regular Fusion 4pack and nearly $7 cheaper than the Proglides. In fact, it was about the exact same price as what I was paying for Mach 3 cartridges some 5 YEARS ago. Cheaper razors that last longer and still give me a top notch razor-burn-free shave adds up to one very converted former Gillette fanboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up: did the Proglide shave great? YES. In fact it was a superior shave all around. Would I recommend buying one? Well, that depends. Personally I doubt I&#x27;ll pay for anotherProglide razor ever again. I simply cannot justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper. Reading some other reviews here at amazon I have noticed something interesting, former Schick fans who have converted to Gillette saying the Proglide is better or superior and whatnot...but I found that for ME, the opposite was true. While the Proglide provided a great shave, the Hydro 5 did the same job for much less...and with money tight the way it is these days, I need to cut corners where possible, and the Schick razor allows me to do that without sacrificing a fantastic shave in the process. Either way, if you have the money, buy what works for YOU and don&#x27;t let anybody tell you different.not justify the cost vs getting a shave JUST AS GOOD from my Hydro 5 for a great deal cheaper.

            <li> I don&#x27;t detect a noticeable difference between the Fusion Proglide version and the previous generation Fusion. The biggest change seems to be the larger \\&quot;lubrication strip\\&quot; and the blue LED on the handle.    The handle is still too light, too fat, and not balanced very well. The Schick handles still feel MUCH better and heftier.</li>
            <li> I buy this one pay 2$, so is a good deal, the quality is very well.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide is Gillette&#x27;s best razor since the Mach 3.    I thought the Fusion was a big step back for Gillette.  They increased the number of blades, but used cheaper and duller blades, so the end result was a lot of grabbing and pulling on my skin, something I never experienced with the Mach 3.  The construction was also cheap, I had a Fusion break apart on me after a year.  I&#x27;ve never had a Mach 3 break, over 10+ years of use.      The Fusion did add the single blade trimmer, which is great.  But the trimmer would get clogged with hairs, which is annoying.    The Fusion Proglide replaces the Fusion&#x27;s dull blades with sharp blades that don&#x27;t tug or pull on my skin, they just glide through and cut as they&#x27;re supposed to.  Plus, this keeps the trimmer while improving it&#x27;s design to allow hairs to wash away without clogging.</li>
            <li> Gillette has been advertising its battery powered fusion razors for a while now and I have to admit that the prospect of a \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; razor blade next to my face sounded more dangerous than appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I gave it a shot and I was happily surprised. The shave is the closest I have ever had and the quickest. The vibrations (really, they are tiny micro-vibrations) enable the razor to glide through my beard much quicker and with a much closer shave than I would normally have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best razor I have ever used in more than 25 years of shaving.</li>
            <li> Delivery – great&lt;br /&gt;Functionality – great&lt;br /&gt;I got what I wanted, and I got everything I needed.&lt;br /&gt;What more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my friends</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach 3 Power previously and the blades had to be replaced frequently.  The turning point for me was, when the battery eventually leaked and corroded the internals (handle grip).  Tried the cheap (U$70) Philips battery operated travel-shaver for 6 months.  Unfortunately, I still missed the close-shaves from the blade shavers.  Finally, I took the plunge again - this time the Fusion Proglide Power.    I have since been getting good results from it.  Maybe it is just psychology, but I feel that it had a closer shave compared to the Mac3 Power.  So far, after weeks of daily usage, I have not had a blade-change yet.  What I like was the flip over edge, to get a closer cut especially under the nose area, and below the lower lips.    On another note, it did not shave too well when I use it with the Fusion HydraGel Moisturizing Shaving Gel.  Perhaps the Gel is too thick and the blades are floating rather than getting closer to the skin.    Overall, it was a good investment for now.</li>
            <li> In my every day life with my work I use all sorts of different blades and have tryed many different kinds of blades and have noticed that no blade is good enough for me unless it is made in usa from chainsaws to stanley utility knife blades-carbide drill bits and saws.wouldn&#x27;t it be great if our face razors were made in usa and just costing alot instead of wasting time which is something we can&#x27;t replace and can cost more .this razor I must admit works amazing right at first but goes dull immediately so until they come out with an american blade for this i will buy these pieces of crap for the outrage of 1.00 or more per shave!</li>
            <li> I normally use a Panasonic Multi-flex electric razor, but mix it up every now and again when I feel like taking my time and looking a little better. The electric is very smooth, especially in the shower with some shaving gel, but this razor beats it hands down, and with no nicks or irritation. Expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but lasts long time. Rarely causes nicks, never ingrown.</li>
            <li> The proglide works great! I previously used the Gillette Fusion and the Shieck Titanium and the proglide out performs them by a big margin.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t give product reviews. Even on stuff I think is worth a review but I had to with this. For me it has changed the way I feel about shaving tenfold. The fusion was good but I still had issues with razor burn. The proglide changed all that. Usually I go about a day in between shaving. After buying the Proglide on Saturday and shaving that evening, I didn&#x27;t shave till Tuesday night &amp; that&#x27;s cause I wanted to. I could have went a couple more days but I like a smooth head so I shaved. I couldn&#x27;t believe how close a shave I got with this blade and went for days without any razor burn or irritation at all and that&#x27;s going with the grain. I always liked going against the grain cause it gave me a closer shave but even with the fusion and as good as it was, my head couldn&#x27;t take the pain afterwards so I stuck with going with the grain. With the Proglide I&#x27;m tempted to give it a try but maybe later down the road I&#x27;ll give it a shot because just going with the grain I get a damn close shave. I know it won&#x27;t be the case for some other people but for me, it truly is the best shave I have ever had and have been looking for for years. Highly, HIGHLY recommend buying this prduct.</li>
            <li> I just tried the new razor this morning.  The razor is definitely of higher quality than the old one.  The new precise trimmer cuts better, overall a smoother shave.  I have a very tough beard and cut through it like butter.  I used that new thermal scrub too (comes free with 4 pack blades).  Wow that stuff interesting...Warms your face right up.</li>
            <li> Since I am the wife reviewing this awesome razor, I will share both my husband&#x27;s viewpoints and my own! I was so glad to be offered something that my husband could use... but I had my doubts about the battery powered razor, and the price of the refill blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First from my standpoint:  my husband was using the Gillette Mach 3 before... a good razor!  Now that he switched over to this one, his face is REALLY much smoother. I mean a HUGE difference... not just a little bit! I certainly don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s definitely for my benefit (no more grizzly bear)! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my husband&#x27;s take: Even when he hasn&#x27;t shaved in a week, this razor blades gives a smooth cut the FIRST time through... no more going over the same area two or three times because he has been lax in his shaving! This thing REALLY works, and works fast, and gives the ultimate cut while it&#x27;s at it!!!  Really, really nice! He also loves the detailed cutter on the top of the blade to get precision cutting... comes in real handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we both recommend it hands down, and we will be tossing the old razors away for this one... and paying the extra for the refills on this one... it is most DEFINITELY worth it!</li>
            <li> First stroke drew blood. The vibrating is junk. Give it to your wife. The trimmer is the only part of it that is better than previous models. I&#x27;m going back to my  old razor.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but a great razor.</li>
            <li> I had a Manuel Fusion before, and try the power Razor this time.  It works perfect with the power vibration.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t repeat what some of the other reviewers have said about how well the new Power Proglide shaves, but suffice it to say, it&#x27;s the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced (and I have a very sensitive neck). It&#x27;s FAR more comfortable than the regular Fusion Power.  To the couple of reviewers that say they couldn&#x27;t tell the difference, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re either shaving wrong or do not have sensitive skin.  With the Fusion Power, I&#x27;d pretty much have to shave in the shower to avoid razor burn on my neck.  With the Power Proglide, I can shave without showering or even using hot water to prep my face before shaving -- no razor burn at all (or ingrown hairs), even shaving against the grain on my neck.    Here&#x27;s what a lot of the reviewers are missing. On the Fusion Power, I had to change blades every 7-10 days. Any more than that and I&#x27;d get torn up. I&#x27;m in my TENTH week of using the Power Proglide blades, and I&#x27;m on my THIRD BLADE!!! It&#x27;s JUST about time to change, but I could still probably handle another shave or two with no less comfort than I had with the regular Fusion Power blades. 3 BLADES in 67 days!!  And the other cool thing is that these blades work perfectly on the Fusion Power chassis, so no need to buy the new Power Proglide razor (unless you just want to upgrade for the looks).    So yes, individually, the blades ARE more expensive than any other blade. But the cost savings, even over just a year, will be SIGNIFICANT for me -- almost $60/year vs. the Fusion Power... AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHAVE EVER??? It&#x27;s a no brainer!!    Update:  Still LOVING this shaver almost a year later.  I did determine that what you&#x27;re using for shaving cream makes a BIG difference.  I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena for Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream for years, but decided to try an organic one from Kiss Your Face.  Lots of razor burn and discomfort with that cream, even with a brand new blade (tried it for two days).  So, back to the Neutrogena and couldn&#x27;t be happeier with the Fusion Power ProGlide.</li>
            <li> Hyped up shaver. The battery is over the top. This product wowrks well but is too glitzy. ALl we need is a good functional shaver. Too many blades and again a battery? Really...</li>
            <li> My razor came early in delivery &amp; in perfect condition.. packaging is excellent ... I opened it up and started using it ... so far so good but I heard that power razors stop working after while due to water penetration - while washing it up - to where the battery is placed ... if this happnes to my razor I will write another review ...</li>
            <li> If you have been using a shaver or throw away razors that you buy at the store every week or two, please stop. I know this is my first night using it, but i just want to let everyone know that i dont normally write reviews for stuff i buy on here and i do buy alot on amazon. First off, normally a disposable razor would usually take me around 8 min even in the shower. Id have to go over it 2 or 3 times for my face to feel smooth. One time is all you need with this and your face will feel like a babys bottom. No missed spots, and it didnt snag on my hair even a bit. I had about a quarter inch of hair on my face and it took it off with ease. and it only took about 5 min. If i would have went a little faster probably like 3-4 min. I was so amazed i was going slow and seeing how well this razor actually worked. Spend the $10 and buy this now it really is amazing and the best shave ive ever gotten.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m giving this one star b/c amazon still has not shipped me this razor 30 days after i \\&quot;bought\\&quot; it.  one star for getting the gillette fusion proglide power via amazon.  my beard hasn&#x27;t quit growing on me for the past 30 days, but amazon/gillette has.</li>
            <li> I suppose the Proglide could be of value for those with skin issues.  But for most guys, it simply doesn&#x27;t deliver the closeness the \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; 2-blade Sensor has been giving for 20 years.  The Proglide marketing campaign relies mostly on gimmicks, specifically:    1) They use the same slo-mo cartoon that was once used to show how the Sensor gives a closer shave because the first blade pulls out the hair it cuts, then the second blade shaves it even closer while the hair is stretched out a bit.  But in the current Proglide commercial, the cartoon is altered to show the second blade doing nothing except scraping the skin, with the hair ending up sticking out above the skin surface.  Major BS here by Gillette.    2) If you&#x27;re not comatose, you&#x27;ll notice on their \\&quot;Take the Proglide Challenge\\&quot; commercials (the one with the used-car salesman guy), they are actually comparing Proglide vs. a DISPOSABLE RAZOR!!!  What does that prove?  How low can Gillette go???    Disregarding the guerilla marketing, Proglide isn&#x27;t totally worthless.  They have innovated the smoothest shave ever, by giving up a little closeness.  Bottom line is, you&#x27;re paying 3 or 4 times more to get a smoother (for the first 2 shaves of each razor) but less close shave.  After 2 shaves, you&#x27;re paying 3 or 4 times for a shave that&#x27;s less close AND less smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made razor. The commercials had me a bit skeptical at first, but once I tried it, I LOVED IT! This is probably the best shave you&#x27;ll ever have if you&#x27;re used to using disposable blades. Only downside is that the replacement blades are a bit pricey and you need to replace them quicker then on a Mach 3 or 5. But other then that, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Here is the scoop after one week of use.      I use to make jokes about the 5 blade razors.  Then I bought a Gillette manual fusion and stopped laughing.  It was awesome with closer shaving and the blades lasted one month for me!      So I just purchased the Proglide Power Razor.  My \\&quot;qualified 5 star rating\\&quot; is given because the improvement of this razor over my first 5 blade manual Gillette is no where near the improvement seen in moving from the 3 blade to 5 blade system.  There is no night and day difference.  I would not be surprised if the razor by Gillette testing is an improvement.  But the difference I believe is too small to discern for an average user.  It may come down to whether you like the vibration.  I will say that I have not determined if the vibration helps prevent the buildup of hair between the blades which is feasible.  Nevertheless, I love this razor.  It is entirely optional whether you use the power capability or not.  And relative to my older manual 5 blade the handle on this Proglide is much more rounded and comfortable.  It is not heavy at all and in fact is likely very light yet solid if you remove the battery. So I would recommend giving it a try and figure out for yourself how you prefer to use it.  My one caveat at for this early review is that I have not been able to determine how long the blades last but do not expect that to be significantly different, and if I am not mistaken the older blades still fit as well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor for times when you need a good shave quickly.  The Gillette multiblade systems are very forgiving of rushed shaving, and truly do a pretty good job.  That said, I&#x27;d need to be able to shave in a tenth of a second to justify $3.50 or more per cartridge.  Seriously, Gillette?    For times when you have a little more time to shave, I&#x27;d recommend a good old-fashioned safety razor.  With a little more time for shaving, and a little attention to technique, you can get shaves with an old safety razor that are as good or better than anything you can do with a Gillette Fusion.    Besides having razor blades that cost a tenth as much as the Fusion cartridges, a classic styled Merkur safety razor is a solid, well-made tool.  Much more satisfying to use than anything made of plastic.  And a puck of good quality shaving soap might cost $10 or less, and it will last you an entire year.  To top it all off, safety razors are more environmentally sound than the plasticky Gillettes.  No pressurized metal cans of goo, and the double-edged blades are inexpensive to manufacture and to purchase.    More tips:  Proraso shave cream in the green metal tube is the best.              Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock sharp edge double edge blades (made in Russia) are great and inexpensive - $34 for      100 at the time of this review.              I&#x27;ve been using a Merkur model 180 for five years now, and love it.</li>
            <li> This is the worse razor I have ever used!  It shaves my face about as well as a pencil eraser would.  Takes forever, very uncomfortable.  I&#x27;m going back to the Gillette Fusion Power, I think it&#x27;s orange, that one used to work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors all my life. They are the best by far and the Fusion continues that tradition. From Mach 5 to Fusion, GIllette always improves!!</li>
            <li> Been using the Mach razors for years.  I already had a Gillette Fusion so I knew this was a great inexpensive razor.  When this on amazon and for a great price I picked up a new Razor.  I have also been a fan of the power option of the Razor which vibrates on the Razor.  I have also found that it helps create a nice smooth shave when combined with some  nice products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying things off of Amazon for a long time now, and this is my first ever review because this thing is simply the best razor out there. I shaved my head with this in the shower, and it was so smooth, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working or not. Sure enough when I got out, I did not miss a spot. Trust me, if you&#x27;re having doubts about buying this product, don&#x27;t. This is legit, and the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best manual razor that I have ever purchased. I have had the razor for about two weeks now, and shave around five days a week. The blades are still sharp and works as well as it did on day one. The replacement blade cartridges can be a little pricey, but they are well worth it. First of all, the pricing of the product is around $10.00, on Amazon and in stores. Secondly, this razor performs amazingly well, and gives a close, smooth, comfortable, and non-irritating shave. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for an amazing shave at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the BEST razor that I have used, ever! I was using an Electric Shaver and stopped using it after I tried the Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Power Razor. I actually got a closer shave with the Proglide Power Razor than I did using the Electric Shaver. This is an outstanding product and I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Ended up buying the 3-1 gillette and that is awesome too. I used have a 5 blade and that was good but when i tried this i have never gone back</li>
            <li> My husband tried this razor, and at the end of the week we compared it to his old two-blade razor. His facial hair has always been somewhat on the thick side, so he goes through razor blades like crazy. The Gillette Fusion Proglide did OK, but the results definitely weren&#x27;t as smooth as his usual razor. He went through the razor blades even quicker with this type of razor too. So it&#x27;s back to his old two-blade.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked this razor.  The blades were much sharper than the regular Fusion blades and gave him a very smooth shave without cutting himself at all.  In fact he said it seems like it would be next to impossible to cut yourself.  We couldn&#x27;t quite figure out why you&#x27;d want a battery operated razor, but he said he was surprised to find that it really made a difference.  I really can&#x27;t see any movement of the razor when I look at it turned on, but he said he liked it a lot.  The razor itself has nice rubberized grips which help make sure it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands. My husband already uses the regular Fusion blades and tested them out and they fit on the Proglide razor just fine.  He&#x27;ll probably go back and forth between the two different blades depending on what we have coupons for.</li>
            <li> I have used the Fusion Power since it came to market.  I liked the old version, but the lubricating strip wore away after only 4 shaves and I experienced discomfort frequently while shaving.  I was a bit skeptical when this new Fusion ProGlide came out.  I mean, how much better could it be?  From the first stroke of the blade, I could feel the difference.  NO PAIN!  It was smooth, comfortable, and left a swath of stubble-free skin that didn&#x27;t need an additional shaving.  I finished shaving and was VERY pleased, so much so that I look forward to my next shave which never happened with the old model.  Thanks for the improvements!</li>
            <li> To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.    I&#x27;ll begin by saying that I&#x27;ve been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.    ProGlide vs. Hydro 5  Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.    What&#x27;s included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.    Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette&#x27;s as a travel holder with no problem.    Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.    The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro&#x27;s trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.    Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as \\&quot;suspension\\&quot; for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.    On initial \\&quot;hefting\\&quot; the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.    The Shave Test  All of the above are secondary to the \\&quot;Yes, But How Does It Shave\\&quot; test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream]] and a badger bristle brush.    Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth)  The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.    The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.    Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.    The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face \\&quot;dried\\&quot; she still said the Gillette side was smoother.    Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth)  The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.    ProGlide vs Quattro  Shave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).    The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.    In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.    As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.    So what&#x27;s not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.    While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn&#x27;t shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.    Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I just got a sample of this razor from Gillette and I have to say its not much more different than the older Fusion. While it seems to be bit more smoother than older Fusion when I shave with the grain, I don&#x27;t see any difference when I shave against the grain. It seems to struggle just as the older fusion against the grain. 3 STARS because the hype that Gillette put behind this product is not justified.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and the electric function is a bit odd at first but you get used to pretty quickly.  Im not sure if it actually helps or not though and I wonder about the safety of using this razor in the shower.  Otherwise this is a really good razor when you consider the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I was very skeptical about the Proglide, as opposed to my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; fusion. I was quite surprised that after two weeks using the Proglide that I have to say it does indeed provide a better shave than the previously mentioned model. I&#x27;m not sure it it&#x27;s the thinner blades that seem to offer much less resistance both against the grain as well as with it, or one of the other features. The power version also has a feature that claims to guide the hairs in straighter for a more close, even cut. While I&#x27;m not sure if this is a gimmick or not, the proof seems to be in the proverbial pudding. For me, the shaves have been much better with less irritaion, and so far the blades seem to last longer than the old version. On the older version I could only get three good shaves at the most before feeling it was time to replace them. With the proglide I only have had to change the blades once in two weeks, and the performance has always been fantastic. Of course, these statements are just my \\&quot;two cents\\&quot; worth, as shaving is very subjective and there are so many factors that go in to a great shave. But for my purposes, this new Proglide seems to fit the bill very nicely.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item when it was originally introduced and enjoyed it at first. Then the lower handle covers fell off. I thought \\&quot;no big deal since I can still hold the razor\\&quot; and, \\&quot;if necessary I can reglue them\\&quot;. Now the power function does not work. I have tried fresh batteries to no avail. Is 5 months the life expectancy for this razor?</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Gillette from Sensor XL to Mach 3 . I like this product too.. But I really don&#x27;t get the power thing. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in shaving by turning that on . So if you are thinking of buying the one without the power , you wont miss a lot.</li>
            <li> I have a friend that really likes his Proglide so I thought I would give it a try.  If you have to shave at least once a day, I would not recommend this razor.  I have a pretty heavy beard (a little boy once told me I have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 11:00 a.m.) and it just doesn&#x27;t do the job around the chin and upper lip.  It&#x27;s fine on the sides and neck but just doesn&#x27;t seem to get very close and is also irritating.  I have absolutely no idea how the vibration is supposed to help - it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me.  I ended up having to use my old trusty Gillette Sensor 2-blade to finish the job.  It&#x27;s just not worth it and I am going to take advantage of Gillette&#x27;s money back guarantee on this razor.</li>
            <li> I will admit that when I decided to buy this razor, I did so with much skepticism, having been disappointed by the shave of the Gillette Fusion Power Razor.     I finally decided to pull the trigger on the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, and  by the time it was delivered, I already had a 3 day growth of facial stubble. I lathered up and was amazed as the razor glided effortlessly over my face and through the stubble, giving the smoothest, most comfortable shave that I have had. Not a bit of drag or irritation was experienced, so I let my beard grow for a week, thinking that this time it would fail the standard it now set. To my amazement, the shave was still superb with no irritation. I finally tested it by shaving daily with the same results.     Concerning the lubricating strip, it is a definite improvement, being more slick and lasting longer while the handle allows a more secure and comfortable grip than its predecessor. I&#x27;m still on my first blade after 4 weeks and the shave is still very comfortable. The single blade at the back of the blade head does a great job especially above the top and lower lip, and the soft blue glow of the power button does add a cool touch. Shaving was done with the power feature on and off, but either way the shave is excellent.    Overall, Gillette definitely has a winner here with the Proglide Power Razor. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, so give it a try and I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Take this with a grain of salt, because I&#x27;ve been using the cheap $5 for 8 razor packs up to now. But man, what a difference. This thing completely smooths my face out. Whereas I used to get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 11AM, now it actually doesn&#x27;t appear... Until 5 o&#x27;clock! I got some razor burn going against the grain with it, but I have a pretty sensitive face to begin with, so I don&#x27;t hold that against the razor. I&#x27;ve yet to find one that won&#x27;t do that when I shave against the hair direction.</li>
            <li> I got this for a song and with 5 blades it works great! I&#x27;m loving the close clean shave it gives~</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase.  I very nice razor, it provides a comfortable and smooth shave.  Blades last about five weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used many manuel razors before, and even own a Philips Norelco electric shaver; however, I find that none of these compare to the Gillette Proglide Fusion. Although quite pricey, the 5 or so blades on this razor make shaving a quick and easy job. I especially love the fact that even after several days of not shaving, I can remove the hair one of my cheeks with just one careful swipe. In sum, I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to shorten their normal shaving time.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  I am a woman and never can understand why they market the great razors to men.  We have much more of our bodies to shave than they do.  Anyway, this razor is really nice with a flashy colorful handle and nice grip.  The packaging was a bit much.  It did very well around the ankles, knees, behind the knees and under the arms it was nice and gentle.  I only had to do one pass over the bikini area which really cuts down on the rash, I appreciate that.  It was a nice clean, smooth shave.  Now they just have to make it in shades of baby blue and pink and market it to us gals.    The razor did come with one battery and I installed it and did use the vibration while I shaved but I&#x27;m not sure what it was for or if it made it better in any way.  I&#x27;d use this razor without it but it is a nice gimmick and I was excited to see what it felt like but I actually forgot it was on while I was shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall I felt the shaving performance and results were just as good as the regular Fusion.  However, I really like the nice new handle design as well as being able to easier clean the hair trimmer.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for this one compared to the regular Fusion, it&#x27;s not worth it to me.  Really a good razor with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I tried this razor and it is terrible.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  I need to shave everyday because I am in the Army and I have always used Gillette Fusion.  The ProGlide often doesn&#x27;t get a close enough shave and is easier to miss spots.  I&#x27;ve been using the razors for 2 weeks and I have cut myself three times.  I never had the same problems with the older version of Gillette&#x27;s Fusion.  I threw these blades away because they are so bad, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have been a long time Fusion owner, I would say about 4 years now.  I have purchased the refills faithfully and only used something different (Quattro) when I was traveling because I have a travel case for the other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my face and head.  I use Gillette shave gel just as I have for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the Proglide:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never understood the point of a power razor that was not an electric razor.  Now that I have used a power razor, I still don&#x27;t get it.  I have a hard time telling where the razor is on my head with the vibration activated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade has not lasted nearly as long as the original fusion blades.  I do not know what has changed, but after just two weeks of shaving, I look like a cat has gotten ahold of my head with his claws extended.  The original blades would last at least a month, but not so with this new blade.  I also do not get nearly the quality shave that I get with the original blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would save my money on this razor and go for the original fusion or even the quattro.  I got it for free in their promotion and my head wishes I had missed the link on Twitter.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been looking for a better shave lately and decided over the last four months to switch over to wet shaving with a double edge razor.  The wet shaving methods and products are far superior to other shaving mechanisms, but the time it took to safely use a double edge razor took up 25 minutes of my morning for a three pass shave avoiding major nicks along the way.  Using the Proglide I can confidently shave at a pace that is about 4 times faster without nick concerns.  The floating blades so effectively follow the contours of my skin that I get as close as shave as I ever have before.  The benefit of the power micro-vibrating effect is the blade cuts while it &#x27;floats&#x27; over the skin.  It is a great combination to safely cut against the grain in places where I dared not take my double edge razor.  Total time for a wet shave with three passes was about 10 minutes and this was the first time I&#x27;ve used it.  I would expect it to be about 5-7 minutes next time.    In defense of double edges, they still remain the best performance/price ratio of any disposable razor.</li>
            <li> This product is really good to use, it is sharp and smooth, without burn and irritation. Just a little bit expensive</li>
            <li> I just bought this tonight at Costco (I had a credit) and shaved a 4 day old beard this evening in nothing flat.  This thing is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> I was put off by the five blades, thinking what&#x27;s next six or ten or whatever. The gaudy styling...this is no Apple product! The battery...uh, what? Just generally another marketing scheme I thought...   But, I needed a razor and the introductory price for the razor and blade is cheap and so I one-clicked it.   Only had a day&#x27;s growth that night, but noticed that this was astonishingly smooth, non-grabby and I didn&#x27;t have to go over areas twice. Even glided smoothy and efficiently over the adams apple area. Battery on one side, unpowered on the other. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  Not a hard test, not enough for a review either, so I didn&#x27;t shave for 4 or 5 days and tried it again. Non-powered on the right side, it was a dramatic improvement over previous multi-bladed shavers. Really a smooth, easy and totally comfortable experience using whatever gel cream was on sale.  I turned on the motor for the left side and it was even better. Just a hair easier. It does help with a thick growth, not a noticeable difference to me with an overnight&#x27;s worth. Of course, this will be different for everyone.   Is the motor worth it? Sure, for a few bucks you get an electric razor that is really fantastic.  I am pretty sure that the very thin and flexible blades, along with whatever technology they use to sharpen the things, is the key here. Would two or three blades work just as well? Not likely the cost would be much less, so what the heck, the more blades the better. Play with those blades. They really are very different than anything I have seen before.  I really don&#x27;t think I can get a better shave. A straight or safety razor would be as good, but really not better simply because this shaver did it perfectly. I do like the lore and beauty of a handmade straight razor and was thinking of one, but I shave in the shower, strictly by feel, and don&#x27;t take much time doing it. The straight razor ritual just takes too much time for me, but I totally understand whey some people would love it. It would also be better for those with elaborate and finely detailed facial hair designs I would think.   The little trimmer blade works well.   This is a highly recommended product, one that actually may make some difference in your life if shaving has been difficult for you. It is new and better technology.</li>
            <li> works about as well as my old gillette razor.  Power seems like it should do something but not sure what.  stick with the tried and true and you won&#x27;t pay for $3 cartridges</li>
            <li> Been looking for a really good razor that doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;tag &amp; pull\\&quot; sensation and this razor really does the job. Its handle is comfortable, easy to clean, and IT VIBRATES! COOL! I recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> (This is Lisa&#x27;s son speaking.)    Shaving has been a frustrating and embarrassing experience for me for years.  There has always been some kind of trade-off between closeness, irritation, tendency to produce ingrown hairs, price, and speed of use.  I never understood how my friends and family members were able to achieve a close and fast shave on a regular basis, while I would shave twice as slowly and get a shave half as good as theirs. I&#x27;ve tried manual razors, electric foil razors, and electric rotary razors.  I had settled on manual razors (only shaving with the grain) because it produced the least irritation and didn&#x27;t leave patches of uncut hairs like all the electric ones I&#x27;ve tried.  Unfortunately, due to my pattern of beard growth, manual razors tended to leave me with ingrown hairs all along my jawline, despite my best efforts to prevent them.  I had figured that I had to settle for dealing with them until now.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best of the manual and electric shaving worlds.  It provides a much closer, faster, consistent, and comfortable shave with no ingrown hairs whatsoever.  Superior in all ways.  You have no idea how relieved I am to have found this razor.</li>
            <li> Engineered to last less, engineered to make your facial hair grow back quicker, and engineered to cost more and make more money for Gilette, is really what the marketing campaign should be like. These razors don&#x27;t last very long, and this is coming from someone who can&#x27;t grow a full beard. The \\&quot;strip\\&quot; on them goes bad in about 2 weeks, and I don&#x27;t seem to get as close a shave as I did with the original Fusion razor, I find myself going over the same areas 2-3x just to get everything. Not sure what all the hype is about but I hate these razors and they have me looking for a new brand.     About me: can&#x27;t grow a full beard, not very thick facial hair, used to shave once every 3-4 days, these razors have me shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> Well the first shave is extremely awesome.. then the quality  of shave drops from there.. today I had a third shave it did a poor job.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Gillette Mach 3 line, but still have sensitive areas under the jawline, so I decided to try the alleged top dog in blades.  Must admit I&#x27;m impressed.  Maybe it&#x27;s just that the blades grab my beard so thoroughly that it slows me down, allowing the vibrating motor to do its work.  But I like it, a very smooth and comfortable shave, and also very close though that&#x27;s not why I switched.  It is relatively expensive, but not exactly going to bankrupt me.</li>
            <li> The new blade arrangement and battery power make a great combination.  First, the closeness and ease of the shave are noticeably improved over the Mach 3.  Second, if you use slower strokes, allowing the battery powered motion to do the cutting, the blade life is substantially increased.  With what I consider a medium heavy beard, I&#x27;m well into a third week on the same blades with no noticeable decrease in performance.</li>
            <li> Like most, I think razor companies have gone overboard adding blades, lubricated strips, hydro technology, and now power. How much better can these possibly be than a normal razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to exclusively use electric razors, but after mine burnt up after erroneously trying to charge it in Europe (220v), I switched exclusively to razor blades.  Overall I found the Gillette Fusion blades to hold their edge the longest.  By having the multiple blades it allows them to make the blades thinner and sharper than their \\&quot;lesser blade counterparts\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the power version of this razor in a free trial offer and decided to give it a shot comparing it to the regular fusion proglide I use daily.  I really didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d make any difference at all, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and I definitely noticed a decrease in razor burn and bumps after using the power version for a week.  I prefer the feel of the normal versions handle though, the power version is made of plastic and doesn&#x27;t feel as premium.  I was also a bit disappointed with battery life, after about 15 shaves I feel like the battery is already getting low.  Combined with the extra cost for the power blades and AAA batteries, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll make the switch permanent.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely sensitive skin and the thought of shaving gives me nightmares. I was using Gillette M3 power but I switched to fusion proglide power after reading the reviews. This is the best 10$ I ever spent. I also got the matching blades. They are really good. Overall, worth it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I had been using the \\&quot;Gillette Mach 3\\&quot; for the past couple of years and it was good. But this product gives such a smooth and clean shave that it makes the Mach 3 look like an extinct old generation product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had gillete manual fusion and pro-glide razors, I think this product is far better, and will recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> As is the case with several other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Mach 3 for years.  I&#x27;ve resisted the temptation to purchase Gillette&#x27;s \\&quot;shaver of the moment\\&quot; because I was satisfied with what I had.  The other day I went to a big-box store (sorry, Amazon)to buy more blades and saw this product.  I bought it, and just tried it for the first time.  IT IS AMAZING!  I had a 2-3 day stubble- always problematic, especially above the chin and the upper lip- and it cut through that like butter.  Contrary to what a few of the other reviewers said, I feel that the vibration materially improves the feel of the shave- I turned it off and felt quite a difference.  Sure, the blades are a little more expensive, but what&#x27;s it worth to make a chore that men do daily (well, at least most men do most days) this much more pleasant?  Priceless!</li>
            <li> This razor is very soft on the beard and very smooth. I am going to use this razor and buy this razor always. Thank you.</li>
            <li> First of all, yes - this is on the expensive end for a razor. But if what happens to me happens to you, then it is worth every dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have razor bumps on my neck.  I had seen a dermatologist many years ago to ask him why my neck always seems to break out in red bumps.  He pulled a couple of my whiskers to show me the exact reason.  When my whisker grows, it immediately starts to curl inward after it breaks the skin. It then grows back into the skin which causes the red irritation mark. He said this is actually quite common and sometimes called razor bumps, but it is really ingrown whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I go more than 48 hours without shaving - 2 things happen.  I start to see red bumps all over my neck and worse - more than 1 of them will bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my latest bout with this issue I decided to give this baby a try. Wow, closest shave I have ever had and more importantly - no bleeding.  Since it cuts the whisker so clean, I can also go more than 2 days without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that in my testing, I actually ordered this Power version, and the non-power version.  I noticed no difference in performance.  They both do an amazing job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer to Gillette Razors for as long as I have been shaving, pretty much beginning with the Mach 3 and continuing on as new products were released over the past couple of years. I can say with confidence that this razor delivers the best shave out of any other razor I have ever used. Unlike some of the previous generations of Gillette disposables, this razor does not \\&quot;drag\\&quot; and pull hairs that may be a little longer. It glides across my face effortlessly free of nicks and irritation. Couple this with a good shaving cream (Try Alba Shave Foam or Aveeno Sensitive Skin brands) and this is heaven for your face.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every other day so it&#x27;s important I have a good razor. This is easily one, if not the best razor I have used for shaving my head/face. It provides a very close, smooth, irritation-free shave every time, and as long as you dry the blades regularly they shouldn&#x27;t dull too easily.  the only con I have for this razor is the cartridges are insanely expensive so I tend to go with a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how smooth my face feels after a shave.  And the blades last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love the power and the blades with the extra blade compared to other razors.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Due to a significant recent career change, I&#x27;ve since had impetus to reevaluate my shaving method, for purposes of professional and personal travel both domestically and internationally. I started shaving with electric shavers way back when, and never used a razor of any sort for shaving, both for comfort and due to suffering lifelong high myopia that made me nervous to try a blade. I&#x27;ve recently made the switch to shaving my head using a HeadBlade[[ASIN:B000NFEX46 Headblade Sport Ultimate Head Shave, 1 razor]] and love the design for my scalp, and tried the FaceBlade[[ASIN:B003LY2E3I HeadBlade FaceBlade Travel Razor]]. I was not impressed by the FaceBlade (it pulled under the chin and along my problem area of my neck, badly), and I went back to my Norelco. I got the Gillette Fusion Power to try, not knowing what to expect, but wanting a better option for travel than my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Gillette Fusion today for the first time, I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough for anyone wanting to switch from a shaver to a razor. I am a convert. The five-blade head makes having to go over the same area several times a thing of the past. But, the power makes all the difference. I have a \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; face; my facial hair naturally grows both thick and in multiple directions and tends to grow thick along my neck, yet my skin is sensitive, making a rotary shaver a good option. But, the power option allows the Gillette to just glide through even my stubs, and the oscillation lets me let the razor do the work of chopping down the thicker hairs that caused clogging and pulling of the FaceBlade. I got a bit of razor burn, but not bad. I&#x27;ve never had a closer, easier, more efficient shave, even from my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to whether there&#x27;s a good enough reason to switch from another razor, but if you&#x27;re like me and looking to go \\&quot;old school\\&quot;, I think this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...blades got so expensive that shaving once every two-three days will cost you an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> Back some time ago I wrote \\&quot;I had to order this since the button to turn this unit on fell out within a year of use. I am happy with the blades. Overall quality is not built to last for a few years.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised that P&amp;G Rep actually ready my comments here and wanted to know more. I called them per their note and I was impressed that they wanted to pass on my experience to their staff. With a company that is standing behind its product I would like to think that the unit I had might have been defective but the company is committed to quality and excellence. My replacement unit I purchased seems to be good. I therefore have updated my rating. If the razor holds up fine for more than a year I may come back and up the rating again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless I would rate proactive customer response as A+ ( 5 stars). Even if they have extremely small number of defects their attention to detail (like responding to my comments) is a big deal to me and I know such an organization would only produce high quality products</li>
            <li> I tried this razor on a lark.  I had been using the Gillette disposables for years.  I usually bought them at BJ&#x27;s or Costco.  One day I was in Walmart and decided to try their brand (they were cheaper).  Well, after only using the Gillette disposables for all those years, the Walmart blades were pretty bad(cuts, rough, etc.).  Right then I decided to upgrade to a new razor.  After all, it was about time.  As luck would have it, I caught a commercial announcing the new ProGlide was coming on June 6th.  I decided to wait the couple of weeks so I would have the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot;. Boy, am I glad I did!    I wound up picking up the preview kit over Memorial Day weekend.  To say it is a smooth shave is an understatement.  It really does glide over your face.  I loved it so much, I picked up kits for my sons.     I was concerned with the cost of the blades, but I&#x27;ve now shaved 8 times on a single blade and my shave this morning was as close and smooth as day one.  My wife now calls me \\&quot;Baby Face\\&quot; because of how smooth my face feels after shaving. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial and automatically thought the fusion was great this one must be better, but i was wrong. this razor was one of the most painful shaves i have had. the original fusion in my opinion glided better. this one actually increased the tug i had to provide in order to get a clean shave. My brother tried it and had the same problem in his words the razor sucks. I would really like to try the razor that they use in the commercial that glides over cause that&#x27;s surely what i didn&#x27;t get from this one. other than a cool appearance the razor is just a down grade from the original fusion.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I never felt like the Fusion was a huge step up from the old Mach 3 Power. This razor, however, is truly a giant step forward - I feel like Gillette is in the unfortunate position of having to market this as a slight improvement on a stock Fusion rather than a new line altogether, despite the fact that it is really leaps and bounds ahead of the older model.     The razor glides over my face with no catching, no scraping feeling, and no irritation, all while delivering an incredibly close shave. I truly don&#x27;t see how Gillette will be able to improve on this.    (I promise I&#x27;m not a paid employee of Gillette, I just think this product is really outstanding).</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette since I was 16, in fact including my grandfather&#x27;s monogrammed brass Gillette razor I come from a family of Gillette users and I have used virtually every kind of Gillette razor in the last 15 years however the day I ordered Proglide I saw a great deal on the Schick Hydro 5 and just thought I will try that for a change and what a change it was!! The Hydro gave me my smoothest shave ever.... at twice as expensive the Gillette proglide does not exactly glide...so although its a good close shave with the Proglide it is nowhere as comfortable as the Hydro 5 and hence the 2 stars.   If you have been a Gillette man like me give the Hydro 5 a chance its cheaper than Gillette and wont hurt, it could give you great shaves and save a lot of money over time. As for my existing fusion blades and the new proglide blades well I simply dont feel like using them and have given the to my gf for her legs etc</li>
            <li> Hi folks,  After more than a decade of electric razor use I decided to try a razor blade. I started out on the Gillette Mach 3, which went ok, and then saw a demo of the vibrating Fusion Proglide at a store. After trying it for the first time I was very impressed; having just tried the Mach 3, I can state for certain that the vibrating motion in the power Fusion Proglide helps avoid snagging and makes for a much smoother shave experience overall. The blades are pricey, but I doubt I&#x27;ll mind too much given the results. Wow!</li>
            <li> As a Military member we have to shave everyday. Which razor you use is really worth the money. I have used Schick Quattro the standard non battery one and its ok but for my head I use the Gillette Fusion power. I Recently both this razor and was amazed!! My face is a maze to shave it as if i do not do it right i end up cutting myself and have a crappy shave job. With this new razor not only does it work for my face but also for my head which i shave almost daily. I also shave against the grain all the time to get the best shave possible. With this new razor i love shaving and get the best shave!!! Thank you Gillette. This product is worth the money for me but if you don&#x27;t need the best shave or don&#x27;t care enough about your face you can get another razor. I for one am tired of going to work with blood on my face from shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of the Gillette Manual Fusion Razor then I bought a ProGlide Power Razor about 2 weeks before it was actually released and all I can say is WOW...this razor is by far the best razor out there today, no doubt about it...This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face, nick or cut you in any way...it provides the closest shave you can possibly get without going into an \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; barber and getting a straight razor shave..Yes, the blades are expensive but you really do \\&quot;Get What You Pay For\\&quot; so if you want cheap blades then expect a lousy shave with cuts and knicks..if you want an extremely close and comfortable shave with minimal effort then this is the razor for you...I recommend getting the Power Razor as it really does make a difference while shaving and it does provide a closer shave than a manual razor..Also, get rid of that crap-in-a-can gel or foam and get yourself some natural cream that you lather with a badger brush (Truefitt &amp; Hill, Proraso, etc) and you will really see this ProGlide Power come to life..A+++ razor that I will continue to use no matter the cost of the blades...Face it, us dudes have to shave daily (or almost daily) so why go cheap and tear up your face if you do not have to..</li>
            <li> This razor does the job but is not my favorite.  I don&#x27; t understand the need for a battery.  Back to my original Gilllette Sensor.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Smooth and easy on the face.  Great deal from Amazon so that helps with justifying the price.  The power and non power are both great but the vibration from the power is like a massage for your face</li>
            <li> This razor works really well and I would recommend it to anyone. I give this product a two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that Gillette was able to create another \\&quot;best shave ever\\&quot;.  More blades, more power, and whatever else their powerful marketing machine is able to drum up.  However, coming from the standard Fusion line, I can&#x27;t believe the difference this razor makes.  Maybe it&#x27;s the vibration, maybe it IS the thinner blades, but whatever it is, it works.      My beard is very coarse and grows like a caveman.  I can be completely smooth in the morning and by 7:00 at night, my face feels like sandpaper.  Other blades, even my beloved Fusion, would pull on my face when I shaved.  The ProGlide is like butter.  Easily lumberjacking the thousands of mini pine trees that decorate my face.  This is my first experience with a \\&quot;powered\\&quot; razor.  I&#x27;ve never owned one as I thought they were gimmicky, but it seriously helps make shaving more comfortable.  Perhaps this is the reason the ProGlide feels to smooth.  Whatever the case, shaving has never felt better, nor lasted longer than it has with this razor.  My face stays smooth ALL DAY.  I do have to shave the next morning, but if I wanted to, I could go into work (like I did today) with a minor sandpaper face.  However there is a cost for all of this handsomeness and it&#x27;s the cost of those blades.  $3.30/each from Costco.  That&#x27;s outrageous, but my wife does love a smooth face and I can&#x27;t deny her that.</li>
            <li> I was excited the first time I used this razor because it shaves so close.&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the day my throat and neck area was extremely irritated and I had hundreds of ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the extremely close shave!&lt;br /&gt;I was so embarrassed when I went to my girlfriend&#x27;s house that night.&lt;br /&gt;I like my face to be clean and smooth but this is just too close of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Also I must note that the blade gets worn down very easily and gets clogged with shaving cream/hair.</li>
            <li> Works great. Not much else to say.  Cheapie razors cut my skin up sometimes whereas this doesn&#x27;t. It works great, nothing negative to say.    As far as this \\&quot;power\\&quot; part... I&#x27;m not really sure what it does. For those that are wondering, think of a cell phone vibrating constantly and that&#x27;s all it seems to be. Kindof like a hybrid electric/manual razor I guess? I don&#x27;t quite know what good it does, myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette since my first razor--which, incidentally, was my first razor--and they have treated me well over the years.  Despite their abundantly mass-produced stock, they have been well-built (some more than others) and have stood the test of time.  These new fangle-dangled battery-operated ones, however, are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They vibrate to shake the hairs from their rested position, and, as I&#x27;m the only one who can grow a full beard in my family, getting the closest shave is very important.  But more than any technology can provide, you must know your face more than the razor knows it.  While Gillette&#x27;s multi-blade cartridges to a great job for my face, I sometimes find myself turning the vibration off because it interrupts my study of my face.  Where I know some bumps on my cheeks and chin should be, the vibration may confuse me and cause me to improperly shave and leave some spots thicker than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades themselves are super sharp, but very expensive and a pain in the butt to clean.  My sink cannot handle wads of hair (nor should any other household bathroom sink), but water is the only way to wash these suckers of the hair stubble, but it also washes away some of the lotion attached (depends which cartridges you get).  In the long run, these razors will be very costly, so I&#x27;m considering doing the ol&#x27;-fashioned wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, however, I will still keep this Fusion on hand for the comfort a Gillette shave provides, and will turn the vibration on to keep my skin massaged, and off when I end up missing some spots on my face.</li>
            <li> The first few shaves are fine but the blade does not last and soon you can feel it dragging across your face. My old 2 blade Sensor does as good as the power glide so after I finish this expensive razors i purchased I am going back to my old stand by !!!</li>
            <li> This is my first vibrating razor and I am thoroughly impressed! I expected it to be about the same as a normal Gillette razor, but it really glides over your face 10x easier than any of their other razors.</li>
            <li> This thing mows down my very tough beard in minutes without tearing up my face. The ProGlide blades are so good that even after 15 shaves, the blade is still better than new Mach III or TRAC II, I&#x27;ve tested. The trimmer opposite the blade is quite overrated and I have no use for the vibration feature, but maybe certain genders do, who knows? That was a joke, Editor, you can leave it in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great razor if you can handle buying the blades.</li>
            <li> Both my wife I have been a &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; time Atra Plus razor users and we were very pleased with the results.  Recently my wife tried a Schick Quattro razor, fell in love with it, and suggested that I try a multi-blade razor.  After a couple of weeks of hearing how great her new razor worked, I gave in and purchased the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual.  I must say that from the first shave that I am hooked.  I have a rather heavy beard and shave every day, and would get 7 days out of each Atra Plus blade before having to change blades due to a dulling.  Well, I am now on my 14th day of my first Gillette Fusion Proglide blade and it&#x27;s still going strong (NO cuts or razor burn).  Though the blades are expensive, the comfort of the shave and the durability of the blade make this a well worth the money.  (By the way Wal-Mart sells this razor with one blade included for $5.00.)</li>
            <li> Of course every person is different, but I hated shaving. I would get cuts, razor burn, or a not so close shave. I decided to splurge on this product and haven&#x27;t looked back. It is amazing. It is a little more than most other razors, but for me it is work it. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, and the shave is amazing. I pair it with the Nivea for Men Q10 having cream that I get here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the fusion razor and was excited to see an update, unfortunately, I think these blades are inferior in every way to the regular fusion blades and are a blatant attempt to get users to buy more razors. The shave is the same or inferior to the current fusion shave, and the blades wear out extremely quickly (less than 1 week of shaves) leading to nicks and razor burn. Stay away.</li>
            <li> Based upon reviews I read here, I purchased a Gillette Fusion Power Proglide. I have had it just a week, but my usage has been outstanding. After using the razor all week, my latest shave was just as comfortable as the first time I used it.  Although I do not have a tough beard, I do have sensitive facial skin. Several times during the first shave the only way I could tell that I was shaving was to look in the mirror and see the shaving cream gone from the area I had just shaved. Those times were so effortless and smooth, I just could not believe it was shaving!  I have a goatee and a mustache and I&#x27;m even awe struck by the rear trimmer.  All in all, I just could not be happier with my decision to purchase and thank all for their reviews.</li>
            <li> I love the closeness of this shaver!! If you don&#x27;t get this your wasting your money!! Kelly K VP of Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz [...]</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good!</li>
            <li> good, thanks, i will bus new one in future, hope it more cheaper than this time. it will be very happy for us</li>
            <li> These were the right price for a razor. I combo&#x27;s this with a pack of replacement razors and I make sure to pop a new one in once a month. Every shave has been smooth and I don&#x27;t have to worry about hairs getting yanked out and razor burn. The little edge razor works great for squaring off the sideburns and beard.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful razor, works great...but it did not come with even ONE replacement blade...What is going on with the replacement blade rip off of late?  I prized the blades for this razor at Walgreens and they&#x27;re $16 for 5 BLADE...more that a dollar a piece.  You&#x27;re almost better off buying a new razor each time the way the technology changes!!</li>
            <li> i cannot for the life of me get a close enough shave but this is as close as it gets without learning how to use a straight razor. only one complain is i deleted my old addresses before ordering this yet amazon still sent it to my last one which was confusing, though they fixed it outright. refunded my money and i reordered it. no harm no foul.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years young and for the last 20 or so have been an electric shave user. With an occasional wet shave with a disposable razor, Now that I DO NOT have to shave every day to please anyone I found the electric shaver just was taking to long and not producing a satisfactory shave and the disposable ones were not much better and were irritating. Did some research and decided on the Proglide Power razor along with some extra blades. I have just treated myself to one of the most smoothest and closest shaves I have EVER experienced. Had this been available when I was blade shaving 20 odd years ago I do not believe I would have made the switch to Electric.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. He said it gives a much closer shave than regular razor. Would recommend for picky husbands.</li>
            <li> Great razor that only needs one pass to get you a close shave.  The power feature helps on awkward places like above your lip where the razor may normally irritate your skin.  No irritation with the vibrating razor because it keeps the razor from biting into your skin.</li>
            <li> The shave is all about the blade and the lather.  This battery operated &#x27;thing&#x27; is a waste.  Let us discuss the supposedly upgraded blade.  You definitely pay for the upgrade - it is twice as much as the regular Mach 3 blade.  And although you get more blades, they are very thin and are literally less stable.  The buildup between the finer blades happens quicker too so I think in the long run you end up going through the Fusion ProGlide blades much quicker.  And last, you can get cuts much easier.  I stopped using the power feature altogether and this system is going to end up in the non-recyclable trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mach 3 blades are fewer in number, but bulkier and seem to provide a cleaner more comfortable shave.  And the blades last twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best shave will come from a double edged safety razor - and these blades can be recycled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, the Fusion ProGlide powered or not - can glide right off the shelves into shaving history as far as I am concerned.  I think the Gillette marketers make you think you are getting more because you paid more - but you are actually getting less. Proctor &amp; Gamble stockholders and doing pretty well right now - maybe you should buy their stocks instead of the blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you choose to be concerned about your environmental footprint - you are not helping the environment with this purchase either.</li>
            <li> Perfect razor, I guess there is nothing better than this in the market right now. I used senser excel before, and I think I am pretty late in trying this product. After using this product, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth of a shave this razor gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason why I gave this 4 stars is I was getting a cheaper rate for the same razor at costco. I always thought amazon has the cheapest rate, but I was wrong in this case. Same razor and blades, 25% less.... I was planning on ordering couple more for my brother and dad. Guess what i am going to costco this time.</li>
            <li> I ended up with one of these as a sample, not expecting much from it.  Pitched as a men&#x27;s razor, presumably for the face, I couldn&#x27;t comment - but I inadvertently found it to be an excellent razor for the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s razors, multi-blade razors, etc. before, so I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s why this razor is as good as it is.  I have no idea why the vibration works the way it does, but when used in the bikini area, it gives incredibly smooth, irritation-free results that I didn&#x27;t think were possible.  I thought the vibration may be preventing the razor from having too much sustained pressure on the skin, although I don&#x27;t generally use much pressure when using razors in general, so I&#x27;m not sure.  All I know is that it works - and unless I find something better, I will continue to use this razor for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, it&#x27;s not the best razor for legs.  It&#x27;s not bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t be writing the same type of review with that type of use in mind.</li>
            <li> My son likes this razor better than ones he&#x27;s previously used and I like it because he shaves more often.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Product works well, but the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; feature doesn&#x27;t improve the shave at all. Did one half of my face with it on and one with it off, no real difference.</li>
            <li> I was in Costco the other day and saw this battery power razor...I thought why not, I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  There is absolutely no benefit to having the razor vibrating (and it barely vibrates anyway).  It shaves just as well as a non-powered razor. Save a few bucks and get the razor without a battery.</li>
            <li> Great razor, got this one for my son - same as the one I use. A bit surprised not to see even one spare razor though!</li>
            <li> Bought after a roommate decimated my Venus Vibrance. Figured that since it was Gillette maybe the stock of Venus blade heads I still have would fit. Alas, this is not the case (and they seem to be of a different design than the other men&#x27;s gillette razors, so that you have to buy the special twice-the-price fusion heads?). Anyways, the razor works well and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> this product is very good, not imagined how good it is, I recommend the Gillette outdone, loved the product can now shave every day.</li>
            <li> I Love that it has the vibrations! It makes the hair stand up and you can really get a clean easy cut without cutting your face and bleeding!!! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> excellent, easy to use, very good shaving experience, it does not irritate your beard, and leave the skin soft and</li>
            <li> I only use Proglide razors and that is because my face and wanna be mustache and beard love it. I have tried other razors but nothing compares to Gillette&#x27;s Proglide. The vibration is a nice touch but by no means necessary.</li>
            <li> I have problems with other razors that rip, tug and pull the hairs from my face (instead of actually shaving them) If you have this problem, then I would highly recommend this razor. Just put the battery in, push the power button and start shaving (with shaving cream of course) It works wonders compared to other straight edge razors I&#x27;ve used (including other Gillette razors) I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s 100% perfect, but it&#x27;s 100% better than most other straight edge razors.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a couple year old Fusion handle that I had dropped at least three or seven times too many.  It started popping apart when it got dropped.  This one is not nearly as heavy as that old one.  Though I&#x27;ve dropped it once and it has survived that with no problem.  The battery has lasted quite nicely.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m sold on the vibrating, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it so I&#x27;ll probably stay with it.  I haven&#x27;t regretted the purchase, but I was already sold on the Fusion cartridges.</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin, using a regular razor can be a daunting task. Nicks and cuts aren&#x27;t painful, but they are something you want to avoid and that can be tough to do without also running the risk of irritating your skin. The Flexball handle prevents a lot of irritation by providing a smoother, more contoured shave that hugs the face. There&#x27;s minimal pull on the skin, and I wound up with a nice close shave without any nicks or irritation afterwards. This is the best razor I&#x27;ve used yet, and while I&#x27;ll probably stick to an electric for day-to-day shaving, this will work as a perfect substitute when I&#x27;m charging that one up.</li>
            <li> This was exactly as advertised and definitely met my expectations. It was a great value and the order was received quickly. My husband loves this razor and I loved the quality and ease of ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Last year I switched from using this blade to one of the cheaper Dollar Shave ones, and regretted it from day one.  This is a great razor and worth the price for not tearing up your face.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best razor that I have ever used! I got this free from Bzzagent from Gillette! It shaves smooth and my shave lasts atleast 5 days or more! It doesnt wear out fast and you can buy replacement heads for them! Best razor ever!</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have ever gotten.  No nicks.  The only issue I had was under the nose and sideburns.  A little difficult to get those tight spots.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razor I ever had. Really, really nice.</li>
            <li> The unit worked for about 4-5 months.  Then one day I was walking by the bathroom and I hear a loud rattle.  I thought is was an air compressor outside somewhere.  Nope, it was the Proglide turning itself on and off randomly.  It eventually died, I shaved once or twice, didn&#x27;t see any difference in the closeness of the shave.  When I got around to changing the battery the sealed compartment was wet and the battery appeared to be leaking and corroding in the compartment.  I let the unit dry out for 2 days and put in a fresh AA and nothing, no light on the button no movement.  I might have a defective one but thought I should enter a one star for others to be aware of.  The unit is shorted out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Product and Gamble in response to the entry from their community manager.  They are sending a replacement handle for the one that malfunctioned above.  That is great customer support!</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me a sample for me to try out. I have been using mostly Gillette shavers for several years. The shave is just as close as the standard Fusion Proglide I have been using for a year or so and takes just as long. That said, I recently switched to the very inexpensive Dorco 6-blade system which is available only via mail order. All of these products provide very similar results for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the power vibrating head really does not improve my shave compared to standard units. It&#x27;s more like a gimmick. I do not have a heavy beard, so others may have different experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another Gillette power handle previously. My only issue is that that the button lights up, rather than the old style, will burn up the battery faster. Frankly, I see no reason for the glowing button other than cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a close shave, but not much reason to pay to switch if you&#x27;re already using a Fusion handle. Of course, unless you get a good deal on one that makes it cheaper than a replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have used by far. I really like the flexible head on the razor, it allows for a incredibly close shave. Also no razor burn which is always nice. You should really give this razor a try.</li>
            <li> appears to do the job in the same way as old classic gillette mach 3 has been doing. bought it because i accidently bought its blade</li>
            <li> Its a good shave but blade does not last long for me making it too expensive to continue with.  Still better off with high quality disposables.</li>
            <li> So I really thought this was a silly gimmick when I first saw it.&lt;br /&gt;I figured they were just trying to play to the Pulsonics popularity and try to snag some naive consumers that didn&#x27;t want to shell out for the expensive electrics. The idea of putting a battery in my razor just.. I dunno, it made me laugh.&lt;br /&gt;Men&#x27;s razors seem to be getting more and more gimmicky lately.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for the 20 blade, vibrating, self lubricating, razor that compliments you on your technique as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;Because of that I&#x27;ve still been scavenging Mach 3 blades (still a great razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear, I own a Pulsonic (retired) and a Panasonic Arc 5, both vibrating electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades on my Arc 5 were finally starting to pull hairs from being dull and I didn&#x27;t have the $60 to replace them at the time, so I ordered one of these on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;What wasn&#x27;t obvious to me for some reason is that the vibration is minuscule. It&#x27;s barely noticeable but it really does help the blade slice through your hairs. On most of my face it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference but on my chin and upper lip where the hairs get really stiff it slid right through them. Normally those are areas where even new blades catch a bit and things get a little sketchy but this one went through without a hitch. I&#x27;m shaving my lip with a lot more confidence now... which probably means I&#x27;ll be horribly wounded and disfigured soon but still, it&#x27;s a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still haven&#x27;t had to replace the battery after a month which is also a nice surprise since I figured they must be in bed with Duracell and had created another way to help sell AAA&#x27;s to tech nerds. But nope, not even showing signs of slowing down yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like my Arc 5 just for sheer ease of use but I&#x27;m definitely keeping this one and buying new blades for it.&lt;br /&gt;I might finally retire my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> My son  recently got one to try from Bzzagent.com site and its great.. it conforms to his  face when he slides the razor over  his skin its easy to use.. not confusing to how others operate..  the cartridges slide in with no problems..  Since using it , my son says its the best razor he has ever got to sample..  from a very active 23 yr old.  who rarely had time to shave..  He has used it on facial hair abit longer and it still manages to shave his skin smooth.  he wont buy any other razor on the market..</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.  It nicks easily, and I can suffer from a breakout if I end up with razorburn.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor really helps with this!  I thought that the buzzing was just a gimmick until I actually tried it.  I now go through one time all downstrokes, then a second time through going up, and with that little vibrating thing (doesn&#x27;t it seem like that would not be a good idea, for the razor against your face to shake really quickly while you&#x27;re using it?) does the trick.  Not much pressure is needed for a very close shave with no nicks or burn.  Definitely a great product. I took off a point because the cartridges are ridiculously expensive, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> As a handicapped guy I love my new fusion proglide! These new ones now come in blue and chrome whereas the ones from last year came in gold. I just bought a new one in blue assuming it would be made in France just as my gold one I got last year was. However, to my dismay, each razor can be made in France, Poland, or China. The latter is the country I never want it to be made in. I took mine back to exchange for one made in Poland. If you do not care where it is made you&#x27;d be happy buying one at random without reading where it was made on the box. I love how it feels to shave with. It definitely beats my safety razor which, I&#x27;d been shaving with daily for 3 years! Granted, the cartridges on this do cost 4 times as much. However, it is a price we must pay for luxury. Sometimes we need a little luxury in life. I consider these razors to be my toys as an adult; when I was little my toys were my inspiration and now as an &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; these practical gadgets are my toys.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Gillette,  to try and give my honest opinion. I liked the close shave I got, even without trimming my beard first. The razor pivots nicely along thw jaw and chin. The vibration felt nice I suppose. I really liked this razor and it would be worth the money to buy it.</li>
            <li> I had to use a couple times before posting the review of this razor. I normally use a 5 blad razor and it shaves really smooth, so I was excited to try this new one, as I shave a beard and my head.&lt;br /&gt;Well for me the shave was not smooth at all and the vibrating is just weird , although kind of like a mini massage.&lt;br /&gt;I would not honestly say someone should pay the extra money for this. But I also believe people shoudl try something first, as their faces and head will be different than mine. Thank you gillette for letting me try this product.</li>
            <li> the razor is almost as good as the hype  it gives a really good shave the head is flexible meaning it covers angles good shave  berman</li>
            <li> This new razor is amazing!  FYI: I&#x27;m female and use men&#x27;s razors because they work better.  Have been using Gillette razors for years and always got the latest one to try to eliminate cuts.  Gillette&#x27;s new Fusion Power ProGlide is far superior to what I hoped for.  This razor feels so light weight and truly glides upon the skin.  This newest model feels like a light feather traveling over your skin.  This very gentle gliding across the skin allowed for faster, smoother strokes, like there was no resistance.  The results are equally spectacular:  very smooth feel and NO cuts.  I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money on this new razor.  It is well worth upgrading to this newest Gillette model.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor, right down to the packaging (the product popped right out, no fighting with the plastic).  He says it gives him a really great, close shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin (he says it feels soft afterward).  He could have a thick beard if he didn&#x27;t shave so for him, a razor with this many blades is great.</li>
            <li> Just used one for the 1st time and was amazed at how smooth it felt and how close it shaved. After seeing the price of refills I may regret using it, but it was nice to get a great shave.</li>
            <li> It felt same as the previous mach versions....only change is the name ....smooth shave did not last long as promised ....after 5 shaves it is no more smooth ...it pulls your hairs   but it is better than other brand razors</li>
            <li> husband&#x27;s go to razer for every day use.  He has extremely sensitive skin with tons of curly ingrown hair but these seems to work well. Tried other brands too and this one is his favorite.  He alternates this with the 2 blade sensor excel which I believe is hard to come by. Uses this with Bigelow shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  I received this razor from Gillette free to test and review.  Starting out, this looks just like an ordinary manual razor with a swappable razor blade like so many other razors out there.  The razor comes with a couple spare razors loaded in the back of the carrying base.  The razor feels good to hold and I always like multiple blade razors.  That is where the similarity to other razors end.  The ProGlide has a ball that lets the blade swivel to contour your face.  If you use a manual razor to do some contouring of your beard, goatee, or moustache, this is the razor for you.  The razor glides so easily across the face I could barely feel it shaving my face.  Other razors are somewhat awkward to hold to do the contouring of my beard but the ball on the ProGlide allows you to hit all of those difficult angles without having to twist your wrist into awkward positions.  I like to use the razor in the shower and lather with soap.  It feels very good using it in this manner.  I don&#x27;t use gel or foam to shave so I cannot comment on that type of shave but I would imagine it also produces a great shave.  I love this razor and feel it is one of the best on the market!</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide w/ Flexball Handle free from Gillette as part of a trial . Gillette razors in general are just great, regardless of the latest gadget they&#x27;ve added to their newest razor.  If you took out all the gimmicks, this would still be a decent razor. But specifically focusing on the Flexball &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34;, I found it to be rather... forgettable. At no point was I shaving my face and thinking, &amp;#34;Oh wow, this is way better now that it has this new Flexball!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve seen the commercial where they show you how well it contours to curves, and that&#x27;s great and all, but I never had a problem with it before this version of the razor.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For years, I used a Gillette Mach 3 razor. I purchased the Fusion Proglide Power razor, and anticipated a slight improvement in comfort and shave closeness.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an understatement to say I am shocked with results with this new razor. No pulling, no scraping and no slight discomfort that I occasionally experienced with Mach 3. And I quickly and almost effortlessly received an extremely close shave (MUCH closer than my typical recent shaves.)&lt;br /&gt;Note that I have very sensitive skin and shave in the shower using shaving oil.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> After switching from 2-blade razors to these premium 4-blade razors...I can&#x27;t bring myself to go back. It&#x27;s a different experience than the cheaper models. This feels like I can get my shave done a lot quicker than with a cheaper model. It&#x27;s quite pricey by comparison, though. The vibrating razors make quite a difference. I tried not switching it on, just shaving without vibration, and that was a completely different experience too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best I&#x27;ve encountered so far, and Costco carries them so I can get the best deal on replacement blades. But I&#x27;m unhappy with the high price, so it loses a star.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the right razor all my adult life and happily my quest has ended.  Simply an amazing razor. Used for underarms and legs, my legs felt like I had just had them waxed at a salon. Haven&#x27;t figured out the need for the batteries to me all it does is vibrate the razor, I don&#x27;t use the feature.  Just glides down my legs no nicks or irritation whatsoever.  After using this razor I exfoliated my legs with Perlier White Almond Sugar and the result is amazing. Ladies, don&#x27;t forget that after showering in order to keep your skin moist you should use an oil skin product, try Tom Ford Neroli Portofino. This product has the fragrance of sandy beaches and ocean waves it is very delicate and lasts quite a longtime.  I mention this only because I feel this razor does such a good job why not pamper yourself and feel like you just had a spa experience.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s razor is incredible.  It is easy to use, gives a close comfortable shave and leaves my face feeling refreshed.  I highly recommend it without reservations to anyone!  The price is very affordable and you get more than you pay for!  Gillette gave me the opportunity to use the first razor free of charge, however, I will continue to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li> When I bought this one, it has 3 dollars off promotional scheme and it was really worthy in term of money, value and usability.</li>
            <li> This razor is one of the best I have used in a long time.  Normally I use an electric shaver, but when I received this one from Gillette, I gave it a try.  It definitely provides a closer shave than my expensive electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little timid at first since it was battery powered and vibrated on my skin, but I did not have any trouble with it shaving close and giving me a smooth face.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who wants a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a huge sum of money for it.</li>
            <li> dont give as close shave as i expected</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant when using a traditional razor as I find them to be uncomfortable and I often cut myself. That was not the case with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with Flexball handle technology. I found it to glide over my face and it left me feeling smooth and uncut!I did receive this product free to try, but would buy it again!</li>
            <li> great razor, opted for trimmer later on but this was good too. only thing bad is how expensive the cartridges are but thats all. nothing to do with the actual product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors over my lifetime.  This has been the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The slight vibration makes is glide over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a super clean cut....you&#x27;ll love it....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ever since it first came out and have been an enthusiastic fan.  There are two things that I have always loved about it.  First, it gives an incredibly close shave.  Other razors cut reasonably close, the using the Fusion there are times when I can run my hand across my face and not detect even the tiniest bit of beard.  Nothing but smoothness.  The other thing that I love about the razor is that I have cut myself using it less than any brand of razor than I have ever used.  One might think that five blades might actually increase the chances of getting cut, but this isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been several minor design changes over the past few years.  They have all, however, been rather minor.  Until now, that is.  The new Proglide version of the Fusion is considerably different than the other versions.  The main improvement is that blade now tilts back much more sharply, allowing you to shave at many more angles.  I find that this allows a much better shave than before, especially around the nose.  It is just easier to use than before.  The other major change is that there is a heavier lubricant strip.  Frankly, I&#x27;m not a big believer in lubricant strips.  They don&#x27;t seem to me to aid much in shaving.  But if you think this matters, it is definitely true that the lubricant strip is heavier than on the old blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you haven&#x27;t used the Fusion series, I definitely recommend doing so.  It is a great razor.  And if you have been using the Fusion, I would definitely recommend the upgrade to the new Fusion Proglide.  It is a great improvement to an already great razor.</li>
            <li> There has been so much hype around this razor. I have seen so many advertisements on TV and on YouTube for this razor. I have never seen anything like it. I was very skeptical about buying another razor, especially after just buying the [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]] and the [[ASIN:B003BVINQI Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor]] in the past month. I was kind of drawn into the advertisements. Therefore, I was considering trying it. Then, I recently went to Target and saw the [[ASIN:B003983HO6 Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Sneak Preview Set]]. For the price, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness of The New Features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the thin blades are the trademark feature of this razor. I compared them to the original Fusion, and saw a noticeable difference. After shaving, I must say the combination of the small blades and the newly designed microcomb helps take in an increased amount of hair with each stroke. Of course, you will not be able to tell because of the smoothness of the shave. That microcomb truly guides the hair to the blades. After shaving, I noticed a strand my facial hair within one of the comb&#x27;s teeth. The newly designed edge trimmer is a lot better than the one on the original Fusion. There is a noticeable gap in the reservoir. It is clearly big enough to take in larger amounts of hair. In addition, the reservoir make for an easier rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Overall Pro Glide Experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first use, I could not believe how smooth the razor shaved. The smoothness of each stroke made me feel as if I was not shaving at all because I could barely feel the razor on my face. There was no tugging or pulling. Using an increased amount of shaving cream only enhances the \\&quot;Gliding\\&quot; experience. For Gillette to say the razor is \\&quot;designed to glide\\&quot; is an understatement. I must admit, shaving with a power razor felt a little awkward, though. To prove the effectiveness of the Pro Glide compared to the other razors, I temporarily went back to using the Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor because the preview set only has one usable cartridge. I actually felt the blades against my skin. The shave did not feel anywhere near as comfortable as it felt using the Pro Glide. Not to mention, I nicked myself. The Pro Glide wins by a landslide. For those, who are looking for a new razor, which will give you an unbelievably comfortable shave, look no further than the Pro Glide. While shaving, you will realize that is EXACTLY what it does. Believe the hype!!! You will receive a shave like you never have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Since the razors are expensive, users can prolong the life of the razor by shaking all excess water out of the razor to the point, which the razor is dry. Put some rubbing alcohol on the razor. Next, place the razor into a plastic bag, so moisture can be kept out. I have used the same razor, which came with the [[ASIN:B003983HO6 Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Sneak Preview Set]]. I have been using the same razor for at least, 15 times. The lubrastrip is STILL green. Therefore, I still have more use of the same razor.Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor because the preview set only has one usable cartridge.

            <li> Too many blades! I don&#x27;t care how closely they are spaced, or what kind of space-aged engineering material you coated them with, its just too many blades for me (everybody?).  Let&#x27;s be clear, I grow facial hair quick and thick, and this still tears up my face.  I really had high hopes for this one too.  I wish they made a 2 blade version of this, because I&#x27;m back to my sensor excel.  Oh and the power feature, just makes it harder to feel if you are pushing too hard or if you&#x27;re about to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor i ever own, it gives you the baby finish everyone want&#x27;s. The duration of the blade is better than standar Fusion. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was not a big fan of the previous Gillette fusion because it irritated my skin and gave me very uncomfortable shaves. I thought that this one would be an improvement and I was excited about getting the pro glide version. Like a dummy I didn&#x27;t test it first and got the bulk set from Costco.     This is by far the worst razor ever. There was no gliding at all, it was more like grinding. It irritated the hell out of my skin and it was the most uncomfortable shave ever. It felt as if it was pulling each hair out of my face and I was bleeding everywhere. At first I thought that OK maybe its was this specific blade I was using so I got another blade, the same. The next morning I pulled out  an old unused single blade disposable I had for emergencies and it was much more comfortable then this one. I absolutely hate this razor, I ended up giving away the other unused blades. I had to go back to my old Gillette Mach3 disposable which were 100x better then this.     Few days later, I went out and got the Shick Hydro 3 blade, now this is a great razor. Felt great. Best shave ever. This did everyting that the Pro glide promised to do. I had no irritation of the skin and the shave was very comfortable and close.     I would NOT recommend this razor at all. I guess maybe my skin is too sensitive, but I thought that this was supposed to the best for sensitive skin...WRONG.     Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t spend you money on this overpriced crap. Get the Shick Hydro or any other disposable razors, they will do a better job.</li>
            <li> I tried every razor on the market starting with the Gillette sensor 2 blade when I first started shaving at around 14-15 years of age. The truth is that I kept on buying into the newer razors that came out thinking they were better but that was always not the case. So I&#x27;ll briefly compare this to the other razors I&#x27;ve tried and tell you a honest view of mine about why this deserves only one star and which razors are better.    Firstly, when I started shaving the Gillette sensor excel 2 blade was excellent and provided a good shave with less to no irritation at all when used with a shave gel. The sensor 3 blade was a little closer and just as comfortable as the two blade. Thats all I have to say about that.  The Mach 3 then came out which did seem to be a better razor and provided a closer shave with out much irritation so it was a winner. Then Mach 3 power nitro came out and the power aspect felt good but the results was basically the same. So all in all the Mach 3 manual and power were better than the Sensor excel 2 and 3 blade razors up to now.    Schick then came out with the quattro 4 blade(the original first one) which was Ok and provided a good close shave but I still decided to stick with the comfort of the Mach 3. So up till now the Mach 3 was my razor of choice.    Now the story changes a bit:    I received a free sample of the fusion power and at first I thought it was the best razor because of the first few close shaves it provided. I got over excited and bought a 8 pack refill for the fusion power thinking I would never use anything else. BAD DECISION!!!! My clear unirritated skin became red and irritated after continuing to use the fusion power. At first I thought maybe my skin is changing as I&#x27;m getter older so it&#x27;s my skin&#x27;s fault. I would get ingrown hairs and it was then embarrassing to go out. I lost all my self confidence and started staying more reserved. I tried various skin treatments to rid of the irritations and redness but nothing would work. The problem with the fusion was that the blades would only last about 3 shaves and then irritate the hell out of your face. ONE DAY I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY ANOTHER RAZOR.    I then bought the Schick Quattro Titanium and boy was it a much less irritating shave with more comfort and the same closeness as the fusion. It was much much better than the fusion because of the titanium coating and the blades last forever. They would stay sharp for months and wouldn&#x27;t clog if a shave gel was used.(I know people complain that it clogs but with a light foaming shave gel like Anthony Logistics or Zirh it doesn&#x27;t).    Now Hydro 5 vs. Fusion Proglide    Hydro 5 came out first and since the schick quattro titanium was my razor of choice I had to try the Hydro 5. At first I liked it, the gel strip felt gooey but washed off easy with warm water. The shave was not as close as I would have wanted. The hydro 5 missed a few parts on the neck area and the under nose area because of the huge cartridge. Still I kept on using it since it came with 2 refills anyway. The gel strip lasted longer than fusion but not as long as quattro titanium.    Fusion Proglide: I bought the sneak peek package just to try the razor before it came out and all I can say is AWFULLLLLL!!!!!!! This time I couldn&#x27;t even get one good shave from this crap. Turns shaving into gliding my A$$!!!! It&#x27;s very uncomfortable to use and does not glide at all.I will admit that it provides a very close shave but that irriates my face a lot. So the fusion proglide is the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used so far. The cartridge lasts only like two shaves and the refills are more expensive than a full tank of gasoline(mind the exaggeration but you know what I mean).    Final verdict: Gillette just tweaks their razors a bit makes false claims and sells their refills for a lot of money to fool the consumers. They are nothing but marketing now. Up until the Mach 3 they were my razor brand but the fusion and fusion proglide are nothingbut scams. They look cool but I think they are face wreckers. Then again I have sensitive skin so I understand people with thicker beards and normal skin probably love Gillette razors but I have to address the sensitive skin shavers out there and Gillette razors should be avoided by them unless they want a irritated face.    The hydro 5 lost because of the huge razor head and strip making it less precise. Also the skin guards on the hydro irritate more than help. So Schick Quattro Titanium is the razor of choice for my sensitive skin. It will not clog with Zirh or Anthony Logistics shave gel and causes no irritation. The blade lasts long and refills are reasonable price, it has the single edging blade which is better than hydro 5 flip trimmer which just irritates. Sorry for long review but I just had to share my experience.</li>
            <li> Clean, close, comfortable shave but my $14 battery operated Braun (including batteries) travel shaver works as good or better.  I&#x27;m not looking for a religious experience when I shave - just smooth skin without irritation, nicks or cuts.  The Proglide gives a good but not superior result, and Gillette&#x27;s instructions for an optimal shave require too much prep time.  Also, Gillette hints that the razor may dull after 5 shaves.  It does and the \\&quot;special lubricating strip\\&quot; wears out sooner.  Frequent razor replacement in addition to the cost of a better quality shave cream is ridiculously expensive.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the Braun (which has a surprisingly good shave block) for daily shaving, and save the Proglide for trimming my sideburns and neckline where it excels.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor over a month and I cannot tell a difference from the old Fusion razor.  I have a heavier than average beard and while this razor gives a good, close shave, there is no reason to go buy it if you are already using the Fusion.  The one improvement that I could see was the larger handle.  The \\&quot;power\\&quot; shave seemed a gimmick that just increases the cost of shaving by one battery.  I got a closer shave with the power turned off.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned, and I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with its performance. not as many cuts, with this one :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  It is hard to believe that this much more is actually better, but it is.  What&#x27;s next?  9 blades?  Seriously, though, this is the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had.  And somehow, the vibrating battery just works too.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to like this razor, the ongoing gimmickry has become increasingly annoying. However I have to admit this razor gives a really comfortable shave. The ergonomics are the best I&#x27;ve come across, well balanced, correctly angled head, substantial weight with battery installed.  The five-blade cluster is more than just gimmickry, it provides a wider shaving area, which is more stable as you shave. The vibrating gimmick is just that, however. It seems to add nothing to the shave and it completely eliminates any tactile feedback, which I find necessary for a good shave. New blades are quite expensive, usually $3-$4 each, pretty steep but you may find the comfort of the shave is worth it (I&#x27;m still unsure). To sum up, pass on the powered version and go with the cheaper &#x27;manual&#x27; version and be prepared to pay a lot for new blades.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I have used a men&#x27;s Mach 3 Razor for many years and liked it.  Just tried this Proglide Men&#x27;s Power Razor and it cuts amazingly. Ladies give this Men&#x27;s razor a try!</li>
            <li> I usually shave with an electric razor, but this might change my mind.  I didn&#x27;t like the vibrate option as i found it made me cut myself too easily.</li>
            <li> I got this the other day from Gillette and I really liked this razor. The blades are much sharper than the regular Fusion blades and give me a very smooth shave without cutting myself at all. In fact, it seems like it would be next to impossible to cut yourself. I couldn&#x27;t quite figure out why you&#x27;d want a battery operated razor, but I was surprised to find that it really makes a difference. I really can&#x27;t see any movement of the razor when I look at it turned on, but it works very well. The razor itself has nice rubberized grips which help make sure it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands. The new Proglide is smooth and did the job without punishing my face. I can shave in the shower without a mirror and the razor glides gently over my face without missing a spot or nicking my skin. If there is one downside to using Gillette Fusion razors it would be the high cost of replacement blades. I suppose one must pay the price for quality and innovation.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from the brand to try out, but I will certainly be purchasing it again. It gave me one of the best shaves I have ever experienced. It glided so easily, and did a great job. A super close shave and my skin was left feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very good razor though I probably won&#x27;t use the vibration function.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for facial shaving. It lived up to it&#x27;s expectations</li>
            <li> Good razor and nice blade. Watch out when ordering replacement blades they may not be same quality..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Schick Quattro for years, and figured it was time to get a new razor. I bought the Gillette Fusion ProGlide based on the reviews, specifically because a lot of reviewers identified themselves as switching from Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been impressed with this razor. It looks nice, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle gets incredibly slippery. I find myself having to thoroughly dry it and my hands multiple times while shaving. I don&#x27;t remember having this issue with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They made this razor very flexible, I&#x27;m guessing so that it will follow the contours of your neck better (maybe in the crook of the neck yes, but no benefits around the Adam&#x27;s apple). I leave stubble on my face most of the time, and shave my neck clean, so I need to get a straight line under my jaw and chin. This razor is just to floppy for that. I need a firmer razor, one that doesn&#x27;t flop around as much at the head. This one is what I imagine it would be like to shave with a wet sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in closeness of shave, nor a reduction in the number of times I have to go across a given area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to my old Schick Quattro. I hope they keep making blades for it…</li>
            <li> it ok but there are better one i try</li>
            <li> Well, as described, will buy again. Hope to have a big discount, so as to stimulate my desire to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the non-powered model for a couple years. Saw this as a deal on Amazon and figured I&#x27;d try it. Very disappointed. Not only is it no better than the non-powered model, it actually seems slightly worse. Not terrible, but certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li> A great clean shave! Does not hurt like some electric razors.</li>
            <li> Shaving needs to be done but this one does a great job. Really like the power feature. We&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Some of us may recall that the &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; our fathers used to shave with was called a straight razor. They sharpened this &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; on a leather strap every so often. (Another use was when an older brother had his rear tanned when he got out of line!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use a straight razor,  the angle where the  razor met the skin for shaving was very important.  An incorrect angle and the skin would be cut.  The other item of importance was the amount of  pressure applied to the razor during the shaving.  Too much force and a cut usually resulted. Too little force and hair  was not shaved off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety razor came into  being when a guy named Gillette devised a &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; to eliminate the need  to hold the razor at a precise angle to shave the face.  Many others then came out with safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s safety  razors,  as I have stated is only a &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; for shaving.  The final shave results depend on the expertise  of the user.  For most this expertise is easily acquired but for a few they never get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret of getting a great shave depends on the pressure one applies to the shaving &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;,  your  safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette produces great shaving &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34;.. every one is better than the one before it!</li>
            <li> I give five stars for the interest of all mankind, I just had the closest shave EVER (and I have had many, including from straight-blade razors). My skin feels so soft and smooth like a baby&#x27;s skin and most important of them all, no blood anywhere. I have a Mach 3 with which every shave made my face red with blood, like it was some battlefield of some medieval European country.&lt;br /&gt;Today is the first time since I took birth that my shave did not give me any cuts, neither did I feel any irritation. I plan on shaving everyday just so I could use this razor.&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it, then don&#x27;t think twice, just click on \\&quot;Buy with 1-click\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Using it for 3 weeks now, I would say I am happy with not super excited though. This is not a revolutionary product. Many people seem to complain about the vibrations. I would say it gives a feeling of so called &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; as it suppresses friction feel and makes it feel smooth. Just a feeling no real effort has been taken to reduce blade to skin friction over other products in this range. Overall its a good upgrade over disposable razors but nothing great compared to other products in this league.</li>
            <li> Great blade. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Atras for 20+ years and I thought it was time to test out other options. What an upgrade! The vibrating blade really does help and I liked precision trimmer for getting a clean shave below the nose. Replacement blades are a few dollars more expensive than some other options I tried, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> At first was skeptical of the vibrating shaver and still not quite sure of it&#x27;s contribution but I have to say that I haven&#x27;t had a shave quite like this before. Hands down the smoothest shave ever and my sensitive skin has been deprived of it&#x27;s usual razor burn. Good buy and goodbye.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was skeptical of Gillette just creating another gimmick cartridge to take our money, but as far as their other razors are concerned, this one really is great.  I can only compare it to other Gillette razors, but this is by far their best.  I was fine with my old regular Fusion, but this you cannot even feel the hairs being cut, and gets my face super smooth. I still get minor razor burn on my neck sometimes, but I can&#x27;t imagine another big-brand-name razor like this being this smooth.  I was really considering the safety razor route, but now I may not have to.</li>
            <li> During my first run with this I saw that it was able to glide and shave all my facial hair. But during the second run I saw that it start to run over my facial hair. I&#x27;m not sure if the blade ended up loosing its \\&quot;sharpness\\&quot; or maybe it was me. Either way, this blade is a piece of work but I wished I bought it from a wholesale store I currently shop at where for just 15 more dollars I could have gotten 5 more blades.</li>
            <li> Hi, I received this razor for Christmas and was shocked at how easy the shave went.  I have never been big on a battery operated razor because I thought it was a waste.  Not true.  It has been a pleasure to have a good clean shave that is so effortless.  I am happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is horrible for sensitive skin.  Try using a Bic Sensitive razor or a bump fighter razor instead.  The Proglide razor was probably the harshest razor I ever used.</li>
            <li> I am coming from using the Mach 3 for many years, but when I forgot it while on a trip I decided to try something different. The shave was definitely a more pleasant experience in that the power handle caused less pulling frequent with the mach 3.  That being said, I have a difficult chin where the grain will vary from place to place. I have to be just as thorough with this handle and I find that a shave takes just as long for maybe a slightly improved result.  Finally, there is an extra blade on the top of the unit for precision trimming. I am finding that to be quite useful in working under the lip and for sideburns.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad and he liked it. He still said that power version of this was better.</li>
            <li> the vibrate feature is great - smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;purchased in a deal..</li>
            <li> Very good comfortable shave.  Truth is, though, I have found very good razors for much less long-term cost.  But this razor is worth getting if the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of razors because I had pretty bad acne when I was younger.  This is one of the only ones to get a good shave across those small pores.  The vibrate function is amazing and really adds a tingling feeling to the fact that I&#x27;m letting 5 incredible sharp blades get really close to my jugular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only better shave is short old dude at the men&#x27;s barber shop downtown wielding a straight blade.</li>
            <li> Gillette has a nasty habit of over-hyping their products. I do not know how this compares to their Fusion and blah blah, but I do know that this is a good razor. It delivers a close shave without causing irritation. This goes really well with a badger brush and some high quality shaving cream. The cartridges last way long than Gilette says; I have been using the same one for the past...five or six months, I think. Take care of the cartridge and it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know whether it’s a placebo or what, but the vibrating handle does seem to make for a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I’ve used many brands of razors over the last 30 years.  I’ve always gone back to Gillette because the craftsmanship of the product always works best for my sensitive skin.  For many years I’ve exclusively used a single blade razor.  After using the Gillette Fusion Proglide, I was sold.  Multiple blades are the way to go.  It normally took be 15 minutes to shave with a single razor.  With this product, it took me less than 5 minutes, and got a closer shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor and the vibrating handle is nice but I&#x27;d probably be just as happy without the vibrating handle. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Flat out the best razor you can buy under $25.  This sucker cost me $10 shipped, and although it only includes one cartridge, it lasts me a solid 3-4 weeks, shaving every other day.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the blade only needs 1-2 passes vs. 5+ with other disposable razors like the Gillette Custom Plus.  I&#x27;ve tried the manual version of this razor, and I prefer the power version because it seems to cut even closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/04/12 Update: I&#x27;ll take that \\&quot;Best razor\\&quot; title out.  It&#x27;s not the best.  The best up to this point from my experience is the Merkur Model 180.  Gillette&#x27;s quality seems to have slipped, as the blades do not keep their sharp edges long enough.  I can only get about 7 shaves out of one cartridge.  I used to get at least 11-12, and on the 13th shave the blades would begin to slightly snag and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, it&#x27;s economically advantageous to go with the Merkur Model 180.</li>
            <li> it do what it advertised. and im satisfied every part of it.&lt;br /&gt;clean look, nice buzz, cant have better.  nice product</li>
            <li> the best razor I have ever used.  my skin is ridiculously sensitive and these razors are smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind; no breakouts or red itchy bumps on my neck afterwards.  A+</li>
            <li> My husband, a man of few words, had a lot to say about this product! He was very impressed with smooth glide, the close shave and the razors that never seem to go dull! A great purchase even if it was an Amazon vine purchase!</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new razor.  I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m always complaining about not getting a close enough shave without tearing my face up, so when I saw the commercial for Proglide I decided to give it a go.  It&#x27;s sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus.  I&#x27;ll say this, it does give me a clean, close shave; but only if I space out its usage.  Thankfully, I only shave a few days a week, considering that it is not a requirement with my line of work that I be clean shaven.  When I&#x27;ve waited a few days before using, the Proglide is a dream.  It glides over my face and takes with it unwanted hair, leaving a smooth aftermath that I thoroughly enjoy.  Sadly, I&#x27;ve noticed that if I shave two days in a row my skin gets irritated and the shave is nowhere near as close.  I know that some consider the battery operated vibration to be a mere gimmick, but having used a razor with the same capability for years I have found that my shave is always closer WITH the vibration, and I&#x27;m quick to replace the battery because of that.  Sure, it can make a shave more expensive in the long run, but it&#x27;s worth it (as far as I&#x27;m concerned).  When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat.  All in all, I like this product.  It delivers most of the time; I just wish it were always.</li>
            <li> Previously I had used Gillette vector plus razor, so this was a major upgrade for me. The shave is super smooth and 100 times better than my previous razor. The chin area used to be hassle for me while shaving, but with the proglide it was a breeze. The vibration effect seems to reduce the friction as advertised. I have used it just once so I cannot comment about the battery life and other aspects of the razor. But I am thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette as a sample.  I switched from using Gillette Mach 3 razor I had used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this razor because of the close shave and no razor burn.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how long my whiskers are it does a great job.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you heard, but Gillette just gave away some of these perfect pieces of machinery for free. They sent me one and what a tool! This little magnificent beauty feels so sophisticated in my hand. Like the gods sat down and crafted this just for me to hold. No more cheap, flimsy poor razors for me. I will take the the Proglide any day as it makes me feel as though I belong with the elite. Aside from the snazzy, well built feel and look of the razor itself, it works. If my face were the North Georgia Mountains, this razor trekked it like a beast. I&#x27;ve never had a razor that moves like this one and it&#x27;s very impressive. I do like this razor. And I plan to keep it.</li>
            <li> I saw a large, end-cap display for these razors yesterday at CVS.  Very nicely done!  Colorful, easy to review, and caught-my-eye as I walked by.  Will be buying more soon...</li>
            <li> Gillette is the star of the handled shaver. This is just an improvement on what was already fine. I&#x27;ve had one before but this was offered at a good price and so I made the purchase. The vibrating head isn&#x27;t just a gadget, it actually does assist in  producing a better shave. I&#x27;m a shower shaver so the sturdiness is appreciated. And, bless their hearts, they included the batter and a blade. In these times, almost unheard of. For a good smooth shave, this is the razor to use.</li>
            <li> This gave me a great close shave. It didn&#x27;t leave any cuts on my face nor did it leave any irritation. It left my skin feeling nice and soft after each shave. It conformed very well to my face. I think I can finally stop my search for razors now. It never left any unwanted leftover facial hair. It gave me a great close shave each and every time I used it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I finally converted to the Fusion razor from my Mach III razor, I was using the un-powered Fusion razor. I just tried the power version, and it is awesome because it seems to gives an even more comfortable shave. It is also somehow more invigorating to shave with the power version.</li>
            <li> am highly impressed by the Fusion Proglide Power Razor. I have been using a Schick Quattro for 6 years or so, along with an electric razor. neither of them really got the chin and neck areas.  the Fusion Proglide gets way closer, leaving a smooth surface.  I don&#x27;t think the replacement blades are that costly, as long as they last 10 or 15 shaves. I have been shaving every seconrd or third day, being a retired guy...I rate this one highly!</li>
            <li> I think this model of shaver is no longer made, but I needed it because I had a supply of blades without the holder. This was a reasonably priced new handle. GOOD VALUE. With the battery it vibrates giving your fingers that gentle relaxing massage while you shave your face. The vibration IMHO does nothing to help the shaving, but get used to it, as long as I&#x27;ve lived they have seen fit to invent something new every couple of years to keep a revenue plan. They long ago reached the technical apex for shaving with multi blade technology, after this it&#x27;s all sales pitch unless you hear they&#x27;ve got a laser model. I don&#x27;t fault Gillette for trying to do makeovers, look what happened to Polaroid and Kodak when they tried to continue without innovation or change. Make sure you have (as I did) or can still get blades for this. Comes in a nice box that&#x27;s a good holder for day to day. I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 because, honestly,  the vibrator is a novelty where form over function is a sales tool, not an improvement in shaving.</li>
            <li> really gives a close shave w/o razor burn</li>
            <li> Good shipping and works great in my walk-in closet</li>
            <li> This razor works really well. I get a clean shave. The addition of the vibration helps with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> First off, yes I am a woman. I never thought I would use a man&#x27;s razor because of the fact I have been a loyal consumer of Schick Quattro For Women. I have been using Schick Quattro since it came on the market and I thought it was the best razor out there. I recently noticed that I would have to shave over certain areas about 5-10 times for it to do its job. As i was shaving last week with my beloved Quattro, my hubby walked in and noticed how I was repeatedly shaving the same spot over and over. Thats when he introduced me to the Gillette Fusion Proglide because he felt bad for me! OMG I LOVED how much faster it was at shaving than my now behated Quattro. It literally took me more than half the time to shave compared to my old one. I could not believe how smooth it was and for some reason I dont have to shave nearly as often as I did with Quattro. I also did not cut myself at all (some razors cut easily). I recommend this razor to all the ladies out there that use Quattro, or any other razor for that matter. Sorry Quattro you are adios.</li>
            <li> I confess I&#x27;m an electric razor user but when by four year old electric gave out my first thought was not to impulse buy a new one but try a high end blade razor until I make my electric choice.  This razor has the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve ever used. The battery powered viration feature lessens the friction for sure. The closeness of course is phenomonal. My son told me about the &#x27;5 week&#x27; blade ad. I used this exactly nine times and you know exactly when you&#x27;ve shaved your last shave with a blade. It was on the ninth shave (today).  For me that&#x27;s the limit. I could feel the friction increase significantly.  For me the blade cost wouldn&#x27;t be high because it&#x27;s a great price/qualty/value.  Blade shaving is not for me but if it were I&#x27;d use this. no doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/19/12 Update: I realized that the buzzy motor thing is just a gimmick. I can tell you that for me it actualy caused more friction and micro cuts. When I tuend it off I got a much better shave. Still, after about 7 to 9 shaves max, the blade is done for me. The blaes are micro thn and just don&#x27;t hold up for my wiskers. I still think the expense is a lot but not so much if you really are into shaving and willing to shell out the dough. I&#x27;m now mostly using my electric wet with a great gel I&#x27;ve found \\&quot;Nivea sensitive skin\\&quot;. OT but for wet electric shaving the exact right gel makes all the difference and other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used were horrible (ie. \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot;). I alternate the electric with Gillete Mach III, which I would say are almost as good as these blades.</li>
            <li> This IS the best razor yet. Very smooth, clean and close shave. I will hold on to this one for a long time. I do wish the refills were less expensive though.</li>
            <li> Smoooooooooth now, like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Best Razor which I have. Little expensive, but you&#x27;ll enjoy every shaving time.</li>
            <li> I really believe the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best razor I have ever used. I am able to shave with the grain and against the grain on my neck and face without any irritation or razor burn.   Where I see the greatest difference between this razor and razors like Mach 3 and the Gillete Power Fusion is when I shave my head. I have been shaving my head for 10 years and I remember the first time I used the Gillette Proglide on my head, I couldn&#x27;t believe how baby skin soft my head felt. Over these 10 years I tried just about every new razor there was on my head. I shave my head once a day and sometimes twice. On a rare occasion I even shaved it three times. I shave my entire head usually twice with the grain and twice or more against the grain using a moderate degree of pressure and I can truthfully say it leaves my head the smoothest of anything I ever tried.   I have had no razor burn or cuts with this Power Proglide razor.  I have used many types of shaving creams with the Proglide razor like Nivea for Sensitive Skin, various types of Edge gell, Aveeno, Aloe Vera Gel, Shaving Secret oil, hair conditioner, bottled shampoo, moisturizers, shaving mug soap with brush and even dial bath soap brushed into a lather with my shaving brush. I can honestly say that there is not too much difference with using these shaving gels/soaps with the Gillette Power Proglide.The product that I found to give me the closest smooth head with the Power Proglide is the Nivea Shave Gel for Sensitive Skin. I can usually get about 5 complete head shaves (several times with the grain and against the grain) and beard shaves  with one razor before I need to replace it. The trimmer is quite helpful to trim around and outline my beard, goatee, mustache and even the occasional eyebrow. The only negative for this razor is the price.   If you want the most baby skin smooth head and face, you will want to try this razor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this product daily, it&#x27;s probably just fine, although the vibration with the battery seems gimmicky. I don&#x27;t think it adds anything. However, for a 2-3 day growth, I found that it pulls on my skin badly, so I found it no better then earlier Gillette models, and really, not any better than some disposable blades.</li>
            <li> I have a medium tough beard and after a week can absolutely tell I&#x27;m not getting as close a shave as I was with the old fusion. My stubble is also returning much earlier in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the new \\&quot;microcombs\\&quot; inserted between the blades, maybe a thicker \\&quot;protection strip\\&quot; or maybe thinner blades. Whatever, it&#x27;s definitely not as close.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor. The blades last me two weeks of daily shaving.  The new flexible one is even better</li>
            <li> How many more times can you upgrade a shaver, works great!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellant razor. I bought it for my husband and he really likes it. Gets close dry shave.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying that if you&#x27;re absolutely settled on a cartridge razor system, this or the regular Fusion Proglide will probably fit the bill just fine. As far as multi-blade razors go, this is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve experienced from one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, here&#x27;s the deal. For the longest time I simply used regular old Gillette Mach 3 disposables and bought some more every time I ran out. They never gave me a great shave, but I chocked that up to my sensitive skin and thought razor burn and bumps were unavoidable. I figured at the very most I&#x27;d need to simply find a better shaving foam/gel, but I never did find it. Finally, I decided to &#x27;upgrade&#x27;, and bought one of these at CVS for $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide does offer superior performance over standard disposables, of course. In terms of cartridge razor &#x27;systems&#x27;, this is as good as it gets. I don&#x27;t think that the &#x27;Power&#x27; model is necessary, although it&#x27;s what I got. The vibrating feature can sometimes feel nice, but most of the time I just shave with it normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I say it turned me off of cartridge systems forever. I went from standard disposables to this, and instead of getting a lot better shave and/or saving money, I got a marginally better shave for quite a bit of money. The razor itself is only about $10, but cartridges are currently $32 for 8 cartridges on Amazon! At the very most - and I think I&#x27;m being a bit too generous here - this is a 2-month supply, assuming each cartridge lasts a week which I highly doubt. That&#x27;s at least $192 a year just on cartridges! (Although, I believe you can use regular Fusion Proglide cartridges, although they aren&#x27;t much cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t mean to sound like a salesman here, but I do have another suggestion. After realizing I couldn&#x27;t justify $200 a year on cartridges, I was absolutely sure there had to be a cheaper way to shave that didn&#x27;t involve an electric razor which doesn&#x27;t get close enough. Amazon \\&quot;Top Rated\\&quot; directed me to an old-school Merkur double-edged safety razor, and I read up. I&#x27;m not trying to sell you guys a Merkur. Buy whatever safety razor floats your boat, but hear this out: 100 razor blades for $10. Razor blades that are sharper and probably last just as long as the cartridges (and perform better), for much, much cheaper. Even if they each only last 3-4 days, that&#x27;s still a years supply for around $10 as opposed to $192. I&#x27;m no math major, but I think that&#x27;s a savings of about $182.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of paying for a cartridge system that doesn&#x27;t shave as well as an old-school safety razor, irritates my face, and costs literally hundreds of dollars a year. It didn&#x27;t make sense to me. In a week or two of using a DE razor, I&#x27;ve made irritation literally a thing of the past. The thing glides along the face, hardly feeling like it&#x27;s touching you until you realize the hair is gone. Honestly, it&#x27;s an epiphany that I can&#x27;t keep quiet about. Especially if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, make the switch and save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I just received my Gillette Fusion Proglide power razor today. I allowed 2 days of growth so I could really put this razor to the test. The razor cut so smooth and clean it was as if it just wiped the hair away. This is my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first to if this vibration really did any type of benefit towards the shave. I shaved one side of my face with the vibration ON, and it was almost effortless to glide down my face. Paired with the amazing head, it did wonders. On the other side I shaved with the vibration OFF. It was still very effortless and a super smooth shave, but it wasn&#x27;t AS close as using the vibration. Moral of the story, if you like a smooth effortless shave, every time, us the vibration.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me the Fusion ProGlide Power at no charge so I could take it out for a test shave. The handle is beautifully designed and feels nice in the hand,  The shave it provides was better than very good, it was excellent.  The thing handles chins very nicely and does not cut you up at all. The trimmer blade should be a prerequisite for every razor handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is too light in my hand, even with the battery for the for the buzzer installed.  Speaking of buzzers, I&#x27;ve tried them before and I&#x27;m not convinced that they are anything more than a marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is the best razor for sensative skin. I used this razor on my neck with no razor burn. I would recommend this razor to anyone that has sensative skin. It has more power than most razors. The cost is in line with others like it and comes with a name known for quality.</li>
            <li> Today I got my free Gillete Fusion PROGLIDE, and guess what the shave was the same as my old fusion. I noticed no difference in my shave. Having said that I still support the Gillette brand because, I think that compared to other brands that I have used in the past they are stillthe ones that I feel comfortable using on my face.</li>
            <li> I got this awesome new razor from a Gillette promo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to shave in the shower.  I even got a mirror installed.  The Fusion Proglide Power Handle makes it even easier to shave while wet.  The handle is big and has rubber grips.  It is also longer than your average razor handle.  I have used power handles from gillette in the past, but the redesign makes me more confident while shaving in the tub or shower.  The power button also feels more substantial than the older models.</li>
            <li> Gillette was kind enough to provide me with a Fusion ProGlide Power Handle and blades. One word to describe it, awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using to traditional shaving (without batteries) and I have been for years and years but that has changed. The vibration created by the power handle makes in the shower for the benefit of the steam seem unnecessary. My shaves are now smoother, faster, and just overall more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m someone who shaves daily and even that&#x27;s not enough so I need all the help I can get to keep my face from getting irritated, great product.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me a ProGlide Power Razor as a promotion and wanted to share my opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a sleek design for a handle.  Not sure if the power bit actually helps with the whole close shave thing but it felt good in the hand and looks awesome.  Came with a battery and was simple to install and use.</li>
            <li> At first I was not sure if I would like this razor as the handle is a bit fatter then the normal non battery operated Gillette razor.&lt;br /&gt;Once you hold it however you dont really realize its fatter, and the shave it gives is excellent. I tested it by shaving half with the Proglide and half with a normal Gillette razor and my wife checked to see which she liked, blind tests work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip on the handle of this ProGlide is superior to other Gillette razors I must add.</li>
            <li> I received this for free via a program run by Gillette. I was excited to try my new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power.  I was very excited to see the advantages of using the power razor.  As it turns out I dont really see the advantage.  The razor blade is great but next time I probably wont even turn on the handle.</li>
            <li> I received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor from a program sponsored by Gillette.  The handle fits in my hand comfortably and I have no issues maneuvering the razor to shave every part of my face.  The power button is flush with the handle, making it harder to turn on accidentally. The battery compartment is also very easy to open and close.  Overall this is a very comfortable razor to use.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to evaluate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is fancy with lots of features, but its a little bit of an overkill unless you grow a lot of facial hair or if you are shaving for the first time after a week.  It&#x27;s nice an ergonomic, but I don&#x27;t need to shave for hours and found normal shavers to be more than adequate.</li>
            <li> I received this power handle for free via a program run by Gillette. The handle itself, during the shave, does help with the overall sleekness and closeness of the shave. One thing I dislike, would be the fact that you have a weird feeling in your hand temporarily after use. But overall, the power handle itself allows a much finer and closer cut.</li>
            <li> I got the razor through a free program run by Gillette. The wider handle and grip make it easier to hold the razor. The button lights up when you turn it on and it feels like an electric razor against my skin. My skin felt smoother after shaving.</li>
            <li> Prior to getting this handle for free from Gillette, I was using the non-Power ProGlide version. I like that this handle is a little larger, which allows me to grip it a bit better. The vibration raises the hair, which allows for a closer, smoother shave. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I used to use a Gilette Sensor razor everyday. It was pretty good.  Then I switched to an electric shaver and used it everyday for about the past 3 years.  When Gillette offered to give me a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to try - I figured sure - I&#x27;ll try it.  Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend the money on one since I was happy with my electric, but after the first day - I&#x27;d buy one.  Super smooth 7 hours later!  The handle is a great design and doesn&#x27;t slip like the old razor I used (one of the reasons i liked the electric better then).  And it was cool how well they designed the battery \\&quot;door\\&quot;.  Kinda like a racecar razor for your face.  Faster shave this morning. No irritation at all.  Thanks Gillette for a great new product.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free as part of a program that was run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance the Fusion ProGlide Power handle is light weight and durable. The handle has a vibrate function that allows the hair to stand up while the blades pass over. This gives you a precision cut for a non stubble feel. The handle has a nice rubber grip so there is no chance of slipping while shaving. Over all this is a great shaving handle for the price. and cant wait to shave again good job Gillette!!</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to check out a Fusion ProGlide Power thanks to a freebie from Gillette.  I must admit I was a bit skeptical about the addition of the vibration from the handle doing anything to help in the shaving process going into it.  After giving it a shot and trying both with it on and off, I feel it does help to stand the hairs up a bit better and really helps the blade slide across the face easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not something we generally think about, this handle has a nice weight to it.  This helps both in controlling the blade in your hand and also makes it feel less cheap than other blades.  The added weight also helps in pulling the blade across the face and when controlling it around areas like sideburns.  The blade on the Fusion ProGlide slides right through hairs without the tugging I often had with other cheap blades.  I don&#x27;t end up with the redness on my neck like I use to.  While one can use the front of the razor for straight cut areas like sideburns, the trimmer on the backside of the head does a better job at making a straight line and is easier to tell where you&#x27;re cutting.  Overall it makes shaving an easier experience that&#x27;s less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving the Fusion ProGlide Power a shot, I&#x27;m sold and have made the switch from my previous razor (Mach 3).  It does the job better with a smoother shave with less pulling than before.  Shaving isn&#x27;t something we enjoy doing but this blade makes it easier to get it done and get on with your day looking great.</li>
            <li> As a special promotion, I received the new Gillette Proglide from Gillette, and its thin blades and powerized handle has been great on my sensitive skin.  I have been using an electric razor but I have recently switched to the Proglide and it has given me a closer shave without the irritation and the powerized handle gives me the same feel from the electric razor and I think it help cut down on the irritation.  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> When I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle free through a program Gillette was running I really wasn&#x27;t expecting the handle to make a difference. I was proven wrong, the power handle was nice! I especially appreciated the grips Gillette added. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the handle slipping out of my hands, especially when I&#x27;m in the shower and my hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I have been using my [[ASIN:B00AFCPAAS Gillette Mach3 Sensitive Power 1 Razor 1 Cartridge 1 Battery]] razor and didn&#x27;t expect to be switching any time soon. I will from now on be using the larger handle of the Gillette Fusion ProGline Power handle.</li>
            <li> I like the design, it has a rubber gripping for a nice feel and the handle goes from skinny to fat so its more of a natural grip with makes for smoother shaving, less slips and quicker more percise shaving. I love this razor and handle and the power buttom makes a huge difference i didnt think it would but it does. If i had to buy a new one i would but i believe this design will last forever or until gillette finds a way to improve it which will be hard to do. I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> I love this razor and its really easy shave.  The handle however is very slick when wet or you have shaving cream on your hand.  I would buy the razor again but will keep this in mind.  I will keep using the razor and see if the handle slickness improves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was provided the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle through a program ran by Gillette to try out the entire kit which included a razor, the handle and the included battery.  Overall I would have to say that the vibrating razor might be a little too much for the every day user.  The vibrations annoyed me more than anything and I had to turn it off halfway through my shave.  I would say if it is a gimmick to sell a new product then I would say that it works but the overall effect was not what I expected.  The only positive I can see from this product is the larger handle which helps with grip and handling.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin, a thick beard, and hair that grows in multiple directions. I shave every day, and have tried everything to make it more comfortable.  I signed up to try the power proglide for free, and since switching, I have noticed a HUGE difference.  I have no idea how vibrating makes a difference, but it does!  Somehow the powered razor seems like its covering more surface area, making each pass more meaningful, which means less irritation.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3 for years but I received the Fusion Proglide Power Blade free of charge through a program run by Gillette. This blade provides the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. The blades were so gentle on my skin that I used them to teach my thirteen year old son how to shave. It worked well for him too. Gillette may have gained a new, young customer. I&#x27;m not sure that the micropulses lead to a better shaving experience but the handle is easy to grip &amp; comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> i recently received some Gillette razors through a Gillette program and i must say im a big fan.  ive used Gillette in the past and had no idea the difference one little battery could make.  if you haven&#x27;t tried it, i recommend you do very soon! i havent heard so many comments about how my shave looks smoother or how its lasting longer (due to closer shave)  i&#x27;m definitely a fan.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor from Gillette and enjoy it. At first I thought that the vibrating handle was just a gimmick, if it is I think it works. The handle is made with quality and should only be a once every year investment. I seem to get a very close shave and with little/no cuts.  I plan on using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Fits really well in the hand.  The battery is safely sealed from water, so you don&#x27;t have to worry when using it in the shower.  Used it a few times, and I like it:  makes for a smooth shave, and doesn&#x27;t tug @ my face when the hair gets too long.  The handle is easy to operate, which I dig.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me a very close shave. I received it from Gillette for free, and I was a little hesitant about the power feature. Even though I don&#x27;t think the power feature adds much to the razor, overall the razor provides a great shave, so I&#x27;m not taking off any stars.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free through a program run by Gillette. I waited to try it until I was set  to go to a wedding.&lt;br /&gt; I used it in the shower just using soap, the shave was the smoothes and easiest shave I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;First I used the razor without the power then I tried the power, I found I needed less pressure with the power.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is very comfortable. This razor has taken the chore out of shaving; I have not missed a day since I tried this ProGlide razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Gillette Fusion ProGlide for a few weeks now and these blades are everything they&#x27;re advertised to be. Clean, close shaves, without nicks and cuts, with a smooth, even feel are what these blades have delivered. As someone who shaves his head, as well as his beard, that&#x27;s important. I&#x27;ve tried numerous shavers/blades, but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide is one I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li> I received this razor courtesy of a program run by Gillette, and I am very pleased with this product. The handle has a good grip, even when wet. It doesn&#x27;t slip and makes for a good clean shave. I recommend to anyone looking for an affordable razor with a sturdy handle.</li>
            <li> You may ask what the point of the electric is. It creates a very smooth shave. The best part is that it comes with the AAA battery.</li>
            <li> I actually thought this Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle was a gimmicky idea but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. I received the handle free through a program from Gillette and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. After a week of use I was very impressed. The battery is easy to install and the power button is in the perfect spot, your thumb just seems to hit it without thinking about it. It has rubber grips that both make it comfortable to hold on to and easy to manuver. I used it both with the power turned on and off and the vibrations do give me a closer and more comfortable shave.I&#x27;m now a convert and will use the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle from now on.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor recently through a promotion by Gillette. This is a radical change from previous Gillette razors I&#x27;ve used and was a more comfortable razor to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new handle for the razor is very comfortable and fits in my hand well. The flexibility that it provides is very useful in terms of being able to get odd or uncomfortable areas when shaving, like parts of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One notable different is the various ergonomic grips running along the handle. While it fits comfortable in my hand, these felt slightly off. There didn&#x27;t seem to be a natural contour to it so that I could get it to fit right between my fingers. This might just be something with me but it made it odd to feel in my hand at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was pleased with how it made the shave go due to the changes and improvements they have made to their original handle.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Gillette. I really gave it a workout! I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a week and when this arrived I used it. No cuts, no burns. A nice clean shave. I really liked the LED light up power button. Overall this is the best razor ever!</li>
            <li> I received this razor free provided via a program run by Gillette. This razor is absolutely priceless! Ive always been a Gillette fan, but this razor is powerful &amp; extremely effective...I recommend this razor to all men... And women too!</li>
            <li> Was part of a market test sponsored by Gillette.  They sent me a Fusion Proglide Power cartridge to try out.  Blades cut extremely close.  Buzzing provided by the shaver massages the skin (get your mind out of the gutter ;)  Definitely not the silliness I was anticipating.  Overall, a good experience and worth a solid try.  I will definitely be getting more blades once these are done.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this for free as part of a program run by Gillette. Well, I come on here to review it and see that it only costs $9.99. I think that is a very fair price for the quality you get in this product. The grip is very good and allows you to maintain a firm grip while shaving. The battery powered aspect takes some getting used to, but also adds to the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> When I opened the the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle I was given via a program run by Gillette I immediately noticed is a bit bigger than the handle I was used to. Despite the larger profile, it was easy to hold even when wet. I&#x27;m not sure how much good the vibrating function does for a smoother shave or whether it&#x27;s just a gimmick, but it was a unique sensation when shaving. Overall, it feels like a quality product!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power from the manufacturer. I really like the classic black color. It provides the right amount of vibration during the shave to enhance the blade performance, but not so much that it makes it difficult to shave. The rubber grips are positioned well, so it is easily held in my hand while I shave. I wish the colors popped a little bit more (although really, no one but me ever sees it). All in all, I have found the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to be an excellent razor handle.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from a program run by Gillette.  The handle was very cool looking and comfortable to hold.  It was easy to handle.  However, comparing this to other similar products, there was only one speed setting on this handle.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor via a program run by Gillette to tryout.  After having tried out the product I want share the pros and cons related to the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor and its  blades.  Overall the razor is the best razor that I have ever used. The razor blades are excellent, high-quality razor blades that I would recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;* The trimmer provides a good shave with an easy to snap on razor blade that will not pop-off like other shaving blades due to an advanced locking mechanism. Which is great as unlike other razors the blade will not pop off when tapping it on the sink to clean out the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;* I have very thick stubble that dulls blades after one or two shaves.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power blades last me through a whole work week.&lt;br /&gt;* They have five + one sharp blades that are easy to clean via simply tapping them and the stubble falls out from between the blades unlike with other blades.&lt;br /&gt;* Also, the blades do not bend easily or get out of shape which makes them work better for longer.&lt;br /&gt;* They have a sixth blade on the top for shaving your neck, what an awesome feature!  This razor has by far given me the best shave of any blade.&lt;br /&gt;* The Power razor simply massages your face; though, I do not believe that it actually helps with cutting the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;* The razor feels great in your hand with its rubber grips and perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cons, I cannot think of any.</li>
            <li> I was provided a power handle as part of a promotion recently. If anything it did give my face and neck a massage. I did notice less irritation after shaving. If not for receiving from the promotion, I am not sure if I would have run out to buy it, but will continue to use it and even replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle has to be the best handle on the market. Its design is sleek and fits comfortably in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette was kind enough to send over this bad boy so I can try it out and spread the word. Well good news, the word is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest thing I have to mention is going in to this, I have always been very skeptical of the whole \\&quot;power vibration lifts the hair for an easier shave\\&quot;, well I don&#x27;t know if maybe I am still skeptical and don&#x27;t want to believe it as I am trying to justify why my shave left me smooth and in one swipe. My frame of mind is that the blades are sharper or at a better angle, or maybe it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as any scientist would do, I waited a few days and decided to turn off the power and shave. To my surprise, and probably even yours as you read this, it did provide a difference. It was minimal, but sill the vibrations did help with the shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was mind-blowing and because of that I have to say all in all, it&#x27;s been great and Gillette has made me a fan. They truly are \\&quot;The Best a Man Can Get\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor through a program run by Gillette. My grooming needs are minimal, having a short beard and doing no grooming below the neck, so I was skeptical if the Razor would provide any benefits over my current razor. After using the Razor for multiple cleanups, it is now my go-to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades themselves are great, but the vibrating handle made me a little skeptical if this was a gimmick-product. It turns out, the vibrations feel really great on your face regardless if they actually improve the shave. It was like a little neck message every morning. The handle is a little bigger than my Mach 3, and since I have big hands, it made it easier to grip. Improved grip was also noticed with the rubber material on the handle. This made it easier to shave in the shower. I had my Mach 3 handle for many years, and hopefully this lasts just as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor to anyone that is in need of the best shave of their life.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is wonderful.  The power handle fits very nice in my hand and does not slip or cause me to loose my grip.  The power button is perfectly positioned for easy activation. The vibration of the razor tickled a little bit but it worked very well.  It does have a lot of power and gives a very smooth shave. It was very easy to maneuver over the contours of my face.  overall a very nice razor and I plan on using it from now.</li>
            <li> Been using this razor for a week now and so far so good. I have been using a fusion power for years and think this one is equally good.</li>
            <li> Every time they create a new version, they make it a bit better. I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with another razor and it coming anywhere close to what ProGlide accomplishes. Hands down the only razor I will use.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gillette user for years and I must say this is my favorite razor. I have used both the manual and the power and I will say that the power doesn&#x27;t really make that much difference, though I do enjoy the vibration, I don&#x27;t think it helps the shave much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the razor is excellent, I have very sensitive skin and this coupled with the Fusion Proglide Extra Sensitive Gel means that my skin is not irritated, even when I shave against the grain. I will admit that I don&#x27;t grow super thick facial hair, and that may be a factor for some people, but if you have normal facial hair growth, and sensitive skin, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor is a great razor.  I has 5 blades that cut pretty close and is very smooth, however, I did use shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any irritation at, which was good.  Also, the blade did not shake a lot which was a plus, because I was concerned being so close to my face that I would knick it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little on the high end of the price spectrum, but I received it for FREE via a program by Gillette, so no complaints here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good razor and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used Gilette razors for years, but a few months ago I tried a competing brand with similar features. When Gilette sent me a free Fusion Proglide Power Razor to try, I realized what I was missing. With the Gilette I am not getting the razor burn that I was with the competing product. The handle is smaller and lighter and easier to manipulate while shaving. I really like the power feature in the handle. It is easy to think that a razor is a razor, but there really are differences. My shave is much smoother and faster in the morning, and I am delighted to be back with Gilette!</li>
            <li> I used this razor, which I got for free from a Gillette program, and the shave it gave me was very smooth.  The trimmer on the other end of the handle was great for my sideburns, or if I wanted to go for a \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; look and not the smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle and Razor from a program they were running, and couldn&#x27;t wait to open the package. I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors and handles for years, but I&#x27;ve also yet to upgrade in all those years. It&#x27;s official. I&#x27;ve upgraded, and I&#x27;m not going back. No more Mach 3 for me. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power gives me an incredibly close shave that lasts longer than any of my other shavers. It was incredibly comfortable to use and the blades glide effortlessly over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the vibrations were going to be a gimmick, but gimmick or not, my shave was closer. It also made shaving ore enjoyable. I felt far less worried about cutting my face since I always shave in the shower without a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor for anyone who wants that baby&#x27;s but smooth shave. Your partner will certainly appreciate it!!</li>
            <li> I shave my head, but I have a beard.  Yes, I&#x27;m one of *those* guys....so I need a serious but versatile razor.  I thought the whole \\&quot;power handle\\&quot; thing was silly, but I saw Gillette would let me try one free (and who doesn&#x27;t love free, razors ain&#x27;t cheap!) so I figured \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  And I&#x27;m glad I did.  The best thing, to me, about the power handle is the vibrations keep me from having to press so hard to get my head as smooth as I want it.  I have a tendency to dig in a little too much because I want my shave as smooth as possible, and with other razors I end up with some scrapes here and there.  But not with the power handle!  I let it glide smoothly over my scalp with just a little pressure and the handle does the rest.  The weight feels good in my hands too, not like some new rinky-dink disposable....you can feel this thing means business.  And that&#x27;s exactly what I need, a razor that means business.</li>
            <li> tried it first with the power on the razor seemed to pull. then tried it with the power off and it worked well. handle had a nice feel but was slightly heavy</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the ProGlide Power Razor through a promotional campaign by Gillette. It provides a smooth, close shave just like other razors of its class. I recommend it for people looking for a great razor at a good price point.</li>
            <li> I received my proglide handle free from a program run by gillette.&lt;br /&gt; I wasn&#x27;t sure the vibrating would make a difference So I tried it both ways. I tried it without the vibration then I tried with the vibration. I was pleasantly surprised the vibration made a huge difference. Even in the tight places. I noticed the places I normally have to hit two or more times to get a close shave only took one swipe. I highly recommend anyone who has to shave everyday as I do for work to give it a try. I have noticed less irritation since I have to hit the same spots multiple times.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free to try from a program run by Gillette. I was a little hesitant at first because I have very sensitive skin. Before the first time I used it I had around a 5 day growth going due to my playoff beard, but having to conduct interviews at work I thought it best to be clean shaven. I would usually use a trimmer to take off most of the hair before I shave if it has been this long between shaves but thought I would give it a shot without trimming it first due to the note on the package that the razor was good on sensitive skin. I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power both with the power off and with the power on and with the power on the shave was noticeably better. The handle felt extremely comfortable, and the blades were a breeze to change. I thought that with the extra hair there would be some tugging and pulling, but there was none. I was able to go against the grain pain free and it was probably the closest shave that I have ever had. My wife enjoyed the shave it gave so much that the biggest problem I have with it is keeping it away from her as she tries to steal it for herself.</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me a free sample of this razor and I was pleasantly surprised.  I had tried power razors in the past and I did not have my hopes up too high.  I get to work from home occasionally so sometimes I can get lazy about shaving.  After I go a couple days without, I can usually look forward to a less than comfortable shave with some pulling and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this razor in just such an instance and it felt like any normal smooth shave as if I was just removing some daily stubble.  The pulses were smoother and made the shave more comfortable.  The handle was nice and comfortable and help the blades move smoothly over without having to grip too hard for precision.  Glad I got the razor and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I have to say I received this razor as part of  a Gillette program to try a new razor, but I was very glad I did. It is a great razor.  The thinner, finer blades give a close shave, so much better than my last razor. The shave is close without any tugging or pulling of the skin. The power handle makes it easier to  maneuver around those hard to reach areas under the chin and nose. And it can  be used in the shower. It is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Norelco electric razor user(still have one. and 850 that works, and before that a Remington Microscreen user. ) I&#x27;ve been cursed with fast growing beard that grows in many textures and directions. Blade shaving always gave me razor burn when it was done close enough. I gave up on having a close shave and stuck with a shave that didn&#x27;t hurt my face. Then came the Fusion and then Fusion Pro which , hands down was better than any shave I&#x27;d ever had. I like the extra blade feature and combined with some decent shaving gel. In short  I was sold. Recently I&#x27;d received a Fusion Pro Power in a program run by Gillette and was asked to try it and my expectations were it would not do me any better than the Fusion Pro I used . I was WRONG again. The vibrating action makes this shave even more effortless smooth I just glide the blade with or offset to the directions of my crazy beard and the smoothest shave with nearly never a nick and never razor burn. I have used cheap shave gel all the way to Shaving specityly stores shave cream and get an equally good shave. This razor blade lasts me a full week of daily shaves without fail . I&#x27;v gone on to refills and the battery shows no signs of giving out. Not sure how many shaves it&#x27;s good for but a AAA Duracel is holding steady. This blade system has completely redefined the art of shaving and is the only reason why I&#x27;m not an electric razor user anymore.</li>
            <li> One of the best shaves I ever had.  Received my free razor from Gillette several weeks ago and it still shaves great.  Its easy to hold and maneuver.  At first I thought the handle looked to be a little bulky and going to an issue.  But the handle was great.  Did not slip and was easy to move around, even with my big meat hooks of hands.  I would recommend this razor and I will be buying refills today.</li>
            <li> I received this razor through a program run by Gillette. I have used it for several weeks and find the shave the best that I have ever gotten. Its close, non-abrasion shave is best that I have had in 27 years of shaving. Gillette has outdone themselves again!</li>
            <li> The razor is amazing! It allows for a clean shave without the crazy price. I&#x27;m pretty particular since I shave my face and head. With that being said I need a nice close shave without razor rash. I love Gillette as this razor created the perfect shave and no rash!</li>
            <li> I was provided this product for free through a program run by Gillette, and I must say that it has not disappointed me at all. The vibrating razor flows very smoothly across your skin and although it may not feel as though you are shaving, the results are definitely noticeable. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to receive a free Fusion Proglide Power Razor to try out.  Before that, I had been using some form of the Mach-3 for over ten years.  It was a dependable razor and I always thought powered razors where just gimmicks.  This razor proved me wrong, and I wished I would have realized it long before.  It provided an effortless shave and left no irritation that I would usually get from the collars of my shirts after a fresh shave.  I was worried at first trimming around my beard because of the cartridge size, but it was exact and easy.  I have been using this razor for a little over three weeks now (3-4 shaves a week) and the blade is just as good as when I opened it.  Looking forward to a nice relationship with the Fusion Proglide Power Razor and saying goodbye to the Mach-3 Turbo.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for the better part of 15 years now, and I have to admit that I had tried just about all razors out there including other Gillette products like the Mach 3 and electric razors, but none have compared to the Fusion ProGlide Power Razor! Even without shaving for 2 weeks I was able to shave quickly with a few strokes and my face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind. I love how there is no irritation and the vibration really stimulates the whiskers to make for one smooth shaving experience! Oh and for full disclosure I did receive this for free through a Gillette Fusion progam, which may attribute to my excitement because who doesn&#x27;t like free things right? But seriously, Go try it!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I hate dropping my razor in the sink or having it slip in my wet hand while I&#x27;m shaving!  I can say that never happened with this one.  The grip felt good in my hand, didn&#x27;t slide around on me and moved everywhere I needed it to!  Gillette sent this to me to try and after my wife tried it, we&#x27;re going to have to get her one too.  If you&#x27;re debating on whether or not to try it, I can say I had reservations as well.  I&#x27;m glad I got to use this one!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was surprised with how much I liked this.  Back in the day I had one of the original vibrating razors and it was a bit odd to use, so I was skeptical - but the new blade configuration works great with the vibration.  Fortunately, Gillette did a promo and I got to try this for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing with this is that it&#x27;s a regular razor till you turn it on, so you can get a nice close shave.  I find when I go a couple of days without shaving, the vibration helps me get a closer one - and it&#x27;s really comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem: the battery is tricky to put it, so be sure to look at the little slip that comes with the handle or you&#x27;ll be perplexed like  I was!  Just remember to pull and twist!</li>
            <li> For starters, I do need to mention that the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle was provided to me free through a Gillette campaign.  However, that little fact has nothing to do with just how well this razor works and the good things I have to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being of mostly Italian and German descent, I could stand to shave twice a day.  I don&#x27;t...  I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have a boss that doesn&#x27;t say a word when I don&#x27;t shave for a few days at a time.  I&#x27;ve always hated shaving.  The time it takes, the process, the razor burn, etc.  I&#x27;ve used all sort of razors over the years, never really finding one that stood above the rest.  Until now.  As this review is essentially about the Power Handle itself, not the blades, I want to elaborate on why it&#x27;s been such a treat to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this is an incredibly comfortable, easy to grip handle.  It gets wet, it doesn&#x27;t get slick.  It&#x27;s very well balanced.  I can grasp it between my thumb and a finger and feel like I have the ultimate control for those sensitive areas.  Now for years I&#x27;ve been seeing these newfangled battery operated razors.  \\&quot;What&#x27;s a little vibration going to do,\\&quot; I&#x27;ve said to myself.  Who would&#x27;ve thought, but that little vibration helps this razor cut through my rather coarse facial hair like the proverbial hot knife through butter.  As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t shave every day.  I&#x27;ve gone for a week at a time not shaving, where in the past I would&#x27;ve dreaded getting around to the irritation I knew my old razors would cause while trying to get through that growth.  Not this one.  No way.  There&#x27;s something about those little pulses that make it such a pleasure to shave.  It&#x27;s faster, it&#x27;s smoother, it&#x27;s just plain better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you&#x27;ve heard the hype, go experience it for yourself.  Don&#x27;t question the fact that this handle might not be the cheapest on the market.  This is a true case of a product living up to the hype and being worth every single cent.</li>
            <li> I shave every day, both my face and head and insist on an extremely close shave.I am very impressed with how close the shave is and how smooth it is. The Gillette ProGlide Power is by far the best razor I have used to date and will recommend it to all my friends. Definite two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I loved my old Gillette Fusion and have been loyal to it for years. I was offered the oppurtunity to try this new one for free through a program run by Gillette. I love this one just as much as my old one and will continue to buy refills for it. The new larger handle with grip is nice and I still get that close, clean, razor burn free shave. My wife likes it too! I already warned her I better not catch her using it on her legs - its mine! All mine!</li>
            <li> I really like these battery operated razors.  Small, light, powerful, and easy to use.  The comb straightens hairs out before the blades cut.  The precision trimmer is a nice feature if you have some facial hair you want to keep.  Gives a nice, clean, smooth shave.  I would give more stars if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, and the refills...forget it.  You&#x27;ll end up spending more than you would if you just bought a decent electric razor.  I&#x27;m glad I got to try this for free as part of a program by Gillette, I don&#x27;t think I would have purchased this without a significant coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this razor the tough test, plowing through coarse, three day growth.  It was up to the task.  Very few nicks, nice lines around my goatee with the precision trimmer.  It was a quick, painless shave.  But not so much better to make it worth the extra money.  Drop the price on these razors and you will sell more, Gillette.</li>
            <li> Got the free razor from Gillette and first impression was good on looks.  Putting the battery in was easy and felt light a tight fit when I put the cover back on.  Shaving with the vibration is different and that&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to it.  It did seem to shave a little better than my current razor.  Has a heavier handle once the battery is inside.  I like the blue power light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Gillette user, and i received this for free from gillette a trial program, and i must say that this razor is outstanding.  I still have one of the older model battery razors, and they have come along way.  first think i noticed when turning on the new razor, is it has a higher frequency vibration than the old one, which is definitely a plus.  I&#x27;ve used the same blade for 5 shaves now, and it still is cutting great.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This razor is typical Gillette quality. Many of the features of this razor are slight refinements of previous designs. The main benefit, as with the manual pro glide, comes from the 5 blades, which are well supported in an improved suspension system. I found that the design of the cartridge made it easy to rinse while shaving. The cartridges also last quite a while; though I&#x27;ve only used mine a couple weeks, I believe the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that a cartridge could last a month or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I found the powered handle to be something of an novelty, it does seem to help with the \\&quot;micro-comb\\&quot; to orient hairs properly as they enter the blade. As far as I know, the micro-comb is the only thing that is different between the power and manual blades, which makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is positive and tacky. It holds blades securely and releases them easy. No complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a fine razor package, and the powered handle does offer some marginal improvement over the manual version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a free razor to test from a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle for free via a program run by Gillette, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  The handle vibrates when you press the button, and it doesn&#x27;t slip due to the grippy design.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, give it a shot - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I was shaving every day, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, very smooth and nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However most of the time I only shave every 2-3 days and this was a rough shave. I felt like it kept getting stuck and pulling too much. I didn&#x27;t see and nicks or cuts, but it was not a pleasant shave. I think it might have to do with the number of blades or the space between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is also really large and wouldn&#x27;t fit in my shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my Mach 3 Power for normal usage.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle razor.  At first I was skeptical about a vibrating razor.  But after using it, I don&#x27;t know if the vibrating helped the shave but it couldn&#x27;t have hurt.  It was a strange feeling on my skin but it was a close smooth shave.  I hope that the razor has a long life span because it&#x27;s a joy to shave with.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the vibrating \\&quot;Power\\&quot; that leads to a closer shave. But it truly gets great results. Very smooth - no nicks. Love the new design of this razor and I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Hi Guys and Gals,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I received this free from gillette to try controlling my facial hair and you know what it works! But the real question is how well does it work? Answer: Pretty darn well. I&#x27;ve used a few different razors including all the past versions of the Proglide and it provides one of the best close shaves I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s smooth and the gel strip built into the blade really does help. I just wish I could say that this version was leaps and bounds better than the previous ones. Most people wont be able to notice a difference between this and any of the previous incarnations of the Proglide line. Does this mean you shouldn&#x27;t pick it up when you need a new razor? No, it just means you should wait until you nned a new razor or until you see it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s provides a good clean shave and does everything you&#x27;d want from a razor, it just isn&#x27;t a noticeable improvement over any of the previous versions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the Gillette Mach3 razor. I received the a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor via a program run by Gillette. I found that it performed as well as the Mach3 but not noticeably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a battery powered vibrating action activated by a power button. I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose is since I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with it on or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the Fusion ProGlide Power is more expensive than the Mach3 and I don&#x27;t see any major difference in the final result, I will stick with the Mach3.</li>
            <li> I used to always use the Gillette disposable razors, so when I got a sample of the \\&quot;fusion proglide power razor\\&quot; I was excited to try it. I must say the difference is totally noticeable. I start getting a stubble almost after couple of hours of shaving. This one gives me such a smooth shave that I can keep stubble at bay for at least a day. Absolutely no nicks and cuts, glides like silk on my face. I don&#x27;t need to apply any after shave lotions too since this worked out great for my sensitive skin. Its a bit on the expensive side, but with all the coupons that gillette gives, I think I will stick to using this one in the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors over the years, but I keep going back to my Panasonic shaver. But thanks to a program run by Gillette, I had a chance to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for free. So, since it had power (like an electric shaver), I thought this might be a nice middle ground - and it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrations in handle won&#x27;t overpower you - it is just right and does give the sense of having an electric shaver in your hand. The handle is easy to grip when wet thanks to the ridges on both side, and the blade cartridge pops on and off with the snap of a release button. Plus, the slightly larger size of the base of the handle adds a little weight, which is nice. This helps balance your hand as you carefully glide over your stubble with the sharp cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED power button may be a little too bright for me in the morning (no bright lights, please), but it isn&#x27;t loud like my shaver, so no worries of waking the house accidentally with the buzz-saw sound of my shaver. The power does add something unique to the shaving experience, I can&#x27;t exactly describe it, but it just adds something to the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Gillette Fusion ProGlide because it gets me a closer shave than my electric razor. But personally I am always running late so I know I will be falling back on my shaver . But if you don&#x27;t mind the very bright power button, this would be well worth a try for a regular razor user.</li>
            <li> Through a promotion with Gillette I received a free Fusion pro-glide power handle razor. I have to say I really liked the razor it provided a very close shave and I really enjoyed this razor.  The larger handle made for easy shaving and I usually drop my razor&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t had that issue with this razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette ProGlide Power Handle and one razor cartridge as a promotion from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is similar to others, but has a few new features. With a slightly larger handle it has a nice feel in your hand. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower but it certainly is a convenient feature. With an auto shutoff feature it will turn off the razor if it is accidentally left on or turned on. The vibration from the handle definitely helps to reduce the drag or pull on the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge is a definite improvement. Not sure if it is the micro comb, the thinner blades or the suspension system, but it really delivered a great shave. I will need to see if the cartridge lasts a whole month as it is stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great buy, especially for those that have sensitive skin and get razor burn easily like I generally do.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to review. I must tell you that this is by far the best razor on the market. The design is perfect! The only complaint that I could possibly come up with is that the shave is so close I actually got a pretty nasty ingrown hair. A small price to pay for a great shave. Like most men I hate shaving and I do it as little as possible. This razor has actually added another day between shaves for me. Awesome. The handle fits perfectly in my hand allowing more control and a better shave. Thank you a great product.</li>
            <li> I like the razor.  it feels like i got a better shave and the vibration definitely helps when cleaning the blade.</li>
            <li> I was provided this gilette razor through a promotion, and I could not be more pleased with it. This is a solid razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Schick Quattro user, and have been for a lot of years, but Gillette sent me a free Fusion ProGlide Power through a promotional program, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving needs might be a bit different from most guys in that I have a beard, but I shave my head. The head shaving is what has kept me a Quattro user for so many years, as the Quattro has protective wires that keep me from inadvertently scalping myself. The Gillette razor has no such wires, but I&#x27;m a daring guy, so I gave it a shot, and was very impressed. I&#x27;d been lazy about shaving my head, so I had about ten days of growth going on.  Normally, I would have to use a set of electric clippers before shaving this much growth, but the Gillette blades are pretty open, so I skipped straight to shaving. I got a great shave and the blades didn&#x27;t clog at all. Having attempted this and failing miserably with the Quattro, I was amazed that the blades rinsed clean without any real effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance on my neck was also impressive. I normally shave my neck with a Braun electric due to issues with razor burn, but I didn&#x27;t experience any razor burn with the Fusion ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the powered handle make a difference? For me, the answer was yes. Gillette had previously sent me a standard Fusion ProGlide handle to sample and I was not impressed. With the non-powered version, I had to go over a lot of areas multiple times to get a smooth shave, which created irritation. The power handle provided a much better shave for me without having to repeatedly drag blades across the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, the features of this handle and blade combo provided me with a great shave. Oh, and if you&#x27;re wondering whether I missed the protective wires of the Quattro, that&#x27;s an affirmative.  I expect the scab behind my ear to be gone any day now, with minimal scarring.</li>
            <li> First I have to say that I received this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette.  The package arrived with the razor, a nice holder, and one blade cartridge.  My first impression was &#x27;I wonder why this thing takes batteries&#x27;.  The razor handle itself felt very sturdy, much more so than other reusable razor handles I&#x27;ve tried. I looked forward to giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also say that I generally use an electric razor during the week, and then use a traditional razor on Sundays after I&#x27;ve skipped shaving all weekend.  The electric razor doesn&#x27;t handle the few days of growth.  So my first try of the Gillete ProGlide was on ~3 days worth of beard.  Wow was I impressed!  With the typical disposable or cartridge razors I always have problems with them getting clogged.  The ProGlide handled this quite well, I presume the vibration helps the blades stay clear.  The vibration also seems to help the blades move much more smoothly through the hairs with less pressure.  I was very impressed with this razor!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor for three weeks now and have been pleasantly surprised by the results. To give some background, I have a tough, thick beard that grows back fairly quickly. I work in an industry where it is important to maintain a clean-cut look. I have found that electric razors have not been able to provide a close enough shave for me and have been using the Gillette Mach3 for the past several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had sampled the Gillette Fusion Power when it first released and was extremely dissatisfied with the experience, so I returned to my Mach3. I found that the lubricated strip wore out after the first use, the micropulses from the battery were weak and ineffective, and water leaked into the battery compartment causing damage to the product. As a result, I had very low expectations from the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle and cartridge through a program sponsored by Gillette. It appears that most of the negative issues that I had encountered on the Gillette Fusion Power have been addressed. I didn&#x27;t expect that there could be any noticeable improvement to my shaves with 5 blade technology, battery powered micropulses, and a lubristrip but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor delivered the smoothest shave I have ever had - not only on the first use but also after repeated uses. I could really feel the battery powered micropulses in conjuction with the microcomb lift the hairs up and guide them in a uniform direction for a closer cut. The lubristrip allowed for smooth strokes and as a result, the razor was gliding effortlessly. The mineral oil from the lubristrips also left my skin feeling soft and irritation-free. The power of 5 blades meant that I did not have to repeat my strokes. With all these efficiencies, there is literally no friction (ie. no tugging and pulling) or discomfort. The razor glides effortlesslyand also provides a very close shave - which is exactly what I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomic design of the handle made it easy to grip but because of the large size of the 5-blade cartridge, I still found the product difficult to maneuver around the tight spots around the sideburns and below the nose. The product advertises a precision trimmer, which is supposed to help with these areas, but I&#x27;m not sure it completely addresses the problem with maneuvering such a large cartridge. I have noticed that I have been becoming more adept with repeated use, so perhaps it is an acquired skill but it is definitely a noticeable different handle in comparison to the Mach3. The handle also has an automatic shutoff feature if the battery power is left on after 8 minutes. I did not use this feature, but think it is a good safeguard in case someone does accidently leave the power on. When I had used the Gillette Fusion Power, I had noticed damage to the battery compartment due to water leakage. Fortunately, they have addressed that issue in this product. When I opened up the handle, there were no traces of water having leaked into the battery compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the razor under multiple conditions over the past three weeks: 1 day shave, 3 day shave, and 1 week shave. In each situation, the result was a smooth, close shave. With the 1 day shave, where I had limited hair regrowth, I did experience a few nicks below the nose but because of the mineral oil from the lubristrip, I could not even notice the cuts. Normally on the 3 day shave, I have significant regrowth by the end of the 2nd day but because of the closer shave from the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I didn&#x27;t notice the same level of regrowth until the middle of the 3rd day! The product was also able to handle a 1 week shave with the same level of effortlessness. Normally, with my Mach3, the hairs would get stuck inside the blades and I have to make repeat strokes over the same areas, but with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I was able to still complete the shave in single, deep strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the lubristrip has started to wear out and appear white after 4 shaves, which means that I would expect that I would have to replace cartridges after ever 2-3 weeks of regular use (ie. shaving every 3 days). If you continue to use the cartridge after the lubristrip has worn out, you will lose some of the benefits of the product&#x27;s smooth shave. Given the high prices of the replacement cartridges, this could prove to be the factor that deters me from becoming a convert. I would really like the cartridge to last at least month and am disappointed that it has shown signs of wear after only limited use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rate the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle 5 stars, because it really does fulfill what it is advertised to do and offers the closest shave a man can get, primarily because of the battery powered micropulses, flexibility, and ergonomic design. Any difficulties maneuvering around the tight spots can be corrected with practice. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge, however, has its drawback and I would only give it 2 stars because of how quickly the lubristrip wears out. The 5-blades and microcomb allow for a smooth shave and remain resilient after repeated uses, but because the lubristrip wears out, the cartridge needs to be trashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably keep the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle and use it with my Mach3 cartridges (they seem to fit) and only use the more expensive Fusion ProGlide cartridges on special occasions when I need a particularly close shave.</li>
            <li> A caregiver shaves my husband and she asked for a Gillette Fusion razor.  I bought this one without paying much attention.  When it arrived, it took the two of us a little time to figure what the battery was for (DUH!!!)  When we realized it was for the trimmer blade she was delighted.  Now she can trim his sideburns, his neck in the back, and even the edges of his ears (who knew he had hair on his ears!!!! Oh the joys of getting older)  She says it works GREAT!!!  I belive her.</li>
            <li> What a nice razor! I am really enjoying using the new razor by Gillette. Precise and sharp, you cannot find anything better around.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a power razor before but the shave with this razor was the first time in my life that I felt no skin irritation or nicks at all. Highly recommend and worth the money.</li>
            <li> My first shave with this razor was excellent.  I had a three day beard growing (waiting of shaver to arrive), and after I used it my wife said that my face was like a babies bottom (I assume that was a good thing).  The longer hairs on the first shave pulled a little, but compared to other razors was non-existent.  I have tried a lot of shavers both electric and blade and this one is by far the best at the onset.  I will update this review after I have used it more as to blade/battery life, but so far it is great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the 2nd time. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I have this for 4 months and its still going. Shaves pretty clean. I haven&#x27;t got cut by it once. Love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> works well, good price</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been happy with my shave quality for several years. I went from using an electric to disposables. Disposable razors are less expensive than cartridge systems, but I never realized they aren&#x27;t as good quality. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different brands and always tended towards the more expensive of the disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started by reading a few articles online from serious shaving experts. They all recommend a safety razor - but you have to be very careful and it takes much longer. What I noticed was that almost all of them said they use the Gillette Fusion when they travel. Other sites explained that there is a difference between the quality of blades used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I gave it a try and was I ever surprised! It really was noticeably smoother than the shave I was getting with regular disposables. My girlfriend loved it. And although I thought the vibrating handle was a gimmick and either wouldn&#x27;t help or might actually increase the likelihood of being cut, it turned out I was completely wrong! It really does help get a closer shave. I&#x27;ve tried with the vibration switch off and on - and on makes a big difference. I&#x27;m really glad I made this change!</li>
            <li> Great razor. Cleans my face very easily and keep the shave time down to 2 days or so. My facial hair grows kind of quick I would say and this gets nice and low for a shave that lasts about 2 days.</li>
            <li> I could never get a close shave with an electric razor - always a little stubble (or the 5:00 shadow appeared at 11am). However, since I found the Fusion Power razor, I feel that I have the best of both worlds. And the ProGlide blades provide a super smooth and very close shave. My face feels softer (according to my wife). The vibration really allows a very close and very nick-free shave. Thanks to this razor and these blades - no more 5:00 shadow either.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very close shave. Refills are expensive.  BzzAgent. com sent me one to try.  If you haven&#x27;t tried them yet, it&#x27;s a must have for a great shave.</li>
            <li> The most comfortable shave I have ever had.  I thought it was a giant gimic and waited until I saw a great deal on this product to try it.  Now, I won&#x27;t use another razor.  By far the most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I received this free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.  The power handle is AWESOME.  It has a great feel, size, and is comfortable in my hand.  I feel that it really helped me get a close shave.  I hope Gillette uses this handle again and creates a 5 blade version of this razor.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I received the proglide power razor free from a Gillette sponsored promotion. I really like the handle there is weight to it without feeling bulky or awkward in my hand. This is a really well made razor, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the handle on this razor.  I was concerned that the power razor might be hard to hold steady but that is not the case.  It is very light and easy to hold and use!</li>
            <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle via a program run by Gillette, I was surprised how perfectly it fit in my hand, how easy it was to use at any angle, how the vibration provided a closer, more comfortable shave and even that it lit up.  Great blades, great razor!</li>
            <li> I got this free in a program run by Gillette.  My face is very smooth after using it.  It is easy to use and keeps my face smooth for longer than my previous razor.  I really like it.  I also like that the handle has a nice feel to it- it has a little more weight and sturdiness.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little apprehensive about using a razor that vibrates. But since I&#x27;ve always liked Gillette products and they gave to me to try for free I thought if give it a whirl. The experience was better then I thought it would be. I ended up with a close,smooth, irritation free shave. I&#x27;m not sure how much the power handle helped but it deffenetly didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor as a part of a program ran by Gillette. The handle is superb and it it is easy to hold even when it is wet (like in the shower). It is a solid feel. It is a bit heavy but that is obviously because of the battery. If you don&#x27;t like the weight, you can always take out the battery and use the razor without the power. It is a great razor handle and probably the best and most comfortable of any razor handle that I have ever used. It is very durable so I don&#x27;t see having to replace it any time soon. The power function is very neat and it seems to have a better shave with it on than with it off.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this product and the new larger handle. I also like the gentle microvibrations and feel like they lead to a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package and holding it in my hand, I felt like I was holding an old friend. The handle was quite comfy. I was a little nervous when I hit the power button, but upon shaving I could actually feel the hair on my face standing up, ready to be shaved. I had a little drag where my facial hair was thick but I haven&#x27;t gotten any razor burn. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is my second experience with a powered razor which I received via a program run by Gillette. The first was the Fusion Proglide Styler, but this turned out to be a better size option for everyday shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First The packaging. This was hands down the easiest razor product I have ever opened. One pull on the tab and it was instant access to the razor. No need for scissors, knifes, etc. Best product packaging yet for a razor handle. The battery falls out when you open the package, so make sure not to loose it in the excitement. Inserting the battery into the compartment on the handle was a breeze although slightly awkward (this is not a simple circle like when screwing in a light bulb, but a slightly awkward battery compartment). Nonetheless, anyone who is minimally handy will figure it out in less then 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experience. Got in the shower and pushed the easy to find power button on the front of the razor. I was surprised when the power symbol lit up in a wonderful hue of blue light. It really made the razor handle look slick and like a product of exceptional quality. The handle immediately started to vibrate. Wonderful fresh feeling clean shave - with extremely close precision (I have always had a slight problem getting a really close shave, but this provided the closest - must be the vibration :). The other thing I love about this razor handle, is that if fits perfectly into my razor holder which is attached to my mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion this is a extremely nice looking handle and a top performer as a razor.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle that I was provided via a program run by Gillette was the best handle I have ever used. The grip design on the handle is outstanding and is very comfortable in my hand. I am recommending it to everyone. I also love the blue on button that glows when the vibration feature is on. Overall it is a very stylish handle for a mens razor.</li>
            <li> I have a crappy beard pattern so as a result, for years, I&#x27;ve been a daily shaver, since my hidden beard and a full beard look really bad. Getting a close and comfortable shave has always been a challenge to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I looked and looked for years and always felt that I had to settle. If it&#x27;s close it&#x27;s not all that comfortable and if comfortable not all that close. I also shave in the shower so trying to handle a razor is a challenge when water is pouring all over you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was invited to get a free razor of a new shaving technology offered via a program run by Gillette, I was ready to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I was completely impressed. The Micorpulses were amazing to the shaving experience. The bigger, more ergonomic side grips made my shower shaving experience a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was by far the easiest to handle razor and closest, most comfortable shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a new fan and dedicated user from now on.</li>
            <li> I got the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge from Gillette . I tried this morning super smooth shave, no nicks or cuts or anything. LOVE the vibration - it feels like I&#x27;m NOT shaving. No razor bumps. I couldn&#x27;t be happier .</li>
            <li> Alas the Proglide razor. 5 blades of smooth gliding bliss across your face. This razor is no joke. It does as it says. Combined with the power of an electric razor you get the smoothest shave ever. Although the handle seems a bit small it has a great grip so if your using in the shower you will have no problems holding the razor. ANother advantage to this razor is the carrier it comes with. Allows you to store a new pack of cartridges underneath for quick changing of an old one. As with any razor hair tends to get stuck between the blades but a quick rinse off cleans them pretty well. I usually just use a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is worth the price and especially the cost of the blades. you can buy a pack and they will last you quite a long time before needing to purchase replacements!! Thanx Gillette for the opportunity to test this great product. Keep up the great work!! I recommend this to anyone. Fusion razors are by far the best i have ever used.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle was comfortable no matter the angle that I shaved. It was easy to grip which resulted in a closer more comfortable shave. The vibrating feature didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference between this and non-powered multi-blade razors I have used, but with only using it once so far it could take more uses before I realize the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this razor from Gillette, and overall enjoyed the shaving experience.  It was smooth and resulted in less razor burn than other razors I had used and gave a nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m not sure how much of that was due to the handle.  The ergonomic side grips helped and provided good grip even when the handle got wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other aspect of the razor that Gillette promotes is the battery powered micropulses activated by pushing a button on the razor.  There is no need to worry, the handle can get wet and will still work fine but I wasn&#x27;t sure how much of a difference the micropulses made.  I tried during the same shave using the razor with the micropulses on and then off and did not feel a significant difference.  Perhaps with more trial I would notice a bigger difference, but I felt the difference in getting a smooth, close shave was in the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the handle is decent, but I think most would be fine without the micropulse feature of the handle.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. The powerhandle has a good grip but is a little noisy when you turn it on. It also gives you a really jumpy vibration in your hand when holding it which could be irritating.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent product, its design makes for a comfortable grip.  Would recommend this razor to anyone. I received the Gillette pro glide power razor handle as part of a promotion held Gillette. The power option provides a vibration that stimulates the hair before the blades cut it close to the skin. Excellent shave and excellent product.</li>
            <li> I was recently provided the Gillette Proglide razor thru a program from Gillette. One of the things that stood out was this razors handle. It was a little bigger than most razors and very ergonomic. I like to shave in the shower and it&#x27;s important to me that the handle doesn&#x27;t slip, well this one is a winner. Even wet there is no slippage and it feels so well balanced it made for a very pleasurable shaving experience. Overall this is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li> I got this handle (and fusion pro-glide razor) free through a program run by gillette. The handle is sturdy, and the vibration feature is awesome. I really feel like it helps the shave quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only problem I have is I tend to hit the power button while I&#x27;m shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta get used to it I guess.</li>
            <li> The razor blades worked well.  I have a beard and got a close, clean shave.  Because the blade cartridge is so mobile (flimsy), I had a hard time edging and trimming especially with the vibration.  I don&#x27;t really understand the need for the battery component when you still have to manually move the razor.  Was happy to try this free razor I received through a program by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle in the mail from Gillette I was excited to try it out, because it&#x27;s not normally something I would spend my money on. Despite the fact that the handle houses a AA battery it&#x27;s not overly bulky and fit well in my hand. The one gripe I had was that I would constantly accidentally hit the power button and turn it off mid shave. If Gillette products were cheaper, I&#x27;d definitely make the switch to using them.</li>
            <li> I received this razor for review via a program run by Gillette. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a good handle that my hand can wrap around. The grip makes it easy so not to slip when water and/or shaving cream drips. I found it easy to maneuver, but what I didn&#x27;t understand was the battery-operated that are supposed to make the shave even smoother. I tried it with it on and without and felt no difference - my shave was smooth either war. It&#x27;s early on in my shave process with this razor, but so far I really like it.  I am excited to see what this will do after a few more shaves.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the point of the vibrating handle.  It doesn&#x27;t improve the shave, if anything it made it more difficult as well as making my hand go numb.  I ended up turning it off and just using it as a regular razor</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power system us a clean smooth shave. The blades are awesome as they cut the hair real close and leave the skin smooth. I wish the moisture strip lasted longer. The handle has a nice feel and does not slip. The size is a little thick in my opinion. The vibration may cause the hair to lift a little more and it also helps agitate the face to stop irritation.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a complimentary Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor from Gillette.  Had I not received it, I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it due to the upfront cost; but now, I do plan on purchasing the refill blades.  I have been using store-brand generic six blade razors, and quite honestly, they don&#x27;t cut it.  Pardon the pun, but it&#x27;s true.  With the generics, I would always have to go over my face at least twice (even with a new blade) to ensure a nice, close shave.  If I skipped more than a day of shaving, forget it.  The generics would be pulling the hair instead of cutting it, and we all know how much that sucks.  With the Proglide Power Razor, it was like a hot knife trough butter.  For the first shave, I intentionally skipped a day to see how well it did, and was I impressed.  There was no tugging and pulling, just a nice smooth shave, after one pass.  What a novel idea!  After two weeks, it is starting to pull a little, but that is much more than I ever got out of a generic!  Although the refill blades are on the expensive side, I will also have to purchase less of them, as they last longer, and give a better shave than the generics anyway.  I do plan on continuing the use the Gillette Fusion Powerglide Razor, even after the first cartridge is done.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free through a program run by Gillette.  The handle was of good quality; its sturdy feeling complemented an ergonomic grip.  The \\&quot;Power\\&quot; part, however, seemed to be yet another example of over-hyped marketing.  I didn&#x27;t see any advantage to using the blade with the power on versus the power off.  Next time I&#x27;ll opt for something more basic.</li>
            <li> I got this product through a campaign run by Gillette. I was skeptical about using this product at first but now I really like it. The handle has a nice grip and its blades can handle nice and sensitive skin. The only thing is you cannot use this to full effect without its battery but its built that way so it&#x27;s understandable. It really reduces the burning and helps give a clean smooth look! I recommend you at least try it out.</li>
            <li> This new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle definitely makes all the difference in my shave.  The handle shape is easy to grip &amp; with the side grips, there&#x27;s no slipping or dropping while I&#x27;m trying to shave.  The micropulses are amazing, I don&#x27;t know how I ever shaved before using a standard razor.  They help lift all the hairs to get an even closer shave than ever before.  I was able to try this razor free through a program with Gillette, but this will be my new razor of choice.</li>
            <li> The GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE is also very comfortable and easy to hold with its non-slip ergonomic grip even when your hands are wet. In addition, if you choose, you can turn the handle on and it vibrates to aid in a smoother and less sensitive shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use an electric razor because of sensitivity, but the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER CARTRIDGE provided me with a smooth and long-lasting shave with minimal irritation. I Received the razor blade and handle free via Gillette as a test and has done very well for me. At this point, I can&#x27;t speak to the durability of the blades or the life of the blade.</li>
            <li> Woah....whoever came up with the concept of adding these vibrating actions to a razor is a genius. I received a free Power Razor from a test-program ran by Gillette and this has changed my shaving experience permanently. I used to shave with razors that I can feel every tug and pull as the hairs are being cut. Not entirely uncomfortable, but still made me cringe. The micropulses, as Gillette calls it, gives me a very smooth cut every time and the vibrating action actually \\&quot;lifts\\&quot; the hairs allowing me to cut as close to my skin as possible without injuring it. I have never had an experience like this before. I would never go back to my old razors; and, trust me, I&#x27;ve experimented with all kinds. This is simple the best. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This battery powered razor gave me the closest shave in years! It even works well in the shower! I was a bit skeptical at first, as I usually use disposable razors, but Gillette has won me over by offering me a free razor through a promotional program. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I received this free via a program run by Gillette. This razor is great. It&#x27;s easy to handle and isn&#x27;t awkward to hold. I never have a problem with it slipping out of my hand while shaving. Great product!</li>
            <li> I received the power handle free from Gillette, and quickly noticed the soothing effects of the Gillette Fusion PowerGlide Power handle on my face.  The slight vibration made for a comfortable and almost therapeutic shave on my easily irritated face.  The effects of the constant vibration on my hand is a different story.  The vibration quickly became annoying in my hand, almost to the point of becoming uncomfortable.  I used the vibrating feature for maybe half of my shave, then had to finish with it powered off.  The razor does fit quite comfortably in my hand, and the ergonomic grips allow for an effortless grasp on the shaver.</li>
            <li> I was recently sent a Gillette Fusion Proglide, from Gillette.  And the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razors are the best razors on the market.  They give you the best shave, with no nicks/cuts.  They contour to your face, and they last for a long time.  It&#x27;s great for different hair types, as well, I have blonde, light hair, but it work for dark/denser hair as well.  My wife bought one for my father a couple of years ago for Christmas, and he couldn&#x27;t believe how great it worked, and the Gillette Fusion is the only razor he uses now.  And, these razors are affordable, and easy to find at the stores.  You will go through several cheap disposable razors in length of time you use 1 of these razors.  And you won&#x27;t look like you had a bad encounter with a dull pair of scissors!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this razor thanks to Gillette.  The handle is superior to the razors I have used in the past.  I had been using Bic razors, including the Hybrid.  The handle on this razor is superior to the Bic razors I have used.  I&#x27;m not used to using powered razors, so it felt somewhat strange to feel the vibration as I shaved but it was a good shave.  I probably will buy refills for this razor.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle has really impressed me. I used to use a different razor for years and I really didn&#x27;t think of trying anything new. I decided to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide because of the vibrating handle which is a huge plus for me due to my sensitive skin and it really makes shaving feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across an opprtunity to get a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette. I am so glad I tried this razor. It feels very comfortable and smooth and has provided me with one of the best shaves I have experienced. I will switch to this razor because with its design and function, trimmer blades, and vibrating power handle, I&#x27;m hooked on this razor!!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor that I received for free from a program by Gillette. When I first took it out of the package, I noticed the nice grip on the handle. The handle and grip is comfortable, has a nice design and looks &amp; feels sturdy. Even when wet, there was a nice grip that prevented it from slipping, giving me better control. This is an improvement over my other razor handles as it does feel more ergonomic and easier to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is comfortable and easy on my skin. Because it takes fewer strokes and glides over my facial hair easily, I feel the process of shaving with this razor takes up less time than with my previous razors. And definitely, less sensitivity. I also noticed there was less tug and true to its claims, does glide easier over trouble spots like under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, a close shave w/ this razor lasts a couple of days before stubbles come out. I&#x27;m curious how long the blade will last before I need to replace it. But I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> As ad added bonus, I highly recommend the addition of the ProGlide Power Handle. While the Proglide Power Blades do very well on their own, the Power Handle does make the shaving experience that much smoother. It cuts down on the &#x27;pulling&#x27; of longer hairs and items that much closer on the day to day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power Handle is also a nice bonus for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend adding the Power Handle to the Power Blades for the BEST shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did receive a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette. That being said, I have purchased the razor both prior to and after using the free product. The above review applies to all of the above!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Lower Handle from Gillette, running a promotion. It&#x27;s very nice looking, holds the razor cartridge appropriately, and has a &amp;#34;nifty&amp;#34; vibration motor in it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a failed attempt at what could be really amazing technology. The problem, if you ask me, which you have, is that the handle is very light, and the vibration motor is centrally located, which means not only does the blade vibrate, but the whole handle does. The result is a numbing effect n the hand, so much so that I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get a safe grip on the handle. The blade didn&#x27;t feel like it was against my skin, and. I couldn&#x27;t feel the gratifying feeling of slicing through those coarse little hairs. In fact, by the time I was finished, I couldn&#x27;t feel anything at all. I have since used the handle without the vibration motor engaged, and I have to say...it&#x27;s great.take away 80% of its features and you have a great razor handle.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a program by Gillette. Overall I love this product. Am a Gillette user and love all their products. This on be too is sturdy and feels great in the hand. Yes its a little bulky but its no big deal considering the overall performance. I love that it indicates when the battery is low. The light feature is good too. I think I will be using this more often now.</li>
            <li> The handle is very well fit for your hand. With the smooth feel of the grips you think it can&#x27;t get any better, until you push the power button to release the power of a smooth shave from a battery that makes you think its a electric shaver. Cant believe that the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got the manual version a couple of month ago and was pretty satisfied. But with my thick black beard, &#x27;under the necks&#x27; hair is always a problem. So decided to try out the fusion with power blades - given to me for free by Gillette. I must say - I was pleasantly surprised. I was of the opinion that mechanized handles, such as the electronic toothbrushes, were for the lazy ones among us. But these Fusion power blades turned out to be more than just a mechanized gimmick of the same old same old.&lt;br /&gt;Some people have the tendency to get nicks/cuts, which I fortunately don&#x27;t. Still shaving can be inconvenient.  I thought these new blades were much easier to work with, and less inconvenient, to raze through my below the neck hair. The blades also worked well around the jaws, without hurting too much.&lt;br /&gt;I find the rear trimmer to be extremely useful as well. Especially for grooming those side-burns and around the stache (if you have one too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether I would go for a manual or power blades - Lets see...there is not much of a price difference. power is more convenient. So if you shelling out the money for manuals, just put in a few more bucks for the power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not mechanized handles are better than electric shavers? I don&#x27;t know. personally I haven&#x27;t used any expensive electric shavers and so its hard for me to compare.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor for several weeks after it was provided to me free from a Gillette run program. It is great for a close shave without irritation or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microcomb feature aligns your facial hair so that it cuts in the right direction, which is pretty cool. It&#x27;s got a lubrication strip similar to other razors to help with irritation. With a flick of the button it vibrates, which is also supposed to help with irritation. I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but it does indeed work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of the handle and find it fits well in my hand. The blades are thinner (and I think sharper) than others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been very happy with the shave and will soon be buying refills for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this is the best shave I have ever had in my entire life. Being in a professional atmosphere having a close shave is very important. I have tried various other 5 blade shavers and this tops them for various reasons. First The blades dont clog up with hair after shaving. Other shavers after using them once or twice they begin to fill with hair and makes shaving much more difficult. Also the blade is absolute perfect shave I receive zero razer burn or bumps after multiple days of use. Finally I have been using the same blade for 2 weeks and I am still receiving amazing shaves each and every day!</li>
            <li> Have been using the past two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I shave dry and these are much faster and much smoother than other razors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use in the shower, the grip is nice and I find myself not dropping it as much as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> I found this razor to give me a great smooth shave for my sensitive skin. Another benefit is that the blade will last you a long time. The only downfall is that the cost of the replacement blades are some what costly. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> When I got the Razor I wanted to compare it to the others I have used with the thought that it  could not be that much better but I had to try.  The first thing I notice is that it has a package that is easy to open... I hate struggling with plastic packages and this one did not make me fight to get it open.  Then I tried it.  This was the first Razor I have ever used that did not nick or cut me in one of the first two or three uses.  this amazed me as I had always nicked myself shaving, here was a solution to my problem.  Also this has given me the smoothest shave that I have ever had.  Gillette you have made the Fusion ProGlide my favorite razor and I can not imagine going back to my other brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to Gillette, but I had been using their old razor technology for some time (Mach 3).  But the opportunity presented itself to try their new Fusion Pro Glide Power and everything was better about it.  The blades are great and everything, but the best part for me was the feel of the razor itself in my hand.  It felt like I had more control over my shave, just because of the shape/weight of the handle.  It was obvious to me that Gillette spent a lot of time on the design of the razor.  I&#x27;ve retired my Mach 3, and now I&#x27;m only using this razor from now on!</li>
            <li> I had grown my facial hair out for three days.  The pro glide gave me a smooth shave without any nicks. I like the power feature as well.  Overall a good razor but it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> The razor with 4 blades and a vibrator is Ok but I &#x27;m not to impressed by the vibrator. I like to &amp;#34;hear&amp;#34; the razor as it runs across my beard the vibrator completely dampens this out. As to the closeness of the shave, the 3 blade product made by Gillette is still an excellent product and I can&#x27;t say 4 blade approach is that much better. In my opinion the 3 blade product is more economical and that is where my priority lies. One other point, without the battery in Power Glide system, it would be too light.&lt;br /&gt;Paul Farrell</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the both the comfort and quality of the shave great product.  I like the smoothness of the shave, left me feeling refreshed with a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE is the most technologically advanced ever. Featuring bigger, more ergonomic side grips, allowing you to get a good grip, even when wet. Now including a \\&quot;power on\\&quot; light that flashes when you&#x27;re running low on juice.&lt;br /&gt;Automatic shut off feature that kicks in after 8 minutes of continuous use, just in case your razor turns on while traveling. I got mine to test free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have grown very fond of this new razor. Gets very close to the skin and have yet to have a cut. It is a bit more pricey but in the long run I see it will be well worth my money. It&#x27;s worth the buck!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free as a part of a program run by Gillette. Overall the quality of the razor and feel of it in my hand is solid. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and easy to use. Initially I felt that the added weight by the battery in the handle would be cumbersome to use but after a few uses I got used to the weight it was perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I would trade in my safety razor for the Proglide as the vibrating handle and extra blades on the razor just feels a little gimmicky to me. If I went for a few days between shaves and used the Proglide the hairs would get caught in between the blades and it would be a pain to get them out. The design of the razor didn&#x27;t really alleviate a problem for me, it actually created a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the build and quality of the product is great, I don&#x27;t find myself wanting to switch to it as my go to razor.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power from a program from Gillette and decided to put away my old razor and give it a shot.After trying Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, I was left very impressed at the smooth and close shave it provided. I did not have to repeat strokes as often as I did with my previous razor and the extra single razor it has on the opposite side of the cartridge was excellent for thinning my mustache. I did not incur a single cut to my skin and there was absolutely no irritation following my shave. Even shaving against the grain of my hair was easy and pain free. The side grips made it easy to handle the razor even when wet, a feature not present on my previous razor. This razor is designed extremely well and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a better shave.</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT A SMOOTH SHAVE GET THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE,IT SHAVE YOURE FACE SO SMOOTH THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT,IT MADE BY THE BEST COMPANY FOR MENS SHAVING PRODUCTS AND IT IS GILLETTE,SO GO GET YOU ONE TODAY AND TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I received a Fusion ProGlide Power razor to try via a program from Gillette and was pleasantly surprised at the results.  The handle is much easier to grip than other razors in this category. I have very sensitive skin and was able to sue this razor all five work days last week without much discomfort by the end of the week.  The results were much better than the other razors in this category I have previously used.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin with a smooth, close shave.  I no longer have red irritated skin after shaving.  I will not be returning to my previous razor.  Highly recommended the power razor!</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a free item to try for Gillette. I think it does a great job shaving but I could do without the battery power. The blades would have been good enough without the vibration. I wouldn&#x27;t go and buy this product without a coupon or sale because I think regular cheaper razors do just as good, but this product does work well. It also doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation or razor burn after shaving.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received the Fusion ProGlide Power razor from Gillette to do a product review and share my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a Gillette Mach 3 as my primary tool to shave. When I received the Fusion ProGlide razor, I really liked the new grippier handle, drop in weight, and increased circumference which made it easier to hold and maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button is easy to push and the battery compartment stays secure until you are ready to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the Proglide Power Handle come on the market, I dismissed it.  I thought, \\&quot;who wants to put a vibrating razor to their face?\\&quot;. A friend warned me that he had tried a similar product and it cut him. I recently received a free sample of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as part of a program run by Gillette I will chalk up my friend&#x27;s experience to \\&quot;user error\\&quot;, because after trying it for myself, I definitely have an improved opinion.  The first thing I needed to do was to get used to the new method of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of taking several shorter strokes to shave, I found the Proglide Power Handle worked best if I used one continuous stroke.  This seemed to allow the maximum benefit from the vibration.  I actually preferred this shaving method, and it did not cut my face!  If you want - though it defeats the benefit of the vibration - you can also use the Proglide as a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; razor, though I liked the vibrations just fine.  Either way, the shave was close enough, and lasted all day.  The blades also seem to last as least as long as any others I&#x27;ve used, so there is no increased cost for consumables. I haven&#x27;t gone to buy new blades yet, but a quick Web search puts the prices in line with other blades of similar quality. I would definitely recommend this razor, and will suggest to my friend that he give it another try.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power thru a promotion Gillette was sponsoring. I had to shave I am not fond of the handle. I can&#x27;t say there is anything wrong with it, I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels in my hand. It is a little bulky which to me removes some of the feed back that the blades are giving as you shave.</li>
            <li> Normally as I tuck my son in to bed at night and kiss kim good night, I get teased about dad&#x27;s bristles feeling like shark skin!.  After using the free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette for a week, no more complaints a bed time from the little man.  That speaks volumes about how close the shave is with this razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor through a program being run by Gillette. Over the years, I have used many razors, both manual and electric, and have to say that the Proglide gave me the best shave. It leaves my face soft and smooth, with no stubble left behind. The thinner blade is designed to glide the blade over the face with no tugging or pulling, resulting in a close shave. I especially like the design of the power handle, the grips make it easy to shave in the shower, no more dropping the razor. It has a great shut off feature which comes in handy to prevent it accidentally being turned on in a drawer or during travel. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is a great little razor, perfect for everyday use. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the Gillette Fusion shaving system.  I have tried a number of their razors over the years and have always been satisfied with the results.  When I had the opportunity to get a free razor from Gillette. I was excited. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power is their newest system.  To start with I love the handle. It has the right amount of weight so you feel like you are shaving with a real instrument and not a cheap plastic toy.  The grips on the underside give you very good control.  I have a tough beard and usually have to shave twice a day to keep my face smooth, but with the Proglide, I can shave once in the morning and my face stays clean-shaven all day.  My wife has sensitive skin and loves the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Power since she can touch my face without feeling like she is touching sandpaper. I would recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power to any man with a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor quite a bit now, and the results are great. The razor head is still sharp and cutting strong. The handle is pretty good, i did&#x27;t really see the benefit of a vibrator, but the razor worked well so maybe it did do something? After each shave my face is cleanly shaven, and it is a piece of cake to shave now(my favorite part). The only thing i would prefer to change is the blade count from 5 to 4. The handle is easy to grip and a cinch to clean, even in the shower! Overall, a great product, always look forward to the great products the Gillette puts out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor i tried was provided for free by a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I Love This product .. it had never let me or my beard down. I always have a great shave when i use this product and i am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I got this razor through a free trial program by Gillette. I really enjoyed the shave. I shave in the shower typically so I was a little concerned about it having a battery but it seems to be just fine. The vibration makes it seem like an expensive electric razor but its a hand held blade razor. It&#x27;s definitely one of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. Even my wife is using it and may convert from her girl versions. Worth the money... good razor.</li>
            <li> I have had a positive shave experience with the Gillette Fusion. I received this razor free as part of a Gillette market study for honest opinions of the product. The first 4 or 5 uses on a new blade are great. In fact, id say the closest blade shave ive experienced. Things kind of go downhill from there and a blade change is required. I found that shaving with a dull blade in power mode is very uncomfortable. The reason I am reluctant to get rid of the other razors I have a stick exclusively with the Fusion is simple....refill cost. I just can&#x27;t accept spending $28 on 8 refills. This was the price I found at a major chain that carries the fusion refills. It&#x27;s just simply to expensive and I don&#x27;t see an extended life with these razors over other less expensive options.</li>
            <li> I have received the &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor&amp;#34; free from a program run by Gillette.  I have to say that this razor was an exceptionally good razor.  I use the the Razor with the power on for a nice smooth shave and it is great because it does not pull my skin which in return does not cut me!! I can always get a good grip on the handle whether it is wet or dry which is good so the razor does not go flying out of my hand.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle is easy to grasp and use and the shave is like nothing you&#x27;ve experienced before.  The ProGlide razor I used was from a free offer from Gillette.  When I first used it, it was so smooth that I stopped to check to see if the plastic cover was still over the blades.  Unlike my old razor, the ProGlide massages my face such that I don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m shaving.  There are no more pulls and snags on my beard like my old razor.  I also used the trimmer blade around my sideburns and it was very effective at shaping the sides with excellent control.  Hands down, it is the smoothest shave I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I received the pro glide razor as a promotion from Gillette. This was my first experience with a power razor and I have to say that I was very impressed. I typically wear a full beard but use the razor to shave my neck and face above the beard. It did a great job in provided a very comfortable shave. But the best part of the RAZR is the single edge blade that makes it very easy to get clean to find lines in my beard.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I&#x27;ve always liked gillette&#x27;s products and this is another great addition to the Gillette family of razors. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that even though it has really thin blades it still irritated my skin really bad. But that happens to me with most razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> The multiple thin blades and secure grips on the handle produce a clean, close shave.  The reverberating handle also aids in the closeness of the shave.  I was very impressed with the flexibility of the razor to help adapt to the different contours of my face.  The blades do not last very long and are expensive to replace but that is a minor inconvenience for the great results that the product provides.  I have experienced little to no razor burn while using this product which cannot be said for all types of razors.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> First off, I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor thru a program run by Gillette.  The razor handle made the razor easy to maneuver and get the best shave you can.  The handle was suitable for the different grips I use while shaving, such as the fingertip grip and the hand palm grip.  It was very easy on the hands.  The gripping surfaces made it easier to maintain control of the razor while getting the look you want.  The smooth and sleek design of the rest of the handle gives the razor that extra appeal.  Overall, the quality of the handle matched the quality of the razor head, allowing for an optimal shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I got the Powerhandle with a coupon when my electric razor died and I have to say that I really like the shave that it gives! Fast, smooth and easy to use!! I think I have been converted.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette products for years now but I was thrilled when I received a free Fusion Proglide Power Handle through a program Gillette was running. When I tried this handle for the first time I knew this was it for me. It&#x27;s like giving your face a massage while you&#x27;re shaving. I have sensitive skin so anything I can use to reduce the sensitivity I&#x27;ll give a try. I am glad I did!!! If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I suggest you do</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try and I usually use disposables but when I used Gillette Fusion ProGlide I was very satisfied by the close clean feeling I got that last. I have sensitive skin and this gave me the comfort of shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was lucky to receive and sample a free Gillette Fusion Proglide razor via a program run by Gillette.  This is definitely a great product!  The first thing you will notice is the handle.  It is much wider than the typical razor and has ergonomic side grips.  Therefore, allowing you a better grip while shaving.  Lots of times in the past, my razor would slip from being wet, since I would have to rinse the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second benefit is the Micropulses as you shave.  These really help the razor glide across your face, without any pulling or tugging.  Therefore, allowing a smoother, cleaner shave.  This helped my sensitive skin, since there was no grabbing.  Plus, I had no bumps as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the shaving experience with this razor from Gillette and have already replaced my others with it!</li>
            <li> I recieved this razor as part of a promotion done by Gillette, and it is te best razor I have ever used.  The five blade shave plus the single blade edger plus the electric handle equals the best shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must-have for any non-bearded guy.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power Razor thru a program run thru Gillette. It was my first battery-powered razor that I had ever experienced, so I was a little skeptical at first. After the first shave, all those doubts went out the window. It delivered a very smooth shave and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with it, especially since it was free! I highly recommend anybody to try out this razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as part of a program run by Gillette, and it is far and away the best manual razor I have ever used.Before using this razor I was using an electric razor. I forgot want a smooth shave was. The five blades gives you the cleanest shave you could ask for. Then you have the edger on the back, which is perfect for some of those tight spots. Finally, the power handle gives an even smoother shave through is vibrations. Overall, this is a must-have for any clean-shaven guy.</li>
            <li> I had a similar Gillette razor before I was provided this razon from a program run by Gillette. After using this razor for a while, it performed slightly better than my old razor. The power action did help keep it from getting stuck on the stubble. It did provide a smooth, clean shave though. Not sure on how long the battery will last, but it is still holding out well with 2+ weeks of use. I am not sure if I would pay the extra money for this product, but it may help for those with tough facial hair.</li>
            <li> What can one say about what is probably one of America&#x27;s favorite razor that hasn&#x27;t already been said. For me I like the clean shave without the nicks and having to wear pieces of toilet paper to cover them that you get from the cheaper razors. The handle makes is comfortable to use. While I did receive a free razor from a program run by Gillette, that in no way influenced my review as I would have to be somewhere where I had no choice but to use an inferior razor.</li>
            <li> Since I started using the Gillette Proglide Power Razor I haven&#x27;t even bothered to try other brands on the market. I was given a free sample of this product to try and I was blown away by the results I got. The high quality of the product speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair and tried my fair share of razors on the market, only to be disappointed. This razor gives me a close shave, leaving me with a smooth skin. It goes well against the grain, and the power feature helps a lot. No cuts, scrapes and burns here!&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges are very expensive, but worth every penny, since one blade lasts me about 5 shavings. It gets expensive if you shave daily, but trust me, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Mach III for over the past five years and have been satisfied with its performance.  I have watched plenty of commercials about the new razors so I wanted to check and see if I was missing anything.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor was the razor that was going to tell me if I was missing out on anything over the past five years as I received the razor as a special promotion run by Gillette.  The Proglide Power Razor performed outstanding on my day to day morning shave.  I will admit that I don&#x27;t grow anything thick in a day, so it wasn&#x27;t hard for it to give me an outstanding close shave with a  very clean and soft feel.(I did get a little more snuggle time from my wife.......but maybe that was just a coincidence ;o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanting to see how the Gillette Fusion Proglide would perform on a longer, thicker bit of growth, I let myself go for a over a week and resisted the urge to use my new Proglide.  After a long week, I found out I have a bit more gray in my beard than I would like, so I was eager to see how effective my shave was going to be.  I was a bit surprised to find that there was little to no tugging on my face and the Fusion Proglide handled my weeks growth with ease.  Perhaps it was the gentle vibrations, or maybe the five blades, or more likely both together, but I was totally impressed with the closeness, efficiency, and ease of my shave.  I didn&#x27;t have the razor burn that always seemed to accompany me with my previous shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for performance I would give the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor a five, but will give it a four only because of the price of the refills.  I haven&#x27;t decided yet if I&#x27;ll stick with it, but it sure will be tough to leave this razor!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor free of charge for evaluation via a program ran by Gillette. When I first received the Fusion power razor, I admit I was a little skeptical at first. Being a regular Fusion user, I did not honestly see how a powered version of this device could make any significant difference.  Boy was I wrong!  The multiple blades and vibration lift the hairs prior to trimming, resulting in a much closer shave than obtained using the regular model.  The LED lighting on the handle is a nice extra touch, and the device is very comfortable to hold. The only downfall in which I see is that the refills are quite expensive. However, with the closeness of the shave obtained by the device, it may just be worth it!</li>
            <li> I got this from a special program from Gillette, but use an electric razor, so I gave it to my wife to use. She uses men&#x27;s shavers anyway, she says they cut better than women&#x27;s. she liked it better than her traditional, non-powered razor, but didn&#x27;t say it was exceptional. Well see how much the blades are and decide if she is going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> 10 years ago, I received one of the first Gillette Fusion razors for my 18th birthday.  10 years later, I participated in a program run by Gillette that gave me the opportunity to try out the latest version of this razor.  Safe to say that this thing has come a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start my review talking about the handle.  In comparison to the previous iteration I owned, not much has changed, but the things that have made me really happy.  First, the handle has slimmed down from what it used to be.  What this leaves you with a great shape and sized handle that fits perfectly in your hand.  They&#x27;ve upgraded the grip on the handle as well, and there is definitely no fear of this bad boy slipping out of you hand.  Next, the motor inside has received a significant boost.  I used to think the vibration was a gimmick, but after years of shaving with one of these razors, I can safely say it gives you a very close shave.  Overall, the changes to the handle were slight, but left me with a very satisfied feeling over the improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual cartridge, it&#x27;s another winner in my book.  It seems like Gillette comes out with a new version every year or so, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if anything is really being improved.  However, with this iteration I noticed a major change in how well it shaved and how little it irritated my skin.  My big problem area is under my chin on my neck and right along the jawline.  All the other cartridges I&#x27;ve used have left me with knicks and this feeling of stubble I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.  When I used this new blade, I didn&#x27;t have any of those problems.  I have been going around trimming my beard down and not shaving for the longest time because I dreaded using a razor, but this one may actually get me back in to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative I can say is that the replacement heads are outrageously priced.  This will definitely be a factor for me in deciding on when to replace my cartridges and how often I shave.  Also in my experience, the cartridges are interchangeable between the different Gillette Fusion handles, so unless yours has broken or is very old I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this one expecting a significant upgrade. All in all though, this razor gives a very close shave and has come a long way from the previous version I owned.</li>
            <li> I got my hands on the Fusion Proglide Power Razor through a program run by Gillette. I haven&#x27;t owned one before, but I was really impressed by the shaving experience after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Makes it easy to get a nice clean shave. Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;2. I love the auto shutdown (safety) feature.&lt;br /&gt;3. The vibration makes the shaving experience effortless.&lt;br /&gt;4. I&#x27;ve used the old Fusion ProGlide (Manual), and body redesign has made the product way more comfortable to handle. I love the way this fits in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The vibration seems to be a little too strong to my liking. It works great, but I can&#x27;t use it continuously for more than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. Totally worth the buck!</li>
            <li> I received this razor about a month ago for free through a program run by Gillette.  I must say, I never would have bought the razor myself, as I was not unhappy with my razor at the time (Gillette Mach 3).  I&#x27;m glad I was part of the free trial program, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the razor was a bit weird due to the different handle than I was used to and the vibrating feature.  It&#x27;s just strange to have a razor vibrate in your hand and on your face!  But let me tell you, I was very happy with the shave.  The handle took 2-3 uses to get fully used to, but it&#x27;s possible I may never go back to a normal razor again.  Shaving every-other day as I normally do, I found the Fusion Power to provide a more comfortable shave than the Mach 3.  There was less irritation, and the shave was closer than with the Mach 3 (whether this is from the handle or the increased blades, I can&#x27;t be positive).  I also let my \\&quot;scratchies\\&quot; (as my 3-y/o daughter calls them) go for 4 days, when they are officially \\&quot;soft\\&quot; rather than so scratchy.  Quite long!  At that point, I almost wouldn&#x27;t consider shaving with the Mach 3 without first trimming.  With the Fusion Power, I had no irritation, no blood spots, nothing to complain about!  I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the handle vibrations take a bit to get used to, but the shave is extremely comfortable and close!  I would recommend the razor to anyone!</li>
            <li> I keep electric shavers and blades. Until now, I have had a tendency to use electric shavers because I don&#x27;t have time to deal with nicks and cuts in the morning, and blades were too difficult to use on anything but flat areas. Fortunately I managed to get a chance to try one of these for free from a special Gillette program. This blade shaver gives me the smoothest blade shave I have ever had. So far I have not had any nicks or cuts, and I glide right around uneven surfaces, even my chin. I love the feel of the handle. It is substantial and solid, not like the cheap blades that are so common. I will continue to use this razor and recommend it for a smooth, easy shave.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor from a program run by Gillette and was so happy I did. I ended up with a clean, comfortable shave. My face felt smooth hours later, unlike when I shave with some other, cheaper razors. I liked the grippy handle and found that it didn&#x27;t slip, even when wet. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the ProGlide and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> The handle is very comfortable in the hand and allows me to move efficiently over my face and neck.  I was able to get a very close shave without the tugging.  I have very sensitive skin but did not have a problem with razor burn or cuts.  Great razor overall and comfortable to hold.  I received this razor free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> This review is written by my husband, since we share this Amazon account.  Here&#x27;s his review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Proglide power handle free as part of a Gillette promotion. I was excited to try it, because I have been a faithful Schick user for years, but always enjoy trying new products to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell you what, too, I&#x27;m so glad I got the chance to try it.  This Gillette razor is amazing!  It honestly gave me the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I am always running around in the morning trying to get myself together, and tend to worry about nicking myself in my hurry to get ready for the office.  But this razor works so well, and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with irritation, nicks or those unsavory missed spots that you sometimes notice half-way through your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades seemed to wear out faster than other razors I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s worth it to replace them for the comfort from this system. I do not think I will be replacing this razor with something else, because I am that pleased with the product.  Sorry Schick, but Gillette has you beat!</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for about a year now and I finally got so sick of the razor burn and irritation in general that i started trying cheeper razors, because i figured that i may as well save money if i was going to look and feel horrible after shaving. WHat i discovered was that the less blades the razor has the less irritating. So finally i looked into single blade shaving and found mt edwin jagger DE89 and have been using a brush to lather my cream, the combination of the two produces an almost irritation free shave and is musch cheeper once you have the basic equipment.</li>
            <li> I recommend everyone buy this product, it really is very good and the seller met, I bought it and it has been very useful, I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a Gillette promotion for free and have actually been very happy with it - it fits nicely in my hand, has a good grip to it, and the batteries seem to last a lot longer than my last razor (which really seemed to chew up batteries).  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor from Gillette. The razor is heavy.  I do not mention this as a negative, but rather it is very sturdy and feels great in the hand.  The grip feel good and snug between the fingers and palm.  It is battery operated and vibrates.  I did half my face with the vibration on and half with it off.  There was absolutely no difference in the shave it provided. When you have the vibration on, there is an LED light on the handle that comes on.  To me this is useless. While I do not feel as though I received a better shave do to the vibration, it does feel good on the hand while holding it.  Overall I would recommend this handle as it does feel great in the hand.</li>
            <li> I got this handle free from a program run by Gillette. Very nice, like getting a facial massage while you shave, the handle fits nicely in my hand and manuvers well, well made does not hav ethat plastic feel like alot of other handles. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> A lot of people think that the only important part of shaving is the blade. This is simply not the case. The handle itself is key! I received this one for free as part of a program run by Gillette and I was not let down. Combined with the ProGlide blades (which I reviewed separately) and my preferred shaving gel (Currently using Anthony for Men), I get some of the best shaves I&#x27;ve experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, but weighted enough (with the battery installed) to feel solid in the hand. The vibration feature is great for ensuring a close, smooth shave with minimal skin irritation. I&#x27;ve shaved several times with it and the battery is still going strong, so that&#x27;s a good sign as well. Design is pretty in line with Gillette&#x27;s recent offerings and looks at home in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product - I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a woman, but I have VERY coarse hair. As a result I tend to try men&#x27;s shaving products. While this did the job, I&#x27;m not really sure the power bit is needed actually. And the refills are quite pricey. Still not sure my overall opinion on this one.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Proglide Power Razor from a program run by Gillette. It is a good quality razor. The handle is easy to hold and it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand. It has grips on it that make it easy to hold while shaving in the shower. The power button is conveniently located and the power is sufficient for shaving. I like the micro pulses. It makes my face feel energized while shaving.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is the best. It&#x27;s amazing what a difference the battery power makes on a close shave. I received this to try out via a Gillette program and won&#x27;t go back to my old handle!</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. The blades are very sharp and aid in getting that perfect shave. One of the features that I really liked was the moisturizing strips. My skin is very sensitive and is prone to cuts and breakouts. I was able to get super close shave without having to keep going over the same spot. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the handle being really wide, it just didn&#x27;t feel very comfortable in my hand. Overall all I like this product and it was free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Best Shave ever..Period...I just started using this Razor and its the best shave i ever got..the only way it could be better is if you got one at a braber shop with a straight razor...this blows away any other razor.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor via a program run by Gillette and this morning I had my second shave with the new razor.  It does take a little getting used to, as I forgot to turn it \\&quot;on\\&quot; this morning for the vibration/micropulses.  The cartridge is slick looking and it seems to provide a closer shave than my Mach 3.  The extra blades make a difference and you feel like your getting an easier glide and closer shave with less effort although it still took me the same amount of time to shave. Definitely less irritation today than with my first shave with the blade yesterday. Vibration/micropulses feel like your face is getting massaged but not sure how it benefits the shave. The precision trimmer is definitely helpful in getting to the hard to get area of under the nose and for straightening out the sideburns. All in all a good razor but is it that much better than the Mach 3 or other earlier versions?  Not sure about that...Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free through a program run by Gillette. This is a Great Razor. The handle is fits well in my hand and is quite comfortable. I have used other \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; razors and they tend to be bulky and difficult to maneuver. This Proglide Razor does it all. I&#x27;ve thrown away all my other razors.</li>
            <li> I was provided a Proglide Power Handle via a program sponsored by Gillette.  I have to say that I was skeptical about its effectiveness, but I have to say it did reduce the amount of nicks and cuts during my shave.  The biggest reason for that is that with the vibration I felt less desire to push harder on my face with the blade in order to get a really close shave.  My beard is fairly course and it usually takes several passes to get an area closely shaved which in turn makes me press harder as well.  The vibration also helps clean the blade out easier when I rinse it which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Gillette ProGlide Handle. This is the best razor I have ever used. I have always suffered from skin irritation after a close shave but not anymore. These blades are so thin that it really feels like it is gliding on my skin. I love the vibrating handle and I feel like it helps me get the closet shave possible without harming my skin. It is the best razor and handle out on the market.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor as part of a program run by Gillette, and as someone who has used their Fusion razor and thought that there was no reason to upgrade to the ProGlide...boy was I wrong. The vibrating head and blades make for one of the smoothest and most comfortable shaves I have ever had. The head pivots and the glide strip is the same as on the other Fusion razors, which help to make it comfortable and effective. It is a bit more expensive for blades, but once you feel it, you understand why. For someone with sensitive skin, like myself, it is money well spent.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as a part of a promotion from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was very happy about the performance of the blades themselves, I am confused as to the purpose of the handle. While cool looking and effective at trimming up edges, The bulky, vibrating, light-up handle seems extraneous, and I&#x27;m mainly scared to get it too wet. I have a trimmer already that I like, and this ersatz version is simply outclassed by a dedicated device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was good, but I blame the blades for the quality, not the sonic screwdriver that they were attached to.</li>
            <li> This razor, though convenient and smooth in some ways, does not rationalize the cost it would require for you to constantly change the head/blades. I received this razor has part of a promotion by Gillette to test the product, and I was not as pleased as I would have liked to been. The vibration feature left me confused because it seemed to do my harm than good - the vibrations caused me to nick myself quite a few times more than I would normally, and I felt like it made my overall experience much more cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I recently received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor to test from Gillette.  I was wary of using a battery operated razor at first, but found out that not only is it shower safe, but I actually enjoy the vibration while shaving my face.  The shave was one of the closest I&#x27;ve had in a long time - no pulling - no pain. My face felt smooth afterwards and no cuts nor razor burn. The handle is substantial enough to give you something to grasp onto to control your shave. This is a great razor and the price isn&#x27;t all that bad.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me a free razor and handle via a program they were running, so I was eager to try out this battery operated blade razor as soon as I could.  I had used electric razors in the past, but changed to blades once I started shaving in the shower.  My initial concerns about water getting into the handle were quickly dispelled, as the seals for the battery compartment were nice and tight.  The handle felt great in my hand, not a bit bulky like I feared it might be.  It gave me a great shave, and overall I was very impressed with it&#x27;s design and functionality.</li>
            <li> I received the razor from Gillette for free to try.  I enjoyed the shave after using the Schick Hydro for the past 3 years.  I feel the Fusion ProGlide provided a very smooth shave leaving my face feeling fresh.  One of the smoother shaves I have had in a good while. The power handle made my face feel very relaxed during shaves, but I had to turn it off while shaving around the lips and side burns (for more control). The biggest draw back is the cost of the refills versus the Schick Hydro.  About twice as much per cartridge, not sure the trade off of a better fresh feeling shave would be worth the cost difference.  Look for me to change once the cost comes down to more affordable prices.</li>
            <li> I got recently got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle for free to try out via a program from Gillte. The ProGlide Power handle provides a nice grip when shaving in wet and dry conditions. The rubber grip has a nice feel and helps keep the razor in your hand when its wet. While the handle is a nice size that fits comfortable in your hands while working up and down when shaving. The micro pulses helps lift the hair which results in a close and smooth shave. They definitely did a good job with this razor&#x27;s handle.</li>
            <li> I must say first of that I have used mostly electric razors. For about 7 years now.  The first time I ever used a regular razor I realized that my skin was just too sensitive. I had received the Gillette Proglide through a free program sponsored by Gillette, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power razor itself was the reason why I wanted to try it. I must say I received the closest shave yet, and using this razor made me a believer. I was so use to the electric razor and the fact that I could shave over the same spot and not get the results that I had using the Proglide Razor. The handle was comfortable to use. Changing the cartridges was easy to do, and storage was not an issue.  The fact that it uses one triple A battery and still gives you the comfort of an electric with the closeness of a blade makes this a valuable product for someone like me who has been using electric razors for as long as I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming from the world of electric, or you like to use both I would highly suggest getting this razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free to try as part of a program run by Gillette.  I really enjoyed my experience with the handle.  It was easy to grip, even while in the shower with wet hands.  The battery life is awesome and still growing strong.  The handle is attractive, efficient and  effective.  Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion from Gillette and I have to say i&#x27;m disappointed.  Well, not really, but I like to think that I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;m getting sucked back into buying blades instead of disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of years ago I shifted from buying blades to razors in a effort to stop paying ridiculous amounts of money for razors.  So I&#x27;ve been blissfully ignorant of the innovation going on in the category until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I really enjoyed the shave that this little device provides.  While i thought the vibration in the power handle was nothing more than a cheap gimmick I was pleasantly surprised when it made cutting through 3 days of stubble not a problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I thought this was a great product and one I&#x27;ll probably use going forward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for years, and most recently the Fusion ProGlide, but the Power part really makes a difference! I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor free  via a program run by Gillette.  This razor gave me a nice clean shave without any irritation. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed on the performance!</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed the Fusion Proglide Styler which I loved, I think a big part of it was the blades.  I really like the comb on each blade, seems to really make a difference in getting the pesky hair facing the wrong direction otherwise pretty difficult to snag.  I will say I&#x27;m not really a fan of the power function but that might just be my preference.  The razor all and all is pretty outstanding.  I&#x27;ll be shaving with this now, instead of my trusty Braun electric.  It&#x27;s just so close and nice!  Really glad I received this free from a Gillette program, it gave me another chance to try a razor.</li>
            <li> Aside from the cooler blue-and-black color scheme and the light-up power button that lets you know when your AAA battery is about up, the ProGlide handle is really quite similar to the Fusion Power handle. The grip, weight, and handling are about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic shut-off feature is a nice touch, but not worth paying extra for. Afraid of your battery-powered devices powering up when traveling? Take the battery out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watertight seal, to routine rising as well as to being submerged in water (although I wouldn&#x27;t try submerging again).</li>
            <li> This was a free razor provided by Gillette as part of a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle itself is very comfortable in your hand while in use. The blade cartridge is easily changed when needed. The power vibration I&#x27;m not sure what it supposed to accomplish. I have used it for five days with and without the power on and have noticed no difference in the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this razor.  Since I shave everyday for my job, I need a razor that won&#x27;t give me razor burn and destroy my face.  This razor shaves so close that it&#x27;s almost unbelievable.  The blades seem to stay sharp much longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used.  Even after a couple days of not shaving, this razor still gives me that ultimate close shave.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle allows you to grip and shave with ease. This lightweight handle has great rubber grips that allow for perfect shaving control. And beyond that...it vibrates to give your skin a comfortable feeling and your face a closer shave. Thanks to Gillette for providing this to me as a promotion.</li>
            <li> I had a week old vacation beard when I decided to use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power. It was a very nice shave on my long beard hair. No pulling or burning. I&#x27;ve used electric shavers in the past and they would heat up making you shave faster and leaving a rough feel.  This is the smoothest razor I&#x27;ve used in the past 25 years. It&#x27;s small and compact just like my, now, old razor.  It looks and feels like my old razor with one exception, POWER!  It was a smooth experience and I&#x27;m glad I found my last razor.  You have to try this.  Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> I used plastic, disposable shavers for the last year or so.  This razor simply reminded me why I missed it.  This shaver provides a smooth shave!  The handle is light weight and well designed for easy gripping and handling.  I fully appreciate how this shaver helps cut down on the time to obtain a clean, smooth shave.  I am fully converted to the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor!</li>
            <li> he Gillete Fusion Proglide razor is awesome and now with the Proglide power handle, it is amazing!  The ergonomic design of the handle gives you ultimate control of the razor, it&#x27;s like one with your hand!  I received a free razor through a program run by Gillette giving me the opportunity to try the product without the financial burden.  The handle is interesting because it vibrates.  The vibrating is supposed to reduce irritation from the blade.  I&#x27;m not sure what it does exactly, but it does feel a little funny at first, but it seems to work great which is really what anyone cares about!  The only downside is you can&#x27;t really submerge the razor handle to clean it, and I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the shower or use it in the shower.  I would recommend this razor and handle to anyone looking for a great close shave!</li>
            <li> What can I say. Great close comfortable shave. Best shaver I ever used. Much better than expected. Dozens of shaves without a nick. You can shave in any direction without consequence. No cuts or skin rash. More than I&#x27;m use to paying for blades but as they say, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This gives you the closest shave you can get and the blades seem to last a long time, longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Being a female, I have very thick, dark, stubborn hair and it would grow back every day with any other razor that I have used and it would be so painful to shave every day. I began waxing but that would take so much time and I would have to wait for the hair to grow back a certain length to wax again and it was incredibly expensive. I bought this razor for 10 bucks at Walmart and it solved all my problems. I wish I had discovered this a lot earlier in life because it would have saved me so much time, money, and pain. I can shave every day with no pain and the skin on my underarms is a lot lighter than when I would shave with any other razor. The best part....it feels like I waxed after using this razor. Oh and its super cheap too! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect.  Works great, but personally think it might be overkill and don&#x27;t even use the vibrate.</li>
            <li> best shave ever, battery lasting 5+ months</li>
            <li> Great, great razor.&lt;br /&gt;Really great if you have sensitive skin.  No more razor burn.  No more dreading shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Super close shave.</li>
            <li> i dint really find it that different from previous versions, it is just the same or even little less comfort than the previous versions i would sat</li>
            <li> Excellent product; reasonably priced; we will continue to purchase Gillette&#x27;s fusion line regularly due to its effectiveness (blades stayed relatively sharp for a good time in comparison to other products &amp; possible second-hand Gillette products); thank you!</li>
            <li> Its great when its new, but eventually, even with new batteries and heads, it&#x27;ll grow to weaken. Unless you&#x27;re very careful, water will slowly leak into the battery compartment and corrode it, making it unreliable in the long-run if you plan to use it in the shower. Even if you keep it dry, the vibration mechanism weakens fairly quickly regardless of what batteries you use. Its great as a short-term power razor, maybe a year at tops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and I love this razor!  I&#x27;ve tried many, many razors that are targeted for women, and none of them measure up, including Gillette&#x27;s women&#x27;s version of this razor.  Gillette&#x27;s Fusion gives a really close shave and really leaves my legs and underarms smooth, for longer than any other razor.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how expensive they are, both the razor and the replacement blades.  Other than that though, I highly recommend this razor, for women too!</li>
            <li> I have gone into the multi blade razors because the are smooth and do not cut my face this particular model does a great job</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful! The shave is perfect and without irritation. Using the vibration the result is even better. This is my product for the rest of his life.</li>
            <li> These did not seem to be any good, as the first one I ordered lasted less than a week, (shaving alternating days,) while other brands always lasted 3-4.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the second one I ordered away to a friend who liked it.</li>
            <li> very good product for sensitive skin. I has a Gillette Mack 3 and Gillette Fusion is a superior product. Comfortable and grips well in your hand.</li>
            <li> Firstly i thought how the battery will work in a razor, Will that harm my skin, But as soon i bought this product and started using it , I just loved it. I bought 2 packs for this and gifted 1 to my dad and he was really happy using this.</li>
            <li> Gillette had a free promotion offer to try out their new profusion power glide razors. I had no idea what to expect when I was going to try this razor. I never got the concept of a vibrating razor, but nonetheless, decided to give it a try. The package comes with a razor holder, the razor handle with blades attached, and 1 AAA battery. I didn&#x27;t shave for a couple of days and gave it a whirl. I paired this razor with the \\&quot;art of shaving\\&quot; kit and I had an amazing shave. The vibration is a bit intense, but you can&#x27;t feel any of the tugging and pulling you normally feel when shaving. It was one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I noticed a significant difference between the regular fusion and the fusion proglide. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a close, smooth, painfree shave.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver from a Gillette promotion.  This is by far the best shaver I have ever used.  It gets a close and smooth shave without any irritation.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate from recommending this shaver to any of my friends.  I will buy in the future.  The one thing it does is tug a bit but that was taking care of by shaving after a got shower or using a damp hot cloth on my face before shaving.  Great shaver!!</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette ProGlide Power handle and cartridge from a Gillette promotion. The overall awesomeness of this combination has convinced me to come back to Gillette, even with the high pricing of the blades. The handle provides a gentle vibration that seems to reduce the irritation normally caused by shaving, and the replaceable battery is definitely a plus. The vibrations also seemed to reduce the tugging and pulling during my shave, but that may have been due to the blades. I would definitely recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a shavette for years, so when this promotion came up I wasn&#x27;t actually all that interested.  At any rate I figured I&#x27;d try it since some times I shave my head (yay summer!).  In short: this razor is pretty terrible, clogging all the time and just giving an overall unsatisfactory shave.  I don&#x27;t understand the point of the vibration feature and seems extremely more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  Add in the expense and I just see no reason to use this razor.  I wound up giving the handle to my brother, he may use it at some point, but overall I can&#x27;t recommend this razor to anyone and have a hard time bringing it up other than to wonder why the heck it exists.</li>
            <li> I was first hesitant in regards to trying a power handle which vibrated so violently in a plastic casing. However, this is a great product to take on travels as the cost is relatively cheap and if you are yearning for some electronic aided shave. I did feel that the vibrations led to a nice, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my main shaver, but as a good back up / travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> This Power Handle seems silly but it is simple and helps to get a closer shave.  This handle just intensifies the smoothness and closeness of my shave to keep for a smooth face longer.  I would recommend this razor to anyone. If you are a fast grower of facial hair, this will help a great deal. It did and has for me. I was able to try this out via  a program run by Gillette.  I will definitely be using this razor again.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle free, from a program run by Gillette.  I have been using the same Mach 3 handle for the past 14 years and I guess I have become a creature of habit.  I have used the handle both with the power and without the power and I really don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s that much of a difference as to the closeness of the shave. Although I did experice a little anxiety at first wondering if the extra power was going to end up with more nicks and cuts.  Thankfully it did not create any nicks with the power turned on, but I still just cant get onto the power shaver boat.  I like that you can use it in or out of the shower even though I was a little unsure about this at first.  It feeld good in my hand and gets the job done.  If you&#x27;re into buying the latest and greatest then Gillette doesn&#x27;t disappoint, but if you&#x27;re a creature of habit I am not sure it&#x27;s worth the price to try and see.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s really great. I have been looking for a good razor for a long time. Will definitely be buying again. Ps, this is my girlfriend&#x27;s amazon account. I am a man.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for the last few weeks. I received it for free through a Gillette promotion. I feel that is an upgrade over the regular plain jane Gillette Fusion handle. The handle is physically bigger than the regular handle to accommodate the battery. I feel like the larger size helps me grip the handle better and provides a better grip, especially on days I shave while in the shower. The Micropulses only add a little bit of improvement over the regular handle. Some days I feel like it does provide a smoother shave, and other days I don&#x27;t notice the difference. Overall the Gillette Fusion ProGlide provdes a great shave.</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to review The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle as part of a promotion by Gillette. It was the first time I have used a razor handle that vibrates. I&#x27;m not sure what benefit this was supposed to provide to me. I turned it on and used it, it made my skin vibrate, which made me nervous that I was going to cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle was comfortable to hold, when it wasn&#x27;t vibrating, otherwise the vibration went all the way down your hand, which made it feel less steady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt kind of strange using it, and would probably use it again without the vibration. My wife made a comment that it looked like something she would use, and not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not use the handle again, unless it is turned off.</li>
            <li> I have been loving my new Gillette Fusion Proglide power handle since I received it a few weeks ago free via a program Gillette is running.  I have needed a power handle that accurately shaves even if its wet and the side grips on this new power handle have done just that.  Also another feature that was improved on this model was the micro pulses that are generated by the power handle which has given me a much smoother feel after shaving.  I recommend anyone interested in a improved power handle from Gillette pick this up right now!</li>
            <li> I received the Power Handle for free from Gillette.  There is alot to like about this handle.  First it has the teardrop shape at the bottom of the handle which fits nicely in the palm of you hand.  Because of this, you can easily move around your face.  Second is the rubber grip handle, it is tacky, but not sticky, and does not get slippery even with soapy hands.  Next, the whole handle is waterproof, so you can take full advantage of the power feature in the shower!  Lastly, is the power feature itself, it makes the handle buzz ever so slightly in your hand, and it feels like it help to give you a closer shave.  Great all around product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gileete Fusion Proglide Power razor for about a week not, coming from the Mach 3.  I received it free from a Gilette sponsored program.  The actual shave is noticeably more comfortable than the Mach3, but I feel that the Mach 3 delivers a closer shave.  That being said, all my shaves have been nick-free, which isn&#x27;t always the case with the Mach 3.  Overall, this is another great product from Gillette and offers a good alternative to the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin, I usually use a Mach 3 razor.  I was lucky to be able to try a free sample Gillette sent me.  I was curious to see if this razor would give a closer shave.  I compared shaves side by side (different sides of my face and neck) and the Fusion seemed to give a smoother shave.  I let my stubble grow out for a few days to see if I could notice a difference and I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to shave in the shower, so the Fusion held up to that test.  It&#x27;s heavier than the Mach 3, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a battery razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades seem to last as long as the Mach 3 as well.  The Fusion&#x27;s blades are very expensive, maybe a little pricer than the Mach 3.  In the future, I might buy the ones on sale.  They&#x27;re very comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the power handle, I like it.  It gives little pulses that help the blades massage my skin.  I was very happy with the shave afterwards.  Sometimes I get little nicks, but I didn&#x27;t with the power handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that the razor gave me a good shave and didn&#x27;t damage my skin.</li>
            <li> This razor is great. It cuts really close, closer than any other razor I have used including my $250 electric razor. It never irratates my skin and has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I received my razor from Gillette as part of a free program by them. The razor is very well made, shaves quite close and no nicks or cuts. The only opportunity for improvement is that getting the battery in is not straight forward and the directions aren&#x27;t very clear.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to try this product for free via program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like the fact that the Gillette Fusion proglide power has a great handle design with a comfort grip, I noticed when shaving it gives you a nice close and smooth shave with massaging comfort in from the handle to the blade. I will not be returning to generic blades again!</li>
            <li> The handle is much better than pervious models and when used properly you will get a quality shave and when your hands are wet it is very easy to hold an control. This will be the only shaver I use from now on.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have ever gotten!  I was suspicious about this product at first.  I thought that the vibrations would cut or scrap when I shaved but boy was I wrong!  It was easy to put the battery in and activate the vibration.  Then just shave like you always have.  Really the closest shave I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor is great! The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now and have been very happy with the results. Battery life is very good, as I haven&#x27;t had to change them out in the six months I&#x27;ve used it. The handle is very sleek and comfortable.  It&#x27;s a bit slippery when wet which is my only complaint.  It could stand some type of non-slip grip.  Besides that, the handle performs very well. In combination with the the blades it provides a VERY close shave.  I believe the vibration adds a smoother shave resulting in a smooth-as-glass finish.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve had with it so far. Go get one!</li>
            <li> I got this free from a program sponsored by Gilette. I was probably even more skeptical of the power handle than I was of the \\&quot;magical\\&quot; five-blade cartridges (but they won me over, too), so you can imagine my surprise when I discovered how much easier it was to shave with the power handle.  The vibration seemed to make the razor slice through stubble twice as easy as before, as though it turned the stationary blades into a sort of oscillating saw you&#x27;d use to cut drywall, but on a much smaller scale.  If that sounds terrifying, it isn&#x27;t.  It took a lot of the \\&quot;work\\&quot; out of the shave, so there was less pulling on the hairs as the blade sliced them, which reduced the potential for razor burn.  If you have the opportunity to get the power handle (or better yet, try your friend&#x27;s, if he&#x27;ll let you), I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and shave my neck and with this razor it made it so much easier to shave my neck with the bigger grips on the handle help me have more control over the handle and it did not slip out of my hand even though it was wet. I was given this razor as a program that Gillette is promoting but I would personally recommend this razor to anyone, And will be purchasing them in the future.</li>
            <li> This handle is was provided to me for free by a program being run by Gillette. I enjoyed the shave very much, and this coming from a guy who usually uses an electric razor. The battery is more of a gimmick though instead of a good addition. It does provide a nice weight to the handle which makes it easier to hold and use on the face and other body parts. The handle uses a triple A battery and vibrates when the button is pushed, it turns off with another push. Overall I think it is a waste of a battery but the weight of the handle is perfect. I would like a normal non battery run handle with the same weight.</li>
            <li> When I received this razor, I had high expectations. The reason my expectations were so high was because I enjoy all the other products that Gillette offers. Well, I must say this razor provides a nice shave but its not the best. I prefer my Schick Hydro 5 over this razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor for a couple weeks now.  It was a free razor provided from a program by Gillette.  I had been using the Gillette Sensor Excel razor for years and thought that it gave pretty good results, but the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor is battery powered so it is able to tackle the stubble a little more easily.  It is a larger handle due to the battery inside, but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Besides, the handle has grips all over, so it is easy to manage.  The battery compartment is well sealed to prevent any water from getting in.  I shave in the shower, so it is nice to be able to rinse the whole razor.  The power button lights up bright blue, so it is easy to remember to turn it off.  I have started shaving without the power on a couple of times.  It works well with the power on, but you get a much smoother shave with the power on.  Gillette has hit the target with yet another well-made product.</li>
            <li> This newest model of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor is the best yet.  It is light weight, easy to maneuver and delivers a better shave than my electric razor which is now gathering dust in the drawer.  The only real negative about the ProGlide razor is my son kept stealing mine so I finally had to buy one for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor to evaluate through a consume program run by Gillette.  Our household likes it so much we have switched to using it exclusively.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor is my favorite of all of the widely available supermarket brand razors.  Similar to the Gillette Fusion, the ProGlide takes the Fusion to the next level by offering sharper blades and an updated cartridge design that provides a smoother stroke with less irritation. I tried this razor through a program run by Gillette.  This razor is a little pricey and the blades aren&#x27;t cheap, but this stick will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try out Gillette new product and this free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. The shave is very smooth and closeness of the blade gives a fresh and clean look with the power razor blades. The skin feels less&lt;br /&gt;irritated, the blade is quite expensive as well as the refill. Overall this product is more or less same like its predecessor.</li>
            <li> I receieved the Gillette Fusion Proglide free through a program run by Gillette.  Gillette Fusion Proglide is a pretty proficient razor.  It gives a nice close shave without any issues.  I&#x27;m not sure if the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handle makes it cut any closer then the original fusion razor but it certainly does not make it any worse.  The razor fits and feels very nice in the hand.  Gillette makes a solid razor that always performs as it should.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome! Compared to previous razors I&#x27;ve used it saves closer and more uniform, it&#x27;s great for people with facial hair because of the trimmer blade on the back, and it&#x27;s easy to wash out. The button to turn the power on is a great improvement too. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle free through a free promotion with Gillette. I really was anticipating getting this power handle in the mail. Since I work from home, I normally don&#x27;t shave until the evening before I go out. So, when the doorbell rang and I received my \\&quot;promotional product\\&quot;, I was excited to try it right then! I tore open the package and installed the AA battery in the handle and ran back to the bathroom to try it out. Jumped in front of the mirror, pressed the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; button and began to test this vibrating handled razor dry. It worked, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it. Then, lathered up and started shaving. WOW! What this smooth! It had the feel of an electric but the closeness of a blade. I then turn off the handle and used it that way on the other side of my face. That only lasted about 3 seconds, before I switched it back on. The vibration makes a world of difference. I&#x27;m a believer. No need to replace my electric razor now, with a newer screen guard. I&#x27;m using a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle!</li>
            <li> Disappointing, didn&#x27;t seem to shave very well, but kudos on building up the brand. It seemed to do a worse job on my face than my normal Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> I thought it was all a load of bs...6 blades, vibrating handle, yeah yeah yeah. Just a new way to get us to pay more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used it. Several times. Still using the original blade. It still shaves me very closely. The vibrating handle-gimmick or useful? Before I tried it, I thought it was a gimmick. After using it a half dozen times, I love it! I am able to shave every OTHER DAY, and I work in an industry that prefers men to be clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that I am shaving less! I am apprehensive about buying the blades---they are significantly more expensive. But if thee handle continues to perform as well as it has, they will be well worth the added expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Gillette, for giving me the opportunity to try your new product!</li>
            <li> Received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor free from a program buy Gillette. The product has such power it shaves even the toughest 5 day beard. It does all the work for you and it is the closet shave I have ever received. It cleans amazingly and the blade lasts a long time. I can go 2 days after shaving without shaving again. I HIGHLY recommend the razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the ProGlide Power Razor through a promotional campaign by Gillette. It was definitely doesn&#x27;t do any better of a job then other razors I have used. As for the handle specifically; the \\&quot;power\\&quot; vibration seemed to be no more than a gimmick to upgrade from your old razor.  The Blades seem to need more attention/cleaned multiple times during the shave when you skip a few days..</li>
            <li> Received this razor free in the mail from Gillette.  Normally use a Bic disposable and never really feel I get a close shave.  Liked the feel of the handle and it was easy to hold onto in the shower where I normally shave.  I have a heavy beard and was very happy with the closeness and comfort of the shave with this razor.  Thought I might not like the pulsing action, but had no issue with it as it isn&#x27;t excessive.  I would definitely recommend; my only issue is the high cost of the refills.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor free from Gillette to try and I must say I was pleased overall with the razor.  The handle itself is slightly thicker than my normal razor handle, so it felt easier to handle and control.  The power aspect of the razor i was less impressed with as I still felt friction, which the claims are that the battery operated pulses reduce.  The blade and shave itself were very impressive, however the second and third shaves with the blade (and a few days growth) didnt seem to be as good as my normal razor.  Overall, the Fusion Proglide razor and handle are top of the line products!</li>
            <li> It always rinsed clean easily with no clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades and lubricating strip do last as long as the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five blades did not nick my face as often as the Quattro or any other four bladed razor</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Pro Glide styler for about a month now, and must say it is a tremendous improvement over the Gillette Track II razor I have been using. It is easy to hold, gives a closer more comfortable shave, with absolutely no nicks or cuts, no matter how carelessly or quickly I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the higher cost per shave that I envision, since the Pro Glide Power Blades are so much more expensive than my previous Track II blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I would recommend the pro Glide Styler to anyone interested in easy and comfortable shaving.</li>
            <li> My current shave setup consists of a Gillette Mach 3 and shaving oil. It does a great job. While I enjoyed shaving with the Power Fusion Proglide, I&#x27;m just not sure that extra blades and vibration are worth any extra money. If you are happy with your current shaving system I can&#x27;t recommend switching.</li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor FREE through Gillette.  Like a babies bottom, my face is as smooth without much effort and rigamarole. 7 days later, the handle is sturdy, and the \\&quot;power\\&quot; glides on my face with ease, and is water resistant. One caveat, however is the strip on the razor head - like many other razors, it soon fizzles.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor in a free package that Gillette sent to me and was cautious at first. I had experience with this product before and did not find it any better or worse than it&#x27;s name brand competitors. But as it was a free package I of course gave it a shot. The first thing I noticed was the black gripping on it. It felt good in my hand and I felt that I had a good control on the razor in general. When I actually began the process of shaving I found that the handle fit securely in my hand throughout the whole shave and my grip did not falter once. It was one of the smoothest shaves that I have ever gotten from a disposable razor, and I was very impressed with the way it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that the disposable razor blades are very expensive. The package that Gillette sells comes with one disposable razor blade so do not let that dissuade you from their product. If you prefer the disposable shave to a power shave, then I would definitely recommend this product to you. The power capability that this disposable razor provides you with one of the best hybrid razor shaves around.</li>
            <li> I was very lucky to test out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle and I mus say that it is a vast improvement over my old Gillette Fusion handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a program run by Gillette, I got a handle to test and it is now my permanent razor for day to day shaving.  The rubber grip make it feel so comfortable in my hand and I barely notice that it vibrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design looks great as well.  I like the new colors and that it has more of a futuristic look.  Also the blue power button is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The Proglide Power handle is definitely something different, but I honestly have to say that I could do without it.  I just don&#x27;t know that the vibrating handle is necessary.  I received the handle through a program run by Gillette a few weeks ago to review the product, and after a handful of uses, I can say with certainty that I&#x27;ll be going back to my old handle</li>
            <li> This Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor was provided to me via a program ran by Gillette. It takes awhile getting use to shaving while the razor is vibrating. I think this comes as a personal preference or just something you have to get use to. I have tried it many times both ways, with it vibrating and without it vibrating. I just prefer to not have it vibrating. As far as the shave I received from the razor it seemed to be the same if I had the vibrating on or off. I always get really good shaves with this razor and I believe that is do to the handle being thicker and giving me better control than the razors on the market with the standard size handles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Gillette products since I started shaving and it&#x27;s been now 25 years of using their products, so I can say that I have seen the changes that have been made, the good from bad and now the close-to the best handle that feels right!  Just a bit about my skin type and hair type because lets face it everyone is different and will experience this product in their own way.  I have sensitive thin skin and black course hair on my chin yet more soft hair on the sides.  I use to break out in rashes easily so it was important for me to make sure the blades are always sharp and I shave with one stroke. This razor was provided through a program by Gillette and when it arrived I was excited to take it for a test drive and this is what I thought...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Looks:&lt;br /&gt;This handle design is by far the coolest.  With base being chrome, blue trim highlights,  black rubberized grip and on button that lights up when the unit is on. It also comes with a holder that&#x27;s well thought out.  At first I did not notice, but this thing can stand up right as well as flat down. Great for medicine cabinets that have little room or bathroom counters that need all the retail space.  An added feature is that when you are done and the unit is still wet the water does not fall forward but slides down to the bottom of the handle where the holder has a lip and scope that directs the water back or collects in the scoop.  Great if you want to keep water marks off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feel:&lt;br /&gt;I have average hands enough to just hold a basketball with one hand and slim fingers.  If the handle is too skinny it does not work for me so I needed a handle that will be able to stick to my hand when shaving the harder areas like the jaw line. The sides are ribbed and feel sold.  There is also more rubber on the underside so when you curl your fingers around the handle you got grip!.  They even have rubber grip at the very bottom of the handle where batteries go, great for the last pinky finger as it curls the base.  Basically the stickiest handle without looking all rubberized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave:&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve tried this with different lengths of hair from very small bristle (5 O&#x27;clock shadows) to very long borderline having to trim first (7mm hair length). In all cases this baby was able to give me a clean shave with no rashes or tugs.  The longest hair did take longer but the vibrations of the blades allowed it to glide with ease. When I went to wash the hair off the blades there no clogging! This makes it quicker to shave if you have to rush off to work. Getting the sideburns cut straight was a breeze. You also have precision blade that can clean up the line after you use the flat side.  The sound of the vibrations were a bit louder from the older versions but nothing close to the sound of any electric shavers.  I guess with louder vibrations you also get stronger vibrations, able to handle when pressing down on your skin.  Overall I get an excellent shave without worrying about nicks or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Con:&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I could say about this unit is the on/off button that lights up when in use would drain the battery faster than not having it on.  It&#x27;s great that the light flashes when the batteries are low but why have the light on the whole time while you shave? it&#x27;s not like you can see the button while shaving. I think a better use would be when you turn on the unit if the lights flash then that&#x27;s when you need to change the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent handling, well thought out, and my new favorite!  I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I received a free sample razor and I use it about twice a week. The blade gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years, with little to no nicks. The handle is great too - has a good grip and makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> The handle seem to do the job, of being a handle.  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference when I turned the power on; except, that it bothered my hand.  I used it for a week with it turned on on one side of my face and not turned on on the other side, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the shave.  I also like to soak my razor in hot water before I use it, to warm it up, but I was scared to do that with a battery being in the handle.</li>
            <li> Received the a free razor via a program run by Gillette and was impressed with the closeness and clean shave. Needing to shave everyday its one those items that need to last a bit, happy to say that the razor has held up for two weeks and I am thinking I will get a couple more shaves. With the price of these razors that&#x27;s a plus, enjoyed the product and will definitely buy in the future and recommend.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor left my skin feeling comfortable and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.  I received this free through a program Gillette is running.  Glad I was able to get one.  I will being using this razor from now on!</li>
            <li> I was given a Proglide as a promotion and I&#x27;m in love.  The subtle vibration makes the shave smooth and close.  It is a very interesting concept between an electric and disposable razor.  This product is well made and dependable.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this seems to do the job pretty well.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide power from Gillette give away program, and can honestly say I have had the best shaves of my life using this razor. The blades gave me an incredibly close and smooth shave. I thought that the handle was fine, I like the way it looks and feels, but I thought the shave was just as good whether or not I even used the power feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product based on how good the blade cartridges are. The handle isn&#x27;t much better than the previous fusion models.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how often I have changed razors over the years.  I have so many random handles from defunct razors, or just ones that didn&#x27;t feel right.  With the ProGlide Power, not only does the size fit me perfectly, but the feel of it is a notch above everything else.  While the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, I would have gladly paid for it in a heartbeat had I known how well it would compare to my old razor.  The button is easy to find, the rubber grip is perfectly done, and the overall look and feel is just incredible.It might not be the second coming of Jesus, but it certainly beats sliced bread!!</li>
            <li> I was able to this new razor against my current Mach 4 razor to see what all the hype was about and Luckily I got this product for free via a program run by Gillette.  Right out of the package it felt light and bulky, a feature I did not like.  I thought once I added the AAA battery that it would give it more mass like a typical razor but I was wrong. Upon first turning on the razor I was not impressed with the minimal vibration, but then again who wants something with blades shaking on their face.  I gave it a try and was impressed with the shave and the smooth finish but that would happen with any new blade. Overall, I was not impressed with this razor and didn&#x27;t quite understand what they were going here for.  I think that it comes as a little too gimmicky for me.  Save your money for a cheaper razor, it will still its job.</li>
            <li> I was provided this razor free of charge via a program run by Gillette. This razor provides an amazingly close shave. Also it is great for sensitive skin. The handle fits comfortably in your hand and it has a good grip to allow maximum control of the razor. I would definitely recommend this product for any one looking for a close and comfortable shave. My only complain is that I wish the replacement cartridges were cheaper but overall this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle gives a smooth, consistent, and tug-free shave. I received this free razor via a program run by Gilette and have been pleased with its performance. I started shaving using the ProGlide Power Handle after 3-days of not shaving. This was meant to simulate the typical amount of time that a Grizzly Adams Man lets his beard \\&quot;go\\&quot;. Ultimately, I found that the ProGlide Power Handle gives a close nick-free shave and I hope to add it to my shaving arsenal.</li>
            <li> I currently use the mach 3 turbo razor and really wasn&#x27;t looking to change.  Well Gillette offered me a promotion for a free Fusion Proglide Power razor.  I thought why not try it out and I did.  The Proglide Power razor was excellent.  Like I said I currently use the mach 3 turbo and have no issues with it.  The Proglide was just a tad better.  I made sure i used the same shaving cream to get an accurate comparison.  The first shave, as with most first shaves, was great.  It was smooth and a really close shave.  Now i am a guy who shaves every day for work and have stubble by noon.  The shaves after the first shave is what is important to me.  The next shaves with the Proglide Power were excellent as well.  The razor does not rip your hair out.  It feels smooth and doesn&#x27;t cut up your face.  I really liked the Proglide Power.  Now would I switch from the Mach 3 Turbo?  I don&#x27;t know.  The difference is not that great so it would depend on the price difference.  The Fusion Proglide Power is definitely a good razor and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase almost everything on Amazon, but I was fortunate enough to get this product in the mail for free from Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the price, this is a pretty good product.  I&#x27;ve been using ProGlide razor for almost two months and I really enjoy it.  The handle has a good grip and the blade does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a few razors in the past that are fairly similar, but I would recommend this one above them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a reasonable product, I&#x27;d recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I use now for my shaving needs. It gets so close and leaves my face smooth. I never worry about knicking myself like I do with other razors I have used in the past. I think this is from the think blades and the micropulses.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this razor as part of a program run by Gillette.  It&#x27;s a great razor handle that cuts nice and close.  I found it much better than of the other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. The vibration really does make a difference, especially on sensitive skin like mine. It has lasted longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school I tried to wet shave for the first time and I quickly found out that I have sensitive skin.  I thought at first it was the way I was shaving, but time after time I saw bumps on my face starting to form.  I came to the realization that I would have to stick to dry electric shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few years I decided to come back to wet shaving and I started to look into different shaving products like the Schick Hydro and Quattro. The two blades I mentioned before gave me a close shave, but I still ended up with bumps after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews for the Proglide Power Razor I decided to give it a try. The first thing I noticed about the blade was the overall presentation. The razor felt like a premium device and I also liked the vibration motion the device offered. After using an electric razor for so many years, the power razor made me feel at home in a weird way.&lt;br /&gt;I grew out my beard for about a week and used the Proglide and it went across my face relatively easy. I expected a rougher experience with the Proglide, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. The Proglide left my face super soft and the best part was I hardly got any bumps after using it for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor to anyone looking for a clean wet shave that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin bumpy and rough. I also got to try the razor free through a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was provided a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor System to use and review, complimentary of a program run by Gillette.  I am a lifelong user of Gillette razors so was excited when I was given the opportunity to test out the latest one.  And, just like every other Gillette razor I have used before, I was not disappointed.  This razor system has a lot going for it.  Its a nice looking razor, looks high quality, and like a well made product.  This razor gives an extremely close smooth shave.  It doesnt pull at all, even when shaving against the grain and does not matter if you shave daily or have several days of growth, either way, the razor is quality and does not pull and tug at the hair, which is very nice and very important when you have sensitive skin like I do.  The little moisture strip at the top of the razor seems to really help in allowing it to glide over your skin easily.  As well, the razor holds up to multiple shaves.  I liked that I dont have to use a new blade every single time I shave.  With this razor, I can use it several times and each time is just like the first in quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Power feature.  I think it aids in getting that super close smooth shave.  I also just happen to like the vibrating feature.  The handle is just the right size and fits in your hand nicely and the grips are nice to keep from dropping the razor when shaving in the shower.  The only thing I would change in this aspect is to provide a better grip in the thumb area.  I was comparing this particular razor to another Gillette Fusion razor I have and my other one has the thumb grip and I wish this one did as well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is another great high quality Gillette razor system.  Its worth the money, even if you spend full price on it.  I did get this one complimentary, but I often buy a second system so I have one for home and one for use when I travel.  My wife often finds great savings for these razor systems so it is possible toget it for a much lower price than the average retail cost.  The only negative thing I really have to say about it is that the refill blades are a bit pricey.  However, that said, if you use coupons and shop around you can get a good price, and this razor is well worth the money.  Its the best Gillette razor so far.  I am all for the five blade razors.  Until I used them, I didnt think they would be any better than what I was currently using, but after having used a high quality five blade razor like this, I couldnt go back to the regular cheaper ones.  Its easy to get spoiled to the super close shave this razor system provides!  And, its well made so the handle will hold up for years.  I like that they handles are made well enough to last as long as you want to keep them....and its only necessary to replace blades as they dull and an occasional battery replacement.  I look forward to using this razor for quite some time.</li>
            <li> the power is superfluous ，I used gillette 3 which i think is better than this one ，although this is the update</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use a razor in the new style. I am used to the old convention of using the Blade and found this as a great. It is pretty easy to shave even thick and hard beard, without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I find the Proglide a good improvement over the fusion blade. The shave is much closer and smoother than fusion.</li>
            <li> My origingal Proglide Power razor that I&#x27;ve owned for years is still functioning as well as it day on the day I bought it.  Since I like to have a second unit to take with me when I travel I&#x27;ve bought multiple &amp;#34;second&amp;#34; units for this purpose.  However, each of them has developed problems with the switch in that the razor turns on by itself and drains the battery.  This is yet another example of a greedy corporation getting even greedier as it sacrifices quality to boost its bottom line.  Pathetic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products all of my adult life (40+ years), and have always been happy with them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time now, I&#x27;ve been using a Mach 3 razor (1st generation), and have been very happy with it also.&lt;br /&gt;I would consider my beard full, and thick, just tough beard hair to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this \\&quot;Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Power Razor\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit intrigued by the addition of a battery, to vibrate the razor, with slight motion, possibly adding to it&#x27;s ability to shave even closer.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it&#x27;s use of 4 blades, and the thinnest used to date , that aid in less irritation, and a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this is a good razor, but the battery &amp; the vibration, I have tried it, and see no benefit. At least no measurable benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in closeness, or less irritation, than I got with my Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both razors give me a very close shave, with very, very little, to no irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s brand new, and have used it, so for now, I&#x27;ll keep using both, and try and decide which is actually better. At this point, I just can&#x27;t tell any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My end opinion is: if your already using a Mach 3, just stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;I think your best investment would be to find a good shaving cream/gel, that works best for you!&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a good razor with 4 blades, you may love this razor.</li>
            <li> This is a super sharp and good razor. It lasts for a long time and it works every time, I love it</li>
            <li> Smooth clean shave, even without turning on the power.  The only drawback might be it can&#x27;t get to the edge of those tight places (for me, under nostrils) because of the wider blade - for that, I can just follow-up with a small disposable.  Well worth it for the nice shave.</li>
            <li> Liked the light weight and overall great unit for the money. The unit is very modern looking too! Very good value.</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette ProGlide Razor this week, via a free sample program run by Gillette.  I have a few opinions that I&#x27;d like to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the handle on my razor was a bit too skinny, and with wet hands, I fumbled with it a little bit.  Not too big of a deal once I got used to the dimensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, the shave is nice.  There was very little irritation after I shaved, and for the most part, I was nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks.  The \\&quot;precision trimmer\\&quot; is awful.  I could not, for the life of me, get the bottoms of my sideburns to look clean, and it actually nicked a small cut on the underside of my earlobe as I was shaving near it.  This is an unacceptable design and desperately needs a flip-top to protect it.  I actually needed to break out my usual razor to trim up my goatee and sideburns, as the trimmer was just simply inadequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, and don&#x27;t need to trim around sideburns or a goatee, you could do OK with this razor. I, however, am going to stick to my preferred razor.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide power handle from a promotion from Gillette.  I received the product for free just to tryand I must say I enjoyed it.  The wider handle and grips made my morning shave easier than normal.  The handle only takes 1 aaa battery which is easy to change.  Its stylish and sleek.  I have not noticed if the power option really changes my shave at all, but time will tell and it certainly doesnt bother me while shaving.  I think in the long  run my overall shave will be closer and my face will be smoother everytime.  Thanks Gillette for giving me a chance to try out your product for free.</li>
            <li> Just received this as part of a free promo through GIllette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using a powered razor and it was definitely an experience. The pulses seemed to work pretty well and I got no irritation. I only used it once through a very thick 4 day beard and I grow thick hard beards. Overall i&#x27;m pretty happy with it and will likely purchase more blade refills for it in the future, changing from a very long experience with the Shick Quattro Titanium. We shall see how it works after repeated uses with a shorter beard.</li>
            <li> my wife loved the gillette fusion proguide styler first time in a while that i could trim without redness .This gillette fusion proguide styler is great The trim is handsome at least that&#x27;s what she says. My face is baby smooth where i want it to be.thank you</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor as a sample from Gilette. This handle works very well, but the vibration is stronger than I expected. I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the experience while shaving, but it did the job very well.</li>
            <li> i was recently selected to receive a Gillette Fusion Proglide power for free from a program that Gillette is running. the handle for this razor is perfect. its slim and easy to maneuver around the contours of my face and makes for a quick and simple shave.</li>
            <li> This is the first razor blade I have used that didn&#x27;t irritate my neck.  I always get razor burn on my neck and I was skeptical to try yet another blade but this one did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of the packaging with ease which is awesome.  I hate feeling like I&#x27;m going to lose a finger trying to open a package.  The razor fits snug in its holder as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I got a close shave and no irritation they are pricey and I&#x27;d have to think about spending this kind of money compared to the Mach 3 I have always used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor free from Gillette to test the product.</li>
            <li> I got this razor from a program Gillette was running. This is by far the best razor I have ever used. I have been shaving for 25+ years. I have a tough beard. I can&#x27;t use cheap disposable razors, they are dull after one shave. The blades on this are staying sharp with no nicks or cuts. Loving it! The single blade is great for under the nose and sideburns.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this blade.  Gives a close shave and cleans easily.  Really can&#x27;t go wrong with this blade!  Razor and blade were provided free from Gillette!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> As part of a promotion from Gillette I received a free razor.  I know it&#x27;ll sound like that clouded my review but honestly, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have sensitive skin and no matter what I try (all those new razors with 5-6 blades, the lubricating strips, etc.) I always end up bleeding or at minimum with my neck very red, bumpy and on fire.  Not so with this razor.  I&#x27;m able to get an incredibly close, clean shave with minimal effort and no irritation. Normally I&#x27;ll have to wait a couple days or so between shaves or else my skin is just too sensitive for a shave, with these blades I&#x27;m able to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor pivots so it follows the contours of your face really well without having to pull and stretch your face to get all those different curves.  I&#x27;m not really certain what the power bit does, I guess the vibration must perk up the hairs to get that extra close shave?  Whatever it is it works.  The precision edging blade is a really nice bonus for getting those extremely difficult little areas like right under the nose and for edging the sideburn area nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly smooth, close, irritation free shave, wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a great new product out on the market, it&#x27;s worth checking out!  I just received the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide® manual razor with Flexball™ technology.  I must say, I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, it makes shaving so much less of a hassle.  Personally, I have sensitive skin and there&#x27;s nothing worse than getting ready for a date, and showing up as if you&#x27;ve slaughtered your neck with a butcher knife. But, you won&#x27;t have to worry about anything, except maybe looking too good with this new razor from Gillette.  The new Flexball™ effortlessly follows the contours of your face, providing a much closer, and smoother shave.  The five blades are extremely sharp, with virtually no tugging, even after missing shave day for the past week.  This product well engineered, and I strongly recommend you go to your local department store and pick one up!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had this razor over a month and I can safely say it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. It shaves extremely smoothly, so smooth that a few times I forgot to turn it on and it still did great. I do have a beard right now so I&#x27;m just shaving my cheeks and neck under the beard, but it does great. The Proglide razor head has stayed sharp all month and it just glides. The downfall makes it follow all contours in any direction. Then the power vibrate feature keeps the razor from ever getting hung up. Today as a test I shaved my three day stubble without any shaving cream just some warm water. No problems at all, shaved as good as ever.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, best razor I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of using.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Works well. Leaves no residue or resistance during movement. Will recommend anyone to purchase. Great price for product</li>
            <li> I loved this razor. It&#x27;s the best to shave my face, because my skin is very sensitive. I recomend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I got 8 shaves out of one cartridge before having to replace it. It gave me a nice smooth shave with no irritation or razor burn. It has a nice large blade surface and I did not cut or nick myself at all. Another thing I really love is that it can be used it the shower, with no problem. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I have been using disposable razors for about a year. I have tried the Mach 3 and the Fusion before, including the products that vibrate as you shave. I stopped using them because they are so expensive. After using disposables for a year I can definitely say that the Fusion ProGlide is far superior than the cheap throw away razors. I don&#x27;t think the stabilizer does too much for me and it seems a bit gimmicky but the blade does swivel on its head.  For the price though, I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I used the previous version of this razor and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it, so I knew the new version had to be better, right? Well, no. I was expecting a better shave with this new Power Fusion razor but I must say that I am slightly disappointed. I did a side by side comparison of the old and the new by shaving one half of my face with the old version and the other side with the new version and for me, the old system gave me a smoother glide hence a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion for free to review I am hooked.  It shaves so well I don&#x27;t have to shave the next day.  I have used a lot of other razors and after having this for two weeks it still shaves great with out any tugging or razor burns to the skin.  I would reccomend this razor to all the guys who have a hard time getting up to shave like my self.  It gets the job done fast and easy and i have never had to go back over a spot.  Love this razor</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide is the best manual shaver I have used  to date. I have the MP3 shaver and it works but the replacement blades&lt;br /&gt;are harder to find,plus the ProGlide Fusion has five blades versus the three of the MP3.I give this a five star.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I have sensitive skin, and this razor gives an amazingly close shave yet doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. It&#x27;s great for shaving your head as well. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You can never quite beat the effect of a manual razor. As someone with very thick and coarse facial hair I was a fan of the fusion and the ProGlide with power option has been even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave. Cannot be beaten by even the best electric razors (I&#x27;ve tried the series 7 Braun recently).&lt;br /&gt;Power function ensures that the blades do not get caught as easily.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a very long time, months for me.&lt;br /&gt;Blades aren&#x27;t overly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None.</li>
            <li> This razor gives you a nice shave with minimal razor burn, if any. One issue I have with it is that it stops working for a bit if you hit it the wrong way. I&#x27;m an old fashioned razor user and I knock my razor against the side of the sink to get the razor trimmings off the blades. This razor vibrates using battery power but if you knock the battery loose a bit it&#x27;ll stop vibrating. Still a pretty good shave though. And it was quite cheap because Amazon offered a coupon.</li>
            <li> good quality, just don&#x27;t like black colour. usung for a year without any problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this razor as a sample. I have to say, I&#x27;m not as impressed as I hoped to be... It shaves well but no better then my previous fusion razor. The razor is OK and I will probably purchase it in stores.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have this razor and found it to be excellent. The 4 blades give a great shave and my wife, in particular, liked the FlexBall movement. She said that for areas like her knees (with funny angles), she&#x27;s never had a better shave. The only thing we were puzzled about was the vibration feature. Neither one of use want bouncing razors on our skin. We just choose not to use the vibration feature and be perfectly happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer the razor not display an LED light when the device is on to conserve battery.  Otherwise, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I received the razor free via a program run by Gillette. It definitely provides a smoother, more comfortable shave over a non-power razor. It uses AAA batteries and they last a long time. I will absolutely continue using this razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor and handle free through a Gillette program. The handle is thick and sturdy feeling; comfortable for a guy with large hands. You&#x27;re not going to accidentally drop this. The rubber enhancements look strange, but only help you when maneuvering the razor around your face. The rubber is essential if you use this razor in the shower, providing a no-slip grip when it gets wet. Very well designed!</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor recently from Gillette and have never been happier with a razor before. The handle is very comfortable and high quality. The power option on the handle provides for better precision and allows me to shave faster, as it removes hair faster than a regular razor. The razor conforms to my face so I get a close shave without cutting myself and leaves no irritation. The handle is light and shower proof, which makes shaving even easier. I wish the blade was a little large to cover more area at once, but otherwise I was very happy with the razor.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. I have trouble not tearing my face off when getting a close shave. The ads make this razor sound like it is targeted toward people like myself. It is lightweight and aerodynamic. If used correctly(trial and error required) it will actually give a clean and close shave. It works especially well if I have more facial hair. If I shave frequently, I am more likely to have irritations occurring. The vibration is not a gimmick. Whatever the science, vibrations make the shave closer and smoother.  But it also makes for a more expensive shave. It&#x27;s a decent product for sure. If you have sensitive skin it&#x27;s still not the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Thought the &#x27;powered&#x27; part would be a gimmick, but I have found the vibration actually improves shaving -- both in terms of comfort and closer shave.</li>
            <li> Very good razor one of the best I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
            <li> got it two years ago still works great. i get about two weeks out of a blade. the vibrating action is very good,the aaa battery lasts about six months. just keep a spar battery. the blades aren&#x27;t cheep. you can get them from amazon or ebay, cvs is a rip off and its hard to purchase them from a locked cabinet.  gs</li>
            <li> Thanks to a free program by Gillette I was able to try out this handle. It feels really good, almost an extension of my hand. It stays put too, no more slipping, or death grips to keep it from slipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, period.  I got one free to try from a Gillette program, and have to admit that while I use to think all razors are about the same, this one has completely made me rethink  that.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of a vibrating handle for a razor, I snickered to myself.  Who would want that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle from Gillette to try, and I must admit, I am sold!  I&#x27;m not sure if the vibration wiggles those rascally whiskers out or what, but it is the most painless shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I&#x27;m using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a razor through a Gillette program for free to try this sucker out and I was very impressed.  It&#x27;s easy to grip and solid enough to give you that quality feel.  The motor in the handle feels perfect without being overkill.  Even the luring blue light to show that it on is very aesthetically pleasing.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Joe</li>
            <li> I received the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor free through a program run by Gillette.  Upon using it the first time, I noticed how different it was with the new Power Handle.  The button to turn it on is in the middle of the handle and lights up to tell you that it is on.  Once you start to shave, the light vibration of the razor made my shaving seem like the razor just floated over my skin.  When I was done, the was absolutely no irritation and my skin was so smooth, a better, closer shave than I have gotten previously with regular non-vibrating razors.  I&#x27;m totally sold, will not us another razor again.  I can describe the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor in one word, FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I received this razor free through Gillette. After using this razor I would definitely purchase it. I would say it gave me the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> I got a great shave using the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power Handle along with ProGlide blades, which I received free through a promotion program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I&#x27;ve used a battery operated handle, so it was a little bit of an odd sensation against my face. This wasn&#x27;t at all bad...just different, so I was a little more conscious of my morning shave, which has become second nature to me.  Because of this, I went a little slower than usual, but I expect that I&#x27;ll get back to my normal speed once I&#x27;m more used to the pulse sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely got a better shave with this razor, although it&#x27;s hard to say how much of it was due to the pulsating handle and how much was due to the blade.  Either way, I was very pleased to see that my tricky areas only required one pass of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle was very easy to hold.  I&#x27;ve been using a similar non-power handle by Gillette for years, so this felt very familiar.  I thought that the single AAA battery might make the blade feel a little heavy, but it was a very comfortable weight.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power (what can I say, the commericals are catchy). I have used Gillette products before, to mixed reviews, but after doing my research, I decided to give the Fusion ProGlide Power a chance through a free Gillette promotion. When I saw the razor&#x27;s handle in the package, before opening, I thought it looked a bit bulky, but I just assumed that it was the packaging playing tricks. However, when I opened the package, I saw that it was no trick. The handle on the Fusion ProGlide Power is extremly bulky, much fatter than any other Gillette razor that I have ever tried in the past. The angles on the razor dont help either. I figured Gillete would have built a product that conformed to the user&#x27;s hand better, but this razor is not it. The lines on the razor are too straight, and the whole time while shaving it is noticable how uncomfortable of a handle it really is. For me, it was so uncomfortable that I couldnt wait for the shave to be done, instead of taking my time and enjoying my shaving time like a true gentleman. Also, the constant vibration, or \\&quot;power\\&quot;, only makes the awkwardness of the handle design more noticable and makes it even more uncomforable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a normal male, and part of the comfort of shaving is in the comfort of the handle, I would advise you not but the Gillete Fusion ProGlide Power, you will regret shaving with this handle.</li>
            <li> I received my razor free through a program run by Gillette and decided to give it a try.  I was a bit skeptical about using a razor with a battery in it.  I have always struggled with sensitive skin on my face and the Mach 3 has always been the razor of choice for me for a long long time.  Using this razor has made me think about switching.  My skin was not irritated after using the razor, which was a nice feeling for once.  The handle was nice to grip and I felt like I got a nice, close shave.  I am very happy that I tried this razor, and even better that I got it for free!</li>
            <li> I love the way the handle fits in my hand for the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor.  I received a free razor from a program by Gillette.  It lets me have complete control on what I&#x27;m doing and I came away with hardly any nicks and cuts!  The razor is a little noisy when turned on but it does the job great!</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure about using this but really happy that I did it works really great I suggest this razor to anybody looking for a smooth face!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular ProGlide for a while and didn&#x27;t think I could find anything I liked better.  But the Power handle kicked it up to the next level.  The weight feels good in you hand, the texture is easy to hold onto and the vibrating action makes for a great shave.  A+</li>
            <li> Recently, I received the Gillett Fusion ProGlide Handle for free via a program run by Gillette.  At first the handle seemed a bit large but is to be expected since there is a AA battery in there.  I tested it out after not shaving for a few days and the vibration mechanism helped to get a smoother, closer shave then other razors I have used.  I will continue to use this for sure</li>
            <li> Received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor free via a program run by Gillette.  The handle felt very comfortable in my hand while shaving, almost as if it was custom made for me.</li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor from Gillette the other day for free to try and tell the world what I think.  The handle on this razor is awesome - it is not like the others when it comes to size.  Most of the razor handles are small and narrow.  The Gillette ProGlide handle is thicker and easier to hold well shaving.  These has got to be the best handle invented.  I would recommend that everyone try this razor you will not be disappointed - I love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very picky about handles. Admittedly, bigger is better to fit in my gorilla mits and this one is larger than its&#x27; predecessors, It&#x27;s very shiny, so it is aesthetically pleasing. I also really like the blue light that lights up; it provides almost not benefit, but it&#x27;s blue and shiny and I like that. Even if I hadn&#x27;t got the razor from a Gillette run program I would&#x27;ve bought it for myself.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razors for 4 years now and won&#x27;t use any other razor ever again! What a clean close smooth shave with little to no effort exherted onto myself! Battery life lasts for quite a while and blades are super durable lasting longer than most others.</li>
            <li> This razor cut through 5 days worth of stubble quickly and easily.  I will definitely use this razor in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette MACH3 since 1995, and it&#x27;s served me well.  Matter of fact, I have two MACH3 razors, one for home and one for traveling.  The MACH3&#x27;s have always treated me well and did a great job for my shaving needs.  Like everything else in life, there comes a time when you need to upgrade it to something better and newer (don&#x27;t tell my wife I said this).  One day, I received a free razor offer from Gillette&#x27;s free trial program, I jumped on the offer right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was a bit leery of the \\&quot;power\\&quot; function because I was afraid to cut myself due to the vibrating mechanism.  However, once I started to shave, the power function didn&#x27;t cause any damage, so I am much at ease with it.  The blades on the ProGlide are SUPER SHARP!  When I was shaving, I didn&#x27;t feel the usual \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; sensation like I was used to.  I had to double check the shaved area to make sure the razors did its job.  The result was a super clean and smooth shave.  The handle was comfortable and had great \\&quot;gripping\\&quot; coverage; and the moisturizing strip also helps with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have is; since the blade is five-blades-thick, it was a bit harder to reach the nooks and smaller areas around my lips and chin.  The MACH3&#x27;s three-blade configuration was thin enough that I had some maneuvering room when shaving around the lip and chin area.  It&#x27;s a minor complaint and I have since grown accustom to it.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves great, considering it has 5, yes 5, blades. It was comfortable to use, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the vibrating part is for. I turned it on and used it as a vibrating razor and also used it as a non-vibrating razor. I didn&#x27;t think the shave was any better one way or the other.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is a unique style of razor that uses vibration to help lift and separate stubble so that it&#x27;s easier to trim.  The pulsating handle may initially take some getting used to but once you do, it&#x27;s an unobtrusive feature that does have some benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the handle itself.  It&#x27;s a well designed handle with soft grip sections that make for easy maneuvering.  I was able to easily switch the way I was holding the handle several times while I was shaving.  It feels like it was perfectly designed to fit snugly in the hand and it&#x27;s definitely easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved half of my face with the power on and half with the power off.  I didn&#x27;t notice much difference either way until I shaved those hard to smooth mutton chop areas.  Here, the vibrating pulses came in handy.  By using the vibration feature I was actually able to get a closer shave than without the vibrations.  So while in general the feature may seem gimmicky, it&#x27;s benefits are undeniable.  This feature brings together the best of two worlds: the smoothness of a blade shave with the vibration feature of an electric razor.  The on/off button is perfectly located and it&#x27;s set back enough so that it need not come in contact with water when rinsing the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor to anyone looking to revisit blade shaving; especially those that have been reluctant to put aside their electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor was provided to me free via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free ProGlide Power Razor from a program sponsored by Gillette.  This has been, by far, my best shave ever!  It quick, smooth, and comfortable.  There is a noticeable reduction in the drag from the blades themselves.  My only beef with the razor is the price!</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Power handle  for free via a program run by Gillette. The handle is fatter the most razors which gives you a firm hold on the razor and makes it easier to maneuver. I saw no value in the power assist. In my opinion it is just a gimmick to draw attention to the product.</li>
            <li> The handle on the Fusion Proglide power razor that i received free through promotional program run by Gillette has a very comfortable grip, therefore making shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the vibrating. It says that it make the shave less abrasive but I believe this may just be do to the number of razors that or on this handle. I still turn it on everytime I user it just because I&#x27;m not sure. I will also continue to use it every week.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have ever used a battery powered razor. I love the fact that you can use it in the shower and the handle has a battery indicator light. I got back from a 3 day trip and the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor left my skin feeling super smooth without any nicks and cuts that I normally get from a regular razor. Looking forward to using it again soon!</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing, having sensitive skin is though when finding the right razor. The way this thing just glides across my skin and gives me a close comfortable shave with out irritating my skin is amazing. I recommend this razor to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;The power handle is amazing as well it actually feels like a face message while your shaving. I also like the way the handle fits my hand</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide for free as part of a program run by Gillette. I have been using a high end electric shaver for a couple of years now and absolutely love the ease and quality of shave I get from it, so I was initially skeptical to try this out. Shaving was quick and effortless using the Proglide. I got a nice close shave, with no nicks and/or skin irritation. It didn&#x27;t take me any longer than using the electric shaver, and the skin irritation was far less and the shave much closer. It only took one stroke to remove all of the hair, and the added single blade on the back for trimming is a great little bonus. The handle feels great in your hand, and is not heavy at all, even though it has a battery powering it. I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a quick, close shave that will leave your face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I got this razor via promotion by Gillette. I had avoided this razor for the cost and the hype. After using it now for about a week, it is the best razor I have ever used!! The handle is very comfortable in my hand and washes up easily. I strongly recommend this to fight against razor bumps and ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This razor gave me an excellent shave. The price isn&#x27;t to hot though. The razor blades are good and do a good job. The whole vibrating thing is a little weird but works. The handle is way to bulky though. I would need a slimmer model though. I was chosen to receive the razor through a campaign ran by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Gillette to try and I got to say I liked trying this over the regular mach 3. the movement seemed to give me a smoother shave and reduced tugging on my face while I did it. the action was smooth and comfortable. it sort of slide across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after trying it a 2nd time same results, maybe I just took more time in using it but I looked as though they didn&#x27;t leave as much razor burn as I would sometimes get. it was a little weird feeling the vibrating with the blades on my face. but a few days after it just felt like a much more even and lasting feel of the shave compared to other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed its a bit of an attention getter in the bathroom, when a few friends were hanging out the color popped of it and they were curious about it seeing how it felt and were looking to go out and give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor &amp; cartridge through BZZAgent.  Otherwise I&#x27;m not sure that I would have purchased this product.  When it arrived in the mail I was excited to try this new combo blade razor/electric razor.  With the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I got a decent shave but nothing I would recommend. It was not smooth it left me wanting to shave a second time.  Not worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I have got free  Gillette Fusion Power Proglide Handle from Gillette. When i used first time Gillette Fusion Power Proglide Handle  No difference, what so ever. The \\&quot;larger handle\\&quot; is not that big of a deal, compared to the fact that a Powered Fusion has roughly the same handle size. The shave was no closer, it was no smoother, I could tell no difference what so ever in razors besides the pretty blue light on my new ProGlide. The Gillette Power Handle is very comfortable to use and i have told to my friend about it. It is realy smooth shaving, My wife even love it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never change to any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Gillette Fusion Power Proglide Handle razor.....</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion proglide power cartridge gave me a great shave but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the point of the power vibration. What is the vibration supposed to accomplish, does it vibrate the hair follicles to be a 1% closer shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it several times now with the power and without the power and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference other than the vibration is kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus sides are the shave is good, the handle is comfortable. The vibration thing is neutral, not really positive or negative, I noticed no difference. The negative is I noticed the blade is already starting to give out after just 4 shaves. This isn&#x27;t really different than my other razor but I was hoping for it to last a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was razor was provided to me by Gillette as part of a marketing program.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used gillette razors in the past (Mach 3, fusion, fusion ProGlide, all with various brands of shave gel. I&#x27;m currently using the Gillette Fusion HydraGel), but this is the first time i&#x27;ve used one of the powered handles.  I received the  Fusion ProGlide Power handle and blade as part of a free campaign run by Gillette and BzzAgent After using for about a week and a half, i&#x27;m definitely a fan of it so far. My skin tends to be a little bit on the sensitive side, and I also tend to get as much use out of my blades as possible, given the price of replacements. Usually after about a week, i really start feeling the difference in the quality of the shave. So far, after almost two weeks, the blade still feels almost new. One reason i&#x27;ve never used a powered handle up until now is that I wasn&#x27;t sure how annoying the vibration would get after using this handle regularly. Again, so far no complaints. The vibration seems to be enough to make a difference in the shave, but not enough to result in any annoyance or discomfort during use. The added battery also doesn&#x27;t add very much bulk to the product, which was another reason i&#x27;ve been hesitant to try these in the past. The product gets a 4 out of 5 due to the high price (which is not unique to this product).</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette. I normally use the regular Gillette Fusion razors due to problems with ingrown hairs. This shaves so smooth and close that it minimizes the amount of ingrown hairs. I only have to go across an area once and the hair is gone. I am able to get 5 uses out of the cartridge before I have to change it. I can&#x27;t say this blows away the non powered one as the shave seems to be equal. I will definitely continue to use this razor in the future.</li>
            <li> Upon getting this Gillette fusion ProGlide razor i have used this for the past week and have gotten the smoothest shave i have ever gotten. No Nicks and or razor burn even on my neck. The Razor also gets under the nose with the flip side, very easily. Since using this razor i have recommended it to all of my friends.My Fiance&#x27; used it on her legs and got a very smooth shave and now she would only use the Gillette Fusion Proglide power Razor.This razor was free and was provided by Gillette via a program.</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion power glide handle is the most comfortable. There are rubber grippers on each side for a no slip grip. The battery chamber twists off for easy insertion of the battery. This whole system is awesome. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gillette is known for great razors, and The Pro Glide Power Razor is no slouch.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. The shave is close and smooth without any razor burn.  It does all this with or without using  the micro pulse feature.  It tickles at first, but is a fun novelty.  Personally I don&#x27;t use the feature.</li>
            <li> I received the razor to try for free and must say I am a huge fan.  The blade along with the vibration allows a close smooth have.  I would like the price of the blade and refills to be less expensive however, after trying this and using it several times I do not think I will be going back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor thru a free Gillette offer, I was skeptical at first. I have been a user of their products for over 7 years and thought that I had found the Mach III Power to be the best that they made. Man was I amazed to see that this razor puts that one to shame. They may have converted their hardest to please customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the start it was off in the right direction. There isn&#x27;t anything that I can&#x27;t stand more, than having to fight to get your product out of its packaging to use it. I was very impressed with the packaging on this product being the easiest to open that I have ever seen. One tab on the back and pull! That easy! Great Start!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loading the battery on the unit is the same as my other model so no problems there. The one thing I did notice is that the handle itself was a little more bulky and had a feel that you knew you were holding it, unlike some disposables that are so light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large groves on the handle were nice for gripping, especially since your hands get wet and possibly slippery when shaving with shaving cream or gel. No problems with managing it. The vibration feature I felt wasn&#x27;t as smooth as the Mach III that I usually use. It seemed to be a little slower, but this could have been the battery that was included with the razor. I found that the button for the on/off of the vibration wasn&#x27;t very easy to push and that it would have been better placed on the razor if it were closer to the blade by about an inch, or above the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The illuminated power button was a nice touch but not necessary. It was nice to see that it had a feature to shut off if on longer than 8 Minutes, great for travel. The other feature that I was impressed with was that it will flash when the battery is low, much better than it just dying on you mid-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor contours nicely to your face and offers a great shave. The handle could use a little tweaking, but overalla great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving this 4 stars because I feel that the layout of the handle and its button didn&#x27;t impress me. When I need to shut it off I would rather not have to fumble with two hands to get to the button and push hard, I would rather be able to do this with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would still highly recommend this product to others for its unbelievably close shave! My best yet!</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor through a promo program run by Gillette. Clearly, a ton of thought and research went into designing this handle. The power button is recessed just enough to make it such that you will not turn the razor off accidentally. However, I have never had a problem with turning it on or off on the first attempt. The battery compartment is secure, and will not come off while shaving. However, an easy twist allows the end to come off giving quick access to the battery when it needs to be changed.  The non-slip rubber surfaces allow for usage in the shower with very little risk of the razor slipping, even when your hands are covered in lather. All in all, this is a fantastically engineered handle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used multi-blade razors before and frequently I had trouble getting the stubble washed out from between the blades. However, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge does not have this problem, despite having more blades than any other razor I have ever used.  Additionally, it delivers an extremely close shave. I had no problems with nicks anywhere, including my chin and neck. On top of that, the precision trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge took care of the hard to shave area under my nose. All in all, the blades on this razor are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I loved the handle.  I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle via a Gillette program and tried it out for 2 weeks.  It made life easier when shaving around my jawbone (rough spot for me because I have some very strong gray hairs that don&#x27;t take kindly to razors).  However, I was not overly impressed with the micropulses.  I thought that it would be this Earth shattering change in the way that the razor felt and the shave closeness.  It wasn&#x27;t.  I liked the razors alone without the micropulse turned on.  I did not notice anything particularly different with the micropulse turned on.</li>
            <li> I received this handle from Gillette for free and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The side grips on the handle are great! The razor doesn&#x27;t twist when you shave like some other models I&#x27;ve used. Good size too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery operated micropulses didn&#x27;t really do much for me. I couldn&#x27;t tell if they were helpful to my shave or not.</li>
            <li> Goodbye Shick, hello Gillette!  In my opinion, this is the best razor on the market today!  I highly recommend this to anyone.  Thank you Gillette for running this program and allowing me to participate!  Don&#x27;t take my word for it, run out and try it out for yourself! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette proglide razor as part of a special offer put on by Gillette. I&#x27;m very happy with my proglide razor. Before this I owned (and still own) a Gillette mach 3 power razor so I&#x27;m used to the power razor style. The handle is solid, the battery compartment seems really watertight and it appears durable. The battery compartment lock was a little tricky to figure out at first but is pretty simple and the button is a little tough, you really gotta give it a good push, but all in all it&#x27;s a pretty great product.</li>
            <li> I received the free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette. For a little extra thickness (holding one battery), the razor fit snugly in the hand and did not feel that difference in thickness, but when the button is pressed it did make the shave smooth. It appeared as if I was running a self propelled razor. The 5 blades was a little scary to start with and I could not comprehend how the 5 blades can make such a smooth shave and believe me it did. About the cost for the cartridges I firmly believe that the longevity and great shave will outweigh the additional cost.</li>
            <li> I have only owned traditional razors in the past and recently received a Proglide power handle through a program run by Gillette and I am now a total fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle feels very comfortable and the power glide also helps me to get a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration seems to help my skin react to the shave and gives me a good feeling during and after.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be chosen by Gillette to try out their new pro glide power razor at no cost, and boy was I blown away. This is the most amazing razor I have ever tried and man have I tried them all. When I first got my razor I was thinking \\&quot;How could a razor with a vibrating handle work better than the boring old razor Ive been using for years.\\&quot; Well it did. The blades seemed to glide over my face with almost no effort, and left me with no razor burn. My only problem with it is the cost of replacement blades, pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor free through a program run by Gillette.  I have to admit I was a little skeptical of a razor with a vibrator on it, seemed gimmicky.  I thought the razor worked overall pretty good.  The handle was a bit more bulky than a \\&quot;normal razor\\&quot; but pretty comfortable and ergonomic.  The real test for me was a dry shave.  Most times I use an electric razor followed up with a blade razor (no shaving cream).  This is where the product really showed that it is different.  Even with a new blade on a normal razor it does grab a bit.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide was markedly smoother.  I&#x27;m not sure how it will do under continued use, but it shows promise.</li>
            <li> First off Gillette provided me with a power proglide to try and I love this razor. This review is of the handle.  I should start by saying I have large hands (think XL size gloves). Also, the razor I was using prior to this was the Gillette Fusion manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is great, I love the design and weight, but it&#x27;s not perfect.  I&#x27;ve used this razor a good 10 times now, and here are the things I like best about the handle:&lt;br /&gt;1. Convenient place for me to put rest my index finger during a shave.  Also, I use that finger to add a little leverage/pressure as I shave down my face.  This is a nice feature for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Size/Weight:  The battery adds a little, but I like the weight and feel of the handle in my hand.  The handle is a little chunky, not bad for me since I&#x27;m XL, but keep in mind if you have small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Look/style: It looks stylish.  I thought the feeling would pass after my first shave, but the handle just plain looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not perfect:&lt;br /&gt;1. The rubber pieces on the handle are a little slippery for wet hands.  This isn&#x27;t a huge deal once you&#x27;re aware of it, but remember the device vibrates.  During my 2nd shave the razor slipped out of my hands once.  Every time I shave I notice that it&#x27;s a little slippery.  It seems like Gillette could probably have come out with something to add a little more grip.&lt;br /&gt;2. This is personal prefernce, but I don&#x27;t love the tingly feeling of the handle in my hand.  Tough too complain about this since I like the blade vibration on my face way more than I dislike the handle vibration.  I&#x27;m getting used to it though (and this is my first power blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it.  So should you get one?  I would highly recommend.  I&#x27;ve tried all of Gillette&#x27;s manual razors and this is the best that&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle offers a nice and clean shave. I got it free from Gillette so I gave it a try. It&#x27;s very sturdy. I normally have to go over my face at least twice but with Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I only have to shave once. Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power extensively and compared to my Mach3, I really don&#x27;t see a difference as to how the handle enhances my grip while shaving dry or wet.  It&#x27;s a handle with some rubberized grips just like other razors.  Gillete touts this handle as having the ability to improve grip while shaving but I just don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> This razor seems similar to the regular Gillette Fusion (which is the razor I use), except this one has a AAA battery that makes it vibrate. The vibration makes this Fusion feel a little like an electric razor -- or how I remember an electric razor feeling, because I haven&#x27;t used one in years. The sensation wasn&#x27;t particularly pleasant, but would be acceptable, I guess, if the razor was delivering a superior shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me a free sample of the Gillette Fusion Proglide.  I&#x27;m using it to trim around my beard. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle for the quick touch ups.  It fits the hand like no other. The blades are the closest, smoothest I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have used tons and tons of razors, and I recently joined and cancelled Dollar Shave Club as well. When it comes to Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, everything else seems flat. The best shaving experience, closest shave, less strokes, saves time, is clean, very easy to clean are just some of the many supreme advantages this razor has compared to others. I am addicted to this razor</li>
            <li> I used to use a cheaper brand to shave 5 times a week for work. Although I did get a clean and smooth shave it seemed that by 4 o&#x27;clock I was victim to the shadow! I was excited about trying Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power to see what it could do for me.  I got it sent for free as part of a program run by Gillette. I was first intrigued by the power handle and wanted to see what difference that would make.  The power handle was very comfortable in my hand and once turned on I immediately felt the difference with the pulses. I was able to achieve a superior shave than before, one that lasted all through the day! The blades were thin and provided a smooth shave without irritation. At 5 o&#x27;clock I still had a clean and smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I received the new proglide from Gillette  to try out and my first impression when I got it \\&quot;things have sure changed since I first started shaving in 1967\\&quot;, some for the better and some just for the change. Having 5 blades is a bit much for me but they do a complete job in giving a good shave. The handle feels substantial and is very comfortable in my hand. To be honest I don&#x27;t get the vibrating part, I tried it the first couple of shaves and really didn&#x27;t see much difference and forgot to turn it on at least 75% of the time after the first couple of tries. I did like the handle enough to decide to get refills, but when I saw the cost of the refills I decided that I didn&#x27;t like it enough to pay the prices they wanted for them, think at least twice as expensive as other refill blades.</li>
            <li> Great Razor.  I typically get razor burn after I shave and after using this razor, I have zero.  I definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I received a free ProGlide Power from Gillette. I was hestitant on using it because there is no way I need to have a razor with a battery in it. Well, this provided the smoothest shave I have ever had. It was comfortable in my hand and never once slipped because of the side grips. Will definitely be purchasing replacement heads so I can keep this handle in use!!</li>
            <li> Tried out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor against my usual Schick Hydro razor as part of a promotional program by Gillette.  I was a bit skeptical at first about the power feature of the razor but it seemed to be a benefit.  Overall I was happy with the razor but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d pay any extra for it or the refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; smooth shave with no irritation&lt;br /&gt;The power function seemed to help with the shave and really helped cleaning the blades out&lt;br /&gt;Blades seemed to last a long time without dulling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Struggled with heavy two-day beard&lt;br /&gt;Refills a bit pricier than my usual Schick razor</li>
            <li> I received the razor free through a promotion with Gillette, and I am now a true believer in this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically have to shave everyday with other razors - I just can&#x27;t seem to find anything that could cut my stubble well enough to leave my face smooth for more than a day at a time.  Now I can at least go 2 days between shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle fits nicely in my hand, which gives me great control during my shave.  I thought the \\&quot;power\\&quot; was going to be gimmicky, so I tried without the power on and then with it on - talk about a world of difference.  With the power on, the razor cut through my stubble with the greatest of ease - and left my face smooth - much smoother than I have gotten with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that I&#x27;m a Gillette user now - and actually look forward to shaving again!</li>
            <li> This razor was great. One to two passes at most. It gave a real clean shave that lasted which is not always the case for me.</li>
            <li> The blade is thinner and finer, you do not feel a tug when shaving, it glides effortlessly over your face, arms, legs and neck.  The handle has a great grip, with a bigger handle, that does not make your hand slip when shaving.  I got this razor free, it was provided via a program run by Gillette.  I am finding myself fighting with my wife over the razor...she loves it too!</li>
            <li> If one thing is consistent, it&#x27;s that Shaving Technology continues to advance.  From the disposable razor to multiple blades to ergonomic handles, there&#x27;s always something new in the Shaving aisle.  When I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I was a little skeptical of a vibrating razor.  However, it&#x27;s able to mimic the smooth and effortless glide of an electric razor while shaving as close as a blade.  (Of course, it&#x27;s actually 5 blades, along with a lubricating strip!)  It almost felt like I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all until I felt my face and how smooth it was.  Thanks to the folks at Gillette for providing a free razor to test.  I loved it!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the comfortable grip and overall heft of the ProGlide Handle.  I received it free from Gillette to try.  It felt good in my hands, not too small, not too bulky.  The grips gave me a good mechanism for firm grip.  I never thought the vibrating handle would have made a difference in how it shaved, actually being worried about being cut by the vibrating blades, but instead I most impressed with the smoothness of the pull as you drew the blades across your face, and the result was a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette provided me this razor on a promotion program and I have been using it for over a week now.  It still shaves very smooth, but I am not certain if the power function really does anything.</li>
            <li> I recently got a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power shaver for free and figured I would see if an upgrade from my previous razor would be worth it.  The power handle that is attached was great for a power shaver. It had a good grip and was not difficult to handle after it got wet. It maintained the grip throughout the shave no matter what got on it. The button was well placed and easy to get to with one hand. Overall I was very satisfied with the shaver.</li>
            <li> I used to use the older Gillette Fusion power and I liked it, a lot.  At some point though, I got pulled into the viral trap and made the switch to dollar shave club.  I really enjoyed the convenience of home delivery, but the quality of the shave wasn&#x27;t quite there and the comfort of the handle wasn&#x27;t even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving a free razor through a program from Gillette, I am definitely making a switch again.  There is just no comparing the closeness of the shave.  I do not see any stubble until late , late in the day, and for a guy like me, that&#x27;s impressive.  My face feels so much better after using the  Fusion Proglide Power.  And my face looks a lot better too.  I mean, it really is like the difference between a Chevette and a Cadillac.  Not only do you get a closer, smoother shave, it&#x27;s just easier.  The blade really does glide across your face and the handle is way more comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.  There&#x27;s no tug, there&#x27;s no nicks, there&#x27;s no missed spots, just a clean, close comfortable shave.  I have a thick beard and need to shave every day.  By the end of the work week, my face can get pretty irritated.  But after a week of the Fusion Proglide, I am happy to report that my face feels as good as it did on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real down side is the price.  That was the only thing that turned off of the Gillette products to begin with.  But after experiencing this and have the dollar shave club products to compare to, it really is worth it.  I mean, is there much more important to a man than his face.  And now that I noticed that you can save a little bit on replacement cartridges with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe an Save program, I have to make the switch.  Plus you still get the convenience of home delivery.</li>
            <li> Like any other man, I typically do not like the act of shaving, but I liked using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the power feature. With the power on, it felt a lot smoother and glided effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the manual shave. It felt like any other five bladed razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t see myself paying what the Fusion ProGlide Power is selling for. This particular razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> This razor works flawlessly ! I have sensitive skin and a small acne problem on my neck and always seem to nick my neck in a couple of places. I have been using this razor for a month now and not one cut or nick ! I really like the new handle, its a little thicker and the grip seems feel more controllable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor free from a program through Gillette but, I would definitely tell you that it is worth the asking price.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and I received this threw them and I got the box and quickly opened it with excitement. I put some shaving cream on and I shaved my beard, and I will just tell you it is the best but the blades are a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I must admit I got this razor free from Gillette. I have used Gillette products for years and have always overall loved them. Slight things i would improve and this Razor hits those improvments. One thing I always hated was when I was traveling it would turn on and by the time I got where I was going the battery was dead. With the Fusion ProGlide Power I do not have to worry about that, the button doesnt turn on unless you want it to turn on. Also I used to drop the razor or it would slide out of my hand while shaving not anymore with the improvements made by Gillette. I would definately recommend it to all of my friends and family and I will be purchasing a second for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I received one of these razors free as a promotion from Gilette. I was a bit skeptical about the vibrating head adding much to a shave but I was pleasently surprised. Shaving with the vibrating head has made my face feel smoother and for longetr than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve been able to go two days without shaving and not look like a hobo....my only slight complaint is that the on/off button is in a place where I sometimes hold the razor, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle free to try via a program run by Gillette. It&#x27;s easy to handle and maneuver. The Mircopulses from the battery powered handle get the job done quick and easy! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this after seeing it at the store.  Luckily I was able to get one for free through a program run by Gillette.  I was pleasantly surprised that it did in fact make a difference in the smoothness of my shave.  I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but if it holds up I will definitely spend the extra few dollars for it next time I need a new one.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette, I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor free in exchange for the testing and review.  This review is for the handle only.  Cartridges are not discussed here.  I have been using Gillette Fusion Regular (non power) razor handle for the last 3 years and was excited to try the Power Handle.  I tried other brands in the past and did not like them, so I am a firm believer that Gillette makes a good product.  First impression - looks very nice, Power Handle is slightly bigger and thicker than regular one and blue light looks cool when you turn the handle on.  Functionality - the light is covered up by your hand when you are shaving, so there is not much point to it rather than perhaps looking cool and possibly draining a battery faster.  I only used the Power Handle 8 times now and the battery power does seem to hold good so far (battery does not feel drained).  At first vibrations feel strange when you are shaving, but you get used to it very fast and I think it makes the shaving go a little faster.  Bigger power handle is nicer in my opinion compared to the smaller regular handle, however I do not like the grip on the power handle.  Regular handle has rubber part all the way to the top, and Power handle does not.  Power handle has plain plastic where I place my index finger when holding the razor for a close shave.  In my opinion the rubber piece on top side should be bigger.  Regular Handle provides better grip, but Power Handle is easier to hold.  If you have big hands - you should like Power Handle more.  It also seems that power handle has slightly better angle than regular one.  Overall great product, but not much better than regular, and I expected better.  Regarding the shave - honestly both Gillette Fusion Razors, Power and Regular, provide great shave and it is hard to see the difference.  I like Gillette razors, but see no major difference between the shave you get based on the handle.  Cartridges is what makes a difference in a shave in my opinion, not the handle. I would have to point out that due to the vibrations of the power handle I find it easier to rinse and I think it washes out cleaner than the regular handle because of the vibrations.  Overall - another great product from Gillette, better than other brands, bigger size is a step up and vibrations make it easier to clean.  Yes I would recommend Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle.  If the price is not much more than regular handle definitely go for it!</li>
            <li> I received my razor from a program Gillette was having. I tried the razor on one day of growth and also 3 days. On one day the razor performed beautifully and resulted in a close shave with no razor burn. On the 3 day beard, the razor had a tougher time getting through and didn&#x27;t rinse out as well but it still resulted in a close shave with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I obtained my razor through a free program via Gillete, and though I initially was skeptical of the power handle, I gave it a try.  It seemed like more of a gimmick than something that would actually help the quality of my shave. This has provided me with a great shave!  And considering that I shave my head also, I have more area to cover :)&lt;br /&gt;My head is fairly tender but provided me with a clean and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;The handle was very comfortable to hold and did not slip from my fingers even with soapy hands. As I shave in the shower, this is a usual concern as I hate cutting my head :) also as it is prior to really waking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all, in all, this razor performed excellently and I am now struggling whether or not to toss my old razors or not.</li>
            <li> I received the ProGlide Power Razor free through Bzzagent.com. This is a great razor. It uses battery power to create an extremely smooth shave. I would recommend the ProGlide Power Razor to anyone in search of the perfect shave.</li>
            <li> Free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. The handle had a superior grip. I received the best shave of my life. It was very close. Best of all, I have not cut myself. I absolutely love this razor. Highly recommended for great shave.</li>
            <li> [DISCLOSURE] I received this razor free through a program from Gillette. I am generally an electric user - I last used a blade back in the days when 3 blades was considered extreme. Razor technology seems to have come a long way. 5 blades does shave faster than 3, and the vibration gives it a soothing feel. (I&#x27;m not sure it buys you much as far as a closer shave.) In general I still prefer an electric. I just cut myself too often with a blade. Maybe I&#x27;m just a klutz. Still, for the price difference between this and an electric, the shave is comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one big gripe with it, however. I found the handle to be quite anti-ergonomic when holding the razor in a non-vertical position. For example, when shaving under my chin, the grip I used caused a fair bit of fatigue in my hand. Because of this, I would use this razor in a pinch, but likely would not make it my full-time shaver. The advantage of the vibration, for me, doesn&#x27;t offset the need to make the handle so thick and stocky to accommodate the battery.</li>
            <li> The grip on the handle works great for my bi-weekly shaving needs.  I received this as a freebie from a program that Gillette is running.  I am very grateful to have been included in the freebie program as I always wait for the last second to purchase my next batch of razors due to the costs.  I also felt that my shave got closer with the capabilities of the powered function.  It is a great product.  Thank you Gillette.</li>
            <li> Received the product from the Gillette Program for free. I really do enjoy the Gillette Fusion Proglide. The Power handle was really nifty and cool as well! It is one of the things that makes the overall product amazing. It has a slim neck with a nice and easy grip. It won&#x27;t fall out of your hand as easily as other razors do. You put a few batteries inside and then twist it to close it. I trust that this is really tight and genius to help make the product waterproof. Turn the battery on and the handle vibrates a little, but the rubber gripping absorbs most of it so it will allow for a smooth shave. I was scared to try my first shave, but after the first stroke I had to continue. Really great!</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to mention that I don&#x27;t normally shave with a razor.  I prefer to use an electric razor.  However, when I received a free sample through Gillette, I figured that it was worth giving manual razors another shot.  After using this razor for the past few weeks, I can honestly say that I like it a lot and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this razor is the high quality design.  The handle is much thicker than the standard disposable razor, which makes it easier to grip.  The handle also has a generous rubber grip around the handle and another rubber grip area near the razor itself where you can rest your thumb or index finger depending on how you are holding the handle.  The handle has a power button that makes the razor vibrate gently while you&#x27;re shaving.  The vibration reduces the friction when you shave.  I&#x27;ve been using my razor almost every day for the past few weeks and still haven&#x27;t had to change the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor itself, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It provides a clean shave without irritating your skin.  This has been a problem for me when I&#x27;ve used other razors, which is one of the main reasons why I switched to an electric razor.  I also don&#x27;t like to use shaving cream since I keep a mustache and goatee.  I really just shave to clean up the areas around my facial hair.  I just applied a little bit of soap to the areas that I needed to shave, and that was all I needed to get a nice clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this razor especially if you&#x27;ve been having trouble finding one that provides a clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle free through a program run by Gillette.  The ergonomic handle is the perfect size for your hand and helps you get the perfect shave.  Even after getting the Power Handle wet, I had no problems with this razor.  The grips on the razor are helpful and allow for precision shaving with no worry of dropping or fumbling around with the sharp blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle gave me one of the best shaves I have ever had!  It allowed for a quick, easy, and smooth shave, which was very satisfying because I am not always able to get the smoothest of shaves.  The Power Handles came through though.  This is a razor I can see myself purchasing in the future.  If there was one problem with this razor, it&#x27;d be that it didn&#x27;t come with any refills. Great shave.</li>
            <li> I obtained a free razor via a program run by Gillette and was surprised by its size. It has a battery in it so expect it to be larger than your average razor. That being said, the grip was a comfortable and shaped ergonomically. The overall shave was good but I could have done without the micropulse feature as I did not get the sense that it gave a smoother shave with it on or off. Overall, a good razor at an expensive price.</li>
            <li> The ProGlide Power handle is comfortable to use--way better than disposables. The bumps and rubberized ridges help you keep a grip when your hands are wet/oily/full of shaving cream. The vibration seems to help any level of compatible cartridge (i.e., no need to always get the super-premium proglide carts) give you a closer, more comfortable shave. The (included) AAA battery powering that handle lasts for a VERY long time... easily more than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this handle if you&#x27;re a Gillette user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received a free razor through a program from Gillette, but I was already a loyal user and already had a Proglide power handle for months before.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor through BzzAgent to test and review.  My normal razor is the Schick Hydro 5.  To test the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, I put a new blade in each of the two razors and proceeded to shave the left half of my face with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and the right side with the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test platform is my face.  I grow thick hair quickly.  I also do not shave daily.  Thus, the hair in the test ranged in length from approximately 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch.  While shaving, I made sure no other members of the household could see which side of my face was shaved with the Gillette and which side was shaved with the Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each shave, my wife and 9 year old son would feel my face and tell me which side they thought was smoother.  After a half dozen shaves, the conclusion was that the Gillette gave a slightly better shave, but it was close enough that if I had not shaven half of my face with each razor, no one could have noticed a difference.  It really required a side by side comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I have had with razors in general is that they quickly become clogged, preventing the blades from cutting any more hair.  Both razors passed the hair out the back of the razor with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor also has a vibrating feature that I used on every shave.  My first instinct was that vibrating a razor at my thoat was a bad idea, but it turns out that I didn&#x27;t get any more nicks or cuts with the Gillette than I did with the Schick.  They both shaved close with almost no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shaving comfort, the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor lost out to the Schick Hydro 5.  The vibration of the Gillette made shaving feel like running in sand.  It felt like the blades would cut half way through the hair, and then pull back before cutting the rest of the way through the hair.  This made shaving with the Gillette take twice as long as with the Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if I needed a razor, and I couldn&#x27;t get my regular Schick, I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad in buying a Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, but it would definitely be a second choice.</li>
            <li> I only use electric razors because i have extremely sensitive skin and razors irritate it very much. This Gillett Fusion proglide was very impressive.  It provided a close, smooth shave with no nicks, or razor burn, or irritation.  It also felt comfortable to hold. I was very impressed with this razor and  highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is coming from a lifetime G user!  Best thing they ever did was to send a free one in the mail when I turned 18.  Anyways I often feel that if you like what you use then use what you like.. why change??  However I recently had the option to try this over the first generation one I had been using for years.. I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor for FREE via a program run by Gillette. It indeed makes it better, a closer, a more comfortable, and quicker shave!! simply amazing!! Yes blades can cost but really worth the money over the typical razor..</li>
            <li> To be clear, I was offered a Fusion ProGlide to test by Gillette. My normal razor is an Edwin Jagger safety razor. Which leads us to my first point: The blades for the Fusion ProGlide are around 4 bucks each. With my safety razor, I can get 10 Feather blades for about the same price. The Fusion boasts 5 blades, and they tout them as being narrower than others, with a coating designed to cause less \\&quot;tug and pull\\&quot;. I would think that any adequately sharpened blade would also prevent \\&quot;tug and pull\\&quot;. The handle takes an AAA battery, which causes the handle to vibrate. It also increases profits for Duracell, Gillettes sister company. If it sounds daunting to place 5 vibrating razor blades onto your face, relax. The vibration isn&#x27;t really noticeable, and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s even a benefit, judging from the closeness of the shave, and the United States court system, which judged Gillettes claims about the razor to be \\&quot;unsubstantiated and innaccurate\\&quot;. It seems gimmicky to me. I have an extremely coarse beard, and spent years searching for a close, comfortable shave. I ended up with the shaving kit that our grandfathers used. My single blade, double edged safety razor doesn&#x27;t clog, and I normally shave every other day. The 5 blades DID clog with my coarse hair. I have no patience for that. The accompanying literature says that the built-in \\&quot;guide comb\\&quot; directs hairs into the blades, at the \\&quot;optimum angle\\&quot; for cutting. I don&#x27;t know what the optimum angle is, but I have trouble believing that every hair requires the same angle for a smooth cut, given that I have to shave in several directions. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong. There&#x27;s a trimmer on the back that I don&#x27;t use. It gives a close enough shave when new, but the clogging was a deal breaker for me. I&#x27;m spoiled with a single blade that rinses out with ease. The vibrating handle? Meh. Call me a luddite, but I don&#x27;t need gimmicky tech in a razor. I need a comfortable handle and a sharp blade. The Fusion handle IS comfortable and sturdy, but not as sturdy as my brass and chrome standby, I&#x27;d bet. All in all, it&#x27;s a fine razor, but the cost of blades and all of the unnecessary bells and whistles make it seem a bit silly to me. And the shave? My Edwin Jagger still shaves closer.y, but not as sturdy as my brass and chrome standby, I&#x27;d bet. All in all, it&#x27;s a fine razor, but the cost of blades and all of the unnecessary bells and whistles make it seem a bit silly to me. And the shave? My Edwin Jagger still shaves closer.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product through Gillette. I really enjoyed the experience. I have previously used the Gillette Fusion Manual razor and though I was suspect, I did notice a difference when using the power model. It feels as though there is less drag so shaving is faster and somewhat more effortless. If there&#x27;s any hygienic task worse than shaving, I&#x27;ve yet to find it, so anything that makes it easier is well worth the added expensive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a trial of this razor through a program run by Gillette. I currently have a Personna Magnum 5 razor, and I&#x27;m pretty stocked up on blades from Costco. But I wanted to give it a try. I was really surprised. At first I was a bit skeptical about the whole battery powered handle thing, but when I tried it out, it seemed to actually help keep the shave comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went away for a weekend in the mountains and decided to do a split face comparison between the two razors. While I didn&#x27;t feel much difference in the smoothness of the shave itself, I did notice a difference in the act of shaving. The vibration from the handle really did make for a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been switching between the two over the course of a few weeks, and I have noticed what feels like a slight dulling of the ProGlide&#x27;s blades, where the Magnum 5 is still cutting smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be finishing my supply of Magnum 5 razors, but after that? Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: A comfortable shave, a good feel in the hand, a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The blades seemed to dull after a few weeks of use. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor many times BEFORE receiving a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. It has a micro pulsation technology, and that keeps the razor from pulling at your skin. So it makes it easy to shave against the grain of the whiskers. It does require batteries,(that comes with), I prefer shaving while in the shower and have never had any issues using it there. The battery area seems to be water tight. The razor is a nice weight and easy to handle while your shaving. As far as razors go, and I&#x27;ve used many, this is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> Having been avid user of the Gillette Fusion Razor for the past three years, I didn&#x27;t think there was going to be much difference when I picked up the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, which I received for free via a program run by Gillette.  Boy, was I wrong.  I have extremely sensitive skin and suffer from the dreaded razor burn and bumps when a blade gets used for more than 2 weeks.  I have had the same blade on this razor for almost 4 weeks now and I am happy to report no razor burn or bumps!  It&#x27;s a miracle!  Although I am not sure why, I have noticed that the lotion strip on the blade has not faded to white as it typically does with the regular Gillette Fusion Razor blades.  That was always a clear indication that I would be shaving at my own risk if I did not change the blade.  The power feature wasn&#x27;t something that I was all that excited about but have grown to love.  The gentle vibration must do something to help reduce the risk of razor burn and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this razor to others (and have done so already).  Especially if you have sensitive skin.  The only thing I miss from the regular Gillette Fusion Razor is the extra blade on the back for trimming your sideburns.  And if that is the only downfall I am happy to sacrifice that extra blade for a consistently smooth and non-irritated post-shave glow.  Definitely going to continue using this razor as although the blades are slightly more expensive than its predecessors, they last a LONG time.  Glad I took a chance and made the switch.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the power handle.  I received it free via a program run by Gillette.  I usually only shave once a week, as my skin is sensitive.  With the power handle, I can add about a day to that.  It seems to cut a bit better than a non-powered handle, so it works for me!</li>
            <li> I received this free razor via a program run by Gillette.  Before receiving it though, I was already a Gillette user.  The razor provides a smooth shave.  I&#x27;ve attempted using other razors, but they don&#x27;t provide the shave that this razor does.  Also, these blades last longer than other razors.  The \\&quot;power\\&quot; aspect of it just seems to make what was already a smooth shave even smoother because you don&#x27;t feel it going across your face.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> In general, my skin is a bit sensitive and my whiskers quite rough (especially the greys). Even when I was younger I have never been able to shave with a single blade razor. Later with double blades I got \\&quot;passable\\&quot; results, but not s particularly close or easy shave. With the advent of more blades (3 or more), in general I&#x27;ve been much more satisfied with the quality and easy of shave. They have been a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently through a Gillette program I was given the opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor. I can say without bias that the Proglide Power is easily the closest shave and most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever received from a handheld replacement razor system. The razor itself matches the best of other products I&#x27;ve used and the other features (Lubrastrip, Blade stabilizer) work well. But for me it is clear the micro-pulses/vibration that the razor has works wonders on getting a super-easy and close shave. In whatever way it works, IT WORKS! I really didn&#x27;t expect any significant difference, but after using it and then going back to other manual shavers, the difference is noticeable. I encourage everyone to give it a go. At least for my particular needs, this is now my standard shaver and I can&#x27;t imagine any significant improvements (although I&#x27;m always game for upgrades).</li>
            <li> I got mayfree razor was provided via a program run by Gillette, I razor worked well the shave was smooth but the blades do not seem to last as long as I would like my facial hair grows fast and sometimes I have to shave 2 x a day, if my facial hair grows a couple of days the blades snag on my hair. The handle is comfortable in my hand and I do like it wish the blades would last longer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who says he loves it.  He doesn&#x27;t nick his face as much and loves for power part of it.</li>
            <li> After I easily installed the battery, I noticed that this handle is nice and sturdy. It can feel a little plasticky at times, but over all it handles well. I realize this is because of the vibrating mechanism and the battery compartment, but the thickness of the handle actually makes the razor easier to use. If only the regular handle come this way. The vibration, though, is pretty much there for a gimmick. I noticed no actual benefit to the vibration over using it without the vibration.</li>
            <li> Gillette recently sent me a sample of the fusion proglide to replace my existing razor. As soon as I opened the box I saw that there was a battery for my handle. I have never had a powered handle for a non-electric razor before. I was quite skeptical at first but after a week of use I am no longer a skeptic, but a proglide believer. Unfortunately the box does not do justice with explaining the function of the powered handle. I had to hop online to figure out why the handle needed a battery. The battery gives a micro pulse that allows for the razor to cut with barely any sensation that the blades are touching the skin. I was amazed that the handle has a microchip which ensures that the same amount of power will be delivered and not taper off as the battery is dying as my electric razor use to do which resulted in painful shaves as the hair would get caught in the blade. The low battery light easily tells you when you will need to replace the battery. The best thing about the handle is the large grip that gives you good control of the shave and does not feel like it will fall apart after a few use. This thing is built to last! I am glad to replace my old razor with this!</li>
            <li> I received this razor handle from a program ran by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how well it works! It shaves close and without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I got this razor handle for free, so now I can focus on just having to buy refills for it.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey they may be, but you def. get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Men are creatures of habit.  If something is not broke then don&#x27;t fix it.  I have been a faithful user of the triple blades and when I saw that the quint blade came out.  It sound to me like overkill because being a creature of habit, and not wanting to try anything new.  I said naw I will pass.  It is just something to cut me five times as opposed to three.&lt;br /&gt;I bit the bullet and chose the single Fusion  blade and handle- Just to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;I took out my old trusty and shaved.  and then I took out the new Fusion  blade on the block and shaved the other side of the face. The five bladed Fusion gave me a closer shave on top of the 3 bladed shaver I had been married to for the last 12 years.  Needless to say I am in the process of getting a divorce.  Goodbye tradition and habit and hello young lover. Fusion you are my only blade through thick and thin until you are no more!  Thanks Gillette for creating another Great product for Real Men!</li>
            <li> I was given a free razor which was provided via a program run by Gillette and am so glad I was.  Like the Fusion, the Fusion ProGlide comes in both manual and powered version (opt for the power -- it does make a difference) and the powered version includes a low-battery indicator light and automatic shut-off.  Like it&#x27;s predecessor, the Gillette Fusion Power Razor has nearly an identical handle and weight (although the Fusion ProGlide has slightly larger rubber grips). The Fusion ProGlide&#x27;s power button is a little larger and is illuminated when the razor is on. I liked the fact that the power button on the updated razor is flush with the handle, making it a bit harder to turn on accidentally. The handle makes it so much easier to shave your face. It works with the razor cartridge to glide over your face in perfect form to give you the cleanest, closest and perfect shave. This is, without a doubt, the best razor on the market today.</li>
            <li> This handle is a very quiet and powerful handle. The grips are very nice and let you grip the razor no matter how wet it is.</li>
            <li> The blades really work effectively. They provide a close shave and a safe shave. they also speeded up shaving for me. I thought this was the best blade I ever used and intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used electric razors and have always stuff with traditional disposable razors. They&#x27;ve always served me well. So the notion of a powered manual razor really confused me at first. Was Gillette trying to basically reinvent the wheel? After signing up for a program through Gillette and trying out their Fusion Proglide Power razor, I think they did just that! At first it was a bit strange that the entire razor was vibrating when powered on. But once I started shaving I found that the razor was just gliding over my skin with ease. Much less resistance or the tugging feeling that can occur with normal razors. I feel it gave me a closer shave than I&#x27;m used to. Also, rising out the razor along the way was extremely easy, no clogging up behind the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is very comfortable to hold.  At no point did it slip out of my hands.  Also the on/off button does not interfere while shaving.  Yes there will be a AA battery needing to be replaced periodically, but I feel that is not an issue with the results this razor provides. Plus it&#x27;s a snap to twist off the end to replace the battery in just seconds. I do encourage others to try the product out for yourself since you have to feel it in action to truly understand how well it works!</li>
            <li> Although I usually don&#x27;t like shaving, I gave a try to this new &#x27;power handle&#x27;. I received it for free, and thought to give it a chance. I Found it very convenient and very ergonomically suited to the palm of the hand. As usual, Gillette&#x27;s blades are superior, and this one is no different. Multiple blades work the facial hair out in one pass - no need to do multiple passes and irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the price of the blades. Although, as said, they are top of the line - the price still makes you think twice before buying.</li>
            <li> I was Shaving with a manual 5 blade razor and thought I was getting a close and clean shave&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle and it changed my whole shaving experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power handle makes the 5 Blade cartridge shave closer and smoother than any other razor I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;The Power Handle maneuvers closely,cleanly and makes your face feel so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I now look forward to shaving everyday and will recommend this product to all the men I know.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power for free as a part of a program Gillette was running. I was very pleased with the handle. The vibration is strong but not overpowering and the handle is thick enough that it&#x27;s not hard to keep a grip on with wet hands. I was also pleased with how simple it is to instal the battery and turn it on. I was shaving in under a minute. Coupled with the new Gillette razors I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sturdy power razor handle that provides a sure handed shave.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle further augments the shaving experience, with the Micropulses allowing for an even closer and smoother shave. The handle itself is broad and easy to grip. Moreover, the texture of the handle allows for a comfortable shave, and facilitates a better grip even when wet. I am giving this product only 4 stars through no fault of its own, but rather because the high quality of the Gillette blades themselves and the high quality shave that they provide on their own render the added benefit of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle somewhat less essential. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> This is a review of the handle itself that I got free as a promotion by Gillette.  Overall, I liked the shave that I was able to get with the handle, but I felt it was a little too annoying to use to really justify the closeness.  I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ll use it, and knowing this, I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it and am glad that I got it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;- The shave did seem closer&lt;br /&gt;- It looks to me like blades fit this handle are the same that fit the non-vibrating handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- The handle is more bulky and a little harder to handle while shaving in the shower&lt;br /&gt;- The price is higher than a normal handle</li>
            <li> I received this handle for free through a program run by Gillette. This handle goes with pro glide cartridges only. It gave me a smooth shave with no bumps. It is a great product if you want to upgrade your razor. I have been using my Mach 3 for 7 years now!</li>
            <li> This razor feels like quality the 1st time you pick it up. The close shave is unparalleled. No need to go over the same spot over and over. I wonder how long the sharpness will last? I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks straight. I was fortunate to have tried this for free through a Gillette program.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from gilette to try , for which I was very pleased to try the product, the handle performs with high efficiency.  This is the best razor on the market for me and my needs, the blades shave close and the trimmer on the back side is an added addition to have when trimming your facial hair or body hair. I would highly recommend this razor to any skin and hair type.</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion proglide power handle was provided to me by Gillette and I think it is a welcome change to the world of shaving. You can tell that alot of thought went into the power handle because of the features like the auto off function that activates after a certain time or the easy to install/change battery compartment. I love it and plan to keep it until I need to buy a new one just like it!</li>
            <li> Just got this the other day through a Gillette sponsored trial. Does an amazing job. Clean, smooth shave, no nicks, no cuts and super fast.</li>
            <li> I recieved the gillette fusion proglide from free through a program with Gillette I I love the shape of the handle it feels like a ball and it is easy to maneuver big enough to hold small enough for comfort. great design.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with th Gillette Fusion Proglide Power a few times so far and have had a good experience with the power handle. I recieved a free sample of the razor from Gillette. My thoughts on the handle it that it has a great feel when I use it to shave. I thought that the vibration would feel strange on my face, but it actaully felt soothing. The only thing was that the vibration from the handle made it a little trick to shave in smaller places on my face. So I had to turn it off. Overall it was a great shave and I would use it again.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette shaving products in the past and this has proven to be the most superior that I have experienced thus far. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle system allowed me to shave without any irritation, anyone with sensitive skin knows that using an uncomfortable razor can ruin your entire experience with the product and brand all together. I would reccomend this razor to anyone with easily irritated skin. The blade was provided to me for free by a program run by Gillette. Additionally, the blade system was much more precise trimming around existing facial hair compared to other blades I have used in the past. This product gets an A in my book and a new home in my shaving arsenal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Fusion razor series, but, unfortunately, for me these novelties were useless. The new and improved handle glows with a blue light and provides a vibrate function to help eliminate the tug on the skin. However, I wouldn&#x27;t pay extra for that feature alone, because that effect can be achieved by spending an extra minute in the morning. Would I buy it? Definitely not, or at least not at the current price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: The product was provided to me via program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> the handle on this razor is incredibly well balanced and fits well in the hand, giving me ultimate control of the blade. easy to clean and well built too! Thanks to Gillette for providing the razor for me to review!</li>
            <li> I received a free razor from a Program ran by Gillette! This razor blades are extraordinary! I am so glad to have been able to try this for free. But to be honest I will always buy the Gillette razor blades. This blade gives me a shave so close. I don&#x27;t have to shave as often. I will continue to recommend this razor/blade to everyone! My guy friends had to ask me to stop talking about it, because I was so thrilled about it. I know Gillette razors are kind of pricy but there are HIGH VALUE coupons everywhere! So you can get them cheaper if you are worried about the price. It&#x27;s worth every penny! I highly recommend the Gillette fusion proglide cartridge to everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> This was sent to me as a Gillette promo. It gives great shave, maneuvering around my face and double chin with no nicks or burns. The handle is big for my women groomers, but fits my hand fine. The trimmer worked well! Cost of refill is only downer. The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette!</li>
            <li> I like this handle.  I do think the vibrating feature gives a smoother shave than not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I wish it was compatible with the Mach3 heads as I personally feel that the Mach3&#x27;s are better than the fusion&#x27;s even without the vibrating feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to point out that I received this handle at no cost via a program provided by Gillette</li>
            <li> When i got my razor my first impression was good. Neat style and cool colors. I was excited to try it and left my stubble grow. When i tested it tho i really didn&#x27;t understand the vibration. Its like a gimmick for grown men. I use a similar razor of the same brand that doesn&#x27;t vibrate. It does just as good a job. I am not convinced anyone needs the vibration. It shaves good but the refills cost so darn much i am going to switch to an electric razor. I wont buy another one.</li>
            <li> I initially received a free Gilette Fusion Proglide Power razor through a program Gillette was hosting, and I love it. It&#x27;s hard to believe a handle this grippy and comfortable is hiding a battery compartment. All in all, a very clever design, and very slim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that I&#x27;m usually dealing with wet hands that could potentially slip on the handle on my razor, I felt the Proglide Power&#x27;s handle was secure the entire time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li> I received this razor through a free program offered through Gillette.  At first I thought the handle was a bit big.  But after using it I found that it offers a manageable grip on the razor, even when wet.  I don&#x27;t know whether or not the vibrating handle contributes to the overall closeness of the shave, I have not seen any scientific studies.  Overall, this power handle is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the design of the new handle.  I shave in in the shower and with the new grips on the side I never worry about dropping it.</li>
            <li> I received this handle to test via a special program from Gillette. I found the handle to be very ergonomic, and slip free; even when wet. The blade cartridges loaded and unloaded with ease, and the battery powered handle provided a smoother than normal shave that was nick, cut, and razor burn free; compared to a non-battery powered shaver handle. I like the battery power light that provided indication of when the handle was on or off, and whether the battery powewas low. Overall I am very pleased with this product and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a program run by Gillette, I had the opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor. This review is specifically for the handle, which I was pretty impressed with. I was a fairly skeptical of the &#x27;power&#x27; aspect of this razor, thinking the vibration was more of a gimmick than anything else, but turns out I was wrong. The gentle vibration and micropulses definitely added to the overall closeness and smoothness of my daily shave. I handle was big &amp; &#x27;grippy&#x27; enough to handle while wet. I would absolutely buy this product.</li>
            <li> a couple weeks ago I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle via a program run by Gillette. I have used the regular Fusion blades for quite some time and also had the opportunity to try another Gillette product, the Fusion Power Trimmer. As expected, this product offered the same, if not better, smooth shave. I&#x27;d say that I was satisfied and certainly not disappointed. That the battery is replaceable is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> Before I start, I do have to provide the disclosure that this razor was provided via a program run by Gillette at no charge to myself.  Now that we have that out of the way let&#x27;s talk about my new Proglide Power Razor.  Before I received this razor I was using an M5 Magnum 5 blade razor.  I had no problems with that razor but felt I would give the Proglide a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression on the razor is that it&#x27;s a nice look.  How important is the look of a razor?  None really, but I felt it was worth mentioning.  The packaging is nice and I found that it opened easily.  No wrestling with the plastic and almost severing a finger, a huge plus in my mind!  It comes in a really nice hard case which you can set the blade on to.  This will be nice if I wanted to take the razor with me when travelling.  Weighing the alternative of just throwing the razor in a shaving bag, I feel this provides a little more protection from the blade snapping off or any other issues I may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one question I think you guys all are dying to know the answer to ... 5 blades?  Really?  Is that necessary?!  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have an answer.  Is 3 blades enough?  4?  5?  Where does it end?  The razor does give a great shave so I&#x27;m going to guess 5 blades is a good thing.  I slack on shaving more than I should so when I do get around to shaving it&#x27;s a bit more difficult and rough than it should be.  One thing that really helps is the conditioning strip on the blade itself.  After 6 shaves the strip still looks pretty good.  I don&#x27;t know how many shaves the strip should last and I will assume it&#x27;s going to be different for every person but I&#x27;m happy to report that it&#x27;s still holding strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next question you have (now that I&#x27;ve answered the blade question) is if the \\&quot;power\\&quot; part of the razor is needed.  I&#x27;ll admit that it does look nice when you press the power button on the handle and does light up a very nice blue!  Other than that I don&#x27;t see a need.  I did an experiment where I shaved half my face with the power on and the other half with the power off.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the ease of shaving or the smoothness of the shave.  There&#x27;s a chance it could make more of a difference when the blade becomes a bit more used but I&#x27;m not that far into using it to know if that is a true statement.  The handle itself does have a good look to it though and it felt comfortable in my hands.  It didn&#x27;t feel like the razor was going to slip out of my hand or that I was going to drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this razor?  Sure!  It&#x27;s a great razor.  I am going to assume it works better than the 1-4 blade razors as there&#x27;s no other reason they would add the coveted 5th blade!  Based on pricing on razors I would say that this fits right in.  It&#x27;s not a cheap razor but not at the high end either.  It&#x27;s a great razor for people who want to spend a little more on a razor without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide handle as a free sample from Gillette. After just one use I immediate realized that I was getting a much closer shave than my previous razor. This was evident from the smoothness of my skin after my shave as well as the absence of my usual shadow at the end of the day. It&#x27;s important to note that I was using a new Gillete Fusion ProGlide blade on my previous razor as well so I&#x27;m fairly confident this improvement was from the power handle itself. What I also liked about the power handle is that it has a slightly larger grip to accomodate the battery. This causes the razor handle to fit my hand more tightly which accomodates a much more controlled shave. Overall this is a great little device. This is particularly true if you, or your spouse, is a gadget friendly guy like myself.</li>
            <li> OK, this seemed a little weird to have a razor handle that vibrates.  This razor was provide free to me to try as a part of a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few strokes to get comfortable with the feel of the razor handle vibrating in my hand.  I wasn&#x27;t sold on the idea until I finished shaving and splashed water on my face to rinse.  I immediately noticed that my skin was absolutely smooth with no sign of any stubble.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor now for two weeks and I am still impressed by how comfortable it is to use with no drag or pulling.  This is my new razor!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test the new Fusion Proglide Power Handle along with the Proglide Power Blade. The blade seemed about on par with most other top of the line blades, however when combined with the Power Handle, something happens... something good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I was VERY skeptical of the \\&quot;Power Handle\\&quot;. I mean, what is a little vibration really going to do for your shave? The answer is, a lot. I still have no clue what is actually going on that makes this system work but I have not had a CUT FREE shave in years. I shaved off about a weeks worth of growth in a few passes, used the same old shave gel I always use, and viola, NO CUTS, NO RAZOR BURN and I think it even went faster than my usual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t skimp on razor blades, I use fresh, top-of-the-line blades and power-less handles, but apparently I have been buying the wrong ones. This FAR out performs my setup. I am convinced.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlibe  for free through a program run by Gillette. I&#x27;ve never owned a battery operated razor in my entire life, believe it or not, so this was a unique opportunity for me to try this out. I appreciated the handle and how it didn&#x27;t slip out of my hand in the shower while my hands were wet. The button that turns the razor on and off was easy to use, even with my oversized fingers! The compartment that houses the batteries was easy to open and close thereby making it easy to replace them when necessary as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shaving went, I was very pleased with the performance of the razor. I had no pulling or nicks and this was with 5 days of growth - I had decided to really grow my hair out to give it a good test! It gave me a very close shave, there was no stubble when I was finished. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the razor and the results that I received.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but my face hates crappy razors. I used to use this product (or the last version of this product maybe? They used to be all orange and no blue) for a long time and had no issues with it. Then my gf, being a loving and caring gf, tossed it out one day and bought me a new razor. One with only 3 blades. 3 tugging, pulling, excruciating blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I saw this was an add on so I bought it to go along with another item that I actually wanted to order and I&#x27;m glad I did. I love this razor and while I&#x27;m sure practically no one will read this, I wanted to add my 5-star rating to the other 5-star ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, a quick pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. 5 really thin blades means it takes less swipes to get the same closeness that half a dozen (or more) swipes on my last razor failed to get. More smooth, less razor burn for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The \\&quot;moisture pad\\&quot; on it actually lasts longer than 2-3 shaves. Something I&#x27;ve vehemently hated about all other razors is that little strip gets used after like one shave. Are you kidding me? These don&#x27;t last overly long, but it&#x27;s way longer than most of its competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There is way less \\&quot;tug and pull\\&quot; with this razor. The 5 blades seem to do really well at hacking the hair to pieces before it has a chance to tug. It really is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve been able to find using a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Refills for this thing are freaking expensive. I don&#x27;t grow facial hair that fast, so it takes me a long time to get through a razor (I only shave 2-3 times a week since I have the gift of a baby face). But people who grow the Amazon jungle on their face every day will probably have to shell out a lot of money every year for refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Power option is kind of gimmicky. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and really didn&#x27;t feel like there was much of a difference with the shave. This feature is probably for the aforementioned \\&quot;burly\\&quot; men above who grow whole fields of hair on their face every day. For the baby face like me who takes half a week to grow a 5 oclock shadow, the power option is pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have been using this razor for a long time and I do love it. I can&#x27;t rave enough about how disposables and inferior razors tear my face apart. Last week was my last shave with the \\&quot;crappy\\&quot; razors and I cut myself 4 times. That&#x27;s literally the damage I&#x27;ll do with this razor in a full year. It&#x27;s very high quality and works very well, especially for pansy faces like mine (darn sensitive skin). I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I grow some pretty thick facial hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for something that gives me a close shave. I&#x27;ve been trying different razors and I really enjoy this one. The handle has a great grip to it. I also enjoy the micropulses. One of the best razors I&#x27;ve used! I received this free razor, it was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a program run by Gillette. I was apprehensive about trying a power razor but thankfully I was pleasantly surprised. The packaging was easy to open and it has a handily designed holder for the razor. My only gripe is it only comes with one additional cartridge. The actual shave experience did not pull at my skin or give me a rash. I definitely noticed it left me with a much smoother face than my old razor. I also like that the battery can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is AWESOME! I have sensitive skin where it always feels like the hair on my face is being pulled out by the roots. The vibrating handle seems to help cut through the hair and closer to my skin easier then others. I highly recommend this product if you have the same issue. I was able to try this free razor from a program run by Gillette. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Great razor! Glides over the skin so easily. Love how smooth it makes my face feel. The blades are great, haven&#x27;t cut myself yet.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette. For years I have tried many razors and systems that have come out on the market. One new concept came to the market that I didn&#x27;t understand or grasp. It was a battery-powered, pulsating \\&quot;power handle\\&quot;. I had long resisted by finally tried it. The Pro Glide Power Razor has me pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great ergonomics, easy to grip. VERY impressed with the way the razor moved over my face. It was very smooth and did not have the ripping effect of a typical shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this handle.</li>
            <li> Kept thinking - can a handle really be that big a deal? The short answer is - yes. The biggest plus for me is that the fit is different in my hand than other razors. It fits my hand better and lets me twist and turn with little effort. Much better grips than my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The micropulses raised my eyebrows (figuratively, that is...). But, I must admit that since I have started using it, my shave is smoother. While I like my old comfortable razor that I have had for years - I REALLY appreciate the new Proglide. Who would have thought?</li>
            <li> Having been a long time user of Schick Hydro 5 razors, I kept seeing ads for this razor, and was curious. Signed up for a Gillette trial of this product, and can I just say they&#x27;ve nailed it with this one. One of the reasons I switched to Schick years ago, was simply because the razor caused less irritation on my neck than the Gillette I had been using. After only 2 shaves with this one, I found my irritation clearing up even more. Not only that, but the shave was very close, and smooth. Being one with very coarse stubble, I can burn through blades pretty quickly, I&#x27;ve noticed that all though the refills cost about the same as my old SChick, they last longer, which is just an added bonus. Looks like I&#x27;ll be using this one from now on.</li>
            <li> I was able to try a free razor thanks to a program ran by Gillette. I was very impressed with the handle. The handle it is easy to hold. The button is easily turned off and on. Overall I had a great shaving experience. I had a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I received a free ProGlide Power Handle Razor from Gillette to try.  This razor is quite good.  The wide handle is great for use in the shower because the grips help you hold on to it when wet and soapy.  The blades are really sharp and provide a nice clean, smooth shave.  The replacement blades are quite expensive, however.  The Power Handle feature is ok, I don&#x27;t really think it was much better than not using it, but others might be impressed by it.  Overall this is a good razor and worth trying out.</li>
            <li> I am loving this razor.  The blades cut sooo smooth.  Even after I have not shaved for a few days.  My only issue is that that blade refills are so expensive.  I usually use Schick and I am thinking about switching... but the cost is double.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this razor free from a program Gillette was sponsoring.</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle was given to me by a Gillette-run program. I have used Gillette products for 40 years so I was anxious to try it.  I have used this handle for 3 weeks. It has a battery that vibrates the handle. This is the first handle I have owned that requires a battery. FIRST IMPRESSION - I remember that I was surprised that the handle was very light, even with the battery installed. Very comfortable to hold. OVERALL - I really like the handle. I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last, but I liked the feel of the vibration as I shaved.  Does it really make a difference?  Can&#x27;t say for sure but it seemed like it helps. I checked prices at a few stores and found that this product is comparable to other brands for similar features so it is not cheap. Since I have to shave every day, I don&#x27;t mind spending what it takes to get a great shave.</li>
            <li> I recently obtained a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor via a program run by Gillette. I have since shaved with it a number of times and was impressed with how easily this razor does slide right across my face. I&#x27;m sure that will change as the blade gets older and duller, but right out of the package this razor provides an easy shave. It takes a lot less effort to shave my face now compared to the disposable razor I was using before I got my Fusion ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the handle itself, it has a sharp appearance and I like how it has a substantial size to it. When gripped by the black rubber portion that circles around the top, sides and back just below the neck of the razor, the razor fits firmly in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem for me arises when I hold it by the lower part of the handle. Although I start my shave holding it near the top of the handle, I find that over the course of the shave, I wind up holding the handle lower over time. Perhaps that is due to shaving different parts of my face in order each time and holding it differently as I go through the process? I don&#x27;t know for certain. What I do know is that the razor almost slides out of my hand when I hold it lower because there is no black rubbery grip on the top part of the lowest part of the handle. There is on the bottom, however, which doesn&#x27;t seem to do any good. The same rubber that outlines the word \\&quot;PROGLIDE\\&quot; on the razor&#x27;s underside should also outline the word \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot; on its top side. I don&#x27;t know if the omission of the rubber was a decision based on aesthetics or what, but I could use that extra rubber grip area when trying to finish my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problematic lowest part of the handle is also where the battery is loaded to allow for the Micropulse action. While the blue light that lights up when the button is pushed up looks cool, I don&#x27;t think the Micropulses actually enhance the shave itself in any way. I think I even remember a lawsuit from a decade or so ago in whichone of the big razor companies (maybe even Gillette) got slapped on the hand for claiming that these vibrating razors helped a person get a better shave by stimulating the hairs to stand up. That was rightfully declared wishful thinking by the court, so I&#x27;m surprised to see products like this persisting in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of my overall shave, I&#x27;d prefer that companies like Gillette focus on practical innovations like making blades that last longer instead of trying to distract me with a bright light and a buzzing razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is by far the best razor I have used in years! Everyone buy one. You&#x27;ll be very happy</li>
            <li> I recently received the latest Gilette Fusion Proglide Power for free through a program with Gillette and was pleasantly surprised with the quality after being a longtime user of the Mach 3. The Proglide has a nice sturdy grip that can be held comfortably and the vibration allows for an easy and clean shave. The only criticism I would have is that it doesn&#x27;t quite match the precision of the Mach 3, however, it&#x27;s superiority in other categories far outweighs this. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I got the product as a free promotion from Gillette. At first I thought the vibrating was a gimmick. I enjoyed it once I tried it though. The vibrating gives you a slightly more comfortable feeling. It&#x27;s not like an amazing thing, but I found myself turning it on every day, even though it would be easy to just pick it up and shave. The weight of the handle and battery feels pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor provided via a program run by Gillette.  The razor handle itself is very comfortable to hold.  The 5 blade head, although rather large, gave an incredibly smooth  shave.  Skin was soft with no cuts or nicks.  When I turned the razor on (vibration) and shaved, it seemed to pinch while shaving.  Definitely was better when used in the \\&quot;off\\&quot; position.  I have a mustache and shaving close to the mustache is rather hard due to larger razor head.  It&#x27;s tough to see where you&#x27;re cutting when you get close to the edge of the mustache.  In larger areas on the face, the razor did fantastic.  It did not clog and rinsed out with ease.  I didn&#x27;t believe the claim that it was waterproof in the shower, so I tested it, and it DEFINITELY is!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle is designed specifically to fit the curve of a palm. It also has grips designed to keep the handle in place even under water to prevent slippage. A secure seal on the battery compartment helps prevent battery corrosion. The only down-side I found was that the power button was not located in the most intuitive place. It would make more sense to have the button where the thumb ends up when gripping the handle.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor through a program offered from Gillette and am glad I did.  Although the blades are expensive, I have a hard time going back to my other 5 blade razor.  The Gillette is sometimes not the most comfortable shave (especially when the blades begin to dull) but it is always the closest.  In fact even when the blades are dull, I have kept it in my shower just to clean up my face after using a different razor my wife bought me.  Even she can tell the difference in the closeness of the shave.  I also love the way the razor fits in my hand.  A lot of times with other razors, I catch myself pressing way too hard on my face as I use it but the Power ProGlide doesn&#x27;t make me do it.  The razor glides right over my face with minimal effort (especially when using a good gel shaving cream).  It has eliminated the razor burn and irritation I have had with my previous blade.  I also love the small vibration that the handle provides.  It seems to help cut my beard easier when it has grown a little longer.  I am a daily shaver because of my job but if I ever miss a day, I have to use the Power ProGlide because it just works so much better.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several weeks now and the blade work great as Gillette always does.  The power portion of the razor has a nifty blue led light when you turn it on.  Can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the powered version and the regular razor.  Overall good clean close shave.</li>
            <li> Note:  Free Razor Provided By Gillette Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experimented over the years with a number of different shaving products, as my wife is not accepting of the slightest bit of facial hair.  Naturally, I want the shave to be as comfortable as possible.  For years I have \\&quot;chased the blades\\&quot; - buying anything that had a 1 plus on the previous number, which has been stuck at 5 for a while now.  For the most part (once the first two shaves are out of the way) the top shelf 5 blade razors perform the same over time, so let me focus on the power handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that the handle is thicker with a beefy rubber grip.  That&#x27;s a substantial improvement over the thinner handles as there is less slippage in the shower. However, I don&#x27;t think the power vibration feature added much if anything to the experience, and the vibration is really uncomfortable on my upper lip, so I end up turning it off before shaving that area.  Not everyone will experience the odd discomfort I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the quality of the shave was similar, if not identical to the non-powered 5 blade varieties (Gillette Fusion or Schick Hydro).  That, coupled with the fact that I cannot use the power feature while shaving the mustache area makes me lean toward the non-powered varieties for the future as they cost less.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and have endlessly been searching for a razor that will not only give me a nice close shave, but one that also won&#x27;t irritate my skin after shaving. I&#x27;ve been a fan of the standard Gillette Fusion ProGlide razors for some time, and when I got the opportunity to try the Fusion ProGlide Power handle through a program run by Gillette, I jumped at the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already pretty happy with the Fusion ProGlide razor, and was interested to learn what the Fusion ProGlide Power handle would add to the experience. I found that the thinner/finer blades, combined with the larger lubricating strip, plus the micropulses provided by the Power handle definitely do seem to give me a closer shave with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* thinner blades and larger lubricated strip definitely reduce friction&lt;br /&gt;* precision trimmer blade is awesome for squaring off &amp; trimming sideburns, and under my nose&lt;br /&gt;* closer shave than previous Fusion models&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* longer hair tends to get caught in cartridge a bit&lt;br /&gt;* \\&quot;improved blade suspension\\&quot; actually seems to restrict the swiveling movement of the cartridge a bit, compared to previous incarnations of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Pros far outweigh the Cons, and this is easily my favorite razor that I&#x27;ve ever used....and I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them. It&#x27;s superior to the other multi-blade razors in its class, and with the month-long life of the edge of the blades, the impact on your wallet is greatly lessened as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the ProGlide Power Razor through a promotional campaign by Gillette.  I was definitely not thrilled with the razor over all.  As for the handle specifically I must say I am just not sold on the vibration concept doing anything to improve my shave.  In fact I feel like it makes it harder to tell if the finer stubble has been removed because there is a lack of feedback through the handle with all the vibration and noise.  As i said with my review of the blades this razor is probably perfect for an everyday shave type person but for someone who lets their facial hair go for a week it just doesnt do the trick.</li>
            <li> I was given this razor free through a Gillette promotion.  I&#x27;ve always been a Gillette razor user however I had never used the fusion and I had never used a vibrating razor before.  The razor itself worked great. I got a nice close clean shave and my skin felt very soft.  I was very pleased! I did try it with the vibration on and off and I never saw or felt a difference between the two shaves.  I now use it without the vibration on. It just seemed like a waste. I will definitely continue using the Fusion Proglide Razor. It worked great!</li>
            <li> After years of using a 3 blade razor I was eager to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor everyday for one week. Not sure about the battery power in a manual razor I shaved half my face with the power on and the other half with the power off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I did not see a purpose for the battery. After one week I noticed no difference in both sides of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the 5 blades and found that there was little to no pull and tug. My face felt smoother after the week. Compared to using a three blade I did notice a better looking and closer shave with the five blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the trimmer on the other side of the razor to be helpful. I used it to cleanly cut and trim my side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that the razor was very easy to clean with less hair being clogged between the blades. It did rinse out cleanly after each use. After one week the razor was also still very sharp and I noticed no dull feel as I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle I found to be just a little too big. That goes back to the point of the battery. Again I saw and noticed no benefit of the \\&quot;power\\&quot;. I did find that the grips on the handle made it easier to hold. When my hand got wet those grips did their job. I did appreciate the ergonomic grips on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this razor again but I do wish they included extra blades. I did receive this razor via a free program from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was given a free razor by Gillette to evaluate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent product, very well made, and gives a good shave. It is however, rather expensive to buy, and I question the battery operation. I think the concept is most interesting, but I prefer a simple razor, and this is a bit too complicated, BUT, if you are looking for a great shave, this razor is excellent!</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. I was lucky enough to test it out for free via a program run by Gillette. The handle on the razor is superb and much more accommodating to larger hands and fingers than competitor handles. I was easily able to grasp it and fine tune my grip for maximum control. The blades are smooth, cut easily through my coarse hair and leave me feeling baby smooth. I have not received any nicks or cuts using this blade nor have I experienced any bumps or burns. This razor truly is remarkable and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical by the marketing claims, but did receive a free razor through a Gillette program and decided to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions were positive.  Very smooth on the skin and the slight vibration seems to help achieve the closer shave compared to my previous (and well liked) razor.  But.... how would my normally sensitive skin react to the close shave?  I was concerned, but again very positive impressions after a few days of shaving regularly with the new Gillette Fusion Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually normally skipped shaving on some days with my previous razor because of the razor burn and irritation concern.  This was not at all a problem with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor.  YAY!  I could finally shave daily and not show up to work with a shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades have very good durability considering how thin they are.  I was able to use the same blade for several weeks.  The refills are reasonably priced considering how well they do last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... you have won over this skeptic!</li>
            <li> The handle is great and so easy to use. It glides very easily along my face, I don&#x27;t have a worry about cutting my face. I was lucky enough to receive them for free through a program for Gillette. I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product before I bought it, I will definitely be switching though.</li>
            <li> I received the Proglide from a trial from Gillette. I was excited to receive the trial as I&#x27;m cheap when it comes to buying razors and go for the less expensive ones at Target. So this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a 4 blade and I was impressed with how close the shave was. I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same rough areas multiple times like I have to do with my cheapy. I forgot o turn on the power but once did, did not notice anything inhancened with the shaving and being closer. It just basically vibrated which I can and do without. Minus the power feature it is overal a good product from close shave to the feel of the handle. Thanks Gillette for the trial as I will stick to their four blade razor.</li>
            <li> Gillette ran a program which provided me with free razor. I love the closeness I got while using the power razor. I have sensitive skin, and usually have poor experiences while shaving. NOT THIS TIME!! I have ordered several more razors already. The handle is the perfect size, and shape. The 5 blade razor has a pivoting head which flowed with the contours of my face providing me with a close, comfortable, and sexy ( my wife&#x27;s words) shave. I highly recommend this razor!!</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a Gillette promotion, and frankly wasn&#x27;t expecting much. The idea of a battery-powered manual razor seemed kind of silly. BUT (and it&#x27;s a big one) it provides an effortless, close, comfortable shave! The razor itself is nicely balanced and feels good in the hands. I was afraid the additional weight of the battery would throw that off, but it does not. The handle is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slip. All in all I&#x27;m VERY happy with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle razor! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the head is a bit too large in my opinion, so when I was shaving my cheeks it was just a tad cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I received this free razor as part of a campaign run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been Gillette products since I was a teenager.  I started with the mach 3 and here I am with the fusion proglide.  I have to say I am very pleased and impressed by this razor.  The grip is fantastic and the pivoting head hugs my face ever so well.  Most razors tend to cut me or do not provide a close shave, however, this razor left me feeling smooth and cut free.  5 blades is way better than the 3 I started off with with my mach 3.  One neat part of this razor is the ability to clean up sideburns by pushing the top head back that has the gel coating.  This leaves a blade open for precision trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the battery function, it is a neat add on but do not think it is necessary.  Manual razor would work just as fine in my opinion.  I tried the first fusion and it was not that great.  I feel like they really improved all the short comings of the first razor.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My razor was free from a Gillette program but I would gladly have paid the 10 bucks for it. This razor is wonderful and has given me the nicest smoothest shave I have ever had. The pulsing razor pulls all my hair so smoothly and shaves my face so nice that I can&#x27;t see using any other razor then this for the rest of my life. If you want a great smooth and comfortable shave then this is the razor for you. Give it it try and I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Smooth shaves for all with the Gillette fusion proglide power razor.</li>
            <li> Very good razor, I will be buying more blades and making this my permanent razor.  Weight is evenly balanced with a solid grip and provides a clean quick shave.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> While I usually buy most of my grooming supplies from Amazon, I was lucky enough to be a part of a promotional program by Gillette and received one of these razors for free in the mail. At first I thought that adding a battery powered handle was just some gimmick, suffice to say it did make a difference in the how the shave felt. Now I have very thick coarse hair that grows quite quickly and sensitive skin so finding a comfortable shave can be a challenge. I have always had good luck with Gillette&#x27;s blades and this one did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to the powered handle I decided that I would do a little experiment. First I did a normal shave without turning on the handle to get a sense of how well the razor worked with just the blades. The blades themselves are very comfortable and provide an extremely close shave. The next day I repeated the process this time with the handle turned on. While there was no perceivable difference in the quality of the shave, though the level of comfort from the handle was noticeable. Impressed with how well the shave felt I decided to see how well it could cope when I took a few days off from shaving. I went without shaving for 3 days to make sure I had a pretty good amount of hair grown out. I then shaved with the handle turned off and can say I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the blades, there was no pulling and my skin was baby smooth with minimal irritation. I then grew the hair out again for 3 days and tried again this time with the handle turned on. If I had to ding the product it would be here, it was not as comfortable with the handle on when shaving the much longer hair. During the shave the vibrations would cause the razor to occasionally pull on some of the hairs, though this was still more comfortable than shaving this length with the Mach 3 series of blades. Since the shave is so comfortable, I am finding that I am currently shaving everyday so this is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Received this razor in a program by Gilette. I tried this product for the first time this week and I was very surprised. I usually stick with the standard non battery operated razor or an electric razor and alternate between both. I picked this razor up last week and noticed a big difference in the closeness of the shave and the smoothness of my skin vs. my old razors. Very nice. Some people say the battery is a gimmick and so are the 5 blades on the razor. I feel these both really add to the experience and really provide a great shave. The lubricating strip on the razor also leaves your skin very smooth as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> I received my free Gillette Fusion PowerGlide Razor in the mail because of a sample program. I wanted to use the razor for a while before I commented on it and must admit this is the best razor I have ever used. The first shave is always great on many razors but this was great for a long time. The tenth shave was just as good as the first shave with the same razor. The razor has a very good grip. And the battery powered razor helps clean it better than any razor I have had. I did not think that I would like this razor but I love it and my wife does too.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a free program from Gillette.  It gave me the smoothest shave of any razor I have used.  The pulses really seemed to help keep the razor moving in one fluid motion.  I definitely recommend this razor for anyone that wants a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor via a program run by Gillette. Overall, this is a great razor. The handle feels nice in the hand, and the vibrating action - when turned on - doesn&#x27;t feel awkward. The rubber grips are nicely positioned and shaped to make for a pleasant experience. The downside to this razor is the shiny metallic-looking portions of the razor definitely feel plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual shave, this razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve used in giving a good, close shave. It has become my go-to razor for mornings when I have time and want to feel extra clean shaven. Normally, I use a Phillips Norelco SensoTouch 1160X electric shaver. I still use that most days because it&#x27;s quicker to use than lathering up and shaving with the Proglide, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle razor to try out for free through a program ran by Gillette. I am a fan of the Gillette brand and still am after using this razor. This is a wet razor and I was able to achieve a nice shave with its thin blades. The handle also fit comfortably in my hand while I used it. I like the comb part of the blade, as it helped me reach and then remove my stubble. It uses a AAA battery that has yet to die on my yet so it seems to last a long time. I&#x27;m happy with the results it gave me.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this razor out for free, it did it&#x27;s job but was nothing special that was advertised. The shave was great but nothing more than an original fusion shave.</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor first, then purchased the Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor.  Prefer the later.  Why? Not as bulky and fat, not that many blades, easier to shave under the nose and around the lips.  They both provide close shaves, hence I would go for the ease of access to shaving parts on your face.  If you find the Proglide Power Razor too fat and difficult to shave with, then try the Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor.  I prefer shaving with the razor in the vibrate-power mode.</li>
            <li> Recently I had an opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle via a promotion from Gillette.  I have used numerous Gillette products in the past and always find them to be of the very highest quality.  The Fusion ProGlide Power Handle was no different, it comes encased in a very comfortable rubber grip and the handle is large enough that it fits snuggly in your hand.  The handle allows you to easily maneuver the blade across all areas of your face and reach even the hardest spots around your nose or ears. One drawback I did find about this handle was it felt a little bit lighter than previous models I have used; some people may like this lightweight feel, while I personally like a razor that feels a little heavier in my hand. However overall this razor is very comfortable very well made and is a marked improvement over any disposable razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The handle feels and looks like metal but is really just plastic.  The button to turn on the power switch is a little hard to press on/off due to it being indented into the rest of the razor.  I would have liked it to be raised above or in line with the rest of the razor since when im shaving in the morning half asleep it&#x27;s not always easy to put pressure on something.The vibration was adequate at making it seem like my shave was better off than without the battery powered function.  The handle was a little big as well but not so much as to make me not use it in the future. However with this being said, I feel like its one of the best handle out on the market today.  I just feel like the industry can do a lot better at making shaving more luxurious.  I received this razor handle free through a Gillette program.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has been extolling the greatness of this product for many months now. I recently received a free power razor through a program run by Gillette and was excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle was a bit bulkier than I was used to with my Mach 3 razor, but the increased grip was not unwelcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration was a bit distracting at first, but after getting used to it I was very happy with the resulting shave. I would constantly get razor burn and bumps with my old Mach 3, but there was nary a red spot to be seen or felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy to experience the same great results I&#x27;ve been told about.</li>
            <li> This razor was provided to me free of charge via a Gillette program.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a week now and it&#x27;s good but I don&#x27;t see much difference from my old Mach 3 that I&#x27;ve been using for a number of years. I&#x27;m not disappointed but I&#x27;m not sold on switching.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me a test razor and here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel of this in my hand.  It&#x27;s not too heavy or bulky.  The power button option is a wash for me, the proof is in the shave.  And this razor can shave.  I have a thick beard and could probably shave twice a day, but this left me smooth for most of the day.  Kudos, Gillette!</li>
            <li> This morning when shaving with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle and matching blades I was amazed at how comfortable and close the shave was. The pulsating feel of the handle and complimenting blades provided a close shave with no cuts at all. I was fortunate enough to try this product via a program from Gillette and was not disappointed. I will definitely continue to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li> Getting a good, clean shave was simple with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor.  It was a little bit on the big side, but that makes sense because they need to fit the battery inside it.  I was glad that it only needs one small battery for whenever I will need to replace it.  Overall, I am happy with this product and am glad I was able to receive it for free through Gillette.</li>
            <li> I feel the handle is light although it has a battery in it and the light weight makes the shaving experience very smooth and pain free. The grip is also nice which ensures that it doesn&#x27;t slip and cause harm to the skin. Overall it is a very well designed handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this Razor Free via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor and handle for free via a program run by Gillette. That aside, after shaving with it, I would be more than willing to pay for this product. The handle itself is extremely comfortable and simple to use. You can&#x27;t even feel the shave!  I had no irritation after I finished. I am a little hesitant putting it too far into water. But don&#x27;t let that deter you, It&#x27;s a great product! I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the handle. I like the feel of it overall, but the buzzing portion doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I like to keep it steady and I find the noise to be distracting. With that said, I do love the Razor overall and am thankful that the Gillette provided me a free one to try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve ever taken particular notice of my razor&#x27;s handle before....until now.  As part of a program run by Gillette, I received a free Fusion ProGlide Power razor.  Right out of the box this first thing I noticed was the the large grip.  Combined with the ergonomic design, both helped with the control, ease, and quality of my overall shave.  What set this razor apart from others though is the vibration of the micropulses which you can feel in the handle and see in the results of your shave. One word.....smooth!!  After trying out the Fusion ProGlide Power, I can&#x27;t see myself going back to conventional razors.</li>
            <li> I was one of the luckily ones that got to try this power razor from a program run by Gillette. The vibrating feature works great! It make the razor smooth right over the skin so it doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs as easy.  I would recommend this product from fine hair but it struggles for course hair.</li>
            <li> Got this razor from gillet  hadle isn&#x27;t as fat as other  power razors  nice shave plus massages ur face  Only bad is that it take battery&#x27;s and isn&#x27;t chargeable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Proglide Power razor for a bit  now, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  I really  thought the five blades were a gimmick and wasn&#x27;t going to try it, I really do like it better than razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The  blade on the top side is very convenient. It allows me to get a good line on my side burns and goatee. The blades last about a month , and I shave every other day on average. I received this razor from Gillette to try out at no cost. So for me it really was worth it. The power handle and vibration is amazing. I don&#x27;t know what it does but it seems to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, these aren&#x27;t a big advance over its predecessor . I think its pretty much the same shave. So the only reason I would buy these over those, is if they were cheaper or my regular brand was discontinued. And if like me you think the vibrating handle is worth the difference in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I recommend giving these a try if you&#x27;re unhappy with your current razor. Or if your looking for a change. They just didn&#x27;t do anything different that blew my mind.  But overall a good razor. To me the feature that is worth talking about is the Power. It really does change the shave. I feel like it gives me such a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I get an excellent grip on the free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor that I got from Gillette.  This is very important as I shave in the shower where my hands are always wet and often slippery from soap and shaving gel.  I am sure that the power light is an useful feature.</li>
            <li> I used this razor yesterday and loved it.  It gave me a close shave with no irritation. It was very easy to shave and was smooth on my skin.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle via a program from Gillette.  I really like the way this handle looks. It has very modern and sleek design.  It has a nice feel in your hands and having the battery installed for the micropulses gives it a little added weight and makes it feel very sturdy.  As for the micropulses I don&#x27;t know if they really make a difference in the quality of the shave.  I tried it with them both on and off and I did not notice a real difference.  That being said this razor still gave me an excellent shave and I will definitely be using more in the future.</li>
            <li> I received my free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor today as part of a Gillette promotion. I must say that I love this razor. Along with a great shave, the handle was very comfortable, with a great grip. I love the power option too, I felt it contributed to a great shave. Thanks Gillette.</li>
            <li> Normally I use an Electric Razor to shave. I was amazed on how light and controllable this handle was. In the past when I used a disposable razor I never liked the feel of the handles. They always felt like they would break in my hands. I loved that this handle was very sturdy and was able to control it with ease. I am so glad I took part in this free razor program run by Gillette. Now I think it is time to pack away he electric razor and start using this razor as my new razor. The vibration of the razor also gives the feeling of an electric razor so I won&#x27;t be missing that either. I would also recommended this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> i wake up in the morning, pound some coffee, and hit the latrine for the good ole S&amp;S. i reach for my brand new weapon of scruff destruction and commence facial battle. ever since Gillette hooked me up with my Proglide Power Handle, i feel like shaving has become quick and painless...finally. the rabid vibration paired with the power blade makes my morning go much more [smooth.] the battery is included, so it is a plug and play tool. i will likely continue my use of this weapon here and now, or in a galaxy far far away.</li>
            <li> I was offered a chance to try this razor through a program offered by Gillette. The razor exceeded my expectations. I didn&#x27;t think I would like the vibration from the razor on my face, but it caused all the hairs to stand on end and gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten!  It was great! The handle is also thinker and easier to grasp due to the rubber sides. I was able to hold it steady and got all the hairs out with one swipe! I have to say that I will never try any other razor! This one beats out all others hands down! My brother already went out and bought one for himself after seeing how great it worked for me!</li>
            <li> i have to say this razor is the best one yet. the shave is super smooth and clean, I&#x27;m not sure if its the added vibrating option or just and overall better razor.. This one gets an A+++++ from me!!!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle as a promotion program by Gillette.  First off, I must say this is a great razor.  What makes this razor so great?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits comfortably in my hand.  It is just slightly thickly then a normal razor, which is great since I have large hands.  The handle grips are comfortable; the handle doesn&#x27;t slip while shaving and it is easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this power razor is, its waterproof, which makes shaving a snap in the shower and cleanup is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I have ever used a battery powered handled razor blade.  It cut micro-close and left my skin feeling smooth; even my girlfriend noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> This razor is my go-to shaver. Lays well in the hand, not too heavy or too light and with the matching cartridges it gives you a nice, clean shave. If you have to shave daily or at least quite often, that is a great feature. I have been razor burn and irritation free and got smooth skin. I am happy because this was provided to me for free by a program ran by Gillette to try it out. However even though I was able to try it for free, I still tell friends and family to go buy it because it works so well for me.</li>
            <li> The handle to this product is durable and has some weight to it. I like the weight to the handle in the past when i had purchased razors i felt like they were going to break in my hand. I really enjoy this razor and invite everyone to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have used a Gillette Fusion manual razor for years with much satisfaction.  When the Fusion Proglide Power razor came I out I was initially very skeptical.  First of all what could a vibrating razor really do besides make your girlfriend happy, with the close shave you&#x27;ll get, of course.  Secondly I am already getting a great shave with my manual razor, how could this be an improvement?  Well I received the opportunity to try the razor for free thanks to Gillette and I&#x27;m surprised to say that I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the Fusion manual razor, I would still get some razor burn if I shaved two days in a row, but the Fusion Proglide Power razor gives an unbelievably close and enjoyable shave, even in that circumstance.  The reason for this, in my opinion, is that the vibration from the razor slightly desensitizes your skin while you shave and adjusts for any small inconsistencies in the contact between your face and the razor as the blade moves along your skin, which would otherwise result in a knick.  The only cons with the razor are that the vibration from the razor takes a little getting used to and can be awkward in your hand at first, and I would prefer it be rechargeable instead of requiring a AAA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I would definitely recommend the small investment in upgrading from a manual razor to a Gillette Proglide Power razor.  The vibration will give you a smoother closer shave and your girlfriend will love it, your closer shave I mean, plus it&#x27;s waterproof!  And don&#x27;t worry, the regular Gillette Fusion cartridges will work with your new razor, just as well as the custom Proglide Power cartridges, in my opinion, which will save you a little dough!</li>
            <li> I have used many razors over the years and the Gillette Fusion Proglide is easily my favorite to date!  I received my current Gillette Fusion razor through a special offer from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried both the power and non-power body; I like both but don&#x27;t notice a significant difference between the bodies.  I personally prefer the non-power version simply because I&#x27;m thrifty (okay, some might say cheap) so I prefer the more economical version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend either of the Fusion Proglide razor bodies!</li>
            <li> I found the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE very easy to use. The large handle makes it easy to maneuver across the face. The power function is very useful it makes the shave smoother than without the power function. overall great handle very easy to use i&#x27;m going to continue on using it. razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using razors for 25 years now, and I&#x27;ve tried a pretty good range of razors, from fancy razors down to the cheapo $1 razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past 6 years I&#x27;ve been using mainly the Gillette Custom Plus razor, and have been satisfied with it. It&#x27;s the no frills razor that my wife uses, and I have been going along for the ride. She buys the large 52 pack, making each razor about $0.65 - $0.75 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used those razors until the blue lubrication strip falls off, which turns out to be a few weeks. This was all about economy, and very little about the quality of the shave. Still, I was satisfied just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to learn about a Gillette program to evaluate their new razor, They sent me the Fusion ProGlide Power for a free evaluation, and was predictably skeptical. I really believed that there wouldn&#x27;t be any significant difference in the shave quality or the experience. All razors are more or less the same, right?&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent me the Fusion ProGlide Power, and I popped in the included battery. At first I was a little hesitant about my razor actually vibrating on my face. I mean, I usually use gentle straight strokes, and don&#x27;t wiggle the blade or anything.&lt;br /&gt;I put it in the shower (I don&#x27;t use a mirror, I feel around for the stubble. That&#x27;s just my style.) and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to laugh when I took the first stroke. It is SOO much better than the razors I had become accustomed to using. It&#x27;s immediately smooth, solid in the hand, and effective. I could actually feel that my face felt different. I was totally stunned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used disposable razors for so long, I had forgotten what a difference a substantial handle makes in the shaving process. There&#x27;s a little rubber pad near the head that is perfectly placed for your finger for added stability on the cheeks and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought the 5 thin blades were mostly marketing at work, but it&#x27;s pretty obviousnow that Gillette has really tried to make the most effective tool for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed right away was that nothing was rattling or shaking around. There are no loose parts, it&#x27;s just a very solid feeling in the hand, like you&#x27;re using a very well crafted tool. I think this has to do with the wide flat design of the cartridge blade. It seems that if it were thin, like my usual razors, it would jiggle around more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is truly excellent, so why haven&#x27;t I been using a razor like this for the last ten years? Mainly the perception that it&#x27;s expensive. This razor isn&#x27;t particularly expensive, but the cartridges are, at least comparatively. Each cartridge is about five times the price of my usual economy blades. I&#x27;m not entirely sure how long they last, but even if they lasted twice as long, they would still be almost three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reality is that the cost is minimal. It&#x27;s probably less than $2 a week for an awesome shaving experience. (a $4 cartridge that lasts 2-3 weeks) I pay more for chewing gum, and don&#x27;t enjoy it half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps you out.</li>
            <li> I was provided a power handle as part of a promotion recently. If anything it did give my face and neck a massage. I did notice less irritation after shaving. If not for receiving from the promotion, I am not sure if I would have run out to buy it, but will continue to use it and even replace the batteries. The handle has excellent Balance, Weight and feel.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette Fusion Proglide since they have made them. I am a very frugal consumer but will not compromise on some products. Gillette Proglide is one of these products. Do they cost more? Yes. But the amount of CLOSE and COMFORTABLE shaves makes this a great purchase. I have and will always be a dedicated user of Gillette Proglide and HIGHLY recommend it. You will not go to another razor after having used this one!!!! The free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;If you have facial hair as I do (Moustache and Beard) use the razor as instructed with long firm strokes it will leave your skin smoother than and other shave you have had. Use the other side for close trimming of the beard and moustache.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle provides a firm grip for a clean and smooth shaving experience. It provides an experience which is second to no other product out there. Extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I just love this razor. It is smooth on your face, and it just glides across even the heaviest of stubble. It also helps reach the tough spots to! I received this free to try from Gillette and am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrating action seems to help lift the stubble and make the razor go through the hair easier.  It feels pretty good too!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product.  I am happy with it but am worried about the price of blade refills costing to much.  It really glides well on ones face.  No cuts no scrapes. Like the battery run handle makes shaving easier.I received the product I tried via a program run by Gillette.  I do not have an amazon account so I am using my family members site with her permission&lt;br /&gt;Don Chuppa&lt;br /&gt;Boca Raton FL</li>
            <li> I got this Fusion ProGlide Power handle through a temporary promotion that Gillette was running. I really liked the vibrating handle on this thing! It made it extremely fast, easy, and painless shave. I have a beard, and clean up all around it including my neck, and I am pleased that this prevented irritation and razor burn. I was hesitant to use a vibrating type razor. But now I can tell it is going to be difficult to ever get use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love the variations Gilette offers in their product. Gilette sent me a free razor to try out the power glide and it was an awesome shave as always! Whether it&#x27;s extra lubrication in the cartridge or a \\&quot;power\\&quot; handle, they always make a great product. I like the idea of the power handle, though I&#x27;m still not sure if it really makes a difference or is merely a placebo effect. Either way I&#x27;m very happy with this product and brand and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just used my new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor that I received from a free promotion by Gillette. With the handle being larger I was able to control the shave a lot easier than my regular Fusion.</li>
            <li> This thing is AWESOME!  I have sensitive skin where it always feels like the hair on my face is being pulled out by the roots.  The vibrating handle seems to either help the blades through the cut, or masks the pulling sensation, but either way it was a good experience.  I highly recommend this product if you have the same issue.</li>
            <li> I received a free  ProGlide Power Handle via a program from Gillette. I found that the handle was very nice. I shave my head twice a week as I am in the military and like to do this during my shower. I like that I can use a powered blade in the shower and not worry about it shorting. The handle has a better grip than my old non power razor. The only thing I did not like was that it doesn&#x27;t allow for a flip type shaving (such as curving upside down around the back of my head)</li>
            <li> June 3, 2013 by Louislampell&lt;br /&gt;I recently received a free razor via a program run by Gillette. The Powered handle is comfortable to hold; and its design does permit close control. However, it also feels a bit too light... almost flimsy. As if I could expect that it might be damaged easily if it were to be dropped.&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe that this would be a much better shaver feel if the handle were to be made a bit more substantial feeling. Admittedly,the shave I got was close and comfortable when this handle was coupled with Gillette&#x27;s new cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;With the addition of an ounce or two of substance to the handle, this would be as close to perfect as I can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER RAZOR CARTRIDGE IS THE BEST!!!&lt;br /&gt;June 3, 2013 by Louislampell&lt;br /&gt;I recently received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;The new Gillette Fusion ProGlide cartridge is by far the closest and at the same time most comfortable shave I have ever had.I have a thick beard; and this new blade system seems to glide almost un-noticed. The skin under my stubble is quite sensitive. Yet I experienced zero irritation...None. So, when I finished shaving and ran my hand over my face, I expected to feel a not too close shave. I was wrong. My face actually felt as if I was again 12 years old and never had the need to shave! One thing I noticed was no immediate need for an after shave balm or splash... There was no tactile evidence of having just shaved.&lt;br /&gt;Oh. and by the way... I have a very sharply trimmed goatee. The trimmer blade at the back edge of the new ProGlide cartridge gave sharp again comfortable and accurate results.&lt;br /&gt;I have liked Gillette shaver cartridges before; but this is by far the best. A radical improvement on an already great product.</li>
            <li> It is a great razor and give me a great shave with no cuts</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT... WILL RECOMEND..</li>
            <li> I get razor burn incredibly easy.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of razors over the years, trying to avoid it.  This is the first one that I&#x27;ve used that works well enough, even on a few days growth, to avoid it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that that battery just doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I typically get less than a week or so from a battery.  HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve had this one for almost 2yrs, and it seems to be getting worse.  So maybe replacing the handle itself would cure this issue.</li>
            <li> I love these razors they work great I own 3 of them wouldn&#x27;t go back to a razor. That doesn&#x27;t vibrate</li>
            <li> At first I thought the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; in this razor was just a gimmick. It very well may be part gimmick, but it actually works well. I owned a Mach 3 razor previous to this, tried the Schick Hydro 5, and briefly used the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual, and what I came to realize, is that this razor gives me the closest shave in the easiest form.  The power part causes the razor to vibrate and by doing so, allows the razor to cut hairs better than a regular manual razor would. I ended up seeing a much better shave with less irritation than any of the other razors I tried. I almost always use shaving gel before and lotion after I shave, but a few times I&#x27;ve been lazy and skipped them and the razor worked fine. Even without the gel or cream, I haven&#x27;t experienced any tugging or pulling. I found that to be the most impressive part of the razor, and that&#x27;s why I would recommend it.  It&#x27;s a little on the pricey end, with the replacement blades also not being any cheaper, but for the shave, i think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This razor, from the handle to the blades is awesome,  my hubby got it from a Gilette promotion and has not put it down.  The handle is ergonomically designed for a better grip in the shower and out, and helps with given a better, closer shave. It is also a bit bigger.  The finer, thinner blades give a close, precise shave without nicks or razor burn.</li>
            <li> Everything about the package is great, easy to get into, no cuts on the hands, perfect way to remove the product from the back side.  The slight vibration that comes from the razor while shaving seems to make the razor move quicker and smother over my neck and face for a clean shave. When the rear of the handle gets wet it is a little harder to handle but you just need to move your grip up to the main grip pads on the neck of the razor.  Over all great product.  The free razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean</li>
            <li> This razor was provided to me for free via a program run by Gillette and I must say that after trying this,I will never go back to any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor glides on your skin , giving you a super close and smooth shave. The Blade has a stabilizer to maintain optimal blade spacing for comfort while contouring to your face . The handle is bigger and has more grips for better control and even weight distribution. Also the razor delivers soothing micro-pulses for incredible comfort. The battery life is also incredible.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is a nice compliment to some of the best razor cartridges I&#x27;ve ever tried.  While the cartridge makes the shave, the handle makes the experience.  With the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I found it easy to use in the shower thanks to the size/shape/construction.  No slipping, no sliding, even with water and shaving cream on the handle.  Then, if it&#x27;s one of the days that I really want to be thorough I kick on the power feature and the pulsing action does a great job of eliminating the last traces of stubble without irritating my skin.  I also like the fact that this handle is larger than many others, it seems to make it easier to control - not to mention easier to find when I can&#x27;t remember where I left it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best compliment I can offer is this - I received a sample of this product free via a program run by Gillette and it made me a believer.  I ditched my old brand because this razor simply works.  Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than many others, but the difference in quality is substantial and impressive.  Right now, Amazon has a special offer for $3.00 off, so that pretty much zeros out the price difference with the cheaper (and less able) brands.</li>
            <li> Loved the razor! It gave a comfortable shave that was effortless. Worth the money, but it is expensive! I would totally recommend it to anyone. A really good razor is hard to find and I think I may have found my favorite. The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> I thought that a handle is basically...a handle on a razor.  How can they be all that different.  And then I received my free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor which, of course, came with a cool power handle.  This razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette.  I must say that the handle made all the difference.  I definitely noticed the added smoothness of the micropulses.  Who would have guessed that a little vibration actually gives you a closer shave.  Above all, I really appreciate the grip.  I was able to shave in the shower without losing my razor like I normally do.  Love the side grips and just really the overall color scheme and look of the product...it&#x27;s really unique.</li>
            <li> I started using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor this week and love it.  The handle has a great grip, stops the razor from sliding like my other razor does all the time.  Also the weight distribution on the handle is good and helps control the razor better while shaving in the shower.  Can believe how nice of a shave I get.  My wife commented on the close shave and she didn&#x27;t even know I switched razors.  I received this through a program run by Gillette and I&#x27;m so glad I signed up for it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for many years now and I haven&#x27;t used a better razor than the Gillette Fusion Proglide. With this razor, you will see a closer, cleaner shave than ever before. The handle is comfortable in the hand and easy to grip. The large base allows me to feel like I&#x27;m in control of my razor. I received this razor free via a program run by Gillette, but I&#x27;ve already ordered several razors for my family and friends to try for themselves. I recommend this product for individuals who shave every day and are looking for the complete shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I received the ProGlide Power Handle as part of a program run by Gillette and I have to say I&#x27;m going to stay with this brand. The handle is nice and sturdy, but also flexible allowing the most awkward of angles to be performed while shaving. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I used another shaver but tried Gillette as part of a free product review I received from them.  Hands down the best shaving system.  Cuts super close and it&#x27;s ergonomic.  Really is the perfect shaver.</li>
            <li> I received this handle to try through a program run by Gillette.  I am very pleased with how this handle performs, and as my first powered vibrating handle, I must say I am impressed.  This handle allows for a close shave, and a comfortable one to boot.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone as a great option for a manual razor!</li>
            <li> So I received a Gillette Fusion ProGlide from a Gillette program the other day to try for free. I waited a little longer to shave to see how this razor would perform. The handle is actually very comfortable and I did not drop it once. Usually with razors I find I drop it at least once after I rinse it out. Not with this razor. The grips are a positive addition. I really liked this razor and I will definitely be getting some replacement blades. The vibration actually helps in the shave. I could not believe the difference between having it on and shaving with it off. Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> I received a free razor that was provided via a program run by Gillette, and I love it. I have always had a hard time with shaving because of sensitive skin. These blades get very close and do not cut me up like others do. I mean I&#x27;m one hairy beast and these work great. I have been using the Fusion Power Blades and they have been doing a decent job. The ProGlide Power Blades are even better.</li>
            <li> I got to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle for free thanks to Gillette. First of let me say I have been really skeptical as to why my razor needs to vibrate. Well once I used it I understand. Those mini movements help the razor to glide effortlessly on my skin. This makes the pulling of my face noticably less. Usually I have irritation from shaving but I did not this time. I got a super close and smooth shave with NO redness. This is a very unique product and now its my favorite!</li>
            <li> I got my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle through a program by Gillette. My experience on the handle was great. It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use. I am however afraid to put it into the water for too long because it&#x27;s electric. The buzzing I&#x27;m not quite used to it but you kind of ignore that part after a while. Great product overall!</li>
            <li> I received a free shaving razor and carts from Gillette through a program they are running at this time and used it for the first time this morning.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I use an electric and at times a disaposable cheapy.&lt;br /&gt;This handle is extremely well engineered and weighted perfectly for a clean and neat shave. Great length and size for shaving also.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the feel in my hand as it glided across my skin.</li>
            <li> Let me start with, I used a 2-blade manual before. I didn&#x27;t know how a 5-blade razor, or even an electric razor would feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basing this off of a 2-blade experience, this is amazing. Simply put, Gillette has done it. The downside, if I drop this in the sink or the bathtub, since its a reusable, you have to continue to use it. However, that&#x27;s a problem all reusable razors face, so you can&#x27;t blame Gillette for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is very soft and grippy, so I am not losing my grip on the razor in the middle of shaving. The electronic feature makes it seem like a massage, coming from a manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Heaven&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: I am starting to notice the faults&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: I feel like I can name a much needed change:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make the blade narrower, our faces are curved, not flat pieces of paper. When shaving more of the blade is not even being used. Only the center gets used the most, and thus, the blade wears out quickly. If the blade was smaller, maybe the prices of the blade refills would be less and then it would not be awkward to be paying only $1 more for the razor than a single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, maybe it was just me, but the blade included with this razor, provided free by a Gillete program, wore out very quickly, prompting me to have to make a quick stop the next day to my local Walgreens to pick up a refill cartridge. It was this that led me to deduct a star from the rating, and if the blade had lasted long, this would no doubt be a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> I just got my razor today through a free promotion from Gillette.  I really enjoyed the weight and feel of this razor but I&#x27;m not 100% sure that the vibrating handle actually did anything or if all the credit goes to the blade.  I still like the look and I will continue to use this razor and replace it with a similar one should anything happen to the one I have.</li>
            <li> As a user of the standard Gillette Fusion razors for years, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much difference between shaving with those and using the power version.  However, it did seem as though I had a smoother shave and absolutely no pulling and tugging with the power handle.  I also liked being able to use the powered razor in the shower.  I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other razors in terms of price, since I got it free through a program run by Gillette, but I am certainly a fan of the shave.</li>
            <li> Although the handle was well weighted and held the blade to my face i am not too sure how much good the vibration does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think by reducing the manufacturing costs they could make the blades a little cheaper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t matter to me in this instance as I was given these by Gillette for free as part of a program they were running.</li>
            <li> Through a special prgoram run by Gillette, I had the fortunate opportunity to try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor. Now let me just tell you that sampling a free item by the company, has not bearing at all on this review. i just want to share my experience based on my own personal opinion and facts. The handle is absolutely amazing, the rugged yet smooth grip is incredible. call me butterfingers but whenever I shaved in the shower in the past, at some point the razor would end up on the ground, but not with the ProGlide Power. The grip on it made it near impossible to drop even when wet. The vibration(i believe it&#x27;s called Micro Pulses) are like a little facial and scalp(I used it to shave my head as well) massage, stimulating the hair follicles for a smoother and closer shave. Although I do wish the handle itself was a touch bigger, overall i have no complaints at all and am looking forward to many shaves to come.</li>
            <li> After trying this product I have decided gillette is the only way to go. Great product with a great outcome every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Gillette razors but always thought the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; version were just a more expensive gimmick - I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide Razor is already the most comfortable, least skin aggravating razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Thanks to Gillette for providing a free power handle for me to review, believe it or not, I know feel the Fusion Proglide Power blows it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple AA battery makes all the difference in the world. The vibrations in the handle literally cause the blade to glide over your skin in a way I&#x27;ve never experienced. It&#x27;s so good that I have no trouble with a \\&quot;fast\\&quot; shave completely against the grain with this razor - it&#x27;s that good. It gives me a perfect shave with no irritation whatsoever. There is no tugging or pulling from the blades either - something only the Power handle can do with the micropulses and the microcomb which lines up the stubble perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle means the end of razor burn for me. If you&#x27;ve been using the manual Fusion blades (or some other brand), get this now. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor via a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a few notes on the packaging - the back of the package is perforated, so it tears open easily - if you happen to notice it, that is. There&#x27;s no \\&quot;open here\\&quot; arrow, so I was all ready to get the scissors to cut the top off, when I happened to pull on the back, and it tore off.  How silly of Gillette not to draw attention to this.  Also, the outside package is recyclable, but I didn&#x27;t see any recycling arrow on the inner cradle, made of even thicker plastic. Boo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the handle itself.  The best handle I&#x27;ve used is on the Schick Xtreme - curved, lots of ridges to get a good grip (especially when using in the shower), and a convenient indent towards the end where your thumb naturally goes.  You won&#x27;t find any of that on this Gillette razor - it&#x27;s too straight, and not enough ridges on both sides to keep a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade pivots enough, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the right starting position (i.e. you always need to press and pivot the blade just to get started).  If it sat at more of an angle, it would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t notice that the vibration does anything useful.  Seemed to get the same shave whether it was turned on or not.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny!  It makes sure you get a close shave every time.  The handle is easy hold on to and a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;*razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> Prior to this razor, I was using the Gilette Mach 3 turbo which gave me an ok shave. Sometimes it would give me one of those shaves where you can run your hand over your face and neck and it feels like a newborn baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Fusion Proglide Power Razor, I get that perfect shave everytime! I have really sensitive skin and really thick facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gilette is seriously the best a man can get.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free, as part of a promotion from Gillette. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  If your on the fence trying to decide whether or not to get the power version of this shaver I have to say its a no brainer....GO POWER!!!  I have tried it with and without power and the difference is so huge I would never go back to a powerless razor.  With the power on this thing glides thru hair like a knife thru warm butter.  I have never had my skin feel this smooth from a shave except maybe when I had no hair on my face. :-)  I will never use another shaving system again!!</li>
            <li> This razor works wonders on my face. I used to use a two blade razor, but after trying this razor after receiving it for free from a program run by Gillette, I have to say I am extremely impressed. This razor leaves my face smooth after just one pass. My wife agrees! No nicks or razor burn either. The handle is well made and easy to grip, I do not feel like it will slip out of my hand, even when wet. The vibration is supposed to help you get a better shave, but I do not notice a difference when it is turned on or when it is off. I think I found my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li> I received this razer free from a program run by Gillette.  Overall, its a very good handle for shaving.  Its comforatable enough and easy to hold without slipping.  It allows enough flex in the head to get a smooth shave all the way across.  The only downside is i don&#x27;t believe the \\&quot;power\\&quot; part really does anything.  I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between a regular handle and this one when it comes to closeness.  It might be different for different skin types though.</li>
            <li> I have used the normal Gillette Fusion when shaving for many many years. So when I received the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; handle for free via a program run by Gillette I was very skeptical as to what improvements my shaving experience would have.  Who would think that a simple powered Micropulses would give me any further benefit from an already outstanding razor but i am here to honestly tell you that I was blown away with the improvement that it made!  My shave experience was faster, easier on my skin &amp; more precise then ever before! The handle was also much easier to control and handle! I would highly recommend getting rid of any other blade and using this great product!!</li>
            <li> used it to shave my head and face would recommend this to everyone  great clean silky smooth shave and got it for free from gillette</li>
            <li> Besides the blades providing a top notch shave, the handle was top of the line as well. It was a really comfortable grip. Even in the shower, I had no worries about it slipping out of my hand. I was lucky enough to have Gillette send me a free razor to try out and I will spread the word that it is a worthwhile razor to have. Definitely for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how the micropulses help to give a smoother shave and the shave lasts for a longer period. The rubbery grip has a nice feel to it and the weight feels just right. The Fusion Proglide Power Handle which I received for free from Gillette is a keeper!</li>
            <li> handle on this product is great even when your hands are wet. best idea for a shaver anyone has ever had</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Gillette and it does give a nice shave.  It feels good on the skin and does not cause any irritation.  I have been using an electric for many years and this is much smoother.  My only issues is that I don&#x27;t think the vibration does anything to help.  A razor with 5 blades and a non vibrating handle gives the same smooth shave as this does so I don&#x27;t think I would spend the extra money for this product.</li>
            <li> I received a  from a program that Gillette was running, and to be honest I was a little skeptical of the \\&quot;power\\&quot; handle, but it works. I am a believer and the way it helps lift the hairs up and makes a really close shave! Great product!</li>
            <li> My last electric razor was one of those rechargeable rotary blade things, I never liked it.  I received a sample of the  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle along with the Power Blade and gave it a try.  This thing really works A quick clean close shave, even with an extra days growth.  I haven&#x27;t gotten a single nick with this razor. The microComb does a great job of trimming my sideburns, no \\&quot;Lamb Chops\\&quot; for me.  I would give this a 5 star if it used AA instead of AAA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003987CL0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title[[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]]</li>
            <li> the handle is amazing the new design fits perfect in your hand and the micropulse helps give one of the closest and smoothest shaves</li>
            <li> I normally shave with the buy in bulk razors from the local warehouse store. Thanks to a free sample from Gillette I had the chance to buy the Proglide Power handle razor. I was skeptical at first. I am not a fan of change but am I glad I gave this a try. While the razor blades themselves are a tad expensive - they are well worth it! The first shave was the closest shave I have EVER had (and the vibration felt good on my skin). Win win! I will definitely be buying more razor blades for this Power handle!</li>
            <li> Not one for gimmicks, but I got a Fusion Proglide Power Razor through a program run by Gillette and I am now a convert. Was a little skeptical going in, but really found that the micro pulses helped give me a closer shave without the pulling of my regular razor (which is also a gillette). It wasn&#x27;t too noisy and actually was kind of soothing (but then I can also fall asleep as the barber buzzes my hair, so maybe it is just me!). The handle wasn&#x27;t to bulky as I thought a power razor might be. Also glad that other gillette blades will fit since I have about five cartridges left from my regular fusion before I need to get new blades. Glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products since I started shaving. I was always curious about the &#x27;power&#x27; handle, but thought the expense didn&#x27;t warrant trying. I got a free sample through a promotion from Gillette. I&#x27;m glad I got to try, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for it. The shave was very good and smooth, but since my beard is not very tough to begin with, it was not noticeably better when I turned it on vs. turned off. The 4 blade cartridge makes the difference; the power handle - not so much. It&#x27;s not bad, just not worth more than the non-power version.</li>
            <li> I received this Proglide Power Handle free from a promotion Gillette was doing.  Let&#x27;s just say i would not have bought a battery powered razor on my own.  It is a weird concept and I am not really a fan and will stick to my old way of shaving.  Call me old fashioned.  I do not think my shave was any better than with my regular razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle for free through a trial being run by Gillette. I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle for free through a trial being run by Gillette. Combined with the proglide cartridges this product is a must buy.  Im usually skeptical about buying \\&quot;the new razor\\&quot; because how many times can it get better.  Until now I was still using my Mach handle.  If I went back to the Mach I wouldnt be satisfied.  This shave is comfortable, close, and painless.  Get out and buy one now!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle now has more ergonomic grips for better control, it snaps snugly into the included plastic holder n stays in place, you could take it with you while traveling with no problem. It is sleek and lightweight and easy to use, which is a bonus. One AAA battery goes into the handle. Just press the blue button and you get a vibrating disposable razor.The power part causes the razor to vibrate and by doing so, allows the razor to cut hair better than a regular manual razor.I have found that my shave is always closer with the vibration. When the vibration is on, the razor pulls at your face for a closer shave, which is pretty neat. I ended up seeing a much better shave with less irritation than any of the other razors I ever used. I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Power Razor as part of a promotion run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like safety razors and have used the one I bought from Hoffritz for decades. As a result, I have a natural bias toward the traditional heavy metal type and consider most of the disposable razors on the market today as just cheap pieces of plastic which are better for women&#x27;s legs and underarms than a man&#x27;s beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the few instances in which I have had to use plastic razors I have found them to be poor and require me to go over the same spots, causing a rash or shaving burn. For this reason, I initially had some trepidation and built in bias against the razor. However, when I tried the Pro Glide Power Razor I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like the design. It is very ergonomic and easy to grip. The weight is good as well, not too heavy or too light. I was impressed at the way the razor moved effortlessly over my face. In addition, the shave was very smooth, no nicks nor chafes which are so common with the traditional safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shave was good, I experienced some tugging by the blade even when shaving a day old beard. Suffice to say when I tried it after not having shaved for a couple of days, it pulled and tugged even more. I also found that there was some difficulty shaving areas around my chin and under my bottom lip. I had to repeatedly go over these areas until they were smooth. In addition, because I have a clef chin, I was not able to shave that area effectively without going over the spot several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not certain why the pulsation is necessary. The Pro Glide Power Razor shaves well enough without vibrating. I feel that this feature can be eliminated and it won&#x27;t be to the Pro Glide&#x27;s detriment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I do not normally use this type of razor, I cannot comment about the cost of replacement cartridges. However, I know it is far easier to find those items than for me to locate a conventional razor blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this Pro Glide Power Razor, even for guys, who, like me still use the old fashion safety razor.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I thought that the idea of a vibrating razor was potentially the worst idea in the world.  So when I was given this razor to try through a program sponsored by Gillette I was a little reluctant.  As it turns out I was pleasantly surprised. The vibration sort of acted like a massaging effect that reduced the irritation that is normally associated with shaving.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample from Schick and I really didn&#x27;t think a vibrating handle would make much of a difference to a blade I already liked. I was wrong. The vibration is enough to make the shave a little more comfortable, smoother and faster. If you are on the fence about getting this product and think it is just a gimmick, I can assure you it is an actual improvement over the non-power version. It is comfortable and since I shave in the shower, I can attest to its waterproofness over the past couple of weeks. This is a great new shave! I&#x27;m not certain the blades are much different from what I was using but the application of them in this was is new and certainly better.</li>
            <li> For a premium handle, its nice, but there definitely are nicer handles out there.  The blade is the BOMB, but I don&#x27;t need my handle looking like a rocket ship.  I&#x27;d like something sleeker, classier, manlier - something like The Art of Shaving.  Then I&#x27;d be a mega fan.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free Gillette Proglide Power Handle shaver through a program run by Gillette. I was interested in if the power made any difference and it did. Its sort of like a gentle vibration while you shave and it seems to help get a smoother shave. The handle is comfortable and I think it evens cleans better under running water while it&#x27;s on.I am quite pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Overs one of the closest shaves out there and is a really great price. This one is a keeper. I received the razor free from a program by Gillette and i love it.</li>
            <li> The bane of all men - shaving.  I am cursed with what I call \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;.  No matter the preparation or after-treatments, every time I shave my skin turns red and dries out under my eyes and on either side of my nose.  Oddly, I am not even shaving that area - it seems to be a sympathy reaction.  To adjust, I shave only 3 times every two weeks (about every 5 days).  I am graced with an even distribution of facial hair so I can usually pull it off, even in an office setting.  However, I would prefer the clean-shaven look, and I think I&#x27;ve finally found my answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried electric razors in the past, but they never shaved quite close enough.  And more than once I&#x27;ve been subjected to &#x27;razor burn&#x27; from these and it is not pleasant.  So when I had the opportunity to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide I went into it assuming this would be another failure for me.  Boy was I wrong.  The micro-vibrations of the handle combined with the excellent replacement blades gave me the smoothest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had - even week-old stubble.  I only used hot water to prepare my face, so I can only imagine it being even easier with some regular preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replaceable blades seem to last as long, if not longer, than comparable-priced manual razors.  I tend to use my blades longer than most, trying to get the most for my money.  The &#x27;power&#x27; handle helps that process, allowing for a dull blade to easily cut through those whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside - I still have an issue with the tight areas under my nose and around my sideburns.  It does have a precision trimmer, but the size of the head just makes it too unwieldy to get into those tight places.  I keep a standard 2-blade disposable close by for those really tight spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly encourage you to try it, I think you&#x27;ll be a convert right away!</li>
            <li> So I recieved this plus the 3in one styler. For freeThrough a program by gilette. Loved the styler and the razor. I like the flexibiliy on the head without being to loose.I gave a clean smooth shave. Here is the funny part. I bought new heads and my wife stole it she ssid it is the best razor she has used .</li>
            <li> My current razor is the the Gillette Fusion so I was happy to try out the Fusion Proglide Power through a Gillette promo. The razor provided a very close and comfortable shave but I wasn&#x27;t sure it did any better than the fusion. The next shave I used a new fusion blade on one half of my face and the proglide on the other, both provided a very smooth, comfortable, and close shave. I gave slight nod to the proglide due to the improved comfort strip but they were equal in closeness at first. As the day went on I was able to feel some roughness on the the fusion side of my face while the proglide remand relatively smooth. For my third shave I did half of my face with pulsing on and half with it off and did not notice a difference in comfort. In my opinion the proglide is an excellent choice as it provides unbeatable comfort and closeness but I do not think the power feature improves anything.</li>
            <li> When asked by Gillette to try the Fusion ProGlide Power handle, I thought that it was just another gimmick product to get you to spend more.  I was very surprised at what a difference it made on my heavy beard.  There appeared to be less drag, and I was able to shave quicker because I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the area again-which meant less irritation.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide POWER... The power handle feature in this razor helps cut through the thick scruff. I find it easier to clean the razor as well between the blades. The shave always leaves my face feeling smooth everytime! No razor burns, cuts or nicks! I recommend the Power ProGlide. The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
            <li> I enjoy this shaving handle and it actually seems to work better in vibrating to get a smooth shave, compared to the pro-glide trimmer kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought that the vibrating feature would be more gimmicky, but it actually does lend itself to getting a close shave without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has never pulled any hairs and seems to work very well. The handle feels good in my hands and lends itself to an effective close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t used this razor for multiple months at a time I would expect that each cartridge would last for a month each, especially with using the trick where you hone the razor on your jeans by running it backward on the jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note I did receive this shaving handle free as part a program that was being ran by Gillette; though it did not influence my review in any way.</li>
            <li> I am basically an electric razor user but I have to admit that I really liked this blade.  I could even use it dry on my face for quick touch ups which I never could do with a regular disposable razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;This razor was supplied for free by Gillette in a try it program for my opinion.  My wife also liked it very much.  I can see that she will be purchasing extra blades for this razor.  I never would have purchased these blades or power unit before trying this, but we will be definitely be purchasing more in the future to keep these blades on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very, very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li> I revieced this as a free trial from Gillette.  I currently use the Fusion power Handle.  I like the new handle it has a better gip than the standard Fusion Power.  It has more \\&quot;grippies\\&quot; kind of like suction cups preventing it from slipping in my fingers.  The power button requires a little more force to turn on and off but this eliminates the accidental bump of the power button and turning off that I would experience with the Fusion Power.  I can&#x27;t think of any negatives.</li>
            <li> I recently was able to try out the Gillette Fusion ProGlide handle thanks to a sample provided by Gillette. I was a bit skeptical having tried one of the micropulse shavers in the past with so-so results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon taking out the Fusion ProGlide power handle from its packaging, I noticed immediately that the handle had been redesigned. It featured a larger set of grips to be able to keep the shaver from slipping during a shave. Due to the fact that I use this in the shower for my daily shave, I was hopeful that the razor would perform better than the previous version I had tried. It did not disappoint. I found the razor very easy to manipulate and shave with thanks to this improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional noteworthy information was that the blades performed very well in the shave itself, providing a clean shave. This was evident in many of the difficult areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reasoning for the razor not being a 5/5 was that the top of the razor head where the lubricating strip is located was just a bit too large for me to be able to get the upper lip right under my nose area. But the increased strip did make for a much smoother and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an excellent shave. Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> I got this razor free to try from Gillette, and this is by far the best razor that I have ever used. The shave is close and thanks to the power gripe handle I always have a good handle on it even when its wet.</li>
            <li> I received this razor through a program ran by Gillette for free. The handle felt good in my hand while shaving the grip felt good even when shaving in the shower. I did not feel the Mircopulses added much to the to the quality of the shaving. Overall I was not a fan of the Mircopulses feature but the razor still delivered a close shave and I got a good amount of uses out of it.As expected from Gillette Vary good over all quality.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but the vibration did irritate my skin at first.  As I started using it regularly, I got used to it.  The handle is a nice fit and weight in my hand, and it is easy to use in the shower.  I received this razor through a program run by Gillette, but I would buy refills for this razor myself as needed.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I love Gillette and have been a loyal user since I started shaving 20 years ago.  I really, really like the shave I get with their products, but feel like there&#x27;s a shaving arms-race going on and Gillette is just continuously trying to one-up itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Proglide Power Handle and a free blade from Gillette as part of a promotional program.  I was super excited to try the latest and greatest from the company.  Having used this 4 times now, I&#x27;m feeling like this technological advance forward was 2 steps back for my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle feels great in your hand.  Has a nice, balanced weight and feels like something sturdy that would give you a great shave.  However trying to navigate it around your neck felt awkward, like you couldn&#x27;t get the right amount of pressure on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;power\\&quot; aspect of the handle is a real wild card.  I tried shaving with the power on and then again with the power off, but ended up bleeding every time I used this product.  I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bum cartridge with the handle or not - I was quite surprised (and disappointed) with these results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend the power handle - but will keep using it to see if I get better performance after more practice.</li>
            <li> This GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE POWER HANDLE  product was sent free from Gillette. I was amazed of how great the product worked.. Very close shave and only shave once instead of going over and over the same area to get a good shave. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor was provided to me via a program run by Gillette and I can definitely say they have a convert.  I switched to this razor after previously using a competing men&#x27;s razor.  Starting with the handle you can definitely feel the control.  It is slightly heavier than an all plastic handle but it was a comfortable weight in my hand.  I had no issues with grip at all.  The blades were sharp and I did not notice any decline throughout the weeks.  The razor had a smooth glide over my skin (Fairly course stubble) and I noticed less \\&quot;breakout\\&quot; around my neck within the first week.  I shaved everyday with the razor.  It was definitely a high quality shave.  Only downside may be price in the long run but if you want a quality shave it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> After sampling the Gillette fusion power handle for free from a program run by Gillette I was very impressed with the rubber grip handle on the razor. This little gripper definitely comes in handy while shaving and have shaving cream/gel/oil on your face so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand and cause you to cut yourself and of course it is a major plus if you shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> This razor provides a superb shave.  The blades are the smoothest that I have experienced.  I have see other brands over the ears but his Gillette razor is performs for me.  I find that this blade lasts me much longer than other brands.  I can only give this razor my highest recommendation</li>
            <li> Having been a long time regular Proglide user I was skeptical about how much difference the power option would make, but now I am converted. The power option does give a much smoother shave, and the bulkier handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate. For someone with big fingers the on off switch may be a little awkward. All round a great shaving tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proglide I reviewed was supplied free of charge under a Gillette program.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I have been somewhat skeptical of the whole \\&quot;vibrating handle\\&quot; razor phenomenon, but when Gillette offered to let me try one for free, I thought that it was worth investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions were positive - the battery compartment requires a larger handle, which has been covered in a patterned rubber grip.  The greater heft gave me the impression of more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor for several days, and have been quite happy with it.  The vibration seems to reduce the impression of pulling that I normally get when shaving my (very thick) beard.  While I do not believe it produced a closer or smoother shave than the un-powered fusion, it did seem to leave my face less irritated.</li>
            <li> Through a free program with Gillette, I tested out their new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power side by side with the non-Power version.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shave with the Power model. I assumed that it would be more of a gimmick than a true differentiator. At first I expected more automation from the Power razor. However, it took a few strokes to realize that I really had to shave exactly the same as I would without the power model. Although not very great, I did notice a slight benefit in the comfort of the shaving process with the power model. The handle was also easy to hold even when wet. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is how it was much lighter than my non-power razor. There was something nice about its heft. Overall, its a nice razor and worth trying for yourself.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion razor through a free program from Gillette.  The first thing I noticed about the Fusion was what an incredibly smooth shave it was.  It didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving my face and one swipe with the razor was all it took to get a close smooth shave.  The only drawback is the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as regular shavers and the replacement blades are very expensive compared to other brands.  Because of the cost of the blades, I don&#x27;t think this is a razor that I will use on a daily basis, unless I can find them on sale.</li>
            <li> The Power razor bring shaving to a whole new level with out having to spend a fortune on the expensive electric razors. I will never go back to unpowered shaving again it help the razor glide across the skin leaving it smooth and not irritated. This has made my daily shaving routine a faster more enjoyable one.</li>
            <li> For a super close shave nothing beats the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power handle. I was skeptical before using this product but the results were great. I guess a little vibration goes a long way. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle and Razor for a little over a month now and I can really notice a difference in my skin. Although the Gillette Fusion Proglide can be more expensive than comparable, I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m shaving less and my skin is smoother. The grip on the handle and the shape itself contours well into my hand. It&#x27;s a very light razor. While shaving using the vibration setting - the razor puts out the right about of vibration to give you the close shave without feeling that your hand is going numb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was provide to me via a program run by Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received this for free via a program run by Gillette.  I love the shave but it is comparable to the results of the non-powered razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle &amp; shave performance did not stand out as special during my side-by-side comparison with my normal Fusion.  The shave was no closer nor smoother. I give 4 stars because it is an excellent razor but too expensive.  I love the Fusion line &amp; will continue to purchase whatever is the least expensive Fusion available.  That is not usually the Fusion Proglide Power Razor but a sale or coupon &amp; I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razor&#x27;s for yr&#x27;s, I love these razor&#x27;s &amp; will never buy anything else, the razor&#x27;s last a very long time &amp; usually don&#x27;t need to shave for 2 whole day&#x27;s. I would highly recommend these any day.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide has a great handle. The rubbery handle is ergonomic and allows for great grip and control. The razor was smooth and provided a close shave. I personally enjoyed using this razor and you can tell it is another great razor in the long line of Gillette razors. The ProGlide was provided for free via a program run by Gillette but it would totally be worth the price otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is a solid razor. I received the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette but I have used them in the past. I feel, as I do with most Gillette products, that I am using a quality product and have confidence that it will give me a close, comfortable and consistent shave. To no surprise, I did receive a little bit a skin irritation, but all and all a very good shave.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have been selected to receive the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power free from Gillette. I was unsure if attaching a vibrator to a shaving razor would do anything at all. The handle is larger than most razors. It takes AAA batteries so its about a 1/3in thicker than a AAA battery. It has a nice rubber textured grip and I didn&#x27;t find it slipping in or out of the shower.  At first it took some time to get used to the thing buzzing. It wasn&#x27;t so bad after a few days. Now I don&#x27;t notice it at all. I really like the fact that it turns itself off after awhile so it doesn&#x27;t drain the battery and it had a light to let you know when it needs a new battery.</li>
            <li> So I received this razor free from a promotion that Gillette is doing and of course i was skeptical because im not really sure why i need a razor with power.  After my initial trepidation that i might get all cut up because of the vibration i used the ProGlide Power.  It was awesome!  Extremely close shave, even closer than normal!  I would highly recommend this razor to anyone that wants that close shave that you are always looking for!</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor. I had the opportunity to receive a free sample to try from a program run by Gillette. I was skeptical at first just because I very rarely find a disposable or any razor that will cut through my thick beard. This razor ranks one of the best in my opinion and it outlasted any other disposable blade I have ever used. Long lasting, durable, comfortable and it gives a great shave! I shave in the shower so the battery handle with LED light has no issues being submerged. Great product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Gillette Fusion Proglide power razor when I got it for free from a Gillette sponsored program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor because my face is sensitive to getting knicks and cuts from other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a Braun electric razor that I use when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised with the close and smooth shave I got while using the power razor for the last couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I will continue with the power razor when the one single blade I got gets dull. The price of replacement blades seem expensive compared to the regular Proglide blades that I buy at BJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I received a fusion proglide power free through a program run by Gillette, and I have to say that this razor doesn&#x27;t perform any better than the Mach 3.  I found the razor itself to be comfortable in my hand (it is much larger than the Mach3), and it was very balanced.  I have very sensitive skin, and grow hair very rapidly, so a great razor is quite important to me.  I have found that the extra blades actually leave me feeling more razor burn, and I keep facial hair (not a smooth shaver) and the size of the blade head is cumbersome while trying to shave in fine lines.  Overall, the razor is nice, but with the price point being higher than the Mach 3 Power, I don&#x27;t have any reason to switch.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor from Gillette. I gave it a try was that I really didn&#x27;t get that much better of a good close shave than any other pivoting head razor that I&#x27;ve tried. The power feature was nice. I had not used that feature before. It reduces or eliminates the razor tug I got from other shavers when used daily. I also used it after a few days of hair growth and found that it had a difficult time handling the longer hair (lots of tugging even with the power on).&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a stylistic looking shaver handle with a nice grip. The cartridge looks delicate, so I am choosing to prevent the blades from getting nicked by keeping it in the large packaging holder that came with it. A nice clip on blade cover would be nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed with the multi-blades performance around my chin. There was just too much width there to shave around tight corners in any direction without getting nicked.&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t pay for this, I decided to look up the price vs. other razors. I found the blades to be considerably more expensive for the same shave quality. I have not yet used the product for long enough to see if the price justifies it&#x27;s useable life span, which may be longer than others.</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor!  I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 40 years and the ProGlide is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried many, many different razors.  Shaving has never been a favorite activity of mine, but the ProGlide definitely makes it more enjoyable.  I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Fusion for years and was very happy with it.  I&#x27;m still not exactly sure what difference the \\&quot;power\\&quot; makes shave wise.  I get a great shave with both, but something about the vibration of the power razor makes the shave more enjoyable.  The only downside to the razor is the initial cost of the refills.  However, I find that the refills last much, much longer than the refills of other brands and in the long run it at least compatible if not even more economic that the other leading brands.  I don&#x27;t have the toughest of beards, but I do need to shave daily and I find that Fusion blade will give me a more comfortable shave more than twice as many times of \\&quot;premium\\&quot; razors and at least 4 times as much as a good throw away razor.  I try to catch the refills on sale or buy them when I happen to come across a coupon (not often enough).  I highly recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for better, more comfortable blade.</li>
            <li> When I first looked at the razor handle it was just cool.  I don&#x27;t know who designed it but this thing is slick. On my second look I thought  it was going to be a little chunky, but once I used it; it became very clear that that was simply a look.  I had total control over my shave.  I have been a disposable razor guy for years, (Always Gillette) I am now a convert, this is totally worth the extra money for the overall value in the product and the shave.  Buy this razor!!</li>
            <li> I got the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette. The handle itself was nice and light even with the battery inside but the vibrating sensation was kind of different and something that you&#x27;ll have to get used to. The blade gives a nice close, smooth shave and it doesn&#x27;t pull at all.  I am very happy with the blade and will probably switch to use this one everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever tried for difficult grain areas, like under the neck. The light vibration means you don&#x27;t have to press as hard in those areas which avoids nicks. I got to try it for free from Gillette, and I am very happy that I got the opportunity.</li>
            <li> I was given a chance to try a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor from a program run by Gillette. i have to tell you that this is the best razor I have ever used. I have a very thick (coarse) facial hair, and I have used all kinds of different razors and electric razors as well. with almost every other razor I have used I will inevitability get a cut or two. however with this Fusion ProGlide power razor I get a very close smooth shave without going back and forth many times like other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that I can shave 2 1/2 weeks with the same blade. unlike the Hydro I was using I could only get 3 shaves and needed new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor if you have a tough beard and want a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li> I must first disclose that I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor free of charge from Gillette to write an honest non-bias review. I am an individual who HAS to shave every day for work, not because I like to, therefore I want to make sure that my shave is not only enjoyable, but fast and that it delivers a nice clean look without much hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received my razor I opened the package, and followed the enclosed instructions to place the battery inside. The one thing that kind of did worry me off the bat is if I would be able to use this razor IN the shower, as nowhere on the instructions did it mention that it was safe. I figured why not and jumped in the shower with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this razor unique from others in the market is the handle. It is battery operated to offer a vibration sensation.  This is suppose to assist in getting a closer shave. Personally I did not see a huge difference in my shave as opposed to using a regular Gillette Fusion Razor. The handle did provide a nice vibration, but to be honest, it made me fearful of cutting myself due to the slight vibrations it produces. At times it gave me the sensation of shaving with an electric razor, only because of the movement it was emitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once done, I was happy that I was not nicked anywhere and was very content with my shave. This handle offers a very soothing and different shaving experience than just a stand alone razor. Therefore, if your the kind of guy who likes to have the newest tech out there, i recommend this razor for you. But, if your just a simple joe like me and just want a fast and easy shave, I&#x27;d suggest to stick with a regular Gillette Fusion Razor. Gillette makes great razors, but the Fusion Proglide Power Razor is just not for me. I&#x27;ll stick with my regular Gillette products.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle fits comfortably in the hand and provides a close, cut/nick-free shave.  I&#x27;ve tried many other razors and with all of them - every one - I am constantly nicked and cut.  The razor was provided via a program run by Gillette and I have been using the ProGlide every day for almost a month and my shave is always smooth and I have not cut myself - not even once.  My skin is very sensitive and I do not feel that burning sensation after shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> It seems like razors are just one gimmick after another nowadays.  You&#x27;ve got ones with 60 blades, that vibrate, wash your car, clean your room and might even shave your face.  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle is no exception to this rule with both cartridges and a handle that is specially contoured and vibrates.  Why do I need a vibrating razor?  Why do I need a razor with contoured, ergonomic rubber sides?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That question really couldn&#x27;t be answered until my first actual shave with the razor.  I was incredibly surprised with how balanced the handle was in my hand, and how easy it was to grip and slide the blades over my face.  It was this light touch that allowed a close shave without hacking at my face and really digging into it.  And as for the vibrating handle part? I was incredibly shocked that it actually did seem to bring the hairs on my face to the surface a bit more, and almost seemed to massage my skin as it shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think these types of razors are a bit overpriced, but I guess if you have to shave daily, and can find a great deal on them, it&#x27;s a pretty sweet handle.  I was fortunate enough to have mine given to me for free via a program run by Gillette, because I&#x27;m not quite sure I&#x27;d pay $10 for the handle and one cartridge, and then have to turn around and pay $32 (Amazon price) for a pack of 8 cartridges.  That&#x27;s an awful lot to spend on razors.</li>
            <li> I was using the Gillette Mach 3 before... a good razor! Now that I got the free razor provided via a program run by Gillette I switched over to this one and  now my face is REALLY much smoother. I mean a HUGE difference... not just a little bit! This razor is by far the best razor out there today, no doubt about it...This razor makes shaving a breeze and it does not drag across your face, nick or cut you in any way...it provides the closest shave you can possibly get&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this razor is the high quality design. The handle is much thicker than the standard disposable razor, which makes it easier to grip. The handle also has a generous rubber grip around the handle and another rubber grip area near the razor itself where you can rest your thumb or index finger depending on how you are holding the handle. The handle has a power button that makes the razor vibrate gently while you&#x27;re shaving. The vibration reduces the friction when you shave. I&#x27;ve been using my razor almost every day for the past few weeks and still haven&#x27;t had to change the battery.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best disposable razors around. I got this as part of a promotion from Gillette, and can definitively say this cuts great. I found this razor to provide the smoothest and cleanest shave of any others I&#x27;ve tried. The vibration also helps glide the razor along the skin, so it doesn&#x27;t catch on particularly tough bits of hair. The handle is sturdy with a decent amount of weight to help with the shaving process, and not feel like a cheap thing that will crumble in your hand. The multiple blades and conditioning strip mean there&#x27;s no razor burn afterwards. Additionally, I&#x27;ve found that I can shave faster with this razor, because you don&#x27;t need to spend as much time lathering the shaving cream/gel. It&#x27;s smooth enough that you can almost use it without any shave gel. I have no incorporated this razor into my daily ritual and haven&#x27;t looked back. The only downside I will say is that the blades can be expensive. I usually need to use 2 per week, but this can obviously vary by person. Overall, I think this is a great razor, with a comfortable  handle, very smooth shave, and has sped up my mornings quite a bit as a result.</li>
            <li> Shaving is never part of my \\&quot;enjoy\\&quot; list but it&#x27;s a necessary evil. I usually use an electric razor to shave off the \\&quot;steel wool\\&quot; on my face but there will be times when a wet shave is required using a regular razor. I have a Gillette Fusion ProGlide on standby whenever I need it. Recently, I received that newest Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ProGlide because of the five blade system used for cutting facial hair. I have thick hair that needs my complete attention whenever I shave because something will get snagged. It&#x27;s not a pleasant experience to feel hairpulling on your face. I even had a barber shave my face in which he stated I had the toughest facial hair he has ever encountered. But the ProGlide definitely makes life so much easier for me. The finer blades help glide across my face without so much tugging. The Microcomb definitely helps against stray stubble. The indicator strip really lets you know when it&#x27;s time to change the blade, which in my case isn&#x27;t very often, thankfully. The handle grip is excellent and flexible. I don&#x27;t find myself with any shaving cream residue residing on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with that said I wondered why it needed an upgrade with the new Power feature. This was a curious thing when I saw that a battery was included. The power button is on the handle so you are able to turn it on and off. The vibrating feature helps make your shaving experience much more relaxing. In addition it&#x27;s also supposed to imitate what an electric shaver feels like against your face complete with the humming and noise. Quite honestly it didn&#x27;t add anything to my experience. It&#x27;s a strange thing to have on a straight edge razor like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle is great as a razor but doesn&#x27;t need the extra vibrating feature to make the shaving experience beneficial. More than anything it becomes an annoying feature.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for many years, I used to buy Schick razors for test and possible replacement option once in a while. For many years Gillette was above its competitor and I do remember only one razor in Schick&#x27;s line that I&#x27;ve used for some time before moving back to Gillette product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor free it was provided via a program run by Gillette.  Now, I&#x27;m more than happy with this razor and not planning to move back to any others for a while (at list till the next Gillette razor release).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Power offers:&lt;br /&gt;1) Overall better build quality. Even though it&#x27;s not something to use for many years, I would say that it&#x27;s handle provides better feeling.&lt;br /&gt;2) Shaving experience is very comfortable and I haven&#x27;t got any irritation so far (I have sensitive skin and lots of shaving products are just not for me).&lt;br /&gt;5) Another thing to mention is that replacement blades are a little pricey, but worth it for such a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I highly recommend Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor.</li>
            <li> This might one of the better razors I have used. I have very sensitive skin and I really hate to shave because of this. I must say it is incredibly smooth and I really don&#x27;t mind shaving.  Great Product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette. Easy grip handle. Smooth shave with the additional trim blade on top. Thin flexible blade to make for a comfortable shaving experience. I will continue to use this razor.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I had the opportunity to try this product through the Gillette sampling program they just ran. It was a really cool product because the razor basically did all the work itself being powered by the battery. I felt that I barely had to push down on the razor to get a good clean shave. At first I was a little skeptical as to how it would actually enhance the shave but I really did notice a difference. It provided a very smooth shave with no irritation. The only thing I noticed was that the blades seemed to go dull quicker that I would have thought. Thank you again Gillette for the opportunity to try the new product!</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide Power Razor from a program run by Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts at first. A razor is pretty much a razor, right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. I&#x27;ve never had a more quick, more clean, or more comfortable shave than with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shape fits in my hand well. Very visible blue light lets me know the razor is on. Rinses out incredibly clean under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;It FEELS good against my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has completely changed my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I received the ProGlide Power Razor free through a program offered by Gillette. You can&#x27;t be free, so that was a plus.  NOW TO THE POINT. Being in the military, I am required to keep a clean shave on a day-to-day basis. This can be agonizing considering my facial hair is coarse. I dread shaving, the razor bumps and the pain. I tried this razor and I haven&#x27;t used another razor since. The handle is sleek and is comfortable and the overall shave is incredible. After shaving, my face feels smooth, no razor bumps after shaving every day (usually if I shave with other razors daily, I will still get bumps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying this razor espically if you have to shave regularly and/or if you have coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Great razor handle.  Cuts nice and close, much better than the other razors I&#x27;ve used.  The battery really does make a difference.  It has lasted longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used so far. I received the razor from a Gillette sponsored program.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moLNN8UHVUWUC4]]I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor from Gillette as a promotion. This may seem like a little unorthodox, but I primarily use a razor for my legs since I am a cyclist. Honestly of all the razors I have tried this one has proven to be the smoothest and most comfortable shave. I credit the close, smooth shave to the battery vibration and the super fine blades. I have been using this razor for approximately 3 weeks and have used it several times per week, and the blades don&#x27;t seem to have dulled much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery vibration seemed odd at first, but honestly I think it helps to make a smoother and closer shave. I did decide to shave my face a few times and I didn&#x27;t have as good of an experience. My facial hair is very bristly and thick and the I felt like the vibration or the 4 blades made the facial shave less comfortable. I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I prefer this blade for shaving my legs for cycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor is a great razor and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> When I received my free razor that was provided to me via a program run by Gillette I was hoping I would not be disappointed. I have problems gripping things in my hand and most razors that I use the handle is small and thin and I have a hard time holding on to them resulting in several cuts and multiple times of trying to hold on to this skinny handle only for it to end up cutting my face and falling to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised and pleased when I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Handle. I love the bigger handle with the ergonomic side grips that has made holding on to the handle and navigating it around my face and neck so much easier for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrating handle which helps cut down on irritation has a power on light that blinks when you are running low on power which is great so it doesn&#x27;t you stop running without you knowing why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the thin blades which gives you a closer cut with out the irritation which is really great for people like me whose skin gets irritated very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up I would highly recommend trying this razor especially for people like me who have a hard time holding the regular thin razor handles.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product during a program run by Gillette. I like that this has a battery - I felt like it helped the razor glide better on my skin. Guess that&#x27;s why they call it Proglide, huh? I easily got a good close, clean shave and didn&#x27;t nick myself, not even on my first time using this razor. The razor felt good in my hand and wasn&#x27;t too heavy or too lightweight. I would recommend it and would buy it myself.</li>
