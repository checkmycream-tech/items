            <li>Great for short hair</li>
            <li>then you will get your money&#x27;s worth out of this one,!</li>
            <li>I bought a much cheaper brand ($18) to replace this one and it works so much better.</li>
            <li>I place alot of orders from Amazon and this is my very first time receiving an item that was not at all what i ordered.  </li>
            <li>but I returned(very easily) and was shipped (very efficiently)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite flat iron because it is easy to get roots, bangs, and around ears.</li>
            <li>I have very, very curly pixie cut hair.</li>
            <li>I love curling short hair with it!</li>
            <li>Ended up with two irons the first one worked for about 3 days and went out...</li>

            <li>No they stop working 2 weeks after purchase very unsatisfied</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and glides through the hair without sticking and tugging.</li>
            <li>This is a little smaller than what I wanted but is super easy to use and light weight.</li>

            <li>The first one was dead on arrival</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough for me to get right to the root.</li>

            <li> PLEASE DONOT BUY THIS BRAND FLAT IRON...</li>
            <li> These flat irons work beautifully:)I</li>
            <li> have naturally curly hair and when I say these flat irons will get your hair straight-thats what I mean!</li>
            <li> These are not authentic Hai flat irons, did not work at all received yesterday and did not come on.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Needless to say the item was not new, the packaging was even old and taped up and the warranty inside had oil on it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little bulky for my carpal tunneled wrist.</li>
            <li> flat iron for $139.99 and received it dusty and used looking with a knob broken off the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> If you are a guy or have short hair or just find standard sizes too awkward and clumsy</li>
            <li> I owned one for the past year and when it quit I ordered another.</li>
            <li> A piece of the hard wear feel off when I took it out the package.</li>
            <li> SOOOO DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> I love this flat iron. Recommended by Najah Aziz of Like the river salon! I was my let down by the slim design and smooth styling of this iron!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is okay, but I expected it to give my hair more shine after using it, but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Great Service and Quality!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Not even a month in it will not turn on. Not like the old black one with yellow plates.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite flat iron because it is easy to get roots, bangs, and around ears. I owned one for the past year and when it quit I ordered another. The first one was dead on arrival but I returned(very easily) and was shipped (very efficiently) another and it works perfectly. In spite of the  hiccup I love this product. Nothing else comparable on the market. If you are a guy or have short hair or just find standard sizes too awkward and clumsy then you will get your money&#x27;s worth out of this one,!</li>
            <li> A piece of the hard wear feel off when I took it out the package. Considered returning it. Oh well!</li>
            <li> Really work good I love curling short hair with it!</li>
            <li> this item is not as ilustrated in photo the twig i recieved was black with yellow plates seems like an older version, vender needs to sell item as ilustrated in the photo.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Received in 2 days but does not work.  I think that it is a replica! So upset</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, very easy to use. Makes my short hair look shiny and beautiful. I love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> Worked well for about a month, but now it won&#x27;t even turn on. When you push the switch a certain way SOMETIMES it will come on for a minute, but the then will turn off. SOOOO DISAPPOINTED. I bought a much cheaper brand ($18) to replace this one and it works so much better.</li>
            <li> If i could rate this experience at &#x27;0&#x27; i would. I ordered a &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34;  flat iron for $139.99 and received it dusty and used looking with a knob broken off the flat iron.  I place alot of orders from Amazon and this is my very first time receiving an item that was not at all what i ordered.  Needless to say the item was not new, the packaging was even old and taped up and the warranty inside had oil on it.  Definitely would not order from them again.</li>
            <li> These are not authentic Hai flat irons, did not work at all received yesterday and did not come on.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. I have very, very curly pixie cut hair. It&#x27;s small enough for me to get right to the root. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> No they stop working 2 weeks after purchase very unsatisfied</li>
            <li> Ended up with two irons the first one worked for about 3 days and went out...I emailed to let them know it stopped working, so they sent another one...upon taking this one out the box and plugging it up it didn&#x27;t work either I don&#x27;t think they are the real Hai irons at all! Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a little smaller than what I wanted but is super easy to use and light weight. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several of these and they keep shutting off like there is a short somewhere. Any one else experience this?</li>
            <li> Great for short hair but it&#x27;s a little bulky for my carpal tunneled wrist.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DONOT BUY THIS BRAND FLAT IRON...THIS IS MY SECOND FLAT IRON WITHIN 2 WEEKS.. AND THE LAST ONE THEY SENT ME DOES NOT COME ON AT ALL..</li>
            <li> Great product. It heats up fast and glides through the hair without sticking and tugging. I was thrilled that It arrived on Christmas Eve, JUST IN TIME!!</li>
