            <li>Ah, delicious sleep.  </li>
            <li>These rollers are GREAT!</li>
            <li>and I still think they&#x27;re the best out on the market.</li>
            <li>I will still continue to use it because it smooths my hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Thank you for great service!</li>
            <li>I feel very proud of myself</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>I am 100% happy.</li>
            <li>The size of the roller is great - just what I needed.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE THEM!!</li>
            <li>Maybe I am not that good at handling this product</li>
            <li>The clips were great also because they didn&#x27;t leave \\&quot;dents\\&quot; like most do</li>
            <li>I have to say, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl the best in the first place, but I thought maybe curlers would fix this problem since it sets longer.  </li>
            <li>Got what I wanted, for a great price, on a product that isn&#x27;t always available in stores.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Pros: nice packaging/velvet texture.</li>
            <li>I ended up using both kind</li>
            <li>The set itself is nice-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak from my own experience on this product but my wife loves them.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have them all in one set, but they aren&#x27;t any better in any way, the \\&quot;edges\\&quot; still burn your fingers (why can&#x27;t somebody figure out how to fix this problem???</li>
            <li>This is a great set of hot rollers.</li>
            <li>They are nicely storable and have a quick warm time.</li>
            <li>It looks better than when I come from the hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>The awarding of two stars in generous (1.5-ish would more like it).</li>
            <li>(Why do most companies forsake the U-s?)</li>
            <li>Ladies in the family are fairly pleased with these.  </li>
            <li>and I do love roller sets</li>
            <li>i used the travelpack conair, that seems to be a bit better for my liking.  </li>
            <li>Does heat up fast and curls great.</li>
            <li>I leave them on to heat for 25 minutes, it takes 10 minutes to put them on and the longer I keep them on the better result I get.</li>
            <li>I really love these rollers.</li>
            <li>oh ok it has pretty good review</li>
            <li>The jumbo rollers are perfect for my long hair that reaches my waist.</li>
            <li>I would say it will take about 1h15mins to get the best result with these (again I have long hair</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up very quickly.</li>
            <li>But they are easy to use and the clips are secure</li>
            <li>The rollers heat fine without the lid.</li>
            <li>(Boo, they weren&#x27;t available the week</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and my hair comes out smooth.</li>
            <li>The set is very nicely done, they give you 2 options for clips (butterfly &amp; traditional metal)</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this product, I know BaByliss is a great name</li>
            <li>Even the Babyliss U-pins hold the curlers nicely in place and leave no imprint (unlike many sets&#x27; new-fangled, less effective and slippy clips).  </li>
            <li>And the curl produced from these Babyliss curlers has a remarkable Houdini-like tendency to disappear after a very short time, despite the judicious use of Product.  </li>
            <li>Only good to smooth frizz.</li>
            <li>Right before I leave to go to work, I take them out, and Wow - I can&#x27;t believe how good my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed that it could handle my thick hair.</li>
            <li>The babyliss curlers takes about a minimum of five minutes in my hair to reach a good curl that would last throughout the day!</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly,</li>
            <li>But they heat up quickly and stay put with either the pins or clips provided.</li>
            <li>Yes, and it is quickly too.</li>
            <li>I was excited to buy these newfangled \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; hot rollers in a brand I had never tried before after using 2 sets at a time of the Revlon (6) travel jumbo roller sets (which are still sold on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>The first problem I have with this product is that the claws to keep the roller in place leave significant creases in the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>After nearly a lifetime&#x27;s intermittent experience using hot rollers, I am confident in concluding:</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, plus it comes with two different types of clips which I love.</li>
            <li>The customer service agent was nice but tried to convince me that the set I got was a better model anyway (even though I wanted the instant heat for a reason, and these are not instant--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the mix of wire and alligator clips, so you can make sure not to get any weird bumps on the top of your hair.  </li>
            <li>They heat up extremely fast and produce really nice big wavy curls.</li>
            <li>These may work better for longer, thicker hair, but there&#x27;s still the issue of not being hot enough.</li>
            <li>I probably reorder another set every 9 months or so just because I use them almost daily, but $30 every 9 months is nothing in the grand scheme of things.</li>
            <li>They do get hot</li>
            <li>I ordered these after reading all the reviews from many different sets of curlers.  </li>
            <li>It definately curls my hair but it doesn&#x27;t come out that pretty.  </li>
            <li>Tried this hot roller.</li>
            <li>oh well, first world problems).</li>
            <li>I was a little leary at first wondering if the rollers would be too wide - they were perfect, they heat up immediately</li>
            <li>they are usually tiny hot curlers for an early 80s-like twirl, so I have to use a very nice converter after ordering them from abroad, and hope my Conairs can handle the extra juice (they can&#x27;t --</li>
            <li>I live in hope that the next time with these Babylisses will work better but ...</li>
            <li>The curler work very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like that they come with the pins and the clips to hold them in place.</li>
            <li>I was very please with the babyliss pro.</li>
            <li>God, I wish they would come up with roller holders that really work.  </li>
            <li>They work really well and heat up fast.</li>
            <li>(they are very flexible and thinner</li>
            <li>and I read on the reviews that it heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I found out that fast &#x3D; 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this matters that much).</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>She gets compliments all the time on her hair and tells me weekly how much she likes them.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I have long fine straight hair (if that helps) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time.</li>
            <li>Rollers have cooled even more over time (only used occasionally) and no longer even really curl my medium-long length layered hair.  </li>
            <li>Plus my hair is less frizzy and more bouncy.</li>
            <li>All in all, if I&#x27;d had these 15 years ago, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have had a lot more dates (unless the unfortunate fellows saw me with these in my hair...</li>
            <li>Works really quick and creates nice waves, I like that there are enough rollers for my shoulder length, thick hair.</li>
            <li>and it gave a little bit more wavy on my hair</li>
            <li>- Wife never complained about them.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, they like the varied sizes, but curls do not seem to hold long.</li>
            <li>Also, being used to my old electric rollers &amp; curling irons, this product didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to produce much curl or wave.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the typical type of heat you get from traditional roller sets, it&#x27;s more like steam, which absolutely holds no curl.</li>
            <li>last only about 5 months before they start melting -- but it&#x27;s worth it for the natural-looking volume without Too Much curl).</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the rollers get so hot they burn my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I figured after several years, hot rollers have to had made some advancements.  </li>
            <li>I give this curler set a .5 credit simply for HEATING UP, and a full extra star in support of the U-shaped pins.</li>
            <li>I really should have sent them back, but I kept thinking I would get used to the &#x27;new technology&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Plus I tend to use only large curlers..</li>
            <li>I wanted soft curls without being too curly, and Babyliss delivered.</li>
            <li>However, I will need to buy another set because 12 rollers was not enough for my whole head.</li>
            <li>If you do get bumps in your hair from using the U clips just use a flat iron to get the kinks out really fast.</li>
            <li>received the replacement set the next day, but it was the exact same ones they sent me before!</li>
            <li>The set does not however, get hot enough to have a lasting hold for me.</li>
            <li>I spent forever researching what type of hot rollers to get.</li>
            <li>This set of hot rollers works as well as any other.  </li>
            <li>I live in France, the land of the Straightening Iron, and hot curlers are not available ANYWHERE in my part of the country and even by mail</li>
            <li>These curlers barely leave a curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Dents and creases definitely is not part of the soft, flowy curl thing I was going for.    </li>
            <li>I took a chance and went with these Babybliss hot rollers even though the quantity of their reviews were less (compared with Conair having hundreds of reviews).</li>
            <li>That is not fast for me because I bought them mainly to save time in the morning.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews for some brands had negative comments about rollers not getting hot enough, this was my main concern.</li>
            <li>I have normal straight hair which usually takes about five minutes tops to blow dry.</li>

            <li> Dents and creases definitely is not part of the soft, flowy curl thing I was going for.    </li>
            <li> I took a chance and went with these Babybliss hot rollers even though the quantity of their reviews were less (compared with Conair having hundreds of reviews).</li>
            <li> That is not fast for me because I bought them mainly to save time in the morning.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews for some brands had negative comments about rollers not getting hot enough, this was my main concern.</li>
            <li> I have normal straight hair which usually takes about five minutes tops to blow dry.</li>
            <li> These rollers seem a bit cooler than the older ones I have and no different, other than the curl doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> Nope, curl lasts about an hour then back to flat.    </li>
            <li> They take a while to heat up, which is fine as long as you plan ahead, but you need to know that they&#x27;re only for a little bit of wave, they won&#x27;t actually make your hair curly, at least not if you have long hair.  </li>
            <li> but if you need to be a professional to handle a product which is used at home, it&#x27;s not worth of my money</li>
            <li> it still didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It made it FLAT</li>
            <li> Not hot enough.</li>
            <li> while I dry my hair, then I put them in (5-7 minutes)</li>
            <li> This product is no better than the one I replaced which was 30 years old.  </li>
            <li> It came when I expected, and performed as expected.  </li>
            <li> Let me add, unlike some other rollers I read reviews for,</li>
            <li> Moreover, not sure how a namebrand curler, i.e., Babyliss,  can be such a lemon where it counts: Curl and Volume.  </li>
            <li> I should have checked out other reviewers before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> A Big Waste of Money!</li>
            <li> If you have kind of thin hair, you might be not be too crazy about these rollers.</li>
            <li> They are really heavy and despite taking care clipping them in, they keep slipping &amp; falling out of my hair.</li>
            <li> but the rollers still fall out half the time.  </li>
            <li> I terribly regret not sticking with the Conair Super Jumbo and Jumbo Set and will definitely pick them up the next chance I get.  </li>
            <li> and I tried again try to put it on heat little longer for about 20-30 minutes</li>
            <li> Basically all they do is give a little shape and flip on the ends.  </li>
            <li> well, just not very NICE (like the typical Conairs) or even a pokey Revlon travel set.  </li>
            <li> I got these with the hope that I&#x27;d shorten my morning routine of wrapping sections around a round brush and drying with the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> My curls do fall out over the course of the day, but then, when I dried my hair with a brush &amp; dryer, they fell out too.  </li>
            <li> and all in all, was a wasted purchase.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I don&#x27;t normally write negative reviews but come on.</li>
            <li> I have long and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I love that they offered it in jumbo sizes but was sad to return it because curls fell out after just 10-15 minutes after being set :(</li>
            <li> I have med thick hair past shoulders and still felt like i couldnt even walk around as the rollers were just to heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I called again, they realized they don&#x27;t even have this model in stock (they may have wanted to check on that before they blindly sent me the second set...?).</li>
            <li> The rollers after two years have a harder time staying in your hair, as the velvet wears thin.</li>
            <li> This set seemed to have the least negative reviews, so</li>
            <li> In my case I like to leave them on for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have hair about 6 inches below my shoulders and it is really thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find sets that have all jumbo rollers (and 12 of them!)</li>
            <li> alas, t&#x27;is not to be; EVERY TIME: not great curl, no hold.  </li>
            <li> I think the roller is to heavy. :(</li>
            <li> The clips do leave weird kinks, but those seem to fall out, and the set comes with pins.  </li>
            <li> im disappointed.    </li>
            <li> and rollers that still come with U clips (they come with those plastic claws too, but I hate those things.)</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The jumbo rollers are perfect for my long hair that reaches my waist. I wanted soft curls without being too curly, and Babyliss delivered. Plus my hair is less frizzy and more bouncy. Nice.</li>
            <li> These do not get as hot as rollers of the past. But they are easy to use and the clips are secure</li>
            <li> The curler work very well.  They are nicely storable and have a quick warm time.</li>
            <li> These rock!  I have shoulder length straight, fine hair.  I got these with the hope that I&#x27;d shorten my morning routine of wrapping sections around a round brush and drying with the hair dryer.  They heat up quickly, while I dry my hair, then I put them in (5-7 minutes) and then I eat breakfast.  Right before I leave to go to work, I take them out, and Wow - I can&#x27;t believe how good my hair looks.  It looks better than when I come from the hairdresser.  And it cuts about 5-10 minutes off of my morning routine.  Ah, delicious sleep.  My curls do fall out over the course of the day, but then, when I dried my hair with a brush &amp; dryer, they fell out too.  Maybe I need some product.  The clips do leave weird kinks, but those seem to fall out, and the set comes with pins.  I wish it also came with a bag to contain the clips, but not the end of the world.  All in all, if I&#x27;d had these 15 years ago, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have had a lot more dates (unless the unfortunate fellows saw me with these in my hair... then he would have fallen over laughing!).  I am 100% happy. I&#x27;ve had them for a week, I can&#x27;t imagine going back to the brush.  Let me add, unlike some other rollers I read reviews for, I can&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d burn a finger with these, because of the velvet coating.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of hot rollers. I really like that they come with the pins and the clips to hold them in place. The rollers heat up very quickly.</li>
            <li> After nearly a lifetime&#x27;s intermittent experience using hot rollers, I am confident in concluding: These stink (figuratively speaking). The awarding of two stars in generous (1.5-ish would more like it). I give this curler set a .5 credit simply for HEATING UP, and a full extra star in support of the U-shaped pins. (Why do most companies forsake the U-s?) Even the Babyliss U-pins hold the curlers nicely in place and leave no imprint (unlike many sets&#x27; new-fangled, less effective and slippy clips).  Moreover, not sure how a namebrand curler, i.e., Babyliss,  can be such a lemon where it counts: Curl and Volume.  The curl is ... well, just not very NICE (like the typical Conairs) or even a pokey Revlon travel set.  And the curl produced from these Babyliss curlers has a remarkable Houdini-like tendency to disappear after a very short time, despite the judicious use of Product.  I live in hope that the next time with these Babylisses will work better but ... alas, t&#x27;is not to be; EVERY TIME: not great curl, no hold.  I terribly regret not sticking with the Conair Super Jumbo and Jumbo Set and will definitely pick them up the next chance I get.  (Boo, they weren&#x27;t available the week I Amazoned these Babyliss clunkers.) I live in France, the land of the Straightening Iron, and hot curlers are not available ANYWHERE in my part of the country and even by mail they are usually tiny hot curlers for an early 80s-like twirl, so I have to use a very nice converter after ordering them from abroad, and hope my Conairs can handle the extra juice (they can&#x27;t -- last only about 5 months before they start melting -- but it&#x27;s worth it for the natural-looking volume without Too Much curl). Voila!</li>
            <li> I spent forever researching what type of hot rollers to get. I have hair about 6 inches below my shoulders and it is really thick. A lot of reviews for some brands had negative comments about rollers not getting hot enough, this was my main concern. I took a chance and went with these Babybliss hot rollers even though the quantity of their reviews were less (compared with Conair having hundreds of reviews). These rollers are GREAT! The do NOT burn my fingers (someone else has said this), they came with pins AND 12 clips. They heat up extremely fast and produce really nice big wavy curls. I was extremely impressed that it could handle my thick hair. However, I will need to buy another set because 12 rollers was not enough for my whole head.</li>
            <li> These curlers barely leave a curl in my hair.  I should have checked out other reviewers before purchasing.  They are pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Ladies in the family are fairly pleased with these.  They heat up quickly, they like the varied sizes, but curls do not seem to hold long.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different roller sets over the years,including steam rollers and nothing compares to these.  Ceramic heating tools are the way to go.  Do not hesistate to purchase.</li>
            <li> This set of hot rollers works as well as any other.  The only problem is that the rollers get so hot they burn my scalp.  But they heat up quickly and stay put with either the pins or clips provided.</li>
            <li> I was very please with the babyliss pro. I have curly hair and my hair comes out smooth. Heats up quickly, plus it comes with two different types of clips which I love.</li>
            <li> If you have kind of thin hair, you might be not be too crazy about these rollers. They are really heavy and despite taking care clipping them in, they keep slipping &amp; falling out of my hair. Also, being used to my old electric rollers &amp; curling irons, this product didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to produce much curl or wave. These may work better for longer, thicker hair, but there&#x27;s still the issue of not being hot enough. I really should have sent them back, but I kept thinking I would get used to the &#x27;new technology&#x27;. This hair roller set is now under the sink, out of the way &amp; I probably will never use them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this set of rollers for years now and I still think they&#x27;re the best out on the market. It&#x27;s really hard to find sets that have all jumbo rollers (and 12 of them!) and rollers that still come with U clips (they come with those plastic claws too, but I hate those things.) I probably reorder another set every 9 months or so just because I use them almost daily, but $30 every 9 months is nothing in the grand scheme of things. If you do get bumps in your hair from using the U clips just use a flat iron to get the kinks out really fast. I definitely recommend these rollers!</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product, I know BaByliss is a great name and I do love roller sets and so I went ahead and purchased this item to replace the Conair set that I&#x27;ve had for over 10 years (still works, cracked lid &amp; everything). The set is very nicely done, they give you 2 options for clips (butterfly &amp; traditional metal) BUT....they don&#x27;t hold a curl. They do get hot but it&#x27;s not the typical type of heat you get from traditional roller sets, it&#x27;s more like steam, which absolutely holds no curl. I love that they offered it in jumbo sizes but was sad to return it because curls fell out after just 10-15 minutes after being set :(</li>
            <li> I was excited to buy these newfangled \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; hot rollers in a brand I had never tried before after using 2 sets at a time of the Revlon (6) travel jumbo roller sets (which are still sold on Amazon).  I figured after several years, hot rollers have to had made some advancements.  These rollers seem a bit cooler than the older ones I have and no different, other than the curl doesn&#x27;t last as long.  It is nice to have them all in one set, but they aren&#x27;t any better in any way, the \\&quot;edges\\&quot; still burn your fingers (why can&#x27;t somebody figure out how to fix this problem??? What about silicone?) and all in all, was a wasted purchase.  UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER:  Rollers have cooled even more over time (only used occasionally) and no longer even really curl my medium-long length layered hair.  Only good to smooth frizz.</li>
            <li> This product is no better than the one I replaced which was 30 years old.  The rollers are too big.  The pegs that hold the rollers in place leave my hair with a kink and the curls drop out.  There is only one size of roller and there are not enough rollers.  Wish I had never bought them.</li>
            <li> i dont use ceramic rollers alot,but.. I have med thick hair past shoulders and still felt like i couldnt even walk around as the rollers were just to heavy for me.  i used the travelpack conair, that seems to be a bit better for my liking.  Pros: nice packaging/velvet texture.</li>
            <li> I have normal straight hair which usually takes about five minutes tops to blow dry. The babyliss curlers takes about a minimum of five minutes in my hair to reach a good curl that would last throughout the day! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> God, I wish they would come up with roller holders that really work.  I ended up using both kind but the rollers still fall out half the time.  Does heat up fast and curls great.</li>
            <li> I ordered these after reading all the reviews from many different sets of curlers.  This set seemed to have the least negative reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d try them.  I have to say, im disappointed.    The first problem I have with this product is that the claws to keep the roller in place leave significant creases in the hair.  Dents and creases definitely is not part of the soft, flowy curl thing I was going for.    Second problem is that the curl does not stay well at all.  I have to say, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl the best in the first place, but I thought maybe curlers would fix this problem since it sets longer.  Nope, curl lasts about an hour then back to flat.    Truth is, I would probably send this item back but by the time I pay for shipping charges, I may as well keep it.  Wish there was a way to acheive the \\&quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret\\&quot; model hair with these curlers, but as I see it- not happening!</li>
            <li> It definately curls my hair but it doesn&#x27;t come out that pretty.  Maybe I am not that good at handling this product but if you need to be a professional to handle a product which is used at home, it&#x27;s not worth of my money right?  Anyways.. It curls well but I didn&#x27;t like how it looks like.  Plus I tend to use only large curlers..</li>
            <li> I was a little leary at first wondering if the rollers would be too wide - they were perfect, they heat up immediately and I LOVE THEM!!</li>
            <li> Tried this hot roller. Read the review and I thought oh ok it has pretty good review so I gave it a shot. I have long and thin hair. Tried it once it didn&#x27;t work. It only gave my hair wavy for couple hours and I tried again try to put it on heat little longer for about 20-30 minutes and it gave a little bit more wavy on my hair and I even used hair spray it still didn&#x27;t last long. Pretty disappointed. Oh and it didn&#x27;t give my hair volume around the crown area. It made it FLAT cos I think the roller is to heavy. :(</li>
            <li> This review is for the seller. I ordered these instant heat ones and received the Nano Titanium ones instead. I sent an email with all of the information they could have needed (including the specific discrepancy in the model numbers, which I did just in case the difference in the product name/appearance wasn&#x27;t as obvious to them as it was to me). Then I called them to arrange for the return (which I had to pay for) and subsequent replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the replacement set the next day, but it was the exact same ones they sent me before! When I called again, they realized they don&#x27;t even have this model in stock (they may have wanted to check on that before they blindly sent me the second set...?). Hopefully they&#x27;ll update this product page so people don&#x27;t order this thinking they are getting one thing and getting another. The customer service agent was nice but tried to convince me that the set I got was a better model anyway (even though I wanted the instant heat for a reason, and these are not instant--oh well, first world problems). I *guess* I&#x27;ll just keep these...? Sorry, I don&#x27;t normally write negative reviews but come on.</li>
            <li> Works really quick and creates nice waves, I like that there are enough rollers for my shoulder length, thick hair. The clips could be improved, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law. She loves them! They work really well and heat up fast. I&#x27;ve had mine for a year now and it&#x27;s still working well.</li>
            <li> Wont curl a strand of hair. Not hot enough. A Big Waste of Money!</li>
            <li> The size of the roller is great - just what I needed. The clips were great also because they didn&#x27;t leave \\&quot;dents\\&quot; like most do (they are very flexible and thinner so they don&#x27;t just lay on the hair). The set does not however, get hot enough to have a lasting hold for me. I will still continue to use it because it smooths my hair wonderfully. I just won&#x27;t expect lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Got what I wanted, for a great price, on a product that isn&#x27;t always available in stores.  It came when I expected, and performed as expected.  Thank you for great service!</li>
            <li> I like these curlers alright.  It&#x27;s nice to have the mix of wire and alligator clips, so you can make sure not to get any weird bumps on the top of your hair.  They take a while to heat up, which is fine as long as you plan ahead, but you need to know that they&#x27;re only for a little bit of wave, they won&#x27;t actually make your hair curly, at least not if you have long hair.  Basically all they do is give a little shape and flip on the ends.  The set itself is nice- the lid stays on well and the curlers don&#x27;t burn your fingers when you put them in.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it came with both the plastic clips and the U clips and I read on the reviews that it heats up fast. I found out that fast &#x3D; 25 minutes. That is not fast for me because I bought them mainly to save time in the morning. I wanted to put them on and then go on to do my make up etc... but they take forever to heat and if don&#x27;t wait for 25 minutes and put them on at 15 or 20 minutes I don&#x27;t get any results. I have long fine straight hair (if that helps) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time. I would say it will take about 1h15mins to get the best result with these (again I have long hair I don&#x27;t know if this matters that much). I leave them on to heat for 25 minutes, it takes 10 minutes to put them on and the longer I keep them on the better result I get. In my case I like to leave them on for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I only wish there were 15-18 curlers instead of only 12.  I have to do my hair in two sets.</li>
            <li> it does not require any technique to make yourself look just like done your hair from studio. Yes, and it is quickly too. I feel very proud of myself - my hair style gets attention all the time. Thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak from my own experience on this product but my wife loves them. She has medium hair length to her sholders and she&#x27;s always fussing with her hair. I did extensive research on Amazon.com and desided on this brand. I got them as a Christmas gift and she loves them. She gets compliments all the time on her hair and tells me weekly how much she likes them.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Wife never complained about them.</li>
            <li> I really love these rollers. Wish they had a set that was just the 1 1/4 size. I&#x27;ve ordered two sets, and both sets the lids cracked, and I finally just took them off. The rollers heat fine without the lid. The rollers after two years have a harder time staying in your hair, as the velvet wears thin.</li>
