            <li>But now a days anything better for</li>
            <li>but I do wish they came in more flavors on amazon.</li>
            <li>Did you know that toothpaste has many effects on our children from behavioral problems to canker sores, so it is important to find and use an all-natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li>For more on this product come find my dot</li>
            <li>I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.  </li>
            <li>It has a candy like grape fragrance, but the taste is more like a grape flavor medicine or soap.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let her not not being able to use it leave any negative impression because this is a great toothpaste, probably one of the best I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I read that the chemical in most toothpastes (SLS, I think) caused ulcers in many kids.  </li>
            <li>If the packaging or customer service had been better, I would have given the product 5 stars because I think it has solved my daughter&#x27;s ulcer problems.</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It has helped learn and love to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li>They both love the grape flavor of this one.  </li>
            <li>They love the grape flavor.</li>
            <li>My kids love the flavor too</li>
            <li>Love the grape flavor.</li>
            <li>boys LOVE the grape flavor (but not the berry).</li>
            <li>Love the idea of this product, but when I gave it to my 7YO</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this brand and boy</li>
            <li>Excellent toothpaste, like even better than expected.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in minimal packaging (always a plus) promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>free of certain chemicals with these which is still good.</li>
            <li>but still feels like it needs an added ingredient to make the teeth more clean.</li>
            <li>It tastes good and he doesn&#x27;t want a different kind.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has trouble with toothpaste flavored in the mint family, this is a wonderful product for children or adults.  </li>
            <li>good natural paste for toddlers</li>
            <li>Good natural product-large size</li>
            <li>My kids just love this toothpaste, it&#x27;s their favorite by far from all the others!</li>
            <li>Mint makes me cough, so I&#x27;m glad to find a pleasant tasting toothpaste other than bubblegum.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a natural fluoride toothpaste and this one does the job and my twins love the flavor!  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strongly flavored, but what flavor it has is very grape-like.</li>
            <li>When I asked them to brush their teeth before school yesterday, for the first time ever there was no fighting!</li>
            <li>In fact he willingly brushes his teeth when we started using it!  </li>
            <li>ANd I love that it is from all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>They asked if they could use the new toothpaste then excitedly ran up to brush!</li>
            <li>After each meal we go to the bathroom , he grabs his spider man tooth brush and comes out with a grape scent of fresh breathe.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>toms strawberry was a little better than this, but still looking to try another flavored toothpaste and not mint,that cleans better.</li>
            <li>Tastes a little off but still good.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this toothpaste for anyone with a picky child or one that doesn&#x27;t like sweet toothpaste on the shelves today.  </li>
            <li>It is mild and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the best of everything because it is natural flavors, no artificial colors, has fluoride for dental health, AND it actually tastes good and my kids like to use it (unlike the only other ones I have tried that are similar-ish and those other kinds are like brushing with slimy chalk paste).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that this toothpaste was a clear gel, which I really liked because I don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning bright blue gunk out of my sinks when the kids make a mess!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not wild about the idea of a twice daily dose of fluoride, but he&#x27;s great at spitting and uses only the tiniest amount since he has an auto toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a safe toothpaste for my 3 year old for a long time.</li>
            <li>The only flavors I ever found were berry or bubblegum and they were way too sweet for my son&#x27;s taste.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is a safe toothpaste for the little ones.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Natural Dentist.</li>
            <li>Very messy with three young children learning to put toothpaste on their own toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>My picky 7 year old likes it!</li>
            <li>My son is pretty picky and actually likes his!  </li>
            <li>The Natural Dentist got rid of the bedtime battle to brush teeth!  </li>
            <li>(We had ordered a 2nd tube when we were placing an Amazon order even though we weren&#x27;t quite ready to start a new tube yet, just to have it on hand, so didn&#x27;t use it immediately.)  </li>
            <li>Mint breaks my mouth out,  This grape flavor fills the bill for me and comes in a large tube that will last me a while.  </li>
            <li>I had an issue with sensitive gums, but since using this toothpaste my gums have healed, I am guessing that I have an issue with the SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) which is absent in this product.  </li>
            <li>I find most toothpastes without SLS (which I don&#x27;t want) to be without flouride, (which I prefer to use at least once a day.)  </li>
            <li>My daughter is picky and I wanted to get her using natural toothpaste.....</li>
            <li>My two year old son loves this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Prefer it over the Berry flavor by Natural Dentist.</li>
            <li>This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever been able to get my autistic son to use without gagging.</li>
            <li>This tube, however, has a failed seam at the top so toothpaste oozes out the top when used.  </li>
            <li>It was more expensive than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Natural, tastes weird at first but its actually not so bad once you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>I hate that most toothpaste for kids has artificial colors and artificial flavors, but I also think that fluoride is important for good dental health and is what my dentist recommends, so I don&#x27;t like that most &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpaste is anti-fluoride.</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t a high-priced item, it is much costlier than typical toothpastes.  </li>

            <li> It is hard to find a fluoridated toothpaste that is SLS free that comes in a flavor other than mint which my boys detest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The grape flavor is only so-so and the texture is very runny due to the absence of conventional foaming agents.</li>
            <li> This product contains fluoride but is not nearly a harsh as conventional toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It gets a little messy after some kid use, maybe a slightly more narrow opening would help that issue, but kids will be kids, I guess.</li>
            <li> I know the Postal Service and other carriers refuse to ship open containers so my only option besides leaving packaging feedback is to write this review to alert Amazon and its seller of the issue.  </li>
            <li> Since starting this toothpaste and a multivitamin over the summer, she has not had a single ulcer!  </li>
            <li> I bkught it for My 3 year old son who i have trouble with getting him to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> There is a decent amount of toothpaste which will last him at least a month in a half.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t stand mixed textures, only eats crunchy food and during therapy we stopped using a brush on her because it was turning therapy into a negative experience.</li>
            <li> so it was to be expected.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t leave the bathroom with my mouth burning from the mint in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s it healthier for their teeth and gums than your average kids toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Weve reordered several tubes and only one has failed at the seam towards the end of use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a toothpaste without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no more fusing when I tell her</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the nasty dyes and extra chemicals that the other drugstore toothpastes have - we try to avoid all those extra additives with our kids, but still want flouride in the formula.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think I&#x27;m crazy for paying this much for toothpaste, but grape is hard to find and if it gets my kid to brush his teeth without complaining, who can put a price on that?!?!</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time getting my daughter to brush her teeth because she hates the taste of mint, berry, etc.</li>
            <li> This brand has a subtle grape flavor and doesn&#x27;t overpower my son.  </li>
            <li> So, a lot of this expensive tube of toothpaste has been wasted because it comes out of both ends when you squeeze it.  </li>
            <li> In any case, it&#x27;s not good business to leave the customer to deal with the faulty product.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have all those icky unnecessary ingredients added.</li>
            <li> The taste took a little getting used to, but wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> We chose this toothpaste b/c my 5 year old was getting terrible mouth ulcers.  </li>
            <li> either difficult to find, mint-flavored or both.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the tube was not crimped well at the end</li>
            <li> IF you hate chemicals in your kid&#x27;s mouth this is the toothpaste to buy.  </li>
            <li> He hated the taste and refused to use it.</li>
            <li> His dentist recommended a toothpaste without SLS because he gets terrible canker sores.  </li>

            <li> My picky 7 year old likes it!</li>
            <li> My son is picky but likes this stuff. Pricey but would buy again. Tastes a little off but still good.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a toothpaste without harsh chemicals. This has worked well for my child. It was more expensive than normal toothpaste. But now a days anything better for you is more expensive so it was to be expected. It&#x27;s been a great purchase but I do wish they came in more flavors on amazon.</li>
            <li> My son loves this toothpaste.  He looks forward to brushing his teeth now.</li>
            <li> Did you know that toothpaste has many effects on our children from behavioral problems to canker sores, so it is important to find and use an all-natural toothpaste! I was very excited to try this brand and boy they did not disappoint. Groovy grape is the favorite flavor for my children! It arrived in minimal packaging (always a plus) promptly and in perfect condition. It has a nice sleek, easy to use shape and the container works great. Both of my children liked the taste of this toothpaste. When I asked them to brush their teeth before school yesterday, for the first time ever there was no fighting! They asked if they could use the new toothpaste then excitedly ran up to brush! Success!!&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste gets two thumbs up from me and I will definitely be recommending this line to all of my readers.

            <li> I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.  My views are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that this toothpaste was a clear gel, which I really liked because I don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning bright blue gunk out of my sinks when the kids make a mess!  It has a candy like grape fragrance, but the taste is more like a grape flavor medicine or soap. This product contains fluoride but is not nearly a harsh as conventional toothpastes. I had an issue with sensitive gums, but since using this toothpaste my gums have healed, I am guessing that I have an issue with the SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) which is absent in this product.  The toothpaste does foam but not profusely. And surprisingly, even with the lack of mint flavoring, it does freshen breath.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste, like even better than expected.  I find most toothpastes without SLS (which I don&#x27;t want) to be without flouride, (which I prefer to use at least once a day.)  either difficult to find, mint-flavored or both.  Mint breaks my mouth out,  This grape flavor fills the bill for me and comes in a large tube that will last me a while.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time getting my daughter to brush her teeth because she hates the taste of mint, berry, etc. but loves grape.  I have never seen grape toothpaste before, so I decided to give Amazon a try and this product came up.  We have had it about 2 weeks and she is now brushing her teeth daily and loves the taste of the toothpaste.  I am so happy that I can now get her to brush without a fight!</li>
            <li> My daughter has SOD and SPD and she couldn&#x27;t stand the texture of this toothpaste so I started using it and it has a wonderful taste that 99.9% of children would love. I would keep it out of reach of younger children because they might want to eat it. I&#x27;ve probably bought 20 different flavors and textures and as soon as the toothpaste hits her mouth she starts to gag so don&#x27;t let her not not being able to use it leave any negative impression because this is a great toothpaste, probably one of the best I&#x27;ve purchased. She can&#x27;t stand mixed textures, only eats crunchy food and during therapy we stopped using a brush on her because it was turning therapy into a negative experience. The feeling of a brush on her body is intolerable let alone the feeling of a brush in her mouth.</li>
            <li> havn&#x27;t use it yet just like it</li>
            <li> We chose this toothpaste b/c my 5 year old was getting terrible mouth ulcers.  I read that the chemical in most toothpastes (SLS, I think) caused ulcers in many kids.  Since starting this toothpaste and a multivitamin over the summer, she has not had a single ulcer!  The taste took a little getting used to, but wasn&#x27;t bad.  Unfortunately, the tube was not crimped well at the end and the company would not replace the item because we didn&#x27;t report it within 7 days.  (We had ordered a 2nd tube when we were placing an Amazon order even though we weren&#x27;t quite ready to start a new tube yet, just to have it on hand, so didn&#x27;t use it immediately.)  So, a lot of this expensive tube of toothpaste has been wasted because it comes out of both ends when you squeeze it.  If the packaging or customer service had been better, I would have given the product 5 stars because I think it has solved my daughter&#x27;s ulcer problems.</li>
            <li> All toothpastes are too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for my son--his words, not mine--but this one works great for him. I&#x27;m not wild about the idea of a twice daily dose of fluoride, but he&#x27;s great at spitting and uses only the tiniest amount since he has an auto toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bkught it for My 3 year old son who i have trouble with getting him to brush his teeth. He hated the taste and refused to use it.</li>
            <li> My son loves this toothpaste.  It tastes good and he doesn&#x27;t want a different kind.  Just this one and this flavor.  Wish it didn&#x27;t have carageenan (spelling?) in it though.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think I&#x27;m crazy for paying this much for toothpaste, but grape is hard to find and if it gets my kid to brush his teeth without complaining, who can put a price on that?!?!</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;No cargeen- good natural paste for toddlers</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the nasty dyes and extra chemicals that the other drugstore toothpastes have - we try to avoid all those extra additives with our kids, but still want flouride in the formula. It gets a little messy after some kid use, maybe a slightly more narrow opening would help that issue, but kids will be kids, I guess.</li>
            <li> I cannot use any type toothpaste that has mint in it, so I was thrilled to find this brand at amazon.com.  It is mild and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is great! Brushing my teeth is no longer a chore i dread each day and I don&#x27;t leave the bathroom with my mouth burning from the mint in other toothpastes. I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter is picky and I wanted to get her using natural toothpaste..... She loves it now!&lt;br /&gt;good stuff, smells like grape, isnt sweet and sugary, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is our second tube of this product.  It&#x27;s been amazing at clearing up the rash around my son&#x27;s mouth (process of elimination is that SLS was likely the cause of the rash).  This tube, however, has a failed seam at the top so toothpaste oozes out the top when used.  Very messy with three young children learning to put toothpaste on their own toothbrushes.  While this isn&#x27;t a high-priced item, it is much costlier than typical toothpastes.  In any case, it&#x27;s not good business to leave the customer to deal with the faulty product.  The only option Amazon gives me to report this problem is the blame it on packaging issues or return it.  I know the Postal Service and other carriers refuse to ship open containers so my only option besides leaving packaging feedback is to write this review to alert Amazon and its seller of the issue.  If I get any resolution, I will update the review.</li>
            <li> Natural, tastes weird at first but its actually not so bad once you get used to it.  Can be used by adults too.</li>
            <li> My son is pretty picky and actually likes his!  Does the job with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> Grape taste good cleans teeth but still feels like it needs an added ingredient to make the teeth more clean. toms strawberry was a little better than this, but still looking to try another flavored toothpaste and not mint,that cleans better. free of certain chemicals with these which is still good.</li>
            <li> My two year old son loves this toothpaste. He would brush his teeth 20 times a day if I allowed it ( 3 times daily ). There is a decent amount of toothpaste which will last him at least a month in a half. It smells and tastes great. After each meal we go to the bathroom , he grabs his spider man tooth brush and comes out with a grape scent of fresh breathe. And I love that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have all those icky unnecessary ingredients added. This is a safe toothpaste for the little ones. I also bought him a toddler book about brushing your teeth. It has helped learn and love to brush his teeth. It&#x27;s called Brush, Brush, Brush ( rookie toddler ) here is the link below&lt;br /&gt;http://smile.amazon.com/Brush-Rookie-Toddler/dp/0531252361/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1416392798&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;brushing+teeth+books+for+toddlers</li>
            <li> I hate that most toothpaste for kids has artificial colors and artificial flavors, but I also think that fluoride is important for good dental health and is what my dentist recommends, so I don&#x27;t like that most &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpaste is anti-fluoride. This toothpaste is the best of everything because it is natural flavors, no artificial colors, has fluoride for dental health, AND it actually tastes good and my kids like to use it (unlike the only other ones I have tried that are similar-ish and those other kinds are like brushing with slimy chalk paste). Highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever been able to get my autistic son to use without gagging.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and helps with cavities.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste!!  Neither of my kids like mint flavors... My 6yo daughter says it&#x27;s  &amp;#34;too spicy&amp;#34;.  They both love the grape flavor of this one.  And we love the ingredients... no SLS!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a safe toothpaste for my 3 year old for a long time. Almost everything has sodium lauryl sulfate in it! My child loves the grape taste.  There&#x27;s no more fusing when I tell her it&#x27;s time to brush her teeth. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Our kids don&#x27;t like minty toothpaste. They love the grape flavor. We like that&#x27;s it healthier for their teeth and gums than your average kids toothpaste.</li>
            <li> IF you hate chemicals in your kid&#x27;s mouth this is the toothpaste to buy.  My kids love the flavor too</li>
            <li> Perfect paste for a mint-sensitive toddler who needs fluoride. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Son likes it. Helps with the mouth sores</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toothpaste for anyone with a picky child or one that doesn&#x27;t like sweet toothpaste on the shelves today.  I searched all over for grape flavored toothpaste for my son and couldn&#x27;t find any.  The only flavors I ever found were berry or bubblegum and they were way too sweet for my son&#x27;s taste.  This brand has a subtle grape flavor and doesn&#x27;t overpower my son.  My son also tended to gag on a mouthful of frothy bubbles of toothpaste!  However, he doesn&#x27;t have that problem because this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam.  The Natural Dentist got rid of the bedtime battle to brush teeth!  It makes his teeth shine. Thanks, Natural Dentist.</li>
            <li> The grape flavor is only so-so and the texture is very runny due to the absence of conventional foaming agents.</li>
            <li> My toddler loves this toothpaste! In fact he willingly brushes his teeth when we started using it!  ANd I love that it is from all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> My kids just love this toothpaste, it&#x27;s their favorite by far from all the others! We will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> Love the grape flavor. Prefer it over the Berry flavor by Natural Dentist. Mint makes me cough, so I&#x27;m glad to find a pleasant tasting toothpaste other than bubblegum.</li>
            <li> While marketed as a Children&#x27;s toothpaste, it is adult-strength.  As someone who has trouble with toothpaste flavored in the mint family, this is a wonderful product for children or adults.  It isn&#x27;t strongly flavored, but what flavor it has is very grape-like.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a fluoridated toothpaste that is SLS free that comes in a flavor other than mint which my boys detest.&lt;br /&gt;My boys LOVE the grape flavor (but not the berry).</li>
            <li> My son uses this.  His dentist recommended a toothpaste without SLS because he gets terrible canker sores.  It does seem to be helping somewhat!</li>
            <li> Good natural product-large size</li>
            <li> Love the idea of this product, but when I gave it to my 7YO he said it tastes like grape-flavored kids&#x27; medicine. I tried it myself. He&#x27;s right. We will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Only grape toothpaste I can find for my picky kids. They love the taste!</li>
