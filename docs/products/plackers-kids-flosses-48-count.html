            <li>these are nice colors, easy to use - they don&#x27;t look a lot like animals and the shapes don&#x27;t impress my son, but I know he likes the colors</li>
            <li>My daughter love it.</li>
            <li>They have become more diligent in flossing their teeth.</li>
            <li>Between Plackers, Firefly, and DenTek, these are my favorite when it comes to kids flossers.  </li>
            <li>My kids love these things, and they&#x27;re suprisingly durable despite being used by rambunctious boys.  </li>
            <li>These are our favorite kid flossers.</li>
            <li>These are really cute flossers, shaped like animals and flavored.  </li>
            <li>My son is 5 years old and these fit perfect in his hand.  </li>
            <li>Kids love them.</li>
            <li>but they love the shapes</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>My 2 1/2 and 5 years olds love these flossers.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing more fun, which means they might floss more often!</li>
            <li>These are still pretty good.</li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver in a toddler mouth, convenient and entertaining for toddler.</li>
            <li>Great dental tool for young children.  </li>
            <li>These are great &amp; my 3 year old has no problem wanting to floss.</li>
            <li>These flosses are a great way to teach dental hygiene to young kids.</li>
            <li>Very helpful to get her into the good habit of flossing her teeth.</li>
            <li>My kiddos love the way they look and are always excited to pick one out</li>
            <li>/&gt;They reach easily throughout her mouth.</li>
            <li>I can easily access all his teeth.</li>
            <li>These flossers are so easy for my kids to use, they are 2 and 4.  </li>
            <li>so he can hold it easily.  </li>
            <li>The handles are easy to hold too.  </li>
            <li>My son loves theme and theyou are easy to use.</li>
            <li>These flossers are both comfortable to handle for me and her.  </li>
            <li>My kids really enjoy these, they love picking which one to use every night, I think they are okay, it would be easier to use them if the had an angle that allowed for better reach to back teeth, like the crest ones I used to be able to purchase on amazon.</li>
            <li>These are not too wide like some flossers and they smell good!</li>
            <li>It makes flossing his teeth FUN!</li>
            <li>He gets excited to pick an &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; out each night.  </li>
            <li>It would be easier to floss the molars if the floss was at a 90 degree angle to the pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that design issue, I think these are very cute and have held up well so far.</li>
            <li>These are cute, colorful, useful, affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to Glide floss using my hands rather than a flosser, and it is much smoother and faster, better for all involved.  </li>
            <li>In simple terms, it&#x27;s good quality floss.</li>
            <li>overall, good.</li>
            <li>Ever since they discontinued the Care One kid floss at Giant, I have been on the hunt for good kid floss.</li>
            <li>If the floss on the Plackers Kids 1st were of higher quality (smoother), then these might be better than using my hands, but unfortunately it is not.</li>
            <li>The kids love the different animal designs which helps in convincing them to floss after brushing.</li>
            <li>These apparently also have fluoride, so it is nice for those who do not use fluoride toothpastes.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty too!</li>
            <li>They have really cute shapes and the floss is strong enough to not break when they are being used.</li>
            <li>Fits their little hands great.</li>
            <li>Fun Flossers before the Plackers.  </li>
            <li>These things however seem to be able to withstand going through all of my adult teeth.  </li>
            <li>As a bonus, the colors and shapes are fun for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to use and handle is decent.</li>
            <li>Now, it is a fun, nighty ritual.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>And at $2.19 for a 48 count bag, the price is right on.  </li>
            <li>Still trying to get them to use them right</li>
            <li>They have a slight fruity flavor that is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>His brushing was perfect but because we were not flossing, he got cavities between the tight back teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is but for my almost 5 year old it is easy for me to help him floss.</li>
            <li>The materials are high quality while still affordable, but most of all the fun shapes (monkey, dolphin, elephant, and crab) get her excited about flossing.  </li>
            <li>My four year old is comfortable with them: he starts out the flossing sessions</li>
            <li>My child is only 4 and every time after she flosses, I check to make sure she didn&#x27;t miss anything.  </li>
            <li>and he willingly uses them,</li>
            <li>He is able to floss all by himself and the design is the same as the Oral B</li>
            <li>These little floss sticks are great for my two year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>i have been buying these as i need, it really helps keeps the girls interested in flossing their teeth...</li>
            <li>and when I help it&#x27;s easy for me to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li>They easily fit into their small mouths and they love picking out what animal they are going to use.</li>
            <li>First time I used the Plackers Kids Flosses on my 4 year old son I knew right away</li>
            <li>wants* to floss, and sometimes I have to dissuade him from using them multiple times a day because we would go through them too quickly!  </li>
            <li>I say they are mostly easy to use because as you try to reach between the molars, the flat design forces the biggest part of the flosser to either hang out of the side of his mouth or be inside his mouth.</li>
            <li>Considering these things are really for children I don&#x27;t want to say too much about using it myself</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Every night she picks out one in the color she wants</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like floss that have a flavor</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s a question of which animal she wants to use to floss instead of whether she wants to floss.</li>
            <li>Will go back to this kind next time: http://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Flossers-Kids-Fruit-Count/dp/B00UB6UJ22/ref&#x3D;sr_1_14?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1439557913&amp;sr&#x3D;8-14&amp;keywords&#x3D;dentek+flosser</li>
            <li>These flossers worked better on my daughter compared to the DenTek Fun Flosser, but still were not easy to get between my daughter&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>Better than the other brand (I forget the name), both in terms of thickness and in terms of the smell.</li>
            <li>Most days she lets me floss her, but they&#x27;re also easy enough for her to use on herself (missing a couple teeth of course).</li>
            <li>suitable for kids&#x27; little hand.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality for ordering these on line, they are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Good way to introduce oral health to little ones, especially when they see adults flossing.</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend these kids flossers.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old had 8 cavities!!</li>
            <li>Good is that they are lively, bad is that only one of them are liked.</li>
            <li>They are really easy for me to use while flossing for him, and the handle is big enough that he can try to do it himself, too.</li>
            <li>Facing him I use my right hand to floss his left side and use my left hand to floss his right side.</li>
            <li>Since the dollar tree is the only local store that sells this product, I&#x27;m going to have to go back and buy more - $1 is much cheaper than the price here</li>
            <li>Very much so I ordered multiple times.</li>
            <li>They looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li>slide easily between his little teeth.  </li>
            <li>My son got a couple of filling that is a bit tight but we&#x27;ve found certain angles that we can get it and out easily - happen to be both from the outside in move.</li>
            <li>I have used the adult version of this flosser for years.</li>
            <li>I got it for my 8 yr old kid</li>
            <li>She actually allows us to floss her teeth and often wants to do it herself.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old finds it easier to floss with these.  </li>
            <li>My 6-yr old who doesn&#x27;t like flossing likes these.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old daughter loves these flossers.</li>
            <li>Try to explain the importance od flossing to a two-year old -</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter loves using these.</li>
            <li>I do recommend them for young children because they are much easier than loose floss.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I went to the local Dollar Tree (Dollar Store)</li>
            <li>I noticed that the adult Placker&#x27;s are also made under the same US patent as the CVS brand.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old now flosses daily.</li>
            <li>I recently walked out of my 5 yr old son&#x27;s dentist office stating that he would need to floss.  </li>
            <li>These seem to be the easiest way to get my 5 and 3 yr old to embrace flossing on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it takes forever for him to decide which color or animal he wants to floss with ;)</li>
            <li>The floss head is small enough to go in and out of kids mouths with ease and the handles are big enough to give parents a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li>The floss is taught enough (the other brand had too much play in the string</li>
            <li>Much easier than the Denteks which means less pain for The Boy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The animal figures are good and bad.</li>

            <li> and when I help it&#x27;s easy for me to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> They easily fit into their small mouths and they love picking out what animal they are going to use.</li>
            <li> First time I used the Plackers Kids Flosses on my 4 year old son I knew right away</li>
            <li> wants* to floss, and sometimes I have to dissuade him from using them multiple times a day because we would go through them too quickly!  </li>
            <li> I say they are mostly easy to use because as you try to reach between the molars, the flat design forces the biggest part of the flosser to either hang out of the side of his mouth or be inside his mouth.</li>
            <li> Considering these things are really for children I don&#x27;t want to say too much about using it myself</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Every night she picks out one in the color she wants</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like floss that have a flavor</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s a question of which animal she wants to use to floss instead of whether she wants to floss.</li>
            <li> Will go back to this kind next time: http://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Flossers-Kids-Fruit-Count/dp/B00UB6UJ22/ref&#x3D;sr_1_14?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1439557913&amp;sr&#x3D;8-14&amp;keywords&#x3D;dentek+flosser</li>
            <li> These flossers worked better on my daughter compared to the DenTek Fun Flosser, but still were not easy to get between my daughter&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> Better than the other brand (I forget the name), both in terms of thickness and in terms of the smell.</li>
            <li> Most days she lets me floss her, but they&#x27;re also easy enough for her to use on herself (missing a couple teeth of course).</li>
            <li> suitable for kids&#x27; little hand.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality for ordering these on line, they are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Good way to introduce oral health to little ones, especially when they see adults flossing.</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend these kids flossers.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old had 8 cavities!!</li>
            <li> Good is that they are lively, bad is that only one of them are liked.</li>
            <li> They are really easy for me to use while flossing for him, and the handle is big enough that he can try to do it himself, too.</li>
            <li> Facing him I use my right hand to floss his left side and use my left hand to floss his right side.</li>
            <li> Since the dollar tree is the only local store that sells this product, I&#x27;m going to have to go back and buy more - $1 is much cheaper than the price here</li>
            <li> Very much so I ordered multiple times.</li>
            <li> They looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li> slide easily between his little teeth.  </li>
            <li> My son got a couple of filling that is a bit tight but we&#x27;ve found certain angles that we can get it and out easily - happen to be both from the outside in move.</li>
            <li> I have used the adult version of this flosser for years.</li>
            <li> I got it for my 8 yr old kid</li>
            <li> She actually allows us to floss her teeth and often wants to do it herself.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old finds it easier to floss with these.  </li>
            <li> My 6-yr old who doesn&#x27;t like flossing likes these.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter loves these flossers.</li>
            <li> Try to explain the importance od flossing to a two-year old -</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter loves using these.</li>
            <li> I do recommend them for young children because they are much easier than loose floss.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I went to the local Dollar Tree (Dollar Store)</li>
            <li> I noticed that the adult Placker&#x27;s are also made under the same US patent as the CVS brand.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old now flosses daily.</li>
            <li> I recently walked out of my 5 yr old son&#x27;s dentist office stating that he would need to floss.  </li>
            <li> These seem to be the easiest way to get my 5 and 3 yr old to embrace flossing on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes forever for him to decide which color or animal he wants to floss with ;)</li>
            <li> The floss head is small enough to go in and out of kids mouths with ease and the handles are big enough to give parents a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li> The floss is taught enough (the other brand had too much play in the string</li>
            <li> Much easier than the Denteks which means less pain for The Boy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The animal figures are good and bad.</li>
            <li> When flossing the furthest back I just angle it horizontally flat.</li>
            <li> The scent/flavor seems strange to me, but my son likes it.  </li>
            <li> I would be not be going back to any other flosser I used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to other parents.  </li>
            <li> the quality keeps the same as other Plackers&#x27; adults dental floss products.</li>
            <li> The floss is thin enough to fit between his tight teeth (the other flosser did not fit between his back teeth).</li>
            <li> It is a little bit too short.</li>
            <li> My package was delivered before the expected shipment date, as all prior Amazon packages have in the past.</li>
            <li> The width of Oral B Stages Kids Flossers, which I usually use, is smaller.  </li>
            <li> If you have an anti-flossing kid, the animal shapes might help you get past that initial resistance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried one other brand for kids and prefer this one.</li>
            <li> The flavor is yummy and the kids complain less when using these to floss their teeth.  </li>
            <li> And my son LOVES these little animal shaped flossers.</li>
            <li> This one is thin enough for tight teeth.</li>
            <li> and he enjoys flossing everyday.</li>
            <li> I find that they break apart after going though a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> The floss is thin enough for crowded teeth with out hurting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few type of kids flosses.</li>
            <li> I had to dump these after a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not sure that I will purchase them again, but I do have a few bags to go through, and I will finish them.</li>
            <li> unfortunately was not my idea initially</li>
            <li> Turns out, it&#x27;s not easy to find!</li>
            <li> So it is hard for me to help my kid to use it in his mouth.</li>
            <li> These work well with my kids, but this particular type are all sample sizes, so they come in annoying packs of 4 each (12 packs/bag) with coupons in each, as if they were to be handed out at a dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the width of the floss is adult size.  </li>
            <li> (this sometimes takes awhile, she takes her colors seriously) and we floss her teeth.</li>
            <li> The string is thin.  </li>
            <li> None have broken while flossing.  </li>
            <li> In comparison the DenTek are very thin and flimpsy and not ergonomic at all for parents&#x27; hands.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had an unflavored variety to avoid artificial flavors.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use this on my daughter, who already fights us every time we brush and floss her teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t seem to find these that include prime shipping.</li>
            <li> but I did want to mention that I usually hate using these floss sticks.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This allow kids to floss properly. Fits their little hands great. Nice minty flavor too.</li>
            <li> We were using Dentek Kids Fun Flossers before the Plackers.  First time I used the Plackers Kids Flosses on my 4 year old son I knew right away I would be not be going back to any other flosser I used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;They slide easily between his little teeth.  Much easier than the Denteks which means less pain for The Boy.&lt;br /&gt;He likes the flavor.  I like the ease of use factor.  And at $2.19 for a 48 count bag, the price is right on.  I highly highly recommend these kids flossers.</li>
            <li> Perfect way to floss my children&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> I was told I needed to start flossing my son&#x27;s teeth by my son&#x27;s dentist. I bought another brand of flosser at the local Target (the only kids&#x27; one they sold). It was horrible. I have used the adult version of this flosser for years. I was surprised when I went to the local Dollar Tree (Dollar Store) and they had this product. I don&#x27;t have to fight to floss my son&#x27;s teeth anymore. The floss is thin enough to fit between his tight teeth (the other flosser did not fit between his back teeth). The floss is taught enough (the other brand had too much play in the string so you could stab yourself in the gums). After two days of flossing my son&#x27;s teeth with this flosser - he is flossing his own teeth!!!! Since the dollar tree is the only local store that sells this product, I&#x27;m going to have to go back and buy more - $1 is much cheaper than the price here online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editing the review to give this tip I figured out. I could no longer find this at the dollar store or at any local store. I went to CVS and found the CVS brand of these flossers. They looked exactly the same. I bought a package and brought them home. They are made under the same US Patent as the Placker&#x27;s brand. They look the same except they don&#x27;t have the purple ones. I&#x27;ve used them and they are the same. I noticed that the adult Placker&#x27;s are also made under the same US patent as the CVS brand.</li>
            <li> These flossers worked better on my daughter compared to the DenTek Fun Flosser, but still were not easy to get between my daughter&#x27;s teeth.  I&#x27;ve switched to Glide floss using my hands rather than a flosser, and it is much smoother and faster, better for all involved.  If the floss on the Plackers Kids 1st were of higher quality (smoother), then these might be better than using my hands, but unfortunately it is not.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and price of kid&#x27;s flossers. I just wish they had an unflavored variety to avoid artificial flavors. These are still pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great easy floss for kids</li>
            <li> Very Good floss. My daughter love it. The string is thin.  It is easier for her to do floss now.</li>
            <li> Better than the other brand (I forget the name), both in terms of thickness and in terms of the smell. These apparently also have fluoride, so it is nice for those who do not use fluoride toothpastes. My four year old is comfortable with them: he starts out the flossing sessions and I finish off with the hard-to-reach spots.</li>
            <li> I got it for my 8 yr old kid and he enjoys flossing everyday. It&#x27;s real good for kids with the berry flavor.</li>
            <li> Floss your kids as soon as they get molars!! My 4 year old had 8 cavities!! His brushing was perfect but because we were not flossing, he got cavities between the tight back teeth. These are so way o use and my kids like picking out their animal each night!!</li>
            <li> Made in China, not USA as stated in description. I would not give these to my child, and had to discard them.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these - she likes picking out which animal to floss with and having the berry flavored floss too!</li>
            <li> These little floss sticks are great for my two year old daughter.  She actually allows us to floss her teeth and often wants to do it herself.  Considering these things are really for children I don&#x27;t want to say too much about using it myself but I did want to mention that I usually hate using these floss sticks.  I find that they break apart after going though a few teeth.  These things however seem to be able to withstand going through all of my adult teeth.  In simple terms, it&#x27;s good quality floss.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit too short. So it is hard for me to help my kid to use it in his mouth.</li>
            <li> They are very cute and the kids love the animals. However, the floss itself is not taut even before they use them. Will go back to this kind next time: http://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Flossers-Kids-Fruit-Count/dp/B00UB6UJ22/ref&#x3D;sr_1_14?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1439557913&amp;sr&#x3D;8-14&amp;keywords&#x3D;dentek+flosser</li>
            <li> My 9 year old finds it easier to floss with these.  In that case they work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They reach easily throughout her mouth.</li>
            <li> Our boys like the size and shape of the flosser.  It can be used multiple times until the floss frays. They have become more diligent in flossing their teeth.</li>
            <li> Between Plackers, Firefly, and DenTek, these are my favorite when it comes to kids flossers.  The floss head is small enough to go in and out of kids mouths with ease and the handles are big enough to give parents a comfortable grip.  My child is only 4 and every time after she flosses, I check to make sure she didn&#x27;t miss anything.  These flossers are both comfortable to handle for me and her.  In comparison the DenTek are very thin and flimpsy and not ergonomic at all for parents&#x27; hands.</li>
            <li> These work well with my kids, but this particular type are all sample sizes, so they come in annoying packs of 4 each (12 packs/bag) with coupons in each, as if they were to be handed out at a dentist&#x27;s office.  If that&#x27;s what you want, great, but if not, beware.</li>
            <li> My 7 yo loves these flossers.  She likes the taste and the colors and that makes for an easier time cleaning the teeth.  They seem sturdy, too.  None have broken while flossing.  Happy mom and happy kid :)</li>
            <li> I order these with the mint type. The kids love the different animal designs which helps in convincing them to floss after brushing. I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t seem to find these that include prime shipping.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the width of the floss is adult size.  The width of Oral B Stages Kids Flossers, which I usually use, is smaller.  I was afraid to use this on my daughter, who already fights us every time we brush and floss her teeth.</li>
            <li> My kids love these things, and they&#x27;re suprisingly durable despite being used by rambunctious boys.  I would definitely recommend these to other parents.  Makes flossing more fun, which means they might floss more often!</li>
            <li> Great dental tool for young children.  Good way to introduce oral health to little ones, especially when they see adults flossing.</li>
            <li> Not a lot to say - these are nice colors, easy to use - they don&#x27;t look a lot like animals and the shapes don&#x27;t impress my son, but I know he likes the colors and he willingly uses them, so all good. :)</li>
            <li> Nice for kids, makes them want to floss. I was surprised at the quality for ordering these on line, they are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are our favorite kid flossers. The dentek won&#x27;t slide between my son&#x27;s teeth and shred. The firefly are OK, but not quite as good.</li>
            <li> These are great &amp; my 3 year old has no problem wanting to floss. He can do it by himself with these and when I help it&#x27;s easy for me to reach the back teeth. My only complaint is that it takes forever for him to decide which color or animal he wants to floss with ;)</li>
            <li> These are really cute flossers, shaped like animals and flavored.  My 3-year-old son loves to use them.  He even *wants* to floss, and sometimes I have to dissuade him from using them multiple times a day because we would go through them too quickly!  (Good problem to have!) They are really easy for me to use while flossing for him, and the handle is big enough that he can try to do it himself, too.</li>
            <li> My kids really enjoy these, they love picking which one to use every night, I think they are okay, it would be easier to use them if the had an angle that allowed for better reach to back teeth, like the crest ones I used to be able to purchase on amazon. Not sure that I will purchase them again, but I do have a few bags to go through, and I will finish them.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them and whatever gets her to floss!</li>
            <li> These flosses are a great way to teach dental hygiene to young kids. They have really cute shapes and the floss is strong enough to not break when they are being used.</li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver in a toddler mouth, convenient and entertaining for toddler. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My 9 year old now flosses daily.</li>
            <li> A lot of good! I&#x27;m buying again.</li>
            <li> My package was delivered before the expected shipment date, as all prior Amazon packages have in the past. And my son LOVES these little animal shaped flossers. It makes flossing his teeth FUN! So I don&#x27;t have to fight with him about it!</li>
            <li> If your kids do not let you floss their teeth, these will help. My boys are 3 and 2 and they refused to let me try especially my younger one until I introduced these. These are cute and smell nice. My kiddos love the way they look and are always excited to pick one out</li>
            <li> Read the reviews here and people seem to liked it for their kids. I do too. I don&#x27;t know what it is but for my almost 5 year old it is easy for me to help him floss. The design might be the reason. I can easily access all his teeth. Facing him I use my right hand to floss his left side and use my left hand to floss his right side. When flossing the furthest back I just angle it horizontally flat. Seems sturdy too. My son got a couple of filling that is a bit tight but we&#x27;ve found certain angles that we can get it and out easily - happen to be both from the outside in move. As a bonus, the colors and shapes are fun for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My son likes to floss using the plackers floss.  He gets excited to pick an &amp;#34;animal&amp;#34; out each night.  The floss is thin enough for crowded teeth with out hurting.</li>
            <li> This a really easy to use and work great for the bottom premolar area. And they aren&#x27;t a mint flavor which was what I was looking for since I can&#x27;t stand mint flavored things.</li>
            <li> I say they are mostly easy to use because as you try to reach between the molars, the flat design forces the biggest part of the flosser to either hang out of the side of his mouth or be inside his mouth. It would be easier to floss the molars if the floss was at a 90 degree angle to the pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that design issue, I think these are very cute and have held up well so far. I do recommend them for young children because they are much easier than loose floss. My 6-year-old does well using them.</li>
            <li> My 6-yr old who doesn&#x27;t like flossing likes these.  These are not too wide like some flossers and they smell good!</li>
            <li> overall, good. can&#x27;t complain. kids will use them. easy to use and handle is decent. would prefer the floss to be waxed so it&#x27;s a bit easier.</li>
            <li> These flossers are so easy for my kids to use, they are 2 and 4.  They have a slight fruity flavor that is pleasant.  They easily fit into their small mouths and they love picking out what animal they are going to use.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter loves these flossers. Every night she picks out one in the color she wants (this sometimes takes awhile, she takes her colors seriously) and we floss her teeth. Very helpful to get her into the good habit of flossing her teeth.</li>
            <li> My son is 5 years old and these fit perfect in his hand.  He can use them to floss by himself.  he likes the colors and animals and the flavor.  No brainer for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few type of kids flosses. This one is thin enough for tight teeth. Very much so I ordered multiple times. The animal figures are good and bad. Good is that they are lively, bad is that only one of them are liked.</li>
            <li> Kids love them. Still trying to get them to use them right but they love the shapes and it&#x27;s a good way to get them flossing.</li>
            <li> I recently walked out of my 5 yr old son&#x27;s dentist office stating that he would need to floss.  I was given some oral b kids flossers and sent home.  The Oral B kids flossers did not get in between my child&#x27;s teeth without a bit of a fight. I couldn&#x27;t see him doing this alone without hurting his gums. So I purchased these flossers with the hopes they would do the trick and they did.  He is able to floss all by himself and the design is the same as the Oral B so he can hold it easily.  I am very happy and the shipment was speedy.</li>
            <li> If you have an anti-flossing kid, the animal shapes might help you get past that initial resistance.</li>
            <li> I use these for my son to floss his teeth.  They work well, and allow me to get between his teeth.  My son likes to pick out the animal that he is going to use. Anything to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Our kids like the shapes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the wee ones in my life.  Try to explain the importance od flossing to a two-year old - you get no where, until you try using Plackers for kids.  Now, it is a fun, nighty ritual.</li>
            <li> Ever since they discontinued the Care One kid floss at Giant, I have been on the hunt for good kid floss. Turns out, it&#x27;s not easy to find! After trying several brands this is my kids&#x27; (b/c of the flavors) and mine (b/c the handle is sturdy and the floss doesn&#x27;t &#x27;give&#x27;).</li>
            <li> These flossers are a perfect size for my almost 4 year old&#x27;s mouth.  The scent/flavor seems strange to me, but my son likes it.  The handles are easy to hold too.  I&#x27;ve tried one other brand for kids and prefer this one.</li>
            <li> The flavor is yummy and the kids complain less when using these to floss their teeth.  The colors are pretty too!</li>
            <li> These flossers are the best I&#x27;ve used for my kids -- they are easy to use, attractive to kids because of the colors and animal shapes, and get the job done.  Love them.</li>
            <li> After going through a more expensive brand, I decided to give these a try.  They work just as well and so we&#x27;re sticking with these.</li>
            <li> I had to dump these after a few days.  The odor emitted from the bag smells like a bunch of mixed chemicals.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the flavor. Makes flossing a bit easier.  She also loves the different animal shapes that they come in.</li>
            <li> My son loves theme and theyou are easy to use.</li>
            <li> It helps encourage the kids to floss themselves, which is a separate benefit in &amp; of itself. And in spite of the fact that Mom often flosses them. These are cute, colorful, useful, affordable.</li>
            <li> The kids will actually use these and put it between their teeth.  A good introduction to the world of flossing.</li>
            <li> i have been buying these as i need, it really helps keeps the girls interested in flossing their teeth...unfortunately was not my idea initially, i so happened to have noticed my daughter had one, when I inquired she told me she got it at her dentist appt. earlier in the day....so we are hooked on them...great item...</li>
            <li> These seem to be the easiest way to get my 5 and 3 yr old to embrace flossing on a regular basis.  They do fight for specific colors, but that&#x27;s what kids do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues with the product, and amazon delivery and service is the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like floss that have a flavor and I find the animal shapes to be cumbersome when you try to get back in the mouth. I may just buy regular ones for my kids next time.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter loves using these. Most days she lets me floss her, but they&#x27;re also easy enough for her to use on herself (missing a couple teeth of course).</li>
            <li> very good quality. suitable for kids&#x27; little hand. the quality keeps the same as other Plackers&#x27; adults dental floss products.</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old loves these. I laughed when the dentist said he needs to floss, but he likes these and is happy to use them. I wish they came in a dinosaur design as well.</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 and 5 years olds love these flossers. They actually look forward to flossing at night! Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting our daughter to start getting used to flossing her teeth.  The materials are high quality while still affordable, but most of all the fun shapes (monkey, dolphin, elephant, and crab) get her excited about flossing.  Now it&#x27;s a question of which animal she wants to use to floss instead of whether she wants to floss.</li>
