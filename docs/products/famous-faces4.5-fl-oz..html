    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>what I will never ever do is buy a lotion for over $40 because you best believe your getting dupped, and I have to say I dont blame them.</li>
            <li>these are both very good face lotions by designer skin</li>
            <li>It keeps your face from burning and give you beautiful color.</li>
            <li>BUT* I GOT GREAT COLOR  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this product again ( if I ever run out lol)</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This product is great as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is indeed the real \\&quot;famous faces\\&quot; by devoted creations.</li>
            <li>I have always had an issue with getting a good color on my face.  </li>
            <li>and it was good.</li>
            <li>If u want your face to get nice and brown buy this \\&quot;famous faces\\&quot; lotion!!</li>
            <li>I am really glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li>I love this face lotion!</li>
            <li>and now I love it !</li>
            <li>AMAZING</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell which I like.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I can not believe they can sell tanning or any kind of lotion with out some kind of wrapping on</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s there own fault...</li>
            <li>gr8 shipping, really nice packaging.  </li>
            <li>So while I have no other products 2 compare this 2, I can say that I&#x27;m very happy with it:  after 1/2 hour in the sun (at 5300&#x27; altitude; ur results may vary)</li>
            <li>simply cuz price is great!</li>
            <li>Anyone who buys this product, will be in love too.</li>
            <li>so I went with Famous Faces.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Now my face almost gets a better tan then my body.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love love love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle it comes in, and it has a pump to dispense the lotion.</li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s more noticeable on hands because they have porous skin and more lines in them.</li>
            <li>doh famous faces has a very sweet smell with no ATO.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am a very honest and hard worker that just wanted a good face tanner and saw good reviews for this one and got screwed over..</li>
            <li>If you want a lotion to help with fine lines and wrinkles....</li>
            <li>I used it on my face normal without tanning and did fine, but I don&#x27;t understand!!</li>
            <li>A lot of people said that they saw a great color change on their face with this product, but I have not had such luck.</li>
            <li>, that &#x27;s why thet are so cheap.</li>
            <li>so were no idiots</li>
            <li>There is a significant change in the color of my face.</li>
            <li>It is very silky and makes my face very smooth</li>
            <li>It feels great on your skin, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy when you apply and works wonderful under makeup without making you appear oily after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this lotion is really doing anything more than what tanning alone would do.  </li>
            <li>So far the product itself works great as far as tanning, I already see a difference after one use.</li>
            <li>Used it first time today and it made my face so smooth and tan.</li>
            <li>worth tryin</li>
            <li>honestly dont think I will ever buy a tanning lotion on the net again</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really notice a big difference color wise on my face.</li>
            <li>I think clean skin ultimately tans better after doing a comparison.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and break out easy</li>
            <li>I noticed a diffrence after the first use.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 4 pumps to be able to cover my entire face and neck before tanning.</li>
            <li>Famous Faces fell short of my expectations.</li>
            <li>I used this today when I tanned and it works really well!  </li>
            <li>It does have a scent, but the scent is so light that it is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>All together, not a bad product, but wish it worked a little better.</li>
            <li>and it certainly didnt do that</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a week, I do think it does help with fine lines around your eyes (that&#x27;s the only reason I continue to use this lotion)</li>
            <li>THE LOTION IS A WHITE LIGHTLY SCENTED LOTION</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>It also tans your face really well.</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smooth, you only need 1-2 pumps</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>my face seemed to be much clearer than it has been (thanks to cetaphil antibacterial bar &amp; dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel)</li>
            <li>u should prolly know that i&#x27;m a guy who doesn&#x27;t get out in the sun much and who has zero experience with cosmetic stuff.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a fantastic lotion to wear daily.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I plan on mixing it with one of my other lotions to get more color.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new foundation because my face is so much darker.</li>
            <li>Very Dissapointed!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have been mixing this lotion with my old lotion to apply on my face, and this has helped my &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; problem!!</li>
            <li>I can see a noticeable difference -- but not so much that people will come up and say &#x27;wow, what a gr8 tan....</li>
            <li>Ive used this product for a few years and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I mean they can put any kind of lotion,liquid,pee,poop... in the bottle and charge $30-100!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive face or break it out.</li>
            <li>This face lotion has completely changed that for me!</li>
            <li>however I got 3x more color from this lotion in a single session which is very difficult for me having fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and nearly everything I put on my face breaks me out.</li>
            <li>my face is getting more tan and a bit less red.</li>
            <li>I have tried every face lotion out there and THIS is my ultimate favorite in the past</li>
            <li>Also this stuff actually smells good where luminary and obsessed smell like play</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my product was old or what, but every time I used it and got out of the tanning bed, my face is as red as a lobster and burns, and no tan!</li>
            <li>Item arrived early and I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
            <li>package came and I noticed the cap was very loose and came off very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s just a spiral with the top cap and is extremely difficult to dispense without the missing part.</li>
            <li> I notice a little difference when tanning but not enough to rave about.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a facial tanning lotion to help tan my face, but also prevent wrinkles, dark spots, and uneven skin tone coloration.</li>
            <li> I am returning this and any other tanning lotion I have bought on amazon because I have discovered these lotions are cut with chemicals</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after running out of my other face tanning lotion &#x27;Face It&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> but honestly i really shouldnt have to and didnt want to until I knew it was a fake..</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little burning sensation after tanning and I might  be getting a rash now.</li>
            <li> In the past I always had issues with my face not tanning like my body does.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick and moisturizing just like I like it.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;d never tried a tanning lotion on my face because I was always having acne issues with my face and didn&#x27;t want to make it worse.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with this product, even after reading the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> I am NOT happy.</li>
            <li> YOUR FACE WILL GET REALLY DARK!!!!!</li>
            <li> Took 2 times of me using this to have that bronze non fake tan look</li>
            <li> twisted the cap and smelled the lotion</li>
            <li> Greasy, made my face sweat like crazy and my face coincidentally started breaking out after using this product.</li>
            <li> Ehh this isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed but no time to return as I&#x27;m trying to build a tan for an upcoming vacation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this product. It felt greasy on my face and it did not give me any color.</li>
            <li> !!!!AWESOME!!!!AWESOME!!!!AWESOME!!!!&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT WORK AMAZING AND DID NOT MAKE MY SKIN BREAK OUT. THE LOTION IS A WHITE LIGHTLY SCENTED LOTION *BUT* I GOT GREAT COLOR  ON MY FACE WITHIN 2 USES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND  AND BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I like how it does not leave my face feeling grimy and gross after tanning. I was a little disappointed with this product, even after reading the previous reviews. A lot of people said that they saw a great color change on their face with this product, but I have not had such luck. I plan on mixing it with one of my other lotions to get more color. All together, not a bad product, but wish it worked a little better.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for a few years and I love it. Doesn&#x27;t make you breakout or clog pores. Assists in facial tanning.</li>
            <li> If u want your face to get nice and brown buy this \\&quot;famous faces\\&quot; lotion!! I noticed a diffrence after the first use. I am really glad I bought it! worth tryin simply cuz price is great! YOUR FACE WILL GET REALLY DARK!!!!!</li>
            <li> Since I began using this my face is getting more tan and a bit less red. Without it all I ever got was red. I have very sensitive skin and it has caused no irritation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this lotion is really doing anything more than what tanning alone would do.  But I like having a lotion that is for faces and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking orange or red.</li>
            <li> Works great. Not bromzing</li>
            <li> I got this so I dont look red in the face at work after tanning and it certainly didnt do that, it works if you dont want any color to your face cause I didnt get burnt and I didnt get any darker.</li>
            <li> I have always had an issue with getting a good color on my face.  This stuff works great.  It keeps your face from burning and give you beautiful color.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and nearly everything I put on my face breaks me out. I have use this one for a couple of weeks with no break outs!</li>
            <li> Took 2 times of me using this to have that bronze non fake tan look that&#x27;s all feels like moisturizer not tanning lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick and moisturizing just like I like it. Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. It comes out white in color. The pump does stick sometimes, but it&#x27;s not bothersome. I feel like this bottle will last awhile. It takes me about 4 pumps to be able to cover my entire face and neck before tanning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my product was old or what, but every time I used it and got out of the tanning bed, my face is as red as a lobster and burns, and no tan! I used my regular tanning lotion and have had no problem. I used it on my face normal without tanning and did fine, but I don&#x27;t understand!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived without a plastic dispenser. It&#x27;s just a spiral with the top cap and is extremely difficult to dispense without the missing part. Item arrived early and I&#x27;ve only used it once. So far the product itself works great as far as tanning, I already see a difference after one use. I just don&#x27;t understand how I got a bottle with no plastic dispensing mechanism. A bit disappointed but no time to return as I&#x27;m trying to build a tan for an upcoming vacation. Will just have to make do.</li>
            <li> I like how the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts. It also tans your face really well.</li>
            <li> Famous Faces fell short of my expectations. I was looking for a facial tanning lotion to help tan my face, but also prevent wrinkles, dark spots, and uneven skin tone coloration. This lotion goes on smooth, you only need 1-2 pumps so I can see this lasting a while which is a plus since it is only 4.5 ounces! The problem I have is that my face is actually paler than it was when I began using this lotion. I am not getting any color at all on my face now! I have been mixing this lotion with my old lotion to apply on my face, and this has helped my &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; problem!! I have been using this for over a week, I do think it does help with fine lines around your eyes (that&#x27;s the only reason I continue to use this lotion) but for people with &amp;#34;hard to tan faces&amp;#34; I would look for something different!! If you want a lotion to help with fine lines and wrinkles.... This is for you!!! I think I am going to start using this as my daily moisturizer for my face instead of a &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; lotion...</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Used it first time today and it made my face so smooth and tan. I&#x27;m in love with it! Anyone who buys this product, will be in love too. I guarantee it.</li>
            <li> I have used this one time. My skin felt a little burning sensation after tanning and I might  be getting a rash now. I am returning this and any other tanning lotion I have bought on amazon because I have discovered these lotions are cut with chemicals, that &#x27;s why thet are so cheap. It&#x27;s not worth it. I am NOT happy.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase. This is indeed the real \\&quot;famous faces\\&quot; by devoted creations. I have tried every face lotion out there and THIS is my ultimate favorite in the past I have used luminary face and obsessed for the most part these are both very good face lotions by designer skin however I got 3x more color from this lotion in a single session which is very difficult for me having fair skin. Also this stuff actually smells good where luminary and obsessed smell like play doh famous faces has a very sweet smell with no ATO. I will be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion! It is very silky and makes my face very smooth and I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference in my face since I&#x27;ve started using it ( I could never get my face to tan before I started using this). It does have a scent, but the scent is so light that it is barely noticeable. I would buy this product again ( if I ever run out lol)</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;d never tried a tanning lotion on my face because I was always having acne issues with my face and didn&#x27;t want to make it worse. Well this tanning season my face seemed to be much clearer than it has been (thanks to cetaphil antibacterial bar &amp; dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel) so I figured I&#x27;d give this lotion a try on my face. It looks and feel just like a basic moisturizer going on my face. It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell which I like. I&#x27;ve used it four times now and I can&#x27;t believe how well my face has tanned! In the past I always had issues with my face not tanning like my body does. This face lotion has completely changed that for me! My face is keeping up with my body and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive face or break it out. This is a must have for all tanners!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion maybe 5 times now in the last 2 weeks. There is a significant change in the color of my face. It is bronzing the same way that my body has been. I had to buy a new foundation because my face is so much darker. Great product. I have also used it as a moisturizer when I didn&#x27;t go tanning and it was good.</li>
            <li> Very Dissapointed!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin so I went with Famous Faces.&lt;br /&gt;The package came and I noticed the cap was very loose and came off very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Then I obv. twisted the cap and smelled the lotion and it had a sunless tan scent but it was white in color..&lt;br /&gt;So once again, I got dupped.... But all in all I bet everyone that orders a tanning lotion gets dupped some how...&lt;br /&gt;I can not believe they can sell tanning or any kind of lotion with out some kind of wrapping on it.&lt;br /&gt;I mean they can put any kind of lotion,liquid,pee,poop... in the bottle and charge $30-100!&lt;br /&gt;Now what I will never ever do is buy a lotion for over $40 because you best believe your getting dupped, and I have to say I dont blame them. If they can sell lotions online and even in the salon with out a wrapping or a sealed bottle it&#x27;s there own fault...&lt;br /&gt;I am a very honest and hard worker that just wanted a good face tanner and saw good reviews for this one and got screwed over..&lt;br /&gt;I did return the lotion but honestly i really shouldnt have to and didnt want to until I knew it was a fake..&lt;br /&gt;Also, what these sellers dont know is if buyers like my self worked at a salon so were no idiots we know what the smell is, the consistency ,density, firmness, viscosity, ect....&lt;br /&gt;I honestly dont think I will ever buy a tanning lotion on the net again, you wonder why the price is so cheap,fair...</li>
            <li> I used this today when I tanned and it works really well!  I made myself go to the gym with no makeup on....makeup has SPF in it so it will block your color!</li>
            <li> gr8 shipping, really nice packaging.  u should prolly know that i&#x27;m a guy who doesn&#x27;t get out in the sun much and who has zero experience with cosmetic stuff.  so, this is the 1st item i&#x27;ve bot that has to do with either facial care or tanning.  So while I have no other products 2 compare this 2, I can say that I&#x27;m very happy with it:  after 1/2 hour in the sun (at 5300&#x27; altitude; ur results may vary) I can see a noticeable difference -- but not so much that people will come up and say &#x27;wow, what a gr8 tan....&amp;#34;  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning in doors off and on for years. My face never seemed to get the color as well and I wasn&#x27;t big on using my bronzer on my face. So I thought I would give this a try and now I love it ! Now my face almost gets a better tan then my body.</li>
            <li> Nothing works on my face until I tried this lotion! :) Now my face matches the rest of me even without makeup! I would even say it has improved the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love love love this lotion. I notice a little difference when tanning but not enough to rave about. However, it&#x27;s a fantastic lotion to wear daily. I have extremely sensitive skin and break out easy but I can wear this all day and night without waking up the next day covered with breakouts. It feels great on your skin, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy when you apply and works wonderful under makeup without making you appear oily after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Works well on your face</li>
            <li> Greasy, made my face sweat like crazy and my face coincidentally started breaking out after using this product. I think clean skin ultimately tans better after doing a comparison.</li>
            <li> Ehh this isn&#x27;t bad. I love the bottle it comes in, and it has a pump to dispense the lotion. don&#x27;t really notice a big difference color wise on my face. I decided to try this after running out of my other face tanning lotion &#x27;Face It&#x27;. I think I will go back to the &#x27;Face it&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li> This product is great as a moisturizer. However, it has not pigmented my skin in any way. I even put it on my hands as a moisturizer one day to see if it would tan them....also it&#x27;s more noticeable on hands because they have porous skin and more lines in them. DID NOT ADD ANY COLOR WHAT SO EVER.</li>
            <li> I see a difference after only one use. I really like this product. Shipped on time as well.</li>
