            <li>These are perfect for that!!</li>
            <li>This kit is great for any artsy child!</li>
            <li>However, the pens are beautiful</li>
            <li>I was so happy when they came in the mail.</li>

            <li>Loved it</li>
            <li>My daughter loved this gift.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I think my daughter loves them even more!</li>
            <li>Some colors don&#x27;t look nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like them, awesome product.</li>
            <li>Love love them where have these been,!  </li>
            <li>Great fun product.  </li>
            <li>The kids still enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I love to change up my tattoo.  </li>
            <li>Thank you love it</li>
            <li>look its a demo thing, if u wanna make sure this is the design u want and placement, i say get this...</li>
            <li>The ink applies smoothly and the colors blend beautifully, allowing me to choose many different looks and styles as well as expand the provided palette.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>I have quite easily removed tattoo with cooking oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine to have them if you&#x27;re expecting markers</li>
            <li>product does not stay on for more than a day,  Ok if you just want a really temporary tattoo.</li>
            <li>They look beautiful for a few days and are easy to retouch.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to change--not really into permanent body art.</li>
            <li>Great concept and idea and fun to play with, but one of the black pens fine tips won&#x27;t work, and the sealing agent you put over it causes the tattoo to be sticky and therefore stick to fabrics and peel off...</li>
            <li>Company did send out quickly.</li>
            <li>This was definitely the favorite Christmas gift!</li>
            <li>great if you plan on putting them in a place that has little contact with clothing.</li>
            <li>This was really fun</li>
            <li>So fun to work with.</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>They have a lot of fun with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li>This makes them tremendous fun for me to use, as I am not a &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; artist but a watercolorist &amp;#34;expanding my canvas to the skin.&amp;#34; Would very much appreciate a blending pen</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d honestly have better luck with plain jane permanent markers..</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t make convincing, or lasting, tattoos.</li>
            <li>Awesome to have so many colors and the narrow and thick tips on each.</li>
            <li>However I found that it wasn&#x27;t that great of a product because the tattoos do not stay on for longer than a day when it says it will stay on for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>They all work pretty good but the detail-tipped ones don&#x27;t work so good after a bit of use and the tattoos don&#x27;t usually make it to two weeks despite lasting long.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got it because I enjoy drawing on myself and others but sharpies have never lasted long enough.</li>
            <li>the fine point quit working on all markers shortly after use.</li>
            <li>The pens write very well</li>
            <li>and if you want a temp tattoo of your choice..invest in a real Henna Tattoo Kit..</li>
            <li>Either way, I still really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>these temporary tattoo pen really work as just like</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>kool lil kit to play with, before getting a real tattoo..</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>They function the exact same way and the colors aren&#x27;t true to the lids.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get all of the different colors.</li>
            <li>just more  ink less</li>
            <li>Need more black pens in the set though</li>
            <li>The green was very light, on the heavier duty side.  </li>
            <li>However, their quality is much better than products I&#x27;ve tried previously and much cheaper than professional brands.</li>
            <li>Overall, just fun to have.</li>
            <li>I very much enjoy the ones that are working, which is about half of them.  </li>
            <li>The tattoos don&#x27;t last long even when you put the protective material supplied, but they still enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>we had fun making tattoos, but the tattoos didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Fun to use and easy to control but hard to make it last long once on.</li>
            <li>The two black pens stop working before I could finish the first temp tattoo.</li>
            <li>Really wish I could get just black as replacements.</li>

            <li> the latex covering feels gross and doesnt last long.  </li>
            <li> It lasts as long as your next shower.</li>
            <li> Use these quite a bit and they stay on for a long enough (I don&#x27;t use the covering either)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long at all...</li>
            <li> The dark green pen looked light green and then quit working two tattoos in.  </li>
            <li> The pens are much smaller than they seem from the picture, I am not sure how long the ink will last.</li>
            <li> The ointment that comes with the pens does not really work well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy and after a few days it makes your skin look gross.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> pens work beautifull, but  after 3 days sometime less you need to remove.  </li>
            <li> One pen was open and thin side don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Some of the pens were dried out which I did not expect.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money..</li>
            <li> it was dried up.</li>
            <li> However, the claim of two weeks is far exaggerated as the ink begins to fleck and the sealant discolors around the edges.  </li>
            <li> Half of the pens were unusable!</li>
            <li> Just a few days and is was hard to come off.</li>
            <li> However both the black markers were already dry when they arrived which was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work at all on the thin side.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s poor quality!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> and I was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed</li>
            <li> A very disappointing birthday gift.  </li>

            <li> These pens were defective.  A very disappointing birthday gift.  Half of the pens were unusable!</li>
            <li> Some colors don&#x27;t look nice on the skin. One pen was open and thin side don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Fun to use and easy to control but hard to make it last long once on. The ointment that comes with the pens does not really work well. Overall, just fun to have.</li>
            <li> The green was very light, on the heavier duty side.  It didn&#x27;t seem to work at all on the thin side.</li>
            <li> Do thet come with tattoos</li>
            <li> product does not stay on for more than a day,  Ok if you just want a really temporary tattoo. nice colors though!</li>
            <li> I really like them, awesome product. The shipping was very quick. I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Some of the pens were dried out which I did not expect.  Did receive it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Loved it</li>
            <li> The pens write very well we had fun making tattoos, but the tattoos didn&#x27;t last long. Just a few days and is was hard to come off. The kids still enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> pens work beautifull, but  after 3 days sometime less you need to remove.  Definatly not lasts lasting for weeks.  the latex covering feels gross and doesnt last long.  I will not purchase again.  Company did send out quickly.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  It&#x27;s just permanent markers and some alcohol wipes.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money..this product is waaaaayy over priced for it&#x27;s poor quality! I bought this kit to have my best friend (pro artist) draw an idea I had for a tatt on my arm. We followed the directions to a T and it still came off within the next day..the fine point quit working on all markers shortly after use. One marker never worked bc it was dried up. And the adhesive is a joke..it&#x27;s messy and after a few days it makes your skin look gross. You&#x27;d honestly have better luck with plain jane permanent markers..and if you want a temp tattoo of your choice..invest in a real Henna Tattoo Kit..</li>
            <li> This was really fun and I&#x27;m glad I got it because I enjoy drawing on myself and others but sharpies have never lasted long enough. They all work pretty good but the detail-tipped ones don&#x27;t work so good after a bit of use and the tattoos don&#x27;t usually make it to two weeks despite lasting long. Either way, I still really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these. They&#x27;re basically sharpies. They function the exact same way and the colors aren&#x27;t true to the lids. It&#x27;s fine to have them if you&#x27;re expecting markers but they don&#x27;t make convincing, or lasting, tattoos.</li>
            <li> Love them! I think my daughter loves them even more! So fun to work with. I like being able to change--not really into permanent body art. These are perfect for that!!</li>
            <li> Great fun product.  Looking forward to the next dress up party. Going as the tattooed lady.</li>
            <li> Fun and they do last. However both the black markers were already dry when they arrived which was very disappointing. Really wish I could get just black as replacements.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay at all, it says 2-3 weeks and mine lasted about 4 days and I was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this gift. Awesome to have so many colors and the narrow and thick tips on each.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last for weeks. It lasts as long as your next shower. And do not try on kids skin.</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy the ones that are working, which is about half of them.  They look beautiful for a few days and are easy to retouch.  However, the claim of two weeks is far exaggerated as the ink begins to fleck and the sealant discolors around the edges.  Disposable gloves will need to be bought separately to apply the sealant.  The pens are much smaller than they seem from the picture, I am not sure how long the ink will last. The dark green pen looked light green and then quit working two tattoos in.  However, their quality is much better than products I&#x27;ve tried previously and much cheaper than professional brands. The ink applies smoothly and the colors blend beautifully, allowing me to choose many different looks and styles as well as expand the provided palette.  This makes them tremendous fun for me to use, as I am not a &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; artist but a watercolorist &amp;#34;expanding my canvas to the skin.&amp;#34; Would very much appreciate a blending pen so I can not use up as much yellow, and perhaps a correction pen, since it does not remove the way face paint does.  Perhaps a kit of those two and some extra wipes could be sold.  I have quite easily removed tattoo with cooking oil.</li>
            <li> Great concept and idea and fun to play with, but one of the black pens fine tips won&#x27;t work, and the sealing agent you put over it causes the tattoo to be sticky and therefore stick to fabrics and peel off... great if you plan on putting them in a place that has little contact with clothing.</li>
            <li> these temporary tattoo pen really work as just like regular mark pens work nothing different just more  ink less</li>
            <li> This kit is great for any artsy child! This was definitely the favorite Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> Love love them where have these been,!  I love to change up my tattoo.  Never permant. Thank you love it</li>
            <li> This kit was a gift for my teen daughters.  They have a lot of fun with it.  The tattoos don&#x27;t last long even when you put the protective material supplied, but they still enjoy it.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when they came in the mail. I opened them up, used them and thought all was well. the ink didn&#x27;t run when I took a shower, but when I went to use them again they wouldn&#x27;t work. If you happen to be looking for a one-time use, then you found it.</li>
            <li> Worked really well. Need more black pens in the set though</li>
            <li> Use these quite a bit and they stay on for a long enough (I don&#x27;t use the covering either)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long at all... However, the pens are beautiful</li>
            <li> Does not stay on longer than one day</li>
            <li> look its a demo thing, if u wanna make sure this is the design u want and placement, i say get this...kool lil kit to play with, before getting a real tattoo..im solid on this! thanks</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get all of the different colors. However I found that it wasn&#x27;t that great of a product because the tattoos do not stay on for longer than a day when it says it will stay on for at least 2 weeks. It&#x27;s fun but I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Did not work well... Did not last... The two black pens stop working before I could finish the first temp tattoo. Not worth the money. Just use eyeliner or a sharpie.</li>
