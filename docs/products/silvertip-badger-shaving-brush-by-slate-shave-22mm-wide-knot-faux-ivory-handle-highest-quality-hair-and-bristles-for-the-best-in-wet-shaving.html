            <li>Best shaving experience ever!</li>
            <li>Otherwise product was excellent.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for bowl-lathering, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>It is Best Badger grade and a lower grade of Best Badger at that.  </li>
            <li>It has excellent balance and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent value - Great service - Top-notch quality.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good quality well constructed brush.  </li>
            <li>The craftsmanship is absolutly beautiful.</li>
            <li>I decided on this shaving brush because of how nice it looked (including the sturdy gift box and presentation) and it seemed to be a very good price for a Silvertip brush (the best quality hair).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall,I am happy with the brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush purchased on sale.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>That handle has a very nice weight to it and looks very nice in person.  </li>
            <li>The knot feels more like best badger than Silvertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it does has a very nice looking handle with a good weight to it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles themselves can be felt on the skin more than the boar bristles, but its very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Good brush for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, he loved the handle, he loved the bristles, but would have preferred they stayed together.</li>
            <li>Really good brush, really good deal.</li>
            <li>It is so good</li>
            <li>The brush feels good against my face also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 22mm brush with a bulb type head that feels as good as it looks.</li>
            <li>Upon loading I knew this was going to be good.</li>
            <li>The handle easily fits into my hand very comfortably and is a joy to use and looks as incredible as it feels in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I simply love this brush it looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>I like the balance in the hand, have had no hairs shed, and the stiffness of the hairs really allow me to work up a good lather on my face (plus, it feels good too!!).</li>
            <li>All in all, this is the perfect brush for someone who is looking for their first upgrade from their \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; brush as you&#x27;re not breaking the bank to get a silvertip brush.</li>
            <li>Good product and fine company!</li>
            <li>It has a great balance of backbone and scritch that I really enjoy...</li>
            <li>It does have a nice look, feel, and is well balanced.</li>
            <li>He really liked the brush.  </li>
            <li>The hair knot has a nice density, not sparse but not too dense.  </li>
            <li>Without knowing better I thought my shaving was all well and good</li>
            <li>I presumed this was because I was soaking it in warm water.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t own $200-$500 brushes so</li>
            <li>The weight and feel is perfect, making this my new go to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush looks even nicer in person, and my son has been very proud of his new shaving accessory.  </li>
            <li>Excellent lathering so far, will update review if any issues come up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but the GBS brand brush is better and cheaper</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>If it had a couple mm lower loft, there would be a lot more backbone to the hair-knot.</li>
            <li>This is my third shaving brush from over the years and it is also the best.</li>
            <li>looks great &amp; works well, appears to be very well made</li>
            <li>I have several Simpson brushes in Best Badger and a Frank Shaving in Finest Badger.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;IMHO the weight and size of this brush are about as perfect as possible.</li>
            <li>, it still had the backbone to a brush that I love.</li>
            <li>After my three passes, this brush cleaned up easily in warm water and is now resting comfortably in</li>
            <li>I have lost no hairs yet and sincerely look forward to years of service with this brush.  </li>
            <li>you get a great lather and a much smoother shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a clear winner and, more importantly, a welcome addition to my stable.</li>
            <li>The bristles also clean very easily.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it will be fine.</li>
            <li>enjoy more.  </li>
            <li>B00K06IBBO Razor and Shaving Brush Stand by Slate Shave - Faux Ivory and Chrome Holder - Perfect for Wet Shaving Enthusiasts]]</li>
            <li>They efficiently absorb water and the soap lathers very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It did an incredible job face lathering today for three full passes without going back to the soap tub.</li>
            <li>the important part...</li>
            <li>Holds water well, whips up a good lather and soft.</li>
            <li>Having said that, quality of the brush for the pure badger one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have used this brush about 10 times now and have had an overall good experience with this brush.  </li>
            <li>Also, the construction of this brush feels very sturdy, so I expect to be using it for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on a daily shave regimen you need to find yourself a good brush.  </li>
            <li>I only swirl it on the pre-soaked soap for about 5 seconds and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as soft as I thought it would be, being a silvertip, but it softened up nicely after the 20 or so lathers that I&#x27;ve put it through.</li>
            <li>This was a lucky break finding out about this brush.</li>
            <li>You will for sure see this as my new Top-Shelf/Go-To Brush.</li>
            <li>&quot; the first couple uses, but that is gone and now have nice soft tips.  </li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t take much to make sure that you&#x27;re using a marine-grade epoxy for gluing in these knots.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite brush.  </li>
            <li>What a wasteful thought, such a nice brush being used on a woman&#x27;s legs.  </li>
            <li>This brush is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making this offer for so many of us to try your brush...</li>
            <li>It also does a great job making a thick lather quickly.</li>
            <li>Upon initial load of this brush being slightly wet, it really holds a lather wonderfully well.</li>
            <li>It is nothing if not unique and reminds me of a 2-band moreso than a 3 (which is a good thing for me, as a soap user).</li>
            <li>Be sure to rinse thoroughly after use--those same qualities that hold moisture also hold the cream unless you rinse it well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to any others since this is my first , but I can&#x27;t imagine finding one that is</li>
            <li>(quality and sop ingredients have a lot to do with his too),  the knot did fall out because I soak the brush in hot water before use.  </li>
            <li>I have several brushes and many of them are Badger hair brushes.  </li>
            <li>First of all, this is NOT as Silvertip Brush.  </li>
            <li>The handle is first class.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade to a reasonably priced silvertip brush I can fully recommend the Slate silvertip!   </li>
            <li>I can tell that this brush will only get better with use.</li>
            <li>I brought the brush to my checks first</li>
            <li>I lightly dry the bristles on a towel and the brush feathers out for better drying.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t comment on some other people&#x27;s comments about long-term quality but so far, very pleased.</li>
            <li>The nickel chrome finish looks like 18/10 stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>A real bargain.</li>
            <li>I had expected much better quality than this.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what I expected</li>
            <li>They make and hold lather very well</li>
            <li>It has a nice firm spring to it.</li>
            <li>would highly and most strongly recommend this Slate Silvertip Brush to all my traditional wet shaving brothers and sisters out there.</li>
            <li>34;how much better is the brush.&amp;#34;  The price was way up there compared to my other brushes</li>
            <li>I really lovey my new Slate  badger hair brush!  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Silvertip and got sent the normal pure badger one in faux rosewood.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was lucky enough to have a promo code but will not hesitate to pay full price if this brush needs replacing in the future.</li>
            <li>So far it has only lost two hairs which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality finish.  </li>
            <li>High quality silvertip brush.</li>
            <li>After three weeks of normal use the handle came off, I did not drop it or abuse it in any ways.  </li>
            <li>The Slate Silvertip Badger brush is worth the extra cost</li>
            <li>Within 30 seconds or so of whipping it starts to produce a nice thick lather.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to one who is looking for a new shave brush and/or to one who is considering to switching to brush and shave soap.  </li>
            <li>and then I tried this fine piece of equipment which made me refer to the other brush I was using as a &amp;#34;mop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Takes my shaving experience to an entirely new level of comfort.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s new home.</li>
            <li>The worst part is that cheap brush he bought 2 years ago is still in perfect condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush holds its shape much better than the one I was using, by which I mean the bristles stay packed tight for a good soft &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; and keeping a thick rich lather.</li>
            <li>I lost about 10 hairs initially over the first 2 or 3 uses, but that has stopped.  </li>
            <li>but I know what I got, a soft high quality brush that allows for the building of a great lather (takes a little extra time due to the softness but</li>
            <li>The result is one&#x27;s beard becomes quickly compliant to shave with minimal pull.  </li>
            <li>My only two \\&quot;cons\\&quot; for this brush are purely preferences.  </li>
            <li>and there is absolutely no stiff bristles to contend with.  </li>
            <li>I think the key is to keep it clean, don&#x27;t be to aggressive with it and dry it with the hairs pointing downward so the knot doesn&#x27;t soak up water.</li>
            <li>Badger bristles are so soft.  </li>
            <li>Not too soft but not too prickly either.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected as this is normal with all badger-hair shaving brushes.</li>
            <li>This Slate silvertip requires far less loading to produce a full 2+ pass lather.</li>
            <li>When you open the brush for the first time, it does smell like the badger had a 2 pack a day habit, but after using the brush with a couple different Catie&#x27;s Bubbles soaps, the smell has disappeared.</li>
            <li>Hoped it would last longer for high priced item.</li>
            <li>the second time I used it the bristles fell right out of the handle, I spent reasonable money for this piece of junk and had to return it,order a different brand for the same money,not here yet</li>
            <li>That was easily fixed by epoxy and have had no further problems.  </li>
            <li>So after 2 brushes and almost exactly a year of shaving with them I would have to say this brush is not worth the money.   </li>
            <li>No change in soap or procedures; last week I had to go back to using my old brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too soft or hard bristled it is priced right.  </li>
            <li>It shed a little (10-15 hairs) in the first 10 or so lathers, but has since stopped.</li>
            <li>I will say it did smell like a cigarette smokers house for the first few uses but that has since cleared up.</li>
            <li>I had been using an inexpensive Van Der Hagen pure brush prior to purchasing this Slate silvertip, so that is my only other reference for shave brushes.</li>
            <li>I began wet shaving after visiting The Art of Shaving in San Diego (where there used to be more fine cutlery stores to choose from :-().</li>
            <li>I still have plenty of lather left over for at least another full pass.</li>

            <li> It is nothing if not unique and reminds me of a 2-band moreso than a 3 (which is a good thing for me, as a soap user).</li>
            <li> Be sure to rinse thoroughly after use--those same qualities that hold moisture also hold the cream unless you rinse it well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to any others since this is my first , but I can&#x27;t imagine finding one that is</li>
            <li> (quality and sop ingredients have a lot to do with his too),  the knot did fall out because I soak the brush in hot water before use.  </li>
            <li> I have several brushes and many of them are Badger hair brushes.  </li>
            <li> First of all, this is NOT as Silvertip Brush.  </li>
            <li> The handle is first class.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade to a reasonably priced silvertip brush I can fully recommend the Slate silvertip!   </li>
            <li> I can tell that this brush will only get better with use.</li>
            <li> I brought the brush to my checks first</li>
            <li> I lightly dry the bristles on a towel and the brush feathers out for better drying.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t comment on some other people&#x27;s comments about long-term quality but so far, very pleased.</li>
            <li> The nickel chrome finish looks like 18/10 stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> A real bargain.</li>
            <li> I had expected much better quality than this.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what I expected</li>
            <li> They make and hold lather very well</li>
            <li> It has a nice firm spring to it.</li>
            <li> would highly and most strongly recommend this Slate Silvertip Brush to all my traditional wet shaving brothers and sisters out there.</li>
            <li> 34;how much better is the brush.&amp;#34;  The price was way up there compared to my other brushes</li>
            <li> I really lovey my new Slate  badger hair brush!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Silvertip and got sent the normal pure badger one in faux rosewood.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was lucky enough to have a promo code but will not hesitate to pay full price if this brush needs replacing in the future.</li>
            <li> So far it has only lost two hairs which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is a high quality finish.  </li>
            <li> High quality silvertip brush.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of normal use the handle came off, I did not drop it or abuse it in any ways.  </li>
            <li> The Slate Silvertip Badger brush is worth the extra cost</li>
            <li> Within 30 seconds or so of whipping it starts to produce a nice thick lather.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to one who is looking for a new shave brush and/or to one who is considering to switching to brush and shave soap.  </li>
            <li> and then I tried this fine piece of equipment which made me refer to the other brush I was using as a &amp;#34;mop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Takes my shaving experience to an entirely new level of comfort.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s new home.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that cheap brush he bought 2 years ago is still in perfect condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush holds its shape much better than the one I was using, by which I mean the bristles stay packed tight for a good soft &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; and keeping a thick rich lather.</li>
            <li> I lost about 10 hairs initially over the first 2 or 3 uses, but that has stopped.  </li>
            <li> but I know what I got, a soft high quality brush that allows for the building of a great lather (takes a little extra time due to the softness but</li>
            <li> The result is one&#x27;s beard becomes quickly compliant to shave with minimal pull.  </li>
            <li> My only two \\&quot;cons\\&quot; for this brush are purely preferences.  </li>
            <li> and there is absolutely no stiff bristles to contend with.  </li>
            <li> I think the key is to keep it clean, don&#x27;t be to aggressive with it and dry it with the hairs pointing downward so the knot doesn&#x27;t soak up water.</li>
            <li> Badger bristles are so soft.  </li>
            <li> Not too soft but not too prickly either.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected as this is normal with all badger-hair shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> This Slate silvertip requires far less loading to produce a full 2+ pass lather.</li>
            <li> When you open the brush for the first time, it does smell like the badger had a 2 pack a day habit, but after using the brush with a couple different Catie&#x27;s Bubbles soaps, the smell has disappeared.</li>
            <li> Hoped it would last longer for high priced item.</li>
            <li> the second time I used it the bristles fell right out of the handle, I spent reasonable money for this piece of junk and had to return it,order a different brand for the same money,not here yet</li>
            <li> That was easily fixed by epoxy and have had no further problems.  </li>
            <li> So after 2 brushes and almost exactly a year of shaving with them I would have to say this brush is not worth the money.   </li>
            <li> No change in soap or procedures; last week I had to go back to using my old brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too soft or hard bristled it is priced right.  </li>
            <li> It shed a little (10-15 hairs) in the first 10 or so lathers, but has since stopped.</li>
            <li> I will say it did smell like a cigarette smokers house for the first few uses but that has since cleared up.</li>
            <li> I had been using an inexpensive Van Der Hagen pure brush prior to purchasing this Slate silvertip, so that is my only other reference for shave brushes.</li>
            <li> I began wet shaving after visiting The Art of Shaving in San Diego (where there used to be more fine cutlery stores to choose from :-().</li>
            <li> I still have plenty of lather left over for at least another full pass.</li>
            <li> As I exclusively face-lather, the loft of the knot is a little too high for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad brush but not a great one either.  </li>
            <li> I would recommed this produst to anyone who is new to DE shaving and is looking for a little flare.</li>
            <li> What I mean is that it is super-soft thanks to being a Silvertip brush however</li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t -quite- as luxurious as my other Silvertip (A german one that I will not name), it is makes up for it with personality--</li>
            <li> I also think from a hygiene perspective if you dry it with the hairs up you will increase the risk of bacteria growing inside the handle, not to mention water sitting inside the handle could loosen the knot.</li>
            <li> It absorbs water as expected with a badger brush and the silver tips are soft yet firm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving brush for several weeks now and was holding off on my review due to other customer&#x27;s comments regarding bristle shedding.</li>
            <li> Like I said, purely preferences, not actually something wrong.  </li>
            <li> Needed to upgrade my shave brush and after receiving a promotional code from a fellow member of a wet shave group on Facebook that saved me a ton, I went with the Silvertip Badger by Slate Shave.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times so</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;ll have a stiff brush the next morning.</li>
            <li> Also, the metal of the handle is slippery when wet, which is not the case for any of my other brushes, but none of them have any metal on them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was a difference in brush quality due to inexperience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order my other one now.</li>
            <li> The brush and the handle are glued together and after getting wet a few times they come loose.  </li>
            <li> Wanted a good bargain  after 7 months the head came off very disappointed but since these badger bristles are said to be one of  nicest I will try and reattach</li>
            <li> I have moved my rating down to 2-stars from 4-stars because of this.</li>
            <li> It held the lather up on the bristles and didn&#x27;t allow for the cream to fall down the handle.</li>
            <li> Based upon the quality of this brush, I am looking forward to other Slate Shave products!</li>
            <li> I also use less soap as a result of changing to this brush.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I purchased a cheaper brush before and it lost a half dozen each shave.</li>
            <li> The company readily sent me a replacement brush, which I soak just the knot in cold water.</li>
            <li> Poorly constructed and a total rip off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I have already recommended this brush to a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> The knot in the slate brush false short of all of them.  </li>
            <li> Very little shedding even after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced that issue with my brush.</li>
            <li> But alas I wound up there and got my supplies.</li>
            <li> It was as if it had been fully broken in already.</li>
            <li> started by looking for a gift at the Art of Shaving but found it to be farily expensive, so I decided to check Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Avoid this outrageously overpriced and poorly constructed product.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> All bristles detached from base.  </li>
            <li> This was very disappointing!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good brush for the price. Husband happy!</li>
            <li> Item lasted 2 months before the hair part came unglued. Had to glue with gorilla glue. Hoped it would last longer for high priced item.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. The craftsmanship is absolutly beautiful. It absorbs water as expected with a badger brush and the silver tips are soft yet firm. I would recommed this produst to anyone who is new to DE shaving and is looking for a little flare.</li>
            <li> It is a Christmas gift for my son so I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to know how he likes it.  I am sure it will be fine. I hope it is a five star.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and quality product!</li>
            <li> When you open the brush for the first time, it does smell like the badger had a 2 pack a day habit, but after using the brush with a couple different Catie&#x27;s Bubbles soaps, the smell has disappeared. It does have a nice look, feel, and is well balanced. It also does a great job making a thick lather quickly. Overall,I am happy with the brush.</li>
            <li> Watch what you get sent. I ordered the Silvertip and got sent the normal pure badger one in faux rosewood. I didn&#x27;t know there was a difference in brush quality due to inexperience. If I knew, I would have asked for a replacement, but I only figured it out after 6 months. Having said that, quality of the brush for the pure badger one is pretty good. Very little shedding even after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Wanted a good bargain  after 7 months the head came off very disappointed but since these badger bristles are said to be one of  nicest I will try and reattach</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my husband for Christmas. 2 weeks ago, after 5 months of use, the bristles came out of the handle. This was very disappointing! He really liked the brush.  The worst part is that cheap brush he bought 2 years ago is still in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Again, he loved the handle, he loved the bristles, but would have preferred they stayed together.</li>
            <li> Best shaving experience ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving brush for several weeks now and was holding off on my review due to other customer&#x27;s comments regarding bristle shedding. I have not experienced that issue with my brush. I think the key is to keep it clean, don&#x27;t be to aggressive with it and dry it with the hairs pointing downward so the knot doesn&#x27;t soak up water. I also think from a hygiene perspective if you dry it with the hairs up you will increase the risk of bacteria growing inside the handle, not to mention water sitting inside the handle could loosen the knot.</li>
            <li> All bristles detached from base.  Otherwise product was excellent.  Returned and purchased Parker equivalent.</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush but not a great one either.  The knot feels more like best badger than Silvertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle, although hefty in weight is very tiny for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is going to the wife as she likes it.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Holds water well, whips up a good lather and soft. Be sure to rinse thoroughly after use--those same qualities that hold moisture also hold the cream unless you rinse it well. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll have a stiff brush the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush about 10 times now and have had an overall good experience with this brush.  I lost about 10 hairs initially over the first 2 or 3 uses, but that has stopped.  Exactly what I expected as this is normal with all badger-hair shaving brushes. The hair knot has a nice density, not sparse but not too dense.  The tips had the tiniest bit of \\&quot;pokiness\\&quot; the first couple uses, but that is gone and now have nice soft tips.  That handle has a very nice weight to it and looks very nice in person.  My only two \\&quot;cons\\&quot; for this brush are purely preferences.  As I exclusively face-lather, the loft of the knot is a little too high for my tastes.  If it had a couple mm lower loft, there would be a lot more backbone to the hair-knot. It is perfect for bowl-lathering, in my opinion. Also, the metal of the handle is slippery when wet, which is not the case for any of my other brushes, but none of them have any metal on them. Like I said, purely preferences, not actually something wrong.  All in all, this is the perfect brush for someone who is looking for their first upgrade from their \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; brush as you&#x27;re not breaking the bank to get a silvertip brush. I would buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: On my 11th use of this brush, the glue let go and the knot fell out of the handle.  The company was notified and even though I didn&#x27;t ask for a refund because I wanted to re-use this knot, a refund was given and I was asked to return the brush. I have moved my rating down to 2-stars from 4-stars because of this. It certainly doesn&#x27;t take much to make sure that you&#x27;re using a marine-grade epoxy for gluing in these knots.</li>
            <li> This brush replaced a boar bristle brush that  finally broke.  Man, what a difference11&lt;br /&gt;The badger bristles do react differently to water and soap as compared to boar bristles.  They efficiently absorb water and the soap lathers very quickly.  The bristles themselves can be felt on the skin more than the boar bristles, but its very pleasant.  It does feel like its exfoliating the skin while distributing the soap lather.  The result is one&#x27;s beard becomes quickly compliant to shave with minimal pull.  The bristles also clean very easily.  I lightly dry the bristles on a towel and the brush feathers out for better drying.  I also use less soap as a result of changing to this brush.&lt;br /&gt;  The brush construction itself is well balanced.  The brush feels substantial without undue weight.  The nickel chrome finish looks like 18/10 stainless steel.  It is a high quality finish.  The faux ivory itself gives the brush a sense of refinement without over indulgence.&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this brush to one who is looking for a new shave brush and/or to one who is considering to switching to brush and shave soap.  Based upon the quality of this brush, I am looking forward to other Slate Shave products!</li>
            <li> I really lovey my new Slate  badger hair brush!  I can&#x27;t compare it to any others since this is my first , but I can&#x27;t imagine finding one that is enjoy more.  Good product and fine company!</li>
            <li> Excellent value - Great service - Top-notch quality.  Lathers like a beast!</li>
            <li> Really good brush, really good deal. Couldn&#x27;t pass this up.  This was a lucky break finding out about this brush.</li>
            <li> Poorly constructed and a total rip off.  After three weeks of normal use the handle came off, I did not drop it or abuse it in any ways.  The brush and the handle are glued together and after getting wet a few times they come loose.  I had purchased an $8 shaving brush 2 years ago and I am back using that.  Avoid this outrageously overpriced and poorly constructed product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I have already recommended this brush to a few of my friends. I began wet shaving after visiting The Art of Shaving in San Diego (where there used to be more fine cutlery stores to choose from :-(). But alas I wound up there and got my supplies. Without knowing better I thought my shaving was all well and good and then I tried this fine piece of equipment which made me refer to the other brush I was using as a &amp;#34;mop&amp;#34;. This brush holds its shape much better than the one I was using, by which I mean the bristles stay packed tight for a good soft &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; and keeping a thick rich lather. Also, the construction of this brush feels very sturdy, so I expect to be using it for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. - using my wifes account to post this review</li>
            <li> Great brush purchased on sale.  A real bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday. After a month of use, the knot fell off from the handle. I had expected much better quality than this. It&#x27;s quite embarrassing for a gift to fall apart!</li>
            <li> the second time I used it the bristles fell right out of the handle, I spent reasonable money for this piece of junk and had to return it,order a different brand for the same money,not here yet but wouldn&#x27;t recommend your to anyone!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It will not deposit shaving soap on my face- It all stays on the brush!  No change in soap or procedures; last week I had to go back to using my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend buying this brush.</li>
            <li> This is my third shaving brush from over the years and it is also the best.I just wish it had a holder with it. My bad,I didn&#x27;t ask,I presumed!</li>
            <li> High quality silvertip brush. Excellent lathering so far, will update review if any issues come up.</li>
            <li> Needed to upgrade my shave brush and after receiving a promotional code from a fellow member of a wet shave group on Facebook that saved me a ton, I went with the Silvertip Badger by Slate Shave. Wasn&#x27;t sure what I expected but I know what I got, a soft high quality brush that allows for the building of a great lather (takes a little extra time due to the softness but that&#x27;s to be expected). The weight and feel is perfect, making this my new go to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to have a promo code but will not hesitate to pay full price if this brush needs replacing in the future.</li>
            <li> looks great &amp; works well, appears to be very well made</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. Takes my shaving experience to an entirely new level of comfort. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but the GBS brand brush is better and cheaper</li>
            <li> By far my favorite brush.  Not too soft or hard bristled it is priced right.  Soap loads up well, (quality and sop ingredients have a lot to do with his too),  the knot did fall out because I soak the brush in hot water before use.  That was easily fixed by epoxy and have had no further problems.  I would buy this brush again.</li>
            <li> Put a lot of thought into this before I pushed the &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; button.  I have several brushes and many of them are Badger hair brushes.  I was thinking &amp;#34;how much better is the brush.&amp;#34;  The price was way up there compared to my other brushes but I decided to buy it and give it a try.  Truly shaving bliss.  The silver tip Badger bristles are so soft.  They make and hold lather very well and there is absolutely no stiff bristles to contend with.  It is so good I&#x27;m going to buy another just to have in case something happens to this one.  Like my wife finding out how silky it feels applying shave soap to skin.  What a wasteful thought, such a nice brush being used on a woman&#x27;s legs.  I&#x27;m going to order my other one now.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is NOT as Silvertip Brush.  It is Best Badger grade and a lower grade of Best Badger at that.  I have several Simpson brushes in Best Badger and a Frank Shaving in Finest Badger.  The knot in the slate brush false short of all of them.  It has a very coarse feel on the face, nothing like a Silvertip should feel.  Nevertheless, it does has a very nice looking handle with a good weight to it.  The handle is first class.  However, after about the 4th use, the knot came out of the handle while I was shaking the water out of it.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely worth the money. If you&#x27;re on a daily shave regimen you need to find yourself a good brush.  I had been using an inexpensive Van Der Hagen pure brush prior to purchasing this Slate silvertip, so that is my only other reference for shave brushes. This Slate silvertip requires far less loading to produce a full 2+ pass lather. I only swirl it on the pre-soaked soap for about 5 seconds and it&#x27;s good to go. I&#x27;ve been face lathering for a while and this brush does quite well. Within 30 seconds or so of whipping it starts to produce a nice thick lather. The brush feels good against my face also. Not too soft but not too prickly either. It has a nice firm spring to it. I will say it did smell like a cigarette smokers house for the first few uses but that has since cleared up. Even after two passes and touch ups I still have plenty of lather left over for at least another full pass. If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade to a reasonably priced silvertip brush I can fully recommend the Slate silvertip!   Update (07/29/2015)  2 months after using the brush the knot separated from the handle. I presumed this was because I was soaking it in warm water. The company readily sent me a replacement brush, which I soak just the knot in cold water. As of a couple days ago the replacement brush finally did the same thing. So after 2 brushes and almost exactly a year of shaving with them I would have to say this brush is not worth the money.   I now have a synthetic brush from the Wet Dog shaving company and it&#x27;s working quite well, so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Silvertip shaving brush along with the matching stand [[ASIN:B00K06IBBO Razor and Shaving Brush Stand by Slate Shave - Faux Ivory and Chrome Holder - Perfect for Wet Shaving Enthusiasts]] as a gift for my son.&lt;br /&gt;I started by looking for a gift at the Art of Shaving but found it to be farily expensive, so I decided to check Amazon.  I decided on this shaving brush because of how nice it looked (including the sturdy gift box and presentation) and it seemed to be a very good price for a Silvertip brush (the best quality hair).&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  The brush looks even nicer in person, and my son has been very proud of his new shaving accessory.  Also, his mother enjoys his clean-shaven appearance.</li>
            <li> When I received this in the post, I knew it was a keeper. It wasn&#x27;t as soft as I thought it would be, being a silvertip, but it softened up nicely after the 20 or so lathers that I&#x27;ve put it through. It has a great balance of backbone and scritch that I really enjoy... I can tell that this brush will only get better with use. It shed a little (10-15 hairs) in the first 10 or so lathers, but has since stopped. It is nothing if not unique and reminds me of a 2-band moreso than a 3 (which is a good thing for me, as a soap user). While it isn&#x27;t -quite- as luxurious as my other Silvertip (A german one that I will not name), it is makes up for it with personality--It has excellent balance and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a clear winner and, more importantly, a welcome addition to my stable.</li>
            <li> After 4 days of using this brush I am submitting this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it feel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO the weight and size of this brush are about as perfect as possible. It&#x27;s a 22mm brush with a bulb type head that feels as good as it looks. The handle easily fits into my hand very comfortably and is a joy to use and looks as incredible as it feels in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the important part...how does it perform?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t own $200-$500 brushes so, I&#x27;m coming at this as a intermediate level shaver so my review may be a bit over-rated to some. Upon initial load of this brush being slightly wet, it really holds a lather wonderfully well. It held the lather up on the bristles and didn&#x27;t allow for the cream to fall down the handle. Upon loading I knew this was going to be good. I brought the brush to my checks first and I couldn&#x27;t believe how it splayed on my face immediately. It was as if it had been fully broken in already. The feel was out of this world. What I mean is that it is super-soft thanks to being a Silvertip brush however, it still had the backbone to a brush that I love. It did an incredible job face lathering today for three full passes without going back to the soap tub. After my three passes, this brush cleaned up easily in warm water and is now resting comfortably in it&#x27;s new home. You will for sure see this as my new Top-Shelf/Go-To Brush. I have lost no hairs yet and sincerely look forward to years of service with this brush.  Thanks so much for making this offer for so many of us to try your brush...This is a great brush at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly and most strongly recommend this Slate Silvertip Brush to all my traditional wet shaving brothers and sisters out there.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality well constructed brush.  I&#x27;ve only used a few times so can&#x27;t comment on some other people&#x27;s comments about long-term quality but so far, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I simply love this brush it looks and feels great. So far it has only lost two hairs which is fantastic. I purchased a cheaper brush before and it lost a half dozen each shave. The Slate Silvertip Badger brush is worth the extra cost you get a great lather and a much smoother shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this after a cheaper brush gave out after about 2 months. I like the balance in the hand, have had no hairs shed, and the stiffness of the hairs really allow me to work up a good lather on my face (plus, it feels good too!!).</li>
