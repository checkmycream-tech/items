            <li>The product is great, the price is great, and you will notice results immediately.</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Really nice and great price,,I already have my bleach trays</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product that works.</li>
            <li>Remineralization gels are good, but the whitening gel product didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li>Otherwise Im sure it would be a great product</li>
            <li>but I have not been able to try it yet!</li>
            <li>Truly amazing results .....</li>
            <li>You must have your own trays.</li>
            <li>It also comes with re-mineralizing gel that you put in your trays as directed and it helps take the sensitivity any bleach might cause,,All in all a great product and sooo much cheaper than the bleach at the dentist.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>So glad you had it to offer.</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and look much better.</li>
            <li>No need to pay more than this.</li>
            <li>THe mineralization is my favorite part, it feels so good on your teeth and leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Honest reviews and quick to receive it.</li>
            <li>Also a light is needed to activate the product.  </li>
            <li>Quick working, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Now, I am only using the product once every four days to keep my teeth at the whiteness that looks good for me.</li>
            <li>It is very effective and does not cause the burning that I have found from other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered product from my normal company in addition to this.</li>
            <li>I started noticing a difference within the first week!</li>
            <li>fast !!</li>
            <li>I recommend giving it a try to remove surface stains and brighten your smile.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>Great price and work as well as the more expensive brand-name producys</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried anything for teeth whitening</li>
            <li>I ordered 22% from another site and I am using that first.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the higher priced ones so I don&#x27;t have anything to make a comparison to but</li>
            <li>It works VERY quickly and results are more intense then the products I purchased from my dentist in the past.</li>
            <li>use this at all up now on my second set that set work just fine</li>
            <li>Huge amount, stuff should last forever...</li>
            <li>This is NOTHING like the real gel.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>This is NOTHING like the real gel I purchase at my dentist for $25 dollars.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>The whitening process left my teeth a bit sensitive and I ran out of the remineralization gel pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>With just a few applications it really does show a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had friends get the teeth bleached at the dentist&#x27;s office (1-visit deal) and after hearing the insane pain they experienced, I would much rather stick to this slower, MUCH more affordable alternative.</li>
            <li>Please be aware prior to ordering.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but this DEFINATELY went above and beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>It saves a lot of money at the dentist and my teeth look professional whitened.</li>
            <li>These are the same as my Dentist recommends but so much cheaper</li>
            <li>Since this is professional strength, I have noticed that it does cause some gum, under tongue, and inside cheek skin irritation.</li>
            <li>The specs were nearly identical to all of the other products at a higher price point</li>
            <li>DID&#x27;NT REALLY WHITEN MUCH…JUST A LITTLE, AND I USED FOR OVER A WEEK</li>

            <li> Works great... Huge amount, stuff should last forever...</li>
            <li> Really nice and great price,,I already have my bleach trays so this worked wonderfully. It also comes with re-mineralizing gel that you put in your trays as directed and it helps take the sensitivity any bleach might cause,,All in all a great product and sooo much cheaper than the bleach at the dentist.</li>
            <li> What is this diluted with?  Aquaphor?  Vaseline? I&#x27;m glad I ordered product from my normal company in addition to this. I&#x27;m afraid to try the remineralizing now. I&#x27;ve tried many products in addition to zoom in office procedure, and this is the most disgusting waste of my 45 minutes!</li>
            <li> my yellow teeth are gone</li>
            <li> Awesome product, delivery without any problems! Thank you, perfect!</li>
            <li> I keep ordering this product whenever I run out. It is very effective and does not cause the burning that I have found from other products. It works VERY quickly and results are more intense then the products I purchased from my dentist in the past. I recommend giving it a try to remove surface stains and brighten your smile.</li>
            <li> use this at all up now on my second set that set work just fine</li>
            <li> My tinted teeth are now white. I had used whitener that was given to me by my dentist. It did the job but I felt that I needed to have an extra supply. This was so inexpensive and the quantity was great. I use the whitener as directed. Remember to have an impression done so as to whiten only those teeth that need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been whitening with these on and off for 2 years now and I always get compliments about how white my teeth are. I&#x27;ve had friends get the teeth bleached at the dentist&#x27;s office (1-visit deal) and after hearing the insane pain they experienced, I would much rather stick to this slower, MUCH more affordable alternative. The only thing I would change about this package is that it should include a 3rd remineralization stick. The whitening process left my teeth a bit sensitive and I ran out of the remineralization gel pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Good product. Slower than promised shipping.</li>
            <li> This only came with the syringes and no where does it say it is only a refill kit, but you need the mouth piece to place the whitener in.  Also a light is needed to activate the product.  Please be aware prior to ordering.  Otherwise Im sure it would be a great product but I have not been able to try it yet!</li>
            <li> Great price and work as well as the more expensive brand-name producys</li>
            <li> Would biy again works well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried anything for teeth whitening and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I started noticing a difference within the first week! I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but this DEFINATELY went above and beyond my expectations. The product is great, the price is great, and you will notice results immediately. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is NOTHING like the real gel. This burned my gums, burned my throat, and I had to take it out of my mouth after only two minutes due to the pain. This is the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made on amazon so far.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. As long as you use it everyday for 15 minutes or every other day for 30 you will see the difference right away. I used it like this for two weeks and I am very happy. THe mineralization is my favorite part, it feels so good on your teeth and leaves you feeling fresh and clean. PS. Try to cut down any mouthguard you are using to barely above your gum line because the gel can sting a lot and turn your gums white. (temporarily, like 30 minutes, but is gone if you immediately use the minerals for 30) Good product that works.</li>
            <li> Quick working, easy to use. Price is right. So glad you had it to offer. Honest reviews and quick to receive it.</li>
            <li> The product seems weak and not what I expected. When purchased from the dentist it is stored in the refrigerator and instructions state to keep it refrigerated.&lt;br /&gt;The upside would be not much of a chance to burn your gums.</li>
            <li> This product work as it stated that it would.  It saves a lot of money at the dentist and my teeth look professional whitened.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing results ..... fast !!</li>
            <li> I have not used the 33% yet. I ordered 22% from another site and I am using that first. These are the same as my Dentist recommends but so much cheaper and you get the remineralixation gel as a bonus. Great deal. You must have your own trays.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  With just a few applications it really does show a huge difference.  I will surley purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first trying this lower priced product. The specs were nearly identical to all of the other products at a higher price point so I decided to try. I haven&#x27;t tried the higher priced ones so I don&#x27;t have anything to make a comparison to but in my case, this product has worked quite well! My teeth are whiter and look much better. Since this is professional strength, I have noticed that it does cause some gum, under tongue, and inside cheek skin irritation. To start with, I used this product every other day for two weeks to jump start the whitening process. Now, I am only using the product once every four days to keep my teeth at the whiteness that looks good for me. With that extended time interval, my gums and the inside of mouth don&#x27;t get so irritated. It does work quite well in whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is NOTHING like the real gel I purchase at my dentist for $25 dollars. This burned my gums, turned them white, burned my throat, and I had to take it out of my mouth after only two minutes due to the pain. This is the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made on amazon so far. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be used,burns the gums right away,very disappointed</li>
            <li> Works great.  No need to pay more than this.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  Remineralization gels are good, but the whitening gel product didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> DID&#x27;NT REALLY WHITEN MUCH…JUST A LITTLE, AND I USED FOR OVER A WEEK</li>
