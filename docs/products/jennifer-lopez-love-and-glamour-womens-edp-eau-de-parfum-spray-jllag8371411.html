            <li>it&#x27;s a nice perfume.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have this one in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>everything was ok, quality and price good.</li>
            <li>A good clean scent.  </li>
            <li>quick delivery; good packing and the product are as you describe it -- I recommend them.</li>
            <li>and 3 I  have smelled that are lovely..</li>
            <li>I love Jennifer Lopez</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>And I love it on her.</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance for every day so glad I find it here at amazon for a better price.</li>
            <li>I personally love this scent.</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it...</li>
            <li>Love my perfume.  </li>
            <li>love this parfume</li>
            <li>If you want a good smell buy \\&quot;Love at first Glow by JLO!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>, I see there is citrus and musk, so my sniffer must be working just fine.  </li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>Gave myself a free squirt from the tester.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice in a gift set, but other then that love it :)</li>
            <li>it smells like grapefruit and kids bubblebath, grapefruit smells like semi clean underarms to me...</li>
            <li>Fragrance is not overbearing and not to sweet.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it as well, and he is super picky about perfumes.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like something sour &amp; sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not floral, I can&#x27;t do floral or light scents because they give me massive headaches</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume when it first came out, it came with a handbag,lotion and body wash.</li>
            <li>I just smelled this for the first time at CVS.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in seeing if it was just luck the first time around.  </li>
            <li>Clean fresh &amp; last all day</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>If everything smelled the same how would we be unique?</li>
            <li>think perfume reviews are honestly somewhat pointless, and when reading reviews for perfume products should always be taken with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li>And it came early, too!</li>
            <li>Dries down to a soft, unique scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice fragrance, I bought this blind (basically due to price).</li>

            <li> This stinks. .. it smells like grapefruit and kids bubblebath, grapefruit smells like semi clean underarms to me... it&#x27;s disgusting.. I bought mine at ross, I thought I could blind shop when it comes to jennifer lopez fragrance because I have 2 I have been in love with for years and 3 I  have smelled that are lovely.. this is a disappointment.. The bottle is glass with an akward pink cap. I would smell before buying this one... Hate it</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume when it first came out, it came with a handbag,lotion and body wash. She loved it, its very elegant and not overbearing at all. I love Jennifer Lopez she knows her perfumes well.</li>

            <li> Excellent: quick delivery; good packing and the product are as you describe it -- I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance but it only last about 2 hours before the scent was gone.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I got this at a great price. My wife loved this as a gift. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Light. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fragrance, I bought this blind (basically due to price). Fragrance is not overbearing and not to sweet. Its a very nice blend....the only down side it doesn&#x27;t last all day (which for the price, I didn&#x27;t expect it to).</li>

            <li> Clean fresh &amp; last all day</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! It is actually one of the only perfumes I can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache! The only problem is it can be hard to find!</li>
            <li> I gave this perfume as a gift, and my friend loves it. She said she wears it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I will also get one for myself if it is that good.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. And I love it on her. Enough said</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. I bought 2 bottles of this perfume and there is no scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all.</li>
            <li> i love j lo product smell good but have to keep on spraying my self but tsure smelled good recommend</li>
            <li> Ordered wrong scent.  Much bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance for every day so glad I find it here at amazon for a better price.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great because it&#x27;s not too strong and it doesn&#x27;t gives me a headache. I would recommend this product to others and definitely buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> I personally love this scent. It&#x27;s light and not floral, I can&#x27;t do floral or light scents because they give me massive headaches and I&#x27;d rather feel good then smell floral. All in all it&#x27;s a nice perfume. I don&#x27;t wear the same perfume everyday I try to always mix it up and it&#x27;s nice to have this one in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think perfume reviews are honestly somewhat pointless, and when reading reviews for perfume products should always be taken with a grain of salt. No one has the same preferences and you are going to encounter someone who can&#x27;t smell it or they don&#x27;t like it. And thats because of their chemistry. If everything smelled the same how would we be unique?</li>
            <li> I just smelled this for the first time at CVS.  Gave myself a free squirt from the tester.  Very delicious!  It smells like lemons &amp; vanilla to me and from the Scent Notes list on Amazon, I see there is citrus and musk, so my sniffer must be working just fine.  I like it.  CVS was out of it, so I&#x27;ll order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it... Not to strong perfect. Would be nice in a gift set, but other then that love it :)</li>
            <li> A good clean scent.  Dries down to a soft, unique scent.  I have never smelled anything remotely close to this scent.  My husband loves it as well, and he is super picky about perfumes.</li>
            <li> Love my perfume.  I wear it everyday</li>
            <li> there is virtually no scent to it.</li>
            <li> love this parfume i was looking for it</li>
            <li> everything was ok, quality and price good.</li>
            <li> Yet another celebrity scent that JLo has mastered. I&#x27;ve smelled all the other celebrity scents but JLo knows her stuff.  I don&#x27;t know how she does it..  I&#x27;m not a fan of Hollywood by no means but after smelling Glow I was interested in seeing if it was just luck the first time around.  I have collected almost all of what she has created.  Never been dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance....</li>
    </ol>
