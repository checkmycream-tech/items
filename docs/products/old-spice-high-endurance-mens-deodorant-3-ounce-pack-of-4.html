            <li>I like Old Spice because it works well at keeping me dry and it smells great.</li>
            <li>The classic high endurance scent that I love.</li>
            <li>At times I&#x27;ve tried Old Spice&#x27;s other scents, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Some may think the High Endurance Original is like the original that came before High Endurance.</li>
            <li>I got an itchy rash on the first usage of High Endurance Original</li>
            <li>The products come in good condition and in a predictable manner</li>

            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to straight deodorant.  </li>
            <li>no so much quantity to get all the freshnes and protection.</li>
            <li>by him--i am referring to my husband and he will tell me when to get more/ thanks.</li>
            <li>* like the scent - very musky and manly without being over-powering.  </li>
            <li>I am seeking legal advice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other makes, Dove, Rexona, Speed Stick, and any like this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using High Endurance for years,  </li>
            <li>High endurance</li>
            <li>Old Favorite, which I like to get by the packs since there has been a drought of available product in the past on Amazon, but they always come back.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find Original (not High Endurance) variety, so I bought this.  </li>
            <li>It is not a powder or dry at all, goes on kind of wet, so you can&#x27;t be in a hurry to put on your shirt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice that this new package they reduced the quantity from 3.25 oz to 3 oz.  </li>
            <li>The green original classic deodorant seems milder to the skin than the high endurance..</li>
            <li>The green original classic deodorant seems milder to the skin than the high endurance.</li>
            <li>I was worried that once left out on my hot porch after delivery that they might be melted, but that was not the case.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought the original Old Spice at several stores but hubby says it&#x27;s not the same.  </li>
            <li>then purchased Old Spice Classic green stick that has the original formula.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t hurt if you sweat, doesn&#x27;t stain, and all--</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive underarms and this gives me no problems.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and this stick deodorant (without antiperspirant) works for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Old Spice since I was young.  </li>
            <li>Plus the ladies like Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>Definitely cheaper than the stores and very convenient.</li>
            <li>and maybe I just have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I will say it&#x27;s not just old spice that uses this chemical and its in almost in every antiperspirant you&#x27;ll find at a store.  </li>
            <li>Strong but not overwhelming scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blue stick of Old Spice High Endurance says \\&quot;Original\\</li>
            <li>have tried other scent&#x27;s but came back to the original.</li>
            <li>Looking on the back it has the usual propylene glycol that most all deodorant has.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent deodorant, and finally I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works for a long time and is not irritating.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice classic green stick I would recommend for those who have more sensitive skin and perspiration is average to low.</li>
            <li>It is much more subtle than the regular old spice and doesn&#x27;t burn the pits,</li>
            <li>/&gt;The high endurance blue stick has a different chemical formula.</li>
            <li>The old spice scent stayed for a lesser period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Opening a flesh wound rash that would open your skin for agonizing pain..Don&#x27;t believe my story,google Old Spice underarm rash..</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the Old Spice Classic Deodorant that is green not the high endurance blue stick.</li>
            <li>Here are some things I discovered about High Endurance blue stick vs the Classic green</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as you would find in the grocery/drug store, but for half the price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product hoping for a deodorant that smelled like old spice but lasts long.</li>
            <li>The scents are very different, the blue stick smells stronger while the green stick has a little more of an rubbing alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>Is the one that causes the least amount of irritation when in extreme situations, and strong enough to do the job.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with original!</li>
            <li> I would only recommend to people who sweat excessively and do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes a long way with me.</li>
            <li> but it takes a bit to dry under my arms</li>
            <li> That is unfortunate since it just waste more packaging.</li>
            <li> Double absorbents means the skin and sweat glands get really dried out causing skin irritation then potentially developing a rash.</li>

            <li> As advertised and was cheaper than buying at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> My husband and son use this product.  I like the great price and will buy again.  If I can save money count me in.</li>
            <li> The ladies love it ;-)</li>
            <li> My favorite for decades.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years, it is great. Amazon makes buying so easy.</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes a long way with me. Is the one that causes the least amount of irritation when in extreme situations, and strong enough to do the job. For some reason designer deodorants rarely agree with me, something about the contents, perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;An Old Favorite, which I like to get by the packs since there has been a drought of available product in the past on Amazon, but they always come back. Reliable, economical, and if desired, scentless. 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> Original scent still gets compliments and it works</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it!  We&#x27;ve bought the original Old Spice at several stores but hubby says it&#x27;s not the same.  My son orders these on Amazon and asked us to order them here.  Hubby is very satisfied with this!</li>
            <li> Good price. Fast service</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s deodorant.  It does a good job, I like the original scent.  I&#x27;ve been using High Endurance for years,  have tried other scent&#x27;s but came back to the original.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, will be my new deodorant! I also have sensitive underarms and this gives me no problems.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my fiance. Great price, and we buy them through the subscribe and save. Good quality and smells good</li>
            <li> This is a great way to make sure you always have extra deodorant on hand. My husband prefers this brand.</li>
            <li> Very good deodorant!!! Enough said!!</li>
            <li> The classic high endurance scent that I love. It is much more subtle than the regular old spice and doesn&#x27;t burn the pits,</li>
            <li> I have been using this Old Spice Original Scent stick deodorant decades now! This scent has an alluringly timeless appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this stick deodorant (without antiperspirant) works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Some people react to the chemical Propylene Glycol commonly found in stick deodorants.  If you do, then I recommend trying [[ASIN:B000Q406PY Nature&#x27;s Gate Deodorant Stick]] - it&#x27;s Propylene Glycol-Free ... it doesn&#x27;t smell like Old Spice though :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend [[ASIN:B008I2IKTA Old Spice Classic Scent Men&#x27;s Cologne]] now available as a more user-friendly  [[ASIN:B00182ERIA Cologne Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check around on Amazon for the best unit price on this classic Old Spice High Endurance Original Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review was helpful ...

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years and I regularly get compliments from women regarding how I smell.  So I guess it works.</li>
            <li> Old spice high endurance is the best non-antiperspirant out there. I can apply, ride my bicycle 7 miles to work, and still smell good when I get there.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works for a long time and is not irritating.</li>
            <li> Gave me chemical burns within a week. Never had that happen with any other deodorant. Google &amp;#34;oldspice chemical burns&amp;#34;. Have a look at the pictures</li>
            <li> Got here quick, looked all good!</li>
            <li> Mama like the smell... I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Mi favorite deodorant, good scent and is the only one taht give me good protection for all the day. Old Spice is always good.</li>
            <li> it should say its GEL i hate it</li>
            <li> I have been using Old Spice since I was young.  Great product, great price.  Keeps me smelling nicely all day.  Strong but not overwhelming scent.  Plus the ladies like Old Spice.  Always have someone say how nice I smell.  Bonus for us guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it on but it takes a bit to dry under my arms but once it does it works all day.  It is not a powder or dry at all, goes on kind of wet, so you can&#x27;t be in a hurry to put on your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and use it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li> if you have a little bit of storage space this is the best way to buy deodorant. Definitely cheaper than the stores and very convenient. I will definitely buy my next batch of deodorant from them..</li>
            <li> I like Old Spice because it works well at keeping me dry and it smells great. All in all great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping for a deodorant that smelled like old spice but lasts long. I got an itchy rash on the first usage of High Endurance Original so I decided to try the Old Spice Classic Deodorant that is green not the high endurance blue stick. Here are some things I discovered about High Endurance blue stick vs the Classic green stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high endurance blue stick has a different chemical formula. Looking on the back it has the usual propylene glycol that most all deodorant has. It also has an extra chemical of \\&quot;Dipropylene Glycol\\&quot;. Propylene glycol acts as an absorbent of liquids. Dipropylene glycol appears to act in a similar fashion as an absorbent. Double absorbents means the skin and sweat glands get really dried out causing skin irritation then potentially developing a rash. Upon reading numerous reviews the negative skin reaction sometimes is not immediate and may occur a day later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then purchased Old Spice Classic green stick that has the original formula. The green stick had the usual propylene glycol which is no surprise. The next chemical in the formula that was different was it used alcohol denat. meaning denatured alcohol. Upon researching further on this chemical it works similar to rubbing alcohol but a different chemical makeup. The green stick did not irritate my armpits. The old spice scent stayed for a lesser period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue stick of Old Spice High Endurance says \\&quot;Original\\&quot; but this could be misleading for some. Some may think the High Endurance Original is like the original that came before High Endurance. It is not the same deodorant. The scents are very different, the blue stick smells stronger while the green stick has a little more of an rubbing alcohol smell. High endurance I would only recommend to people who sweat excessively and do not have sensitive skin. The Old Spice classic green stick I would recommend for those who have more sensitive skin and perspiration is average to low. If one has a negative skin reaction to propylene glycol then I would not recommend either. The green original classic deodorant seems milder to the skin than the high endurance.. If one has a negative skin reaction to propylene glycol then I would not recommend either. The green original classic deodorant seems milder to the skin than the high endurance.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with original!</li>
            <li> Excellent I have been a fan for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 50 years, what more can I say?</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s the point of a subscription right? The products come in good condition and in a predictable manner so you don&#x27;t have to go to the store. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant on a budget and does smell good, but it gave me a red rash when using it.  I believe it to be the aluminum compound in the antiperspirant which also makes stains on shirts.  If you don&#x27;t have this issue, good for you and maybe I just have sensitive skin.  Either way, if you find this happening to you, there are many others out here and you have been warned.  I will say it&#x27;s not just old spice that uses this chemical and its in almost in every antiperspirant you&#x27;ll find at a store.  I&#x27;ve switched to straight deodorant.  A bit sweaty, but smell good!</li>
            <li> Bad Chemicals, This stuff is bad for you. I used this for a couple weeks and a rash broke out,not knowing it was related to the deodorant I kept using it. Opening a flesh wound rash that would open your skin for agonizing pain..Don&#x27;t believe my story,google Old Spice underarm rash..I bet you will never use this company again.</li>
            <li> smells great! Does the job.</li>
            <li> Great delivery all around.</li>
            <li> Great scent&lt;br /&gt;Works as described&lt;br /&gt;No pore clogging chemicals</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price delivered just as scheduled. Well done Amazon</li>
            <li> The product was delivered in timely. Yes, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> Great Deal!  And I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store.  Feel confident with an old school smell.  Get Yourself Some Of That!</li>
            <li> This is my go to deodorant and I often get compliments that I smell good or people ask what cologne I&#x27;m wearing because they like the smell.  Lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent deodorant, and finally I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other makes, Dove, Rexona, Speed Stick, and any like this. The smell is great, so fresh and lasts ALL THE DAY. trust me. Best deodorante you can find online/stores. The 4 pack is so convenient and you have to put in your armpits no so much quantity to get all the freshnes and protection. Very very recommended to all who whant to be confident with his smell all the day. No doubt FIVE STARS ***** !!!</li>
            <li> an old but tried and true product. it is good, it is reasonable. and i will continue to get for him. he said mennen was not working for him. told him my dad always used this product and was happy with it. by him--i am referring to my husband and he will tell me when to get more/ thanks. donna</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband because *I* like the scent - very musky and manly without being over-powering.  Doesn&#x27;t give up and keeps him smelling great.</li>
            <li> Great product that does exactly what it says, lasts all day long and smells as great as you would expect.</li>
            <li> If your grandpa hadn&#x27;t worn it... you wouldn&#x27;t be here</li>
            <li> I used his product for about a week and then it caused pain and burn my armpits and I don&#x27;t ever have any issues with deodorants. The armpit burn has been very painful and limited my mobility with my armpits. I am seeking legal advice.</li>
            <li> •How do you use this product? 10&lt;br /&gt;•What should other customers know when considering this product? 10&lt;br /&gt;•What aspects of this product do you like? 10&lt;br /&gt;•Was the quality of this product above or below your expectations? 10</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as you would find in the grocery/drug store, but for half the price. I was worried that once left out on my hot porch after delivery that they might be melted, but that was not the case. I love the classic scent!</li>
            <li> Smells great all day gets lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing if you get close. I give it a 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t protect 24 hours as it says, maybe 12.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for years and it is my favorite...I did notice that this new package they reduced the quantity from 3.25 oz to 3 oz.  That is unfortunate since it just waste more packaging.</li>
            <li> Great price and excellent product!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and smells good! Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find Original (not High Endurance) variety, so I bought this.  The odor is enough to smell up the house and affect your every smell and taste all day. I had to shower again and throw it away!</li>
            <li> Now in my mid-twenties, I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;Original Scent\\&quot; Old Spice since I was fifteen. At times I&#x27;ve tried Old Spice&#x27;s other scents, but this one is by far the best. Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t hurt if you sweat, doesn&#x27;t stain, and all--yes, that&#x27;s 100%--of my significant others have loved it and are bound to say at least once, \\&quot;That&#x27;s your smell\\&quot; because of its unique yet fresh fragrance. Also, I play soccer and basketball frequently, and the deodorant has a way of smelling better the more you sweat. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably never change my deodorant though, so it has my vote.</li>
