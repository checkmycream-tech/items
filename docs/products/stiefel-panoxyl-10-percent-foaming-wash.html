            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon, but I just wanted to leave a review because this product is great.</li>
            <li>Very nice and creamy, foamy.</li>
            <li>Amazing results!  </li>
            <li>I had looked up reviews upon reviews searching for a good body wash that would give me relief, after a week I could noticeably see results</li>
            <li>I have been using this face-wash cream for over a month now but the results are not that good.</li>
            <li>My skin reacts so good to it to this day, so I ordered this product specifically to use on my body in the shower.</li>
            <li>she has fair skin.</li>
            <li>A good alternative gien healthcare prescription coverage isnt what it used to be to warrant purchasing what could 100% work grom</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good reviews on Panoxyl products</li>
            <li>(For some, that alone would be a good reason to buy this product).     </li>
            <li>One good thing is that it has a good soapy consistency to wash off oils from the face.</li>
            <li>Good product works well.</li>
            <li>I have fairly severe oily skin (</li>
            <li>Stiefel&#x27;s PanOxyl has produced good acne products over the years.  </li>
            <li>The price is good.  </li>
            <li>Good price, good product.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I learned my lesson to stockpile when you find something good that works.</li>
            <li>It had a good texture that makes you think it&#x27;s going to work</li>
            <li>Excellent BP cleanser, lightly foaming, can be drying if you don&#x27;t already have fairly oily skin.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning and evening and after using it I rub a apple cider vinegar astringent on and my face looks bright and lovely!</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced itchy, watery eyes, and burning using it more then once per</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I had gotten this (not being able to find a 5% wash) and I must rave about it!</li>
            <li>i take care of the dryness using a moisturizer, but this sure works!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Coupled, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this perfect product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not so thrilled with this product and am not purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>know that, yes, it is effective.</li>
            <li>The Absolute best!!!!</li>
            <li>asides from it&#x27;s possibility of discomfort if used more then once a day, it&#x27;s a really good product to try.</li>
            <li>(which I prefer to those you just kind of smear around your face)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>and it has significantly cleared my skin!!</li>
            <li>But if you got scent free lotion you&#x27;d be good.</li>
            <li>So you can see what GSK are at - forcing everyone to spend more - nice company.</li>
            <li>The product effectively clears existing acne and prevents more from forming.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I am very, very impressed with the results so far.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that it also makes a great moisturizer (but only use at nights as it is kind of greasy!)&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>I had great results during the first week using it once a day.</li>
            <li>Since I was a teenager, I have always been breaking out and suffered many many years of face acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;If are considering this product more than twice a day, I suggest also using an oil-free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of acne solutions, I use a repairing lotion with it in the morning and night, and the combo can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I have also used the 8%, and this works better with no additional side effects.</li>
            <li>Though it dries the skin and for sure an irritation occurs sometimes</li>
            <li>This stuff is way stronger then proactive and works a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>tho :)</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments on my skin now.</li>
            <li>and I am one extremely satisfied buyer.</li>
            <li>I also use oil blotting sheets during the day to keep the oil off my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I LOVE this product and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel that I can confidently give this product a review it deserves.</li>
            <li>LOVE this STUFF....</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I find it is much more forgiving to skin.</li>
            <li>The Stiefel PanOxyl 10 percent has cleaned and cleared most of my acne irritations.</li>
            <li>I feel this product has worked better than some of the Dermatologistsâ€™ prescribe medicines.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my husband, who has struggled with acne for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If you do have colored towels, find one that you don&#x27;t mind staining and make sure the rest are out of the splash zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hoped it would work better after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I know my face will take more time</li>
            <li>I hope it keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>After months of paying more than my budget would allow I decided to turn to Amazon to find a solution.  </li>
            <li>Broke out even more.</li>
            <li>So, the PanOxyl Foaming Wash is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is stronger than Proactiv, so it can be more drying -</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The skin that actually has all the excess oils, however, is in the best shape it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
            <li>I find that it works better using a wash rag.</li>
            <li>after trying a lot more products i gave up.</li>
            <li>or so it sure seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered.</li>
            <li>I have used so many products and they either don&#x27;t work or they stop working.</li>
            <li>After getting fed up with it, I did some more research and found out about Panoxyl.</li>
            <li>If feels like your skin is so clean and healthy!</li>
            <li>The real reason I&#x27;m posting a review is I saw this listed for $31.99!!!!  </li>
            <li>It is a whole lot cheaper than the multi-phased product you see in television and magazine ads, and, according to Consumer Reports, JUST AS EFFECTIVE!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to find this product with Benzoyl Peroxide over the counter!</li>
            <li>I found this combination worked best for me to control flareups and not be pealing and not feel like my skin is dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>Works great so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Panoxyl works great for many people, but for me it was the opposite of what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I use it every other day for best results.</li>
            <li>BUT NOT LEAST MOST IMPORTANT WITH THIS PRODUCT IS, YOU MUST USE A GOOD MOISTURIZER...</li>
            <li>But if your face gets irritated easily maybe you should try something milder.</li>
            <li>) Make sure you have a clean diet and are DRINKING 3 litters of water a day.</li>
            <li>My guess is that it was too strong for me</li>
            <li>This product is incredibly strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong wash</li>
            <li>Hands down this is one of the best products to have and to use if you deal with body acne, pimple, blackheads, whitehead, cystic acne etc issues.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is that it made my whiteheads and blackheads (VERY) easy to extract.</li>
            <li>If you use this was and follow these basic steps, you skin will be beautiful and acne free.</li>
            <li>If used with a moisuturizer afterwards, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>It clears up my son&#x27;s breakout quickly and prevents more.</li>
            <li>If any of you feel like you could never do that, buy this stuff, use it twice a day consistently with a nice clean washcloth each time--and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That alone made a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great facewash.</li>
            <li>This wash is great for breakouts on the neck, back and chest.</li>
            <li>He has used the PanOxyl face bar for several years with great results.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face with it twice a day and then immediately use a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have had better success with PanOxyl than ANYTHING except Accutane--and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so happy with PanOxyl, I buy several tubes at one because I never want to be without it.  </li>
            <li>It tigthens my skin and my face feels smooth like glass.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always noticed that my skin seems to react better to Benzoyl peroxide than Salicylic acid, so I saw this with the 10% Benzoyl and looked up the reviews on here and figured it was well worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Good and does what it is supposed to but should be clear</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it too (adult acne) and it has done good things for my skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yup that&#x27;s right, 12 years of never being able to find a product that works.  </li>
            <li>stuff really truly works and me and my daughter could not be happier!!!</li>
            <li>This product keeps her skin clean and acne free without causing any sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>I be had mild problems with face acne and it wiped that out very quickly.</li>
            <li>long stick line, lol</li>
            <li>The best there is for acne (face and body acne) preventatives and maintenance that you can get over the counter without a prescription and without spending a small fortune.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because the zapzyt bar was discontinued and the panoxyl bar was unavailable on the market for some reason.  </li>
            <li>and I was really excited to see that they have a foaming wash.</li>
            <li>Great acne treatment, though it does tend to leave skin dry.</li>
            <li>Your face feels clean after every use and the pimples and blackheads are controlled.</li>
            <li>soft,gentle foam leaves my face clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Works great but does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I really liked the old 8% cream wash available until now.  </li>
            <li>Word to the wise, when using benzoyl peroxide products you need to switch to white towels or else you will inevitably bleach everything you own!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the $13 and 8 weeks to potentially be acne free for the rest of your life!!!</li>
            <li>Cleared right up!</li>
            <li>This was getting hard to find--I found it for a great price!</li>
            <li>WITHIN TWO DAYS OF USING THIS PRODUCT I BEGAN TO SEE AMAZING RESULTS LEAVING MY SKIN, CLEANER, CLEARER &amp; SOFT.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely top notch and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not really bad.</li>
            <li>Fine for once or twice daily applications and will help nicely in moderation.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild acne on my shoulders and the backs of them.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and met expectations.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten quick and noticeable results with this product.</li>
            <li>Use in combination with a benz peroxide cream of 10 % for maximum results and quick work.</li>
            <li>helps get rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li>I still have some discolored spots from where acne was but those are fading quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit drying due to the strength, but it is very effective.</li>
            <li>I have spent years (many many years) taking very good care of my skin and using benzoyl peroxide washes and topical lotions to keep my sensitive skin and cystic acne in check.  </li>
            <li>This wash is great for acne, you will see results in less than a week, I use about 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really foam!!</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived super quick and I will certainly buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li>I have hormonal acne from birth control pills and was really hoping this would help with it, but I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but i want a body wash that smells nice as well as treats my back acne</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I use it for my neck and back only (haven&#x27;t tried with my face because I don&#x27;t have acne on my face), and like some others have said, this works, brilliantly.</li>
            <li>The area gets red for a while - because I bathe with warm water I think -</li>
            <li>bottle is totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li>If you struggle with acne, this is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>10% FACE- CHEST- BODY wash is worth it.  </li>
            <li>On top of (maybe the cause of) all of that, I have VERY oily skin and living in the tropics doesn&#x27;t really</li>
            <li>I still have stubborn blackheads that are clearly under the top layer</li>
            <li>thinking i was goin to get more than 1 tube very diasppointed in this scam one of the reasons i don&#x27;t like e-bay or amazon been very diasppointed so buyer beware[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>That may make the price worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Works great to quickly clear up out breaks and helps keep them from coming back.</li>
            <li>This helps me keep clear and still do all the activities that I love like the GYM and Boxing.</li>
            <li>It truly helps the glands \\&quot;dry up\\&quot; and prevents more from becoming inflamed.</li>
            <li>was bringing him the product overseas and needed it pretty quickly, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay ~$30 for expedited shipping.  </li>
            <li>After researching over internet, it appears to be right soln.</li>
            <li>right after.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does clean your face very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this product is just ok, i will stick to the bar soaps like black soap instead since they work much better</li>
            <li>I have mild back acne and tried many solutions over and under the counter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the feeling of being super dried out after washing my face (but some may not like how drying it is)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>May cause itchyness, tightness of the skin, and general discomfort if used more then once per</li>
            <li>and I stopped right after the first use.</li>
            <li>thing is very drying, my skin is super oily and I literally can feel it taught after I use this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had mild to moderate acne breakouts and like most people I&#x27;ve tried many different products.</li>
            <li>Honestly the first week I washed my face twice a day with the wash and my skin became irritated and dry.</li>
            <li>When put on an area with acne for about 10-15 minutes twice a day, you will see very fast results.</li>
            <li>Light fingertip pressure is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;After washing, before skin dries completely, I plaster Purpose Dual Treatment moisturizer on to prevent over drying my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>whenever I start working out in higher frequencies for longer periods of time.</li>
            <li>The first time around I used it during winter.</li>
            <li>time around, I&#x27;m using it during the hot and humid summer.</li>
            <li>But this wash is better to me than any topical my doctors ever prescribed.</li>
            <li>my Dad&#x27;s a Dermatologist ;)</li>
            <li>For me, this is a success at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you try something milder first.</li>
            <li>I saw results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Now I can finally focus on scars and not have to worry about more acne forming.</li>
            <li>In the morning I use a moisturizer with sunscreen (Neutrogena oil free moisturizer for sensitive skin, spf 15) at nights</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>perhaps it would be of help buy sadly no.</li>
            <li>When i first started using this, i used it twice a day and despite my moisturizer, my skin was still pealing.</li>
            <li>I used it every day for the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was worried about the inclusion of hydrogenated castor oil in the product, but I&#x27;ve no ill effects from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more than enough</li>
            <li>However, just as indicated on the product, it may cause some dryness at first.</li>
            <li>My cheeks and chin began to peel within the first week and as a result lightened the post acne marks on my face.</li>
            <li>During my search I was able to buy my regular wash from the pharmacy at an elevated price (about $40/one month supply) since it was no longer covered by insurance.  </li>
            <li>I use H&amp;S anti-dandruff shampoo first on my hair--rinse--then follow it with panoxyl foaming wash--lather--leave on for 2 min then rinse.  </li>
            <li>: For me I had cut my hair short, so I used more styling products to keep it syled &#x3D; clogged scalp follicles &#x3D; scalp acne.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist said he had seen many cases of this problem and recommended this as daily wash.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is only ok  </li>
            <li>About a year ago my dermatologist recommend this to me because I have pretty oily skin, and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because I have tried EVERYTHING ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>SO DEFINITELY USE A SPF30 OR BETTER</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 and have been battling acne for years and have had it under control for the most part recently.</li>
            <li>A wash that I use to use which required a prescription and costed considerably more ($89.99 then, $24.99 currently on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>Nothing has worked to completely eradicate my acne problem, however, PanOxyl 10% has proven to be the most effective tool for reducing my back acne to the occasional here and there whitehead.  </li>
            <li>This product is very smooth, lathers really easily, a tiny pea size would work well for your whole face, and another pea size would go for arms and chest/shoulder areas.</li>
            <li>I would sometimes have large cysts but most of the time I would have several embarrassing blemishes on my face, jawline, and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Keeps complexion clean and clear.</li>
            <li>and this is easer on my skin then clean and clear.</li>
            <li>and initially I didn&#x27;t pay it any mind until several of her followers chimed in on how good this stuff is for acne.</li>
            <li>Without going into too much detail, those treatments worked ok but once discontinued, the flareups come back.</li>
            <li>The price is alot higher, but hopefully not for too much longer.</li>
            <li>The dryness after washing triggers your face to produce more oil which will hurt you in the long run.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would clear things up on its own for those with more serious acne, you probably need to take some oral prescription also.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use lotion, as PanOxyl does dry out the skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I am comfortable going outside without makeup.  </li>
            <li>This is combined with R A Lotion for overnight; unfortunately not carried by Amazon but available from pharmacist (no prescriptions needed) at local Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed for a few weeks, it seemed that it helped my acne slightly</li>
            <li>My facial acne is very mild now, largely thanks to this face wash.</li>
            <li>My son uses this and his face looks better than it has in a very long time!  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s more expensive and you have to use more of it, upto 3 times a day!</li>
            <li>They go away more quickly for the time being, but will return return bigger and deeper in the same location 2 to 4 weeks</li>
            <li>high percentage of medication was apparently exactly what my skin needed, because it cleared my acne within a week, no joke.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to find good products that don&#x27;t overdry or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I hope it keeps up the good work because so far it seems like a little miracle.</li>
            <li>I stopped working out as much after a while and thus didn&#x27;t need the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then, I was using it three or four times a day because I had very oily</li>
            <li>or it really dries out my face; but used 5-6 times a week it does its job.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and they really work for me.</li>
            <li>Very drying</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>This stuff works, but it is very potent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it really took a toll on my body.</li>
            <li>This one was recommended to me after I had seen my fourth derm who said that all of thr above wasnt necessary and PanOxyl would be a great product to keep flareups under control.</li>
            <li>So your goal should be to figure out how much your skin can handle (once/twice per day) and what none-pore-clogging moisturizer to use for body/face</li>
            <li>* (candy, junk, fried, sugars(even too much sugar from fruit ) soda, etc)</li>
            <li>They very graciously agreed, and I received the order in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>It works really well and was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed.  </li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s only available by prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 2-3 days my skin was clearer than ever and looked smooth with no red patches.  </li>
            <li>Over the summer I noticed my skin would burn much easier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this didnt do much for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile and it really works.  </li>
            <li>im really hoping this one will work</li>
            <li>my skin out so much that it started peeling.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and it arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>very convenient at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>My skin really cleared up fast.</li>
            <li>I put some on my hand then hold it over a bit of water (don&#x27;t use too much water) then rub on my face &amp; rinse.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S COVERING YOUR FRESH CLEAR SKIN UNDERNEATH.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced</li>
            <li>really take the acne away and also the scars</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used Panoxyl 3 times with a loofah and the results are fabulous.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always willing to try something new that would help me with my breakouts.</li>
            <li>B000052YJM Clean &amp; Clear ESSENTIALS Dual Action Moisturizer, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>2) Use clean towels and wash your pillow cases regularly 3)</li>
            <li>Thanks for previous review, Ive been looking for it everywhere good to know it will be back.</li>
            <li>If this is a little too strong for you I suggest the Clean and Clear 10% formula, it works almost as well</li>
            <li>hope to update my review in a few weeks-months with more positive results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to make for clear skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is now consistently clear, for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life since I was 12 (I&#x27;m 26) I have a clear face.</li>
            <li>Adult acne is pretty repulsive, so I gave this product a try after a lot of trial and error.</li>
            <li>So be sure to use a moisturizer, or avoid applying it on sensitive area of the face such as near the eyes and the mouth.</li>
            <li>It irritated my face for the first week since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It can be a little drying, so it&#x27;s good to note that every day use may not be possible based on your skin type.</li>
            <li>You might need a little moisturizer though since your skin feels tight (in a good way!)</li>
            <li>It did not really worked for me but it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>use it mainly in the T-zone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And for the sensitive skin on the face you may want to use a light moisturizer to prevent irritation, red skin, tightness, and itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The first week I ended up with more acne than usual but thats the cleanser working, getting everything out.</li>
            <li>He actually reminds me to get more when we run low.</li>
            <li>and I am Loyal to them even though walmart has a similar product, I choose them because I know it works.</li>
            <li>I have to say it was very unexpected!</li>
            <li>definitely worth a try, only thing to clear my skin consistently for years</li>
            <li>But butt is super smooth and no more acne.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this face wash.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who is struggling with minor-mild acne as it seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly Rec.</li>
            <li>Dry, cracked skin is a common side effect, and although there are some good non-comedogenic (oil-free) moisturizers that you can use to mitigate that, you may be better off just choosing a lower-concentration product in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has been using this every day, and so far, not too much change.</li>
            <li>I grabbed Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask, not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>This so far has worked very well.</li>
            <li>So I am glad to know that it can also be purchased here if it is not available</li>
            <li>No delicate salicylic acid foaming wash here, just industrial acne destroyer 10% benzoyl peroxide here to decimate your sebum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once again it&#x27;s clear, smooth and not blotchy or dry.  </li>
            <li>Helps with acne and new acne forming  </li>
            <li>When Proactiv stopped working a year ago I started my search for something new.</li>
            <li>I do think that this could be mixed with a gentler, moisturizing cleanser for those whose skin is more dry or sensitive.</li>
            <li>He is very sensitive to odors and skin irritation, and this seems to not bother him at all.</li>
            <li>i use it day and night and within a week, my face was almost clear!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist prescribed this and my face finally looks consistent.</li>
            <li>I am holding out hope as I have never seen a product reviewed so consistently well by people who seem to have similar acne stories.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can already see a huge change on my chest which includes less acne/breakouts and clearer skin.</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING from proactive to knock-off products of proactive, clean and clear, x-out, Murad, foreign face wash kits, antibiotics for years....</li>
            <li>so you only need to use a small bit on the tip of your finger for it to wash your entire face that creates a fair amount of foam.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband to use on his back and it really seems to work well for getting rid of the pimples and preventing new ones.</li>
            <li>I have used Benzamycin topical gel (it has 5% BP) to control the mild acne on my face probably since I was in middle school</li>
            <li>Other than that it has pretty much eliminated my acne after about two months, face went clearer after just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m left with a large tube of this panoxyl.</li>
            <li>The good news is that many other brands have products with the same active ingredient of Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, or lesser strengths if this is too harsh.</li>
            <li>Now I can look people in the face with confidence knowing I have clear skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t clear up my acne or anything, just made me itch.</li>
            <li>It helps keep her skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>when I came to see her her face was clear.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin really clear and heals breakouts well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;The acne is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>you want real results for acne, I would suggest cleaning up your diet and possibly adopting a paleo or primal way of eating.  </li>
            <li>Also, I make a natural exfoliation mix of baking soda, turmeric and cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since early September and just now having a chance to give it a review.</li>
            <li>It has never gone completely away even with a year prescription of Prascion (a wash I got from my dermatologist.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with very severe back acne since adolescence.</li>
            <li>Not a few blemishes, not a few whiteheads.</li>
            <li>This stuff started to clear up my face in 24 hours and my acne was completely gone within a week.</li>
            <li>It was only after I ordered this that I realized that benzoyl peroxide wash in the same concentration is now available on the shelf at my local discount store for a fraction of the cost I paid to order it and have it shipped.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have used a whole tube and on my second</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter has back-acne...and has suffered with it since she was 14.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and EVEN at 36 years old-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>I do see some clearing; however, my chin frequently has pimples that develop and retreat without ever popping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works well to clear up adult acne.</li>
            <li>Here lately, I hadn&#x27;t been able to find the PanOxyl in any of the drug stores</li>
            <li>I used neutrogena sensitive skin lotion and eventually my face got used to it and calmed</li>
            <li>and I dont even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the same thing and much cheaper than the prescription.</li>
            <li>Now in my early 30s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, just the occasional breakouts which really bothers me and PanOxyl</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ineffective as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and Benzoyl Peroxide</li>
            <li>&amp; I RECOMMEND USING IT AT NIGHT BECAUSE YOUR SKIN CAN &amp; WILL BECOME SENSITIVE TO THE SUN</li>
            <li>ingredients PanOxyl contains are nearly identical to that of Brevoxyl-4.  </li>
            <li>The turning over of dead skin cells from tanning or sunburn is what primarily clogs your pore causing acne.</li>
            <li>I am almost 30 and have suffered from adult acne for years.</li>
            <li>I recommend anyone with adult acne to give this a go.</li>
            <li>It will dry out your face very fast and you need the oil in your skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed within the first two days that blemishes on my cheeks and forehead started to dry out.</li>
            <li>It did dry my skin out a bit when I first started using it</li>
            <li>Upon the first couple uses my skin cleared up tremendously but several washes later I realized my skin was extremely dry and my breakouts came back.</li>
            <li>so I usually go with 30 seconds and that works just fine.</li>
            <li>My acne is mainly reduced, and I&#x27;d say acne scars are slowly starting to</li>
            <li>Finally an acne product that hurts at first but actually works!</li>
            <li>It began to dry out my sensitive skin, so I either use it with a light moisturizer or just use it every other day.</li>
            <li>is only use this as once per day, in the shower before I go to bed, after my normal Bath n Body shower gel.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a decrease in new breakouts but it&#x27;s not an automatic cure for back acne.  </li>
            <li>have very oily skin, and yet this manages to heavily dry it out if I don&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry out too much.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for a week before it began to dry my skin out too much.</li>
            <li>There is no reason to spend this much money on this product when you can buy essentially the same thing for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly pleasantly surprised, I did not have high hopes for this product, but I will be trying to find it locally before my current tube runs out.</li>
            <li>This product worked within a week and I barely break out now!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to everyone who has major acne problems.</li>
            <li>It may leave my face pretty dry after multiple washes a day, but as oily as i can get..</li>
            <li>It does seem like a strong concentration because there are a few dry patches.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice daily for about 5 weeks and my skin looks clear.</li>
            <li>One person swore that it finally helped clear up his back-acne.</li>
            <li>After a month my back was completely clear.</li>
            <li>going back to proactiv to clear up my face again..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far but only once a day.</li>
            <li>Battering adult acne for several years.</li>
            <li>Be prepared for it to bleach everything though, unless you use a white towel or old towel for just your face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Surprisingly enough, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am a 20 year old male</li>
            <li>They were barely visible anymore, but this has brought every one of those to a whitehead</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin with occasional breakouts.  </li>
            <li>but the next day when I wake up my skin is back to normal</li>
            <li>Topix, Clean and Clear, and Glytone are examples of other products with the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li>and so if you have very dry skin, I would probably limit it to once per day and try to focus mainly on the T zone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work, My face seemed a little clear</li>
            <li>I would caution you to only use it in small amounts (once a day, two if you really need it) and not put too much cream on at one time (dime size - its foaming).  </li>
            <li>I have to agree with the other reviewers-this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>I used this as a daily face wash, once in the morning and before bed at night, and it totally helped get rid of my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old African American woman with oily and sensative skin</li>
            <li>I then tried to use it only on the area of my face that was breaking out (normally my T-zone area) limited to once a day</li>
            <li>It even helped clear up some of the acne marks that I&#x27;ve had for a long time.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive and even a tiny amount of 5% Benzol Peroxide topical will make my face burn and turn red for a week.</li>
            <li>My face cleared dramatically the first few days of use.  </li>
            <li>I was in so much pain I couldnt lay down to sleep</li>
            <li>After I got through about half of the tube that was when I really started to see the results.</li>
            <li>I generally use it only in the shower or remove my shirt at the sink and use only white washcloths.</li>
            <li>and then after 30 mins to 1 hour, when the heat dissipated I can see clearly that the red parts went away and the old dark spots left by acne disappear gradually over days.</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old, of mixed race, (Chinese, black and Indian) and I have been battling acne ever since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li>or you could put it on a scrunchie in the shower and it will allow you to use it on your whole body (but you will run out a little quicker).</li>
            <li>I was trying new things every other week, products might work a week or two</li>
            <li>think is good for people who have bad acne.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a good or bad thing depending on your needs.</li>

            <li> using panoxyl 1-2 times a day depending on how I feel my skin is with the help of a vitamin mix for clearing up acne and it works great!</li>

            <li> Very impressed with this</li>
            <li> It works the best.</li>
            <li> WORKS WAY BETTER THEN PROACTIVE!!!</li>
            <li> Very good for acne, just use it in the morning and at night, used to be a pain to get cause it was prescription</li>
            <li> I decided to look it up and gave it a try, its very fairly priced</li>
            <li> Good Luck!</li>
            <li> It pays to be beautiful sometimes</li>
            <li> I started off with Panoxyl 10 and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Both work great.</li>
            <li> This product is great for keeping pimples at bay.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.</li>
            <li> (otherwise the results aren&#x27;t as great for me)</li>
            <li> My cousin a dermatologist suggested PanOxyl, and I&#x27;m happy he did.</li>
            <li> This work great on my daughters acne.  </li>
            <li> Works best in warm, humid weather.</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay $75.00 for a BP wash even if it works great.  </li>
            <li> this stuff works great  </li>
            <li> I use this product and I think it works just great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for controlling acne caused by testosterone treatments.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This product works great but remember to always use a moisturizer after because it dries up your skin and also put sunscreen on before going out in the sun.</li>
            <li> This face foaming wash works great.</li>
            <li> You will be happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon, but I just wanted to leave a review because this product is great.</li>
            <li> Very nice and creamy, foamy.</li>
            <li> Amazing results!  </li>
            <li> I had looked up reviews upon reviews searching for a good body wash that would give me relief, after a week I could noticeably see results</li>
            <li> I have been using this face-wash cream for over a month now but the results are not that good.</li>
            <li> My skin reacts so good to it to this day, so I ordered this product specifically to use on my body in the shower.</li>
            <li> she has fair skin.</li>
            <li> A good alternative gien healthcare prescription coverage isnt what it used to be to warrant purchasing what could 100% work grom</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reviews on Panoxyl products</li>
            <li> (For some, that alone would be a good reason to buy this product).     </li>
            <li> One good thing is that it has a good soapy consistency to wash off oils from the face.</li>
            <li> Good product works well.</li>
            <li> I have fairly severe oily skin (</li>
            <li> Stiefel&#x27;s PanOxyl has produced good acne products over the years.  </li>
            <li> The price is good.  </li>
            <li> Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I learned my lesson to stockpile when you find something good that works.</li>
            <li> It had a good texture that makes you think it&#x27;s going to work</li>
            <li> Excellent BP cleanser, lightly foaming, can be drying if you don&#x27;t already have fairly oily skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and evening and after using it I rub a apple cider vinegar astringent on and my face looks bright and lovely!</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced itchy, watery eyes, and burning using it more then once per</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this (not being able to find a 5% wash) and I must rave about it!</li>
            <li> i take care of the dryness using a moisturizer, but this sure works!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Coupled, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this perfect product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not so thrilled with this product and am not purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> know that, yes, it is effective.</li>
            <li> The Absolute best!!!!</li>
            <li> asides from it&#x27;s possibility of discomfort if used more then once a day, it&#x27;s a really good product to try.</li>
            <li> (which I prefer to those you just kind of smear around your face)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> and it has significantly cleared my skin!!</li>
            <li> But if you got scent free lotion you&#x27;d be good.</li>
            <li> So you can see what GSK are at - forcing everyone to spend more - nice company.</li>
            <li> The product effectively clears existing acne and prevents more from forming.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I am very, very impressed with the results so far.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that it also makes a great moisturizer (but only use at nights as it is kind of greasy!)&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> I had great results during the first week using it once a day.</li>
            <li> Since I was a teenager, I have always been breaking out and suffered many many years of face acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;If are considering this product more than twice a day, I suggest also using an oil-free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of acne solutions, I use a repairing lotion with it in the morning and night, and the combo can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I have also used the 8%, and this works better with no additional side effects.</li>
            <li> Though it dries the skin and for sure an irritation occurs sometimes</li>
            <li> This stuff is way stronger then proactive and works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> tho :)</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments on my skin now.</li>
            <li> and I am one extremely satisfied buyer.</li>
            <li> I also use oil blotting sheets during the day to keep the oil off my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I LOVE this product and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel that I can confidently give this product a review it deserves.</li>
            <li> LOVE this STUFF....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I find it is much more forgiving to skin.</li>
            <li> The Stiefel PanOxyl 10 percent has cleaned and cleared most of my acne irritations.</li>
            <li> I feel this product has worked better than some of the Dermatologistsâ€™ prescribe medicines.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband, who has struggled with acne for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> If you do have colored towels, find one that you don&#x27;t mind staining and make sure the rest are out of the splash zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hoped it would work better after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I know my face will take more time</li>
            <li> I hope it keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> After months of paying more than my budget would allow I decided to turn to Amazon to find a solution.  </li>
            <li> Broke out even more.</li>
            <li> So, the PanOxyl Foaming Wash is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is stronger than Proactiv, so it can be more drying -</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The skin that actually has all the excess oils, however, is in the best shape it&#x27;s been in years.</li>
            <li> I find that it works better using a wash rag.</li>
            <li> after trying a lot more products i gave up.</li>
            <li> or so it sure seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> I have used so many products and they either don&#x27;t work or they stop working.</li>
            <li> After getting fed up with it, I did some more research and found out about Panoxyl.</li>
            <li> If feels like your skin is so clean and healthy!</li>
            <li> The real reason I&#x27;m posting a review is I saw this listed for $31.99!!!!  </li>
            <li> It is a whole lot cheaper than the multi-phased product you see in television and magazine ads, and, according to Consumer Reports, JUST AS EFFECTIVE!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this product with Benzoyl Peroxide over the counter!</li>
            <li> I found this combination worked best for me to control flareups and not be pealing and not feel like my skin is dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Works great so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Panoxyl works great for many people, but for me it was the opposite of what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day for best results.</li>
            <li> BUT NOT LEAST MOST IMPORTANT WITH THIS PRODUCT IS, YOU MUST USE A GOOD MOISTURIZER...</li>
            <li> But if your face gets irritated easily maybe you should try something milder.</li>
            <li> ) Make sure you have a clean diet and are DRINKING 3 litters of water a day.</li>
            <li> My guess is that it was too strong for me</li>
            <li> This product is incredibly strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong wash</li>
            <li> Hands down this is one of the best products to have and to use if you deal with body acne, pimple, blackheads, whitehead, cystic acne etc issues.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about it is that it made my whiteheads and blackheads (VERY) easy to extract.</li>
            <li> If you use this was and follow these basic steps, you skin will be beautiful and acne free.</li>
            <li> If used with a moisuturizer afterwards, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> It clears up my son&#x27;s breakout quickly and prevents more.</li>
            <li> If any of you feel like you could never do that, buy this stuff, use it twice a day consistently with a nice clean washcloth each time--and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That alone made a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great facewash.</li>
            <li> This wash is great for breakouts on the neck, back and chest.</li>
            <li> He has used the PanOxyl face bar for several years with great results.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face with it twice a day and then immediately use a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have had better success with PanOxyl than ANYTHING except Accutane--and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so happy with PanOxyl, I buy several tubes at one because I never want to be without it.  </li>
            <li> It tigthens my skin and my face feels smooth like glass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always noticed that my skin seems to react better to Benzoyl peroxide than Salicylic acid, so I saw this with the 10% Benzoyl and looked up the reviews on here and figured it was well worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Good and does what it is supposed to but should be clear</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it too (adult acne) and it has done good things for my skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yup that&#x27;s right, 12 years of never being able to find a product that works.  </li>
            <li> stuff really truly works and me and my daughter could not be happier!!!</li>
            <li> This product keeps her skin clean and acne free without causing any sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> I be had mild problems with face acne and it wiped that out very quickly.</li>
            <li> long stick line, lol</li>
            <li> The best there is for acne (face and body acne) preventatives and maintenance that you can get over the counter without a prescription and without spending a small fortune.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because the zapzyt bar was discontinued and the panoxyl bar was unavailable on the market for some reason.  </li>
            <li> and I was really excited to see that they have a foaming wash.</li>
            <li> Great acne treatment, though it does tend to leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> Your face feels clean after every use and the pimples and blackheads are controlled.</li>
            <li> soft,gentle foam leaves my face clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Works great but does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I really liked the old 8% cream wash available until now.  </li>
            <li> Word to the wise, when using benzoyl peroxide products you need to switch to white towels or else you will inevitably bleach everything you own!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the $13 and 8 weeks to potentially be acne free for the rest of your life!!!</li>
            <li> Cleared right up!</li>
            <li> This was getting hard to find--I found it for a great price!</li>
            <li> WITHIN TWO DAYS OF USING THIS PRODUCT I BEGAN TO SEE AMAZING RESULTS LEAVING MY SKIN, CLEANER, CLEARER &amp; SOFT.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely top notch and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really bad.</li>
            <li> Fine for once or twice daily applications and will help nicely in moderation.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild acne on my shoulders and the backs of them.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and met expectations.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten quick and noticeable results with this product.</li>
            <li> Use in combination with a benz peroxide cream of 10 % for maximum results and quick work.</li>
            <li> helps get rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li> I still have some discolored spots from where acne was but those are fading quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit drying due to the strength, but it is very effective.</li>
            <li> I have spent years (many many years) taking very good care of my skin and using benzoyl peroxide washes and topical lotions to keep my sensitive skin and cystic acne in check.  </li>
            <li> This wash is great for acne, you will see results in less than a week, I use about 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really foam!!</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived super quick and I will certainly buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne from birth control pills and was really hoping this would help with it, but I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but i want a body wash that smells nice as well as treats my back acne</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I use it for my neck and back only (haven&#x27;t tried with my face because I don&#x27;t have acne on my face), and like some others have said, this works, brilliantly.</li>
            <li> The area gets red for a while - because I bathe with warm water I think -</li>
            <li> bottle is totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li> If you struggle with acne, this is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> 10% FACE- CHEST- BODY wash is worth it.  </li>
            <li> On top of (maybe the cause of) all of that, I have VERY oily skin and living in the tropics doesn&#x27;t really</li>
            <li> I still have stubborn blackheads that are clearly under the top layer</li>
            <li> thinking i was goin to get more than 1 tube very diasppointed in this scam one of the reasons i don&#x27;t like e-bay or amazon been very diasppointed so buyer beware[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> That may make the price worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works great to quickly clear up out breaks and helps keep them from coming back.</li>
            <li> This helps me keep clear and still do all the activities that I love like the GYM and Boxing.</li>
            <li> It truly helps the glands \\&quot;dry up\\&quot; and prevents more from becoming inflamed.</li>
            <li> was bringing him the product overseas and needed it pretty quickly, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay ~$30 for expedited shipping.  </li>
            <li> After researching over internet, it appears to be right soln.</li>
            <li> right after.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does clean your face very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this product is just ok, i will stick to the bar soaps like black soap instead since they work much better</li>
            <li> I have mild back acne and tried many solutions over and under the counter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the feeling of being super dried out after washing my face (but some may not like how drying it is)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> May cause itchyness, tightness of the skin, and general discomfort if used more then once per</li>
            <li> and I stopped right after the first use.</li>
            <li> thing is very drying, my skin is super oily and I literally can feel it taught after I use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had mild to moderate acne breakouts and like most people I&#x27;ve tried many different products.</li>
            <li> Honestly the first week I washed my face twice a day with the wash and my skin became irritated and dry.</li>
            <li> When put on an area with acne for about 10-15 minutes twice a day, you will see very fast results.</li>
            <li> Light fingertip pressure is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;After washing, before skin dries completely, I plaster Purpose Dual Treatment moisturizer on to prevent over drying my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> whenever I start working out in higher frequencies for longer periods of time.</li>
            <li> The first time around I used it during winter.</li>
            <li> time around, I&#x27;m using it during the hot and humid summer.</li>
            <li> But this wash is better to me than any topical my doctors ever prescribed.</li>
            <li> my Dad&#x27;s a Dermatologist ;)</li>
            <li> For me, this is a success at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you try something milder first.</li>
            <li> I saw results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Now I can finally focus on scars and not have to worry about more acne forming.</li>
            <li> In the morning I use a moisturizer with sunscreen (Neutrogena oil free moisturizer for sensitive skin, spf 15) at nights</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> perhaps it would be of help buy sadly no.</li>
            <li> When i first started using this, i used it twice a day and despite my moisturizer, my skin was still pealing.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was worried about the inclusion of hydrogenated castor oil in the product, but I&#x27;ve no ill effects from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more than enough</li>
            <li> However, just as indicated on the product, it may cause some dryness at first.</li>
            <li> My cheeks and chin began to peel within the first week and as a result lightened the post acne marks on my face.</li>
            <li> During my search I was able to buy my regular wash from the pharmacy at an elevated price (about $40/one month supply) since it was no longer covered by insurance.  </li>
            <li> I use H&amp;S anti-dandruff shampoo first on my hair--rinse--then follow it with panoxyl foaming wash--lather--leave on for 2 min then rinse.  </li>
            <li> : For me I had cut my hair short, so I used more styling products to keep it syled &#x3D; clogged scalp follicles &#x3D; scalp acne.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said he had seen many cases of this problem and recommended this as daily wash.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is only ok  </li>
            <li> About a year ago my dermatologist recommend this to me because I have pretty oily skin, and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because I have tried EVERYTHING ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> SO DEFINITELY USE A SPF30 OR BETTER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and have been battling acne for years and have had it under control for the most part recently.</li>
            <li> A wash that I use to use which required a prescription and costed considerably more ($89.99 then, $24.99 currently on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> Nothing has worked to completely eradicate my acne problem, however, PanOxyl 10% has proven to be the most effective tool for reducing my back acne to the occasional here and there whitehead.  </li>
            <li> This product is very smooth, lathers really easily, a tiny pea size would work well for your whole face, and another pea size would go for arms and chest/shoulder areas.</li>
            <li> I would sometimes have large cysts but most of the time I would have several embarrassing blemishes on my face, jawline, and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Keeps complexion clean and clear.</li>
            <li> and this is easer on my skin then clean and clear.</li>
            <li> and initially I didn&#x27;t pay it any mind until several of her followers chimed in on how good this stuff is for acne.</li>
            <li> Without going into too much detail, those treatments worked ok but once discontinued, the flareups come back.</li>
            <li> The price is alot higher, but hopefully not for too much longer.</li>
            <li> The dryness after washing triggers your face to produce more oil which will hurt you in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would clear things up on its own for those with more serious acne, you probably need to take some oral prescription also.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use lotion, as PanOxyl does dry out the skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I am comfortable going outside without makeup.  </li>
            <li> This is combined with R A Lotion for overnight; unfortunately not carried by Amazon but available from pharmacist (no prescriptions needed) at local Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed for a few weeks, it seemed that it helped my acne slightly</li>
            <li> My facial acne is very mild now, largely thanks to this face wash.</li>
            <li> My son uses this and his face looks better than it has in a very long time!  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s more expensive and you have to use more of it, upto 3 times a day!</li>
            <li> They go away more quickly for the time being, but will return return bigger and deeper in the same location 2 to 4 weeks</li>
            <li> high percentage of medication was apparently exactly what my skin needed, because it cleared my acne within a week, no joke.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find good products that don&#x27;t overdry or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I hope it keeps up the good work because so far it seems like a little miracle.</li>
            <li> I stopped working out as much after a while and thus didn&#x27;t need the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then, I was using it three or four times a day because I had very oily</li>
            <li> or it really dries out my face; but used 5-6 times a week it does its job.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and they really work for me.</li>
            <li> Very drying</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but it is very potent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it really took a toll on my body.</li>
            <li> This one was recommended to me after I had seen my fourth derm who said that all of thr above wasnt necessary and PanOxyl would be a great product to keep flareups under control.</li>
            <li> So your goal should be to figure out how much your skin can handle (once/twice per day) and what none-pore-clogging moisturizer to use for body/face</li>
            <li> * (candy, junk, fried, sugars(even too much sugar from fruit ) soda, etc)</li>
            <li> They very graciously agreed, and I received the order in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> It works really well and was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed.  </li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s only available by prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 2-3 days my skin was clearer than ever and looked smooth with no red patches.  </li>
            <li> Over the summer I noticed my skin would burn much easier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this didnt do much for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile and it really works.  </li>
            <li> im really hoping this one will work</li>
            <li> my skin out so much that it started peeling.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and it arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> very convenient at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> My skin really cleared up fast.</li>
            <li> I put some on my hand then hold it over a bit of water (don&#x27;t use too much water) then rub on my face &amp; rinse.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S COVERING YOUR FRESH CLEAR SKIN UNDERNEATH.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced</li>
            <li> really take the acne away and also the scars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used Panoxyl 3 times with a loofah and the results are fabulous.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always willing to try something new that would help me with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> B000052YJM Clean &amp; Clear ESSENTIALS Dual Action Moisturizer, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> 2) Use clean towels and wash your pillow cases regularly 3)</li>
            <li> Thanks for previous review, Ive been looking for it everywhere good to know it will be back.</li>
            <li> If this is a little too strong for you I suggest the Clean and Clear 10% formula, it works almost as well</li>
            <li> hope to update my review in a few weeks-months with more positive results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to make for clear skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is now consistently clear, for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life since I was 12 (I&#x27;m 26) I have a clear face.</li>
            <li> Adult acne is pretty repulsive, so I gave this product a try after a lot of trial and error.</li>
            <li> So be sure to use a moisturizer, or avoid applying it on sensitive area of the face such as near the eyes and the mouth.</li>
            <li> It irritated my face for the first week since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying, so it&#x27;s good to note that every day use may not be possible based on your skin type.</li>
            <li> You might need a little moisturizer though since your skin feels tight (in a good way!)</li>
            <li> It did not really worked for me but it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> use it mainly in the T-zone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for the sensitive skin on the face you may want to use a light moisturizer to prevent irritation, red skin, tightness, and itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The first week I ended up with more acne than usual but thats the cleanser working, getting everything out.</li>
            <li> He actually reminds me to get more when we run low.</li>
            <li> and I am Loyal to them even though walmart has a similar product, I choose them because I know it works.</li>
            <li> I have to say it was very unexpected!</li>
            <li> definitely worth a try, only thing to clear my skin consistently for years</li>
            <li> But butt is super smooth and no more acne.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this face wash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who is struggling with minor-mild acne as it seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly Rec.</li>
            <li> Dry, cracked skin is a common side effect, and although there are some good non-comedogenic (oil-free) moisturizers that you can use to mitigate that, you may be better off just choosing a lower-concentration product in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has been using this every day, and so far, not too much change.</li>
            <li> I grabbed Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask, not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> This so far has worked very well.</li>
            <li> So I am glad to know that it can also be purchased here if it is not available</li>
            <li> No delicate salicylic acid foaming wash here, just industrial acne destroyer 10% benzoyl peroxide here to decimate your sebum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once again it&#x27;s clear, smooth and not blotchy or dry.  </li>
            <li> Helps with acne and new acne forming  </li>
            <li> When Proactiv stopped working a year ago I started my search for something new.</li>
            <li> I do think that this could be mixed with a gentler, moisturizing cleanser for those whose skin is more dry or sensitive.</li>
            <li> He is very sensitive to odors and skin irritation, and this seems to not bother him at all.</li>
            <li> i use it day and night and within a week, my face was almost clear!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed this and my face finally looks consistent.</li>
            <li> I am holding out hope as I have never seen a product reviewed so consistently well by people who seem to have similar acne stories.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can already see a huge change on my chest which includes less acne/breakouts and clearer skin.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING from proactive to knock-off products of proactive, clean and clear, x-out, Murad, foreign face wash kits, antibiotics for years....</li>
            <li> so you only need to use a small bit on the tip of your finger for it to wash your entire face that creates a fair amount of foam.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to use on his back and it really seems to work well for getting rid of the pimples and preventing new ones.</li>
            <li> I have used Benzamycin topical gel (it has 5% BP) to control the mild acne on my face probably since I was in middle school</li>
            <li> Other than that it has pretty much eliminated my acne after about two months, face went clearer after just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m left with a large tube of this panoxyl.</li>
            <li> The good news is that many other brands have products with the same active ingredient of Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, or lesser strengths if this is too harsh.</li>
            <li> Now I can look people in the face with confidence knowing I have clear skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clear up my acne or anything, just made me itch.</li>
            <li> It helps keep her skin clear.  </li>
            <li> Helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> when I came to see her her face was clear.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin really clear and heals breakouts well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;The acne is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> you want real results for acne, I would suggest cleaning up your diet and possibly adopting a paleo or primal way of eating.  </li>
            <li> Also, I make a natural exfoliation mix of baking soda, turmeric and cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since early September and just now having a chance to give it a review.</li>
            <li> It has never gone completely away even with a year prescription of Prascion (a wash I got from my dermatologist.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with very severe back acne since adolescence.</li>
            <li> Not a few blemishes, not a few whiteheads.</li>
            <li> This stuff started to clear up my face in 24 hours and my acne was completely gone within a week.</li>
            <li> It was only after I ordered this that I realized that benzoyl peroxide wash in the same concentration is now available on the shelf at my local discount store for a fraction of the cost I paid to order it and have it shipped.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have used a whole tube and on my second</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter has back-acne...and has suffered with it since she was 14.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and EVEN at 36 years old-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> I do see some clearing; however, my chin frequently has pimples that develop and retreat without ever popping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works well to clear up adult acne.</li>
            <li> Here lately, I hadn&#x27;t been able to find the PanOxyl in any of the drug stores</li>
            <li> I used neutrogena sensitive skin lotion and eventually my face got used to it and calmed</li>
            <li> and I dont even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the same thing and much cheaper than the prescription.</li>
            <li> Now in my early 30s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, just the occasional breakouts which really bothers me and PanOxyl</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ineffective as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and Benzoyl Peroxide</li>
            <li> &amp; I RECOMMEND USING IT AT NIGHT BECAUSE YOUR SKIN CAN &amp; WILL BECOME SENSITIVE TO THE SUN</li>
            <li> ingredients PanOxyl contains are nearly identical to that of Brevoxyl-4.  </li>
            <li> The turning over of dead skin cells from tanning or sunburn is what primarily clogs your pore causing acne.</li>
            <li> I am almost 30 and have suffered from adult acne for years.</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone with adult acne to give this a go.</li>
            <li> It will dry out your face very fast and you need the oil in your skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed within the first two days that blemishes on my cheeks and forehead started to dry out.</li>
            <li> It did dry my skin out a bit when I first started using it</li>
            <li> Upon the first couple uses my skin cleared up tremendously but several washes later I realized my skin was extremely dry and my breakouts came back.</li>
            <li> so I usually go with 30 seconds and that works just fine.</li>
            <li> My acne is mainly reduced, and I&#x27;d say acne scars are slowly starting to</li>
            <li> Finally an acne product that hurts at first but actually works!</li>
            <li> It began to dry out my sensitive skin, so I either use it with a light moisturizer or just use it every other day.</li>
            <li> is only use this as once per day, in the shower before I go to bed, after my normal Bath n Body shower gel.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a decrease in new breakouts but it&#x27;s not an automatic cure for back acne.  </li>
            <li> have very oily skin, and yet this manages to heavily dry it out if I don&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry out too much.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for a week before it began to dry my skin out too much.</li>
            <li> There is no reason to spend this much money on this product when you can buy essentially the same thing for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly pleasantly surprised, I did not have high hopes for this product, but I will be trying to find it locally before my current tube runs out.</li>
            <li> This product worked within a week and I barely break out now!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to everyone who has major acne problems.</li>
            <li> It may leave my face pretty dry after multiple washes a day, but as oily as i can get..</li>
            <li> It does seem like a strong concentration because there are a few dry patches.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice daily for about 5 weeks and my skin looks clear.</li>
            <li> One person swore that it finally helped clear up his back-acne.</li>
            <li> After a month my back was completely clear.</li>
            <li> going back to proactiv to clear up my face again..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far but only once a day.</li>
            <li> Battering adult acne for several years.</li>
            <li> Be prepared for it to bleach everything though, unless you use a white towel or old towel for just your face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Surprisingly enough, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old male</li>
            <li> They were barely visible anymore, but this has brought every one of those to a whitehead</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin with occasional breakouts.  </li>
            <li> but the next day when I wake up my skin is back to normal</li>
            <li> Topix, Clean and Clear, and Glytone are examples of other products with the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> and so if you have very dry skin, I would probably limit it to once per day and try to focus mainly on the T zone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work, My face seemed a little clear</li>
            <li> I would caution you to only use it in small amounts (once a day, two if you really need it) and not put too much cream on at one time (dime size - its foaming).  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers-this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> I used this as a daily face wash, once in the morning and before bed at night, and it totally helped get rid of my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old African American woman with oily and sensative skin</li>
            <li> I then tried to use it only on the area of my face that was breaking out (normally my T-zone area) limited to once a day</li>
            <li> It even helped clear up some of the acne marks that I&#x27;ve had for a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and even a tiny amount of 5% Benzol Peroxide topical will make my face burn and turn red for a week.</li>
            <li> My face cleared dramatically the first few days of use.  </li>
            <li> I was in so much pain I couldnt lay down to sleep</li>
            <li> After I got through about half of the tube that was when I really started to see the results.</li>
            <li> I generally use it only in the shower or remove my shirt at the sink and use only white washcloths.</li>
            <li> and then after 30 mins to 1 hour, when the heat dissipated I can see clearly that the red parts went away and the old dark spots left by acne disappear gradually over days.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old, of mixed race, (Chinese, black and Indian) and I have been battling acne ever since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li> or you could put it on a scrunchie in the shower and it will allow you to use it on your whole body (but you will run out a little quicker).</li>
            <li> I was trying new things every other week, products might work a week or two</li>
            <li> think is good for people who have bad acne.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a good or bad thing depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit more expensive than other acne body washes but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> , I am at the hairdresser today, and over heard a very odd ointment for this very problem....desitin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or your skin isn&#x27;t extremely oily, I suggest you consider the PanOxyl 4% instead of the 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful--it will bleach your towels/pillow cases.</li>
            <li> The price was a little high</li>
            <li> the change is obvious-just 1 or 2 small zits that only come during ovulation or menstruation, which is a real improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few decent results that lasted for a month or so</li>
            <li> Four weeks later, having cut down my usage to once every three days, I am completely clear.</li>
            <li> The black heads on my foreheaad and chin are almost completely gone now!</li>
            <li> This does not mean heavy pressure.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few that has missed the cut (so far!!?).</li>
            <li> but that did not last long.</li>
            <li> I am in my 20&#x27;s and have dealt with moderate to severe acne for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Thus far after 2 weeks of using it every other day because my skin started to become dry, my blackheads were at a minimum.</li>
            <li> If you have extreme acne, this is a good product, if its not too bad</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a long time</li>
            <li> Not too harsh and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have learned over the past few months to not use more than a small amount during my washes.  </li>
            <li> I have used PanOxyl for a long time now</li>
            <li> So one bottle should go a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;7.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed especially since the reviews said</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely clearer, smoother, and less red.</li>
            <li> However, in one short week (less than that) it gave me my skin back.  </li>
            <li> Use it daily, but be careful, if your skin isn&#x27;t use to it, it WILL dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I realized that certain foods like dairy, beans and low-quality packaged stuff all have serious effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and honestly I&#x27;ve spent so much money on my face with creams, washes, acne cream that I didn&#x27;t want to go about buying another high price expensive face wash that wouldn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little bit with water gently massaged over the face helps keep dead skin cells from clogging pores.  </li>
            <li> It not only has Benzoyl Peroxide but also Glycolic acid... and other ingredients that work to help the skin get</li>
            <li> She says it tingles when you apply it to your back and face and that it foams up (unlike other products she&#x27;s used).</li>
            <li> There are some other obvious factors.  </li>
            <li> I used it every other day and on the second week I noticed I didn&#x27;t break out in my scalp anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have oily face and this seems to dry my face up..</li>
            <li> It eradicated all of my forehead acne but gave me extremely dry skin around my mouth to the point that it was all peeling off.</li>
            <li> I can already tell it&#x27;s getting rid of someone of my forehead acne but the dry skin around my mouth is still persisting.</li>
            <li> Dry skin &#x3D;</li>
            <li> But I also had a problem with oilyness and LOTS of dry peeling</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will dry your skin so, use a moisturizer as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really dry up your skin either.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> pat dry...</li>
            <li> cause it can be a bit on the dry side...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using this on dry skin, yikes.</li>
            <li> But the skill alreadys became a bit dry...</li>
            <li> Be warned this stuff will dry your face out, it will burn some times and it won&#x27;t be an over night fix.</li>
            <li> It may dry your skin out a bit in the beginning, but just reduce the amount that you use (dilute it).</li>
            <li> Did not work for me and it didn&#x27;t even dry my skin one bit.</li>
            <li> This product can dry you out.  </li>
            <li> I use this in breakout areas everyother day because it will dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my oily skin out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists, been prescribed drugs, creams and body washes, all with various degrees of success, and all of them expensive.</li>
            <li> Anyways this has the same active ingredient of 10% Benzoyl peroxide and works just as well for me.  </li>
            <li> I still had a few of the deeper, bigger ones but they aren&#x27;t sore, aren&#x27;t red, and shrinking.</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne breakouts frequently, have for the past 10+ yrs,  </li>
            <li> He has to use it with each shower, but if he does it knocks the acne down to a low, tolerable level.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it was cheap, and i think mine might have been old?</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this product,my face has improved,less white head acnes and less oily face.</li>
            <li> have been fighting the long winded acne battle since the dawn of time and this is one of the few products that actually DOES something.</li>
            <li> I AM A BLACK MALE</li>
            <li> I continued use and the small ones continued to pop up and go away quickly, but then I began to realize that those were the small non-colored bumps and black heads</li>
            <li> I could notice my skin clearing up, and no new breakouts have come in!</li>
            <li> the area around the mouth became very dry</li>
            <li> but I can already notice a difference of it being less oily during the day and less major breakouts.</li>
            <li> and im only seeing little change in my chest acne...</li>
            <li> Despite other peoples opinions, it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin</li>
            <li> The 10% concentration can be bad news for your skin if you apply it more than twice a day.</li>
            <li> but now its OTC and it works really, use 2x a day if you have bad acne, it really helps alot.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking disfiguring, scarring, ugly, embarrassed to wear a tank top, bleeding/weeping type stuff.</li>
            <li> 4) don&#x27;t touch your face with your dirty oil filled hands.</li>
            <li> IN MY MID 20&#x27;S &amp; MED DARK SKIN TONE, THE DARK SPOTS</li>
            <li> This totally eliminated the dead skin without scrubbing or exfoliation since I notice it has glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> I may revisit it again but for now I would say this product was too harsh on my skin and not enough for my acne.</li>
            <li> I had to switch to white towels after ruining a green towel set.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Be careful in the sun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be careful as this WILL bleach clothing and towels.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that actually use benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> Currently, my skin is looking smoother and clearer than it has in a few years.  </li>
            <li> I got sunburned three times over the last few years which triggered breakouts that wrecked my face for months afterwards.  </li>
            <li> THIS WILL DRY YOUR SKIN OUT SUPER BAD ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut down to using it only once a day and following it immediately with a thick layer of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because my face was bad before beginning the ACNE-FREE SEVER SYSTEM, but after reading the ingredients (which I later note), I decided to give it a try rather than pay considerably more for the ACNE-FREE products online ($53.00 currently on Amazon) compared to my local Meijer ($19.99).  </li>
            <li> (Panoxyl also as a gentler option that is only 4% BP that I use in the cold, dry months that also works very well.)</li>
            <li> I been to the dermatologist and spent $5000 which helped controlled my acne for less than a year, which was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about it drying your skin out</li>
            <li> Not sure if further improvement could be made.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested I use this in addition to some other acne products....</li>
            <li> And despite its drying effect, I have cut out any other products (including moisturizer) in hopes that it will allow Panoxyl to do its thing.</li>
            <li> I have used this before in the past and decided to use it again when I found my other prescription face wash had almost the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to the other stuff</li>
            <li> extremely surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I started getting really small ones which only lasted a day or two and this concerned me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you have used it a few times you may notice that your skin may become over dry, or flaking, so just gauge your skin&#x27;s response and adjust accordingly.</li>
            <li> Over the last two months it&#x27;s come back worse than it has in a while.</li>
            <li> as for the white heads i think they are getting less and less, it dried my skin so before i sleep</li>
            <li> They would still be benefiting from the active ingredient without suffering extra-dry skin.</li>
            <li> Before i started this product about a week ago i have quite a few white and black heads on my chin and forhead and a few on my cheeks and temples.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been also using it on her face and the dark spots on her forehead have just about disappeared.</li>
            <li> This item can be a bit difficult to locate at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I would also suggest that if you do clear up to take a night or two off from washing with this, as you will just cause unnecessary irritation.</li>
            <li> so I think the bottle may last me at least another couple of months.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced drying of the skin perhaps because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m down to just one or two per leg and ZERO on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked it down to once a day, at night.</li>
            <li> I got some severe rashes on my face and extreme drying!</li>
            <li> and now I use it every other day since it dried my skin out some.</li>
            <li> Then I tried proactive and that worked also for less than a year, before I started breaking out again and proactive</li>
            <li> I switched to the bar because per the reviews people seem to slightly prefer it.</li>
            <li> However, PanOxyl does offer milder variations with less of this benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let it go, don&#x27;t touch it and eventually your face will produce less oil.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin still feels tight after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it for close to 2 weeks -1 month, (once a day, everyday) and there is definitely less acne now.</li>
            <li> Took a little longer for my chest but both are beyond clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get a little (10 min)</li>
            <li> : It did for me at least Does it bleach your hair?: It didn&#x27;t bleach my thick black asian hair</li>
            <li> You need to keep the price down so people can afford it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist that had put me on a cream that was too harsh and would cause cysts if used for a prolonged period of time.</li>
            <li> I can never use any harsh products, OTC or prescription.</li>
            <li> In the beginning, it dried my skin a lot</li>
            <li> I use it religiously, everyday.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist a few years ago and was prescribed a 15% solution.  </li>
            <li> Rub it it/lather it, and let it sit on your skin a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> For example, you may not need to use it everyday, maybe just 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Everyday I want to cry because my face is brighter, clearer and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it everyday though, or it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now</li>
            <li> few side notes;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dried  </li>
            <li> I have trouble skin and this wash came at a recommendation of my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> 1x or 2x a week to remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> If this wash is too harsh on your skin dilute with water.</li>
            <li> IF PEELIING OCCURES DON&#x27;T WORRY, IT&#x27;S THE DEAD SKIN</li>
            <li> I tried their soap but it dried me out and made me break out.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using morning and night</li>
            <li> My face was not a huge issue.</li>
            <li> Within a month, 2 tops you&#x27;ll be a while new you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chest and Back :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> Literally within 8 hours of washing my face with this for the first time my acne (which was numerous and very painful and deep pimples) was less painful and red.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne or oily skin.</li>
            <li> i have horrible oily skin and most people said to use this product to help with oil, because of less alcohol or peroxide content ..</li>
            <li> the temptation is to use higher concentrations, but you could end up damaging your skin just as badly by drying it out.</li>
            <li> After another couple days the occurrence of the small bumps has begun to slow down dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I might stick with this because the bar gets kinda messy and hard to handle after awhile.</li>
            <li> Well that lasted for a while but over time some acne came bavk, nothno major but enough to be annoying and bothersome.  </li>
            <li> Even with insurance, a small bottle ran about $50.  </li>
            <li> It works unbelievably well for me.  </li>
            <li> I have since gone to washing with this once a night in a small amount and have seen results again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to apply, cream stays stiff.</li>
            <li> Just plain NYC hard water and face cloth</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve gone through a phase where the PanOxyl Soap BAR is extremely hard to find anymore, at least in suburban Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia.  </li>
            <li> The next few days I didn&#x27;t get anymore big nasty ones (as I typically would have).</li>
            <li> With how hard it is to find in stores and how the prices seems to vary month to month</li>
            <li> but I hardly get cystic acne anymore</li>
            <li> It was hard to keep on the shelves it was</li>
            <li> I use this every day in the shower and that keeps my skin clear even if I eat bad.  </li>
            <li> My skin hadn&#x27;t looked this bad since I was 13 years old.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this product, keep using it faithfully at least once a day</li>
            <li> Last Saturday I was desperate</li>
            <li> so I took it slow.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased because GSK (the manufacturer) after buying out Stiefel have decided to delete a whole range of Panoxyl products without any regard to their customer base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled acne since early puberty, I&#x27;m now 21 and sooo sick of it.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad breakouts, only small ones or clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I typically would get one or two big nasty ones every week or two, have a few small ones, and have some non-colored bumps/ blackhead.  </li>
            <li> You can get it at either WalMart (behind the counter), Ulta, Walgreens, or Target for NO MORE THAN $10.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> This price is absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> BUT: If you have sensitive, anything-near-dry, or broken skin, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Then I felt a little silly</li>
            <li> But it dries your skin so badly that it doesn&#x27;t heal properly.  </li>
            <li> Face broke out a lot but my chest and back where beyond bad.</li>
            <li> , back then it was so bad I took&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t broken it ever since (face at least).  </li>
            <li> Dry, broken out all over and texturally unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tough to get out of the tube which is why I&#x27;m docking it a star.</li>
            <li> Therefore, use of this product can make acne scars worse, including hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Panoxyl for approximately 6 weeks and my skin was ravaged.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for about two months until it dried my skin out badly.</li>
            <li> well needless to say, my face is WORSE than ever.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t  bad been using it for about two weeks, haven&#x27;t seen much improvement yet, but hasn&#x27;t gotten worst either.</li>
            <li> no.     Excellent stuff.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just wrong.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately after 1 month of using this I still have yet to see any change.</li>
            <li> I tried T/Sal that only made it worst.</li>
            <li> The worst that&#x27;ll happen is it will dry you out.</li>
            <li> (which I hated applying after getting home late, tired, and/or</li>
            <li> I hate when companies produce a product that works, and for some dumb marketing or profit-based reason, they stop producing it, leaving dedicated-to-the-product consumers in the lurch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would suggest this product to anyone who suffers from breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Now that the bar has become very difficult to find, he&#x27;s trying the foaming wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cousin who I always knew as having a bad complexion and</li>
            <li> Works of bad acne.</li>
            <li> My idea of under control may differ from yours (Mine had some extremely bad times in the 12 years I have been battling with it).  </li>
            <li> Blackheads, whiteheads, painful cysts, you name it; I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> if you know anything about Accutane, you know that comes with tons of painful side effects</li>
            <li> so it has been a painful process.</li>
            <li> Frustrated</li>
            <li> I hate benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li> I needed it, badly!</li>
            <li> I peeled so badly and it was the biggest pain, you HAVE to use moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have had bad butt acne for years!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very bad acne</li>
            <li> After using this on my worst breakout areas for about a week, I saw improvement.</li>
            <li> After having my worst break out in months I started going through reviews to troubleshoot about 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have horrible acne on my face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo disgusting and embarrasing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just started using this I have oily face and this seems to dry my face up.. And my dermatologist recommend %6-%10 benzoyle. I went with the 10% cause it&#x27;s the strongest. And if you&#x27;re suffering with acne go to a dermatologist . I did they put me on antibiotics and it&#x27;s been almost two month and no break outs..</li>
            <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;The acne is almost completely gone. Nothing but occasional tiny bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I use it mainly in the T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;It says massage it in. This does not mean heavy pressure. Light fingertip pressure is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;After washing, before skin dries completely, I plaster Purpose Dual Treatment moisturizer on to prevent over drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice daily for about 5 weeks and my skin looks clear. The cystic stuff on my chin is finally under control.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Keeps complexion clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I keep reording this product because ... it works.  Nothing else worked for me, but this product gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Since I was a teenager, I have always been breaking out and suffered many many years of face acne. I been to the dermatologist and spent $5000 which helped controlled my acne for less than a year, which was a total waste of money. Then I tried proactive and that worked also for less than a year, before I started breaking out again and proactive didn&#x27;t work anymore. So I have been searching for different products and came across PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash. I have to say it was very unexpected! This product worked within a week and I barely break out now! It even helped clear up some of the acne marks that I&#x27;ve had for a long time. It is unbelievable! I have been using it for over 2 years and still controlled my acne the best ever. It is also the cheapest compared to everything else I&#x27;ve tried. Now I can look people in the face with confidence knowing I have clear skin. Thanks to this perfect product!</li>
            <li> Hard to apply, cream stays stiff.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of forehead acne whenever I start working out in higher frequencies for longer periods of time. Adult acne is pretty repulsive, so I gave this product a try after a lot of trial and error. The first time around I used it during winter. It eradicated all of my forehead acne but gave me extremely dry skin around my mouth to the point that it was all peeling off. I stopped working out as much after a while and thus didn&#x27;t need the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around, I&#x27;m using it during the hot and humid summer. I can already tell it&#x27;s getting rid of someone of my forehead acne but the dry skin around my mouth is still persisting. I&#x27;ve cut down to using it only once a day and following it immediately with a thick layer of moisturizer. However, my skin still feels tight after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whatever. It&#x27;s totally a sacrifice I&#x27;m willing to make for clear skin.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF WORKS!!  My teenager&#x27;s backne is almost entirely gone and I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> The 10% concentration can be bad news for your skin if you apply it more than twice a day. Dry, cracked skin is a common side effect, and although there are some good non-comedogenic (oil-free) moisturizers that you can use to mitigate that, you may be better off just choosing a lower-concentration product in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you have stubborn acne the temptation is to use higher concentrations, but you could end up damaging your skin just as badly by drying it out. I used this product for about two months until it dried my skin out badly. But then, I was using it three or four times a day because I had very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If are considering this product more than twice a day, I suggest also using an oil-free moisturizer. Fine for once or twice daily applications and will help nicely in moderation.</li>
            <li> I used this as a daily face wash, once in the morning and before bed at night, and it totally helped get rid of my adult acne. Wish I had known about this stuff before.</li>
            <li> When put on an area with acne for about 10-15 minutes twice a day, you will see very fast results. However, I would recommend avoid using this stuff on your face because it&#x27;s extra strength (10% benzoyl peroxide). It will dry out your face very fast and you need the oil in your skin. Dry skin &#x3D; No no.     Excellent stuff. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of acne solutions, I use a repairing lotion with it in the morning and night, and the combo can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I have a condition called hidradenitis supprativa, which is a constant \\&quot;clogging\\&quot; of the sweat glands. My doctor recommended I wash with a 5% benzoyl peroxide wash. I had gotten this (not being able to find a 5% wash) and I must rave about it! It truly helps the glands \\&quot;dry up\\&quot; and prevents more from becoming inflamed. The shipment arrived super quick and I will certainly buy from this seller again! 5 stars all the way around!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve messed around with different anti-acne products and benzoyl peroxide was my go-to product for a while.  But it dries your skin so badly that it doesn&#x27;t heal properly.  Therefore, use of this product can make acne scars worse, including hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want real results for acne, I would suggest cleaning up your diet and possibly adopting a paleo or primal way of eating.  That alone made a huge difference for me.  I realized that certain foods like dairy, beans and low-quality packaged stuff all have serious effects on my skin.  Also, I make a natural exfoliation mix of baking soda, turmeric and cinnamon.  Just a little bit with water gently massaged over the face helps keep dead skin cells from clogging pores.  Paleo + homemade exfoliant &#x3D; inexpensive triumph over acne!</li>
            <li> thinking of ordering this. but i want a body wash that smells nice as well as treats my back acne</li>
            <li> I used this product once a day for only three days. I could notice my skin clearing up, and no new breakouts have come in! I am very happy I bought this face was. I needed it, badly!</li>
            <li> This has been the only thing that works for me. With how hard it is to find in stores and how the prices seems to vary month to month it is definitely something to stock up on. I do notice that I burn a lot easier on my face in the summer and I can only leave this on for about 20 seconds or it really dries out my face; but used 5-6 times a week it does its job. I have also used the 8%, and this works better with no additional side effects.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years now, only thing that makes me feel like it&#x27;s actually working. It may leave my face pretty dry after multiple washes a day, but as oily as i can get..it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Very good for acne, just use it in the morning and at night, used to be a pain to get cause it was prescription but now its OTC and it works really, use 2x a day if you have bad acne, it really helps alot.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work, My face seemed a little clear but I still have tons of acne. :(&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it was cheap, and i think mine might have been old? because it came out in like,&lt;br /&gt;a long stick line, lol and it didn&#x27;t really foam!!</li>
            <li> I use this every day in the shower and that keeps my skin clear even if I eat bad.  It is fading my scars and also keeps away the boils or cysts I sometimes get.</li>
            <li> I use this every time that I shower! I&#x27;ve been using it since early September and just now having a chance to give it a review. I&#x27;ve been cursed with body acne, especially around my buttocks and upper back, for years. I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist that had put me on a cream that was too harsh and would cause cysts if used for a prolonged period of time. Panoxyl does wonders! I had looked up reviews upon reviews searching for a good body wash that would give me relief, after a week I could noticeably see results and I only have break outs every so often! I would recommend this to anyone, but just be weary about how often you use it, it can cause dry/sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this product,my face has improved,less white head acnes and less oily face.Though it dries the skin and for sure an irritation occurs sometimes but it&#x27;s not really bad.I would recommend it to everyone who has major acne problems.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at the drugstore and thought I&#x27;d write the review here. I can never use any harsh products, OTC or prescription. My skin is really sensitive and even a tiny amount of 5% Benzol Peroxide topical will make my face burn and turn red for a week. I don&#x27;t have bad breakouts, only small ones or clogged pores. But I also had a problem with oilyness and LOTS of dry peeling I could never get rid of. This totally eliminated the dead skin without scrubbing or exfoliation since I notice it has glycolic acid. I had great results during the first week using it once a day. It feels somewhat cooling to me when I put it on and it doesn&#x27;t burn or make my face red and irritated at all. You might need a little moisturizer though since your skin feels tight (in a good way!) as if you visited the spa and had a chem peel. I don&#x27;t think it would clear things up on its own for those with more serious acne, you probably need to take some oral prescription also. But this wash is better to me than any topical my doctors ever prescribed.</li>
            <li> My son is 17 and has some acne issues on his shoulders and back. He has been using this every day, and so far, not too much change. Kind of disappointed especially since the reviews said otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am at the hairdresser today, and over heard a very odd ointment for this very problem....desitin. Yup....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so thrilled with this product and am not purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very bad acne so I did use for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;My forehead and the area around the mouth became very dry so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it maybe once per week.It does clean your face very well.&lt;br /&gt;I think is good for people who have bad acne.But if your face gets irritated easily maybe you should try something milder.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face-wash cream for over a month now but the results are not that good. In the beginning, it dried my skin a lot but that was not the problem. It did not really worked for me but it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Best acne medications hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even try proactive, it&#x27;s just a fancy face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will dry your skin so, use a moisturizer as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be used on face, back, chest shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this regularly and see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me my Dad&#x27;s a Dermatologist ;)</li>
            <li> I use it for my neck and back only (haven&#x27;t tried with my face because I don&#x27;t have acne on my face), and like some others have said, this works, brilliantly. I have been using for about 2 weeks, twice a day, and I began to see changes starting the second week. The area gets red for a while - because I bathe with warm water I think - and then after 30 mins to 1 hour, when the heat dissipated I can see clearly that the red parts went away and the old dark spots left by acne disappear gradually over days. It makes my skin irritable for a while though, but I can stand it.  Would recommend it to anyone having back acne.</li>
            <li> Good and does what it is supposed to but should be clear it is a cream cleanser and not a foaming wash</li>
            <li> I have never tried a benzoil peroxide gel before this one. I have a lot of acne on my face, and I tried a lot of products, but they did not work. I use this one from 4 weeks now togheter with retin a and Obagi nr. 3, 4, 5. and they really work for me.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this product with Benzoyl Peroxide over the counter! I suffer from mild acne on my shoulders and the backs of them. It has never gone completely away even with a year prescription of Prascion (a wash I got from my dermatologist.) I decided not to continue with that product and chose one with BP. I have used Benzamycin topical gel (it has 5% BP) to control the mild acne on my face probably since I was in middle school and I&#x27;m 27 now. My skin reacts so good to it to this day, so I ordered this product specifically to use on my body in the shower. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far but only once a day. I have already seen improvement but my skin is kinda itchy and a tiny bit red so I may order the 8% wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff just works! I&#x27;ve been dealing with body acne for years. I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists, been prescribed drugs, creams and body washes, all with various degrees of success, and all of them expensive. After using this on my worst breakout areas for about a week, I saw improvement. After about two weeks of using this every time I shower, I&#x27;ve seen about a 90% reduction of pimples around hair follicles. I used to see between 10 and 20 pimples on each of my legs per day before using this cleanser, and a handful of pimples on my stomach area. Now I&#x27;m down to just one or two per leg and ZERO on the rest of my body. I&#x27;m honestly pleasantly surprised, I did not have high hopes for this product, but I will be trying to find it locally before my current tube runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with very severe back acne since adolescence. Not a few blemishes, not a few whiteheads. We&#x27;re talking disfiguring, scarring, ugly, embarrassed to wear a tank top, bleeding/weeping type stuff. Nothing helped. Benzoyl Peroxide 10% of any type works and this is no different. I started off with Panoxyl 10 and it worked great. Switched to Oxy when the store ran out of Panoxyl. Both work great. My skin is now consistently clear, for the first time in my life. Does not irritate my skin at all although I understand it&#x27;s a possibility. I use it religiously, everyday. My dermatologist advised that I leave it for a bit before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> I have mild back acne and tried many solutions over and under the counter.  Nothing has worked to completely eradicate my acne problem, however, PanOxyl 10% has proven to be the most effective tool for reducing my back acne to the occasional here and there whitehead.  For me, this is a success at a reasonable price.  I suggest using this stuff every shower.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a year or so now and I continue to use it because it continues to work</li>
            <li> I bought this product because proactive wasn&#x27;t working for me. This stuff started to clear up my face in 24 hours and my acne was completely gone within a week. This stuff is way stronger then proactive and works a lot better. I&#x27;m using this from now on. It doesn&#x27;t really dry up your skin either. It burns for like the minuete when your using this but other then that it doesn&#x27;t burn. I love this stuff. WORKS WAY BETTER THEN PROACTIVE!!! BUY THIS NOW!!!!![[ASIN:B0011Z3X8O PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash, Maximum Strength, 5.5 oz.]]</li>
            <li> Other than that it has pretty much eliminated my acne after about two months, face went clearer after just a couple of days. If you have extreme acne, this is a good product, if its not too bad I suggest you try something milder first. Definitely makes all the sh!t go away tho :)</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month now and it works wonderfully.  I saw results the first time I used it. I have not experienced drying of the skin perhaps because I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  I use this once a day on my face, but sometimes twice on my shoulders and back.  I don&#x27;t have acne on my face, but I quite like the feel of my skin after using it. Very shortly after I shower, I apply deep moisturizing lotion.  Coupled, the results are amazing. I went to a dermatologist a few years ago and was prescribed a 15% solution.  Even with insurance, a small bottle ran about $50.  Ridiculous.  This 5.5 oz. bottle is totally worth the price.  I order two or three at a time. If you struggle with acne, this is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awsome. I receive so many compliments on my skin now.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t  bad been using it for about two weeks, haven&#x27;t seen much improvement yet, but hasn&#x27;t gotten worst either.</li>
            <li> The best there is for acne (face and body acne) preventatives and maintenance that you can get over the counter without a prescription and without spending a small fortune.&lt;br /&gt;Try it according to it&#x27;s instructions. Rub it it/lather it, and let it sit on your skin a few minutes.  When you have used it a few times you may notice that your skin may become over dry, or flaking, so just gauge your skin&#x27;s response and adjust accordingly. For example, you may not need to use it everyday, maybe just 3 times a week. And for the sensitive skin on the face you may want to use a light moisturizer to prevent irritation, red skin, tightness, and itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;Just know that, yes, it is effective. It not only has Benzoyl Peroxide but also Glycolic acid... and other ingredients that work to help the skin get better.&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this at my local Walgreens/CVS/ RiteAid, etc or Mom &amp; Pop Pharmacy store.... The price on Amazon is about the same. So I am glad to know that it can also be purchased here if it is not available locally.&lt;br /&gt;PanOxyl 10% FACE- CHEST- BODY wash is worth it.  Hands down this is one of the best products to have and to use if you deal with body acne, pimple, blackheads, whitehead, cystic acne etc issues. (especially if you don&#x27;t have a dermatologist)</li>
            <li> Yup that&#x27;s right, 12 years of never being able to find a product that works.  However, I was told to try this product about 2 months ago. I have not have 1 pimple on my face since then. You have to follow the instructions though, which is to massage the product onto your skin for 1 to 2 minutes. That&#x27;s a long time so I usually go with 30 seconds and that works just fine. I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne or oily skin. Like I said NOT 1 PIMPLE SINCE I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT. Now I can finally focus on scars and not have to worry about more acne forming. 1/2 the battle is over.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old, of mixed race, (Chinese, black and Indian) and I have been battling acne ever since I was 12 years old. Blackheads, whiteheads, painful cysts, you name it; I&#x27;ve had it. On top of (maybe the cause of) all of that, I have VERY oily skin and living in the tropics doesn&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Pan Oxyl 10 last year and I am one extremely satisfied buyer. I use Pan Oxyl to wash my face twice a day; morning and night. In the morning I use a moisturizer with sunscreen (Neutrogena oil free moisturizer for sensitive skin, spf 15) at nights I use Ambi&#x27;s fade cream. I initially started using it for my post acne marks and I noticed that it also makes a great moisturizer (but only use at nights as it is kind of greasy!)&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that my skin has never been better. I still have stubborn blackheads that are clearly under the top layer but I plan to get a facial to take carr of those. I have the occasional inflamed blackhead but I hardly get cystic acne anymore and when I do it&#x27;s because of improper cleansing. (Sleeping in make-up etc). I also tend to get a fee bumps when I don&#x27;t use the Pan Oxyl for a fee days so that&#x27;s the only con for me.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this, I use Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep Scrub to exfoliate twice a month and the masque from the same brand twice a month too. I also use oil blotting sheets during the day to keep the oil off my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I LOVE this product and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter broke out with qcne overnight. Thus product seems to be controling it from spreadind, cleared up what she began with but she is left w acne scars which i hope fades in time bc she has fair skin. A good alternative gien healthcare prescription coverage isnt what it used to be to warrant purchasing what could 100% work grom her doctor ðŸ˜³</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for 4 months and im only seeing little change in my chest acne... im still using it though, i have hope that itll get rid of all my chest acne over time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and met expectations.  It was only after I ordered this that I realized that benzoyl peroxide wash in the same concentration is now available on the shelf at my local discount store for a fraction of the cost I paid to order it and have it shipped.  Then I felt a little silly</li>
            <li> Upon the first couple uses my skin cleared up tremendously but several washes later I realized my skin was extremely dry and my breakouts came back. I then tried to use it only on the area of my face that was breaking out (normally my T-zone area) limited to once a day but it still never cleared my face up like it did in the beginning so I stopped using it. I may revisit it again but for now I would say this product was too harsh on my skin and not enough for my acne.</li>
            <li> Battering adult acne for several years. Dermatologist recommend this cleanser and it has significantly cleared my skin!! Very drying</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because the zapzyt bar was discontinued and the panoxyl bar was unavailable on the market for some reason.  Anyways this has the same active ingredient of 10% Benzoyl peroxide and works just as well for me.  PanOxyl has started selling the bar form again but I might stick with this because the bar gets kinda messy and hard to handle after awhile.</li>
            <li> It helps big time with my itchy scratchy back. VA doctor recommended it and it works best to this day.</li>
            <li> This product is great for keeping pimples at bay. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Overall a great facewash.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reviews on Panoxyl products so when I saw it at my local drugstore, I thought I&#x27;d try it. (10% Maximum strength benzoyl peroxide foaming face wash) The only good thing about it is that it made my whiteheads and blackheads (VERY) easy to extract. (For some, that alone would be a good reason to buy this product).     BUT: If you have sensitive, anything-near-dry, or broken skin, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I got some severe rashes on my face and extreme drying! I even diluted the product with some water a couple times. I really wanted this to work so I&#x27;ve waited about two weeks for this to work, but I&#x27;m done waiting!</li>
            <li> Now that I have used a whole tube and on my second I feel that I can confidently give this product a review it deserves. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed for a few weeks, it seemed that it helped my acne slightly and I thought it was because I was only using it once a day. I read other reviews about it drying your skin out so I took it slow. After I got through about half of the tube that was when I really started to see the results. For the first time in my life since I was 12 (I&#x27;m 26) I have a clear face. Everyday I want to cry because my face is brighter, clearer and not greasy. If you buy this product, keep using it faithfully at least once a day and you will see results. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Used it for close to 2 weeks -1 month, (once a day, everyday) and there is definitely less acne now.</li>
            <li> I work in a retail pharmacy and have been using this for several months.  My coworkers and family use it as well.  It works unbelievably well for me.  As for my family and coworkers, it works well for some and so so for the others.  You would have to try it to see how well it does for you.  Be prepared for it to bleach everything though, unless you use a white towel or old towel for just your face.  The real reason I&#x27;m posting a review is I saw this listed for $31.99!!!!  That&#x27;s just wrong.  Go to your local pharmacy and ask your Tech or Pharmacist to order it for you for probably around $10-$15.</li>
            <li> i lov theproduct but thought i was getting mor the 1 product i paid almost 79.00 for 1 tube of panoxyl 10 thinking i was goin to get more than 1 tube very diasppointed in this scam one of the reasons i don&#x27;t like e-bay or amazon been very diasppointed so buyer beware[[ASIN:B0011Z3X8O Stiefel PanOxyl 10 Percent Foaming Wash]]</li>
            <li> LOVE this STUFF.... Helps with acne and new acne forming  just rub about 2 to 3 minutes then pat dry... use moisterizer cause it can be a bit on the dry side...</li>
            <li> Works great so far! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this face wash. Unfortunately after 1 month of using this I still have yet to see any change. I suffer from acne breakouts frequently, have for the past 10+ yrs,  so I&#x27;m always willing to try something new that would help me with my breakouts. I did some research and of course some of the face washes I came across were quite pricey and honestly I&#x27;ve spent so much money on my face with creams, washes, acne cream that I didn&#x27;t want to go about buying another high price expensive face wash that wouldn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought with the 10% benzoyl perhaps it would be of help buy sadly no. My face still has the blackheads &amp; still breaking out. And I&#x27;m left with a large tube of this panoxyl. One good thing is that it has a good soapy consistency to wash off oils from the face.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. It&#x27;s the only product that I&#x27;ve found that works for severe psoriasis. I cannot use it everyday though, or it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I use it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> No need for a dermatologist. The best over the counter product on the market. Love this stuff. If feels like your skin is so clean and healthy!</li>
            <li> This product extinguishes acne within 24 hours of applying. Be sure to use lotion, as PanOxyl does dry out the skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but it is very potent.&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin, and yet this manages to heavily dry it out if I don&#x27;t moisturize. I can&#x27;t imagine using this on dry skin, yikes. I wash  twice per day (otherwise the results aren&#x27;t as great for me) and so if you have very dry skin, I would probably limit it to once per day and try to focus mainly on the T zone.&lt;br /&gt;This wash works wonders and it clears out any acne I have, gets rid of any clogged pores or basically any problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly enough, I have sensitive skin but it manages to not irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been fighting the long winded acne battle since the dawn of time and this is one of the few products that actually DOES something. If this is a little too strong for you I suggest the Clean and Clear 10% formula, it works almost as well and I find it is much more forgiving to skin. But I&#x27;m shooting for the stars man, so I&#x27;ll stick with this!</li>
            <li> I was suffered from tiny pimples on my arms for over 10 years. After researching over internet, it appears to be right soln. I have applied twice daily and seen some improvement. Not sure if further improvement could be made. But the skill alreadys became a bit dry...</li>
            <li> Cleared right up! Not too harsh and I have sensitive skin. Once I run out I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> This wash is great for breakouts on the neck, back and chest. It can be a little drying, so it&#x27;s good to note that every day use may not be possible based on your skin type. It clears up my son&#x27;s breakout quickly and prevents more. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter has back-acne...and has suffered with it since she was 14. Went to a dermatologist and they prescribed  medicated acne wash (didn&#x27;t work), we tried Glytone (didn&#x27;t work), we even tried Proactive (that too didn&#x27;t work...she kept having breakouts). One night I just happened to be perusing Instagram and one of the ladies I followed posted a pic of PanOxyl...and initially I didn&#x27;t pay it any mind until several of her followers chimed in on how good this stuff is for acne. One person swore that it finally helped clear up his back-acne. I figured why not...&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it in Wal-Mart for about $8 or $9 and had my daughter use it immediatly. She says it tingles when you apply it to your back and face and that it foams up (unlike other products she&#x27;s used). She uses it everytime she takes a shower and within a 1.5 weeks...the breakouts stopped. Yesssss...FINALLY!!! She&#x27;s been also using it on her face and the dark spots on her forehead have just about disappeared. Let me add that she uses the PanOxyl in conjunction with the Noxema cleansing pads.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really truly works and me and my daughter could not be happier!!!</li>
            <li> The Absolute best!!!! Don&#x27;t wait or look elsewhere! Buy this now!!! It works on face, back and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry out too much. Maybe just a tad bit. But if you got scent free lotion you&#x27;d be good. (refuring to face use) I be had mild problems with face acne and it wiped that out very quickly. Thing that also helps is taking pantothenic acid and drinking a lot of water. Within a month, 2 tops you&#x27;ll be a while new you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chest and Back :(&lt;br /&gt;  This is where I seen the best results. I worked graveyards for over a year an it really took a toll on my body. Face broke out a lot but my chest and back where beyond bad. I was in so much pain I couldnt lay down to sleep, I couldn&#x27;t put on or take off a shirt, all without hurting. After a month my back was completely clear. Took a little longer for my chest but both are beyond clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this now you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> this product is just ok, i will stick to the bar soaps like black soap instead since they work much better</li>
            <li> The Stiefel PanOxyl 10 percent has cleaned and cleared most of my acne irritations. I feel this product has worked better than some of the Dermatologistsâ€™ prescribe medicines.</li>
            <li> This product is very smooth, lathers really easily, a tiny pea size would work well for your whole face, and another pea size would go for arms and chest/shoulder areas. I have tried using it with fingers alone or you could put it on a scrunchie in the shower and it will allow you to use it on your whole body (but you will run out a little quicker). It doesnt smell like anything and the bottle lasts me about 2-3 months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been through the ringer with acne. Since I was a teenager (now 30), I have had acne on my arms, back, shoulders and some on chest. My face was not a huge issue. I have been to the dermatologist a ton: tried antibiotics, topical antibiotics, tretinoins and of course Accutane. Without going into too much detail, those treatments worked ok but once discontinued, the flareups come back. This one was recommended to me after I had seen my fourth derm who said that all of thr above wasnt necessary and PanOxyl would be a great product to keep flareups under control. And it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is very drying, my skin is super oily and I literally can feel it taught after I use this. When i first started using this, i used it twice a day and despite my moisturizer, my skin was still pealing. Everywhere. So your goal should be to figure out how much your skin can handle (once/twice per day) and what none-pore-clogging moisturizer to use for body/face right after.&lt;br /&gt;What I do (and everyone is different) is only use this as once per day, in the shower before I go to bed, after my normal Bath n Body shower gel. I only use this on problem areas. I use clarins face lotion on my face at night and Cedaphil cream that&#x27;s in a big tub (not lotion) on my body. I found this combination worked best for me to control flareups and not be pealing and not feel like my skin is dry and itchy. I sometimes additionally apply a spot treatment gel either with salicylic acid or also benzyl peroxide and that speeds things up too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with facil acne on and off since I was 19(28 now), back then it was so bad I took&lt;br /&gt;accutane and 3 months later pow, my skin was perfect. Well that lasted for a while but over time some acne came bavk, nothno major but enough to be annoying and bothersome.  Over the last two months it&#x27;s come back worse than it has in a while. My cousin a dermatologist suggested PanOxyl, and I&#x27;m happy he did. Be warned this stuff will dry your face out, it will burn some times and it won&#x27;t be an over night fix. If your thinking of trying it, give it 8 week and be religious about it. Start of once a day and as your face adjusts over a week, then move to twice a day or even 3 as it says on the directions. I can&#x27;t imagine you won&#x27;t see results. There are some other obvious factors.  1) Make sure you have a clean diet and are DRINKING 3 litters of water a day. If you eat like s*** (candy, junk, fried, sugars(even too much sugar from fruit ) soda, etc) then acne will be inevitable. 2) Use clean towels and wash your pillow cases regularly 3) Get a little (10 min) sunlight ever day. 4) don&#x27;t touch your face with your dirty oil filled hands. If you use this was and follow these basic steps, you skin will be beautiful and acne free. Don&#x27;t think for another second it&#x27;s worth the $13 and 8 weeks to potentially be acne free for the rest of your life!!!</li>
            <li> I wish someone had told me about benzyl peroxide years ago. My dermatologist prescribed this and my face finally looks consistent. The 10% you can only use once a day, have a mild/non acne face wash for the evening.</li>
            <li> Great acne treatment, though it does tend to leave skin dry. So be sure to use a moisturizer, or avoid applying it on sensitive area of the face such as near the eyes and the mouth.</li>
            <li> Good product works well.</li>
            <li> This product done one thing and one thing only...dried my skin out. Didn&#x27;t clear up my acne or anything, just made me itch.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband, who has struggled with acne for many years.  He has used the PanOxyl face bar for several years with great results.  Now that the bar has become very difficult to find, he&#x27;s trying the foaming wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was bringing him the product overseas and needed it pretty quickly, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay ~$30 for expedited shipping.  I sent the vendor an email asking them to please expedite the processing so that it would hopefully arrive in time with standard shipping.  They very graciously agreed, and I received the order in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> All my acne cleared. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have gotten quick and noticeable results with this product. It may dry your skin out a bit in the beginning, but just reduce the amount that you use (dilute it).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit drying due to the strength, but it is very effective.</li>
            <li> I got them especially for the acne on my back. I use it with a back scrubber and its been everything I hoped for. The first week I ended up with more acne than usual but thats the cleanser working, getting everything out. I used it every day for the first 2 weeks and now I use it every other day since it dried my skin out some.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! This item can be a bit difficult to locate at a reasonable price.  It works really well and was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have ever used. It&#x27;s really tough to get out of the tube which is why I&#x27;m docking it a star.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me and it didn&#x27;t even dry my skin one bit.</li>
            <li> This work great on my daughters acne.  It helps keep her skin clear.  She has been using this for years then we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my entire life.  I&#x27;ve gone through two rounds of Accutane and I&#x27;ve taken every Rx my doctors could think of.  I have oily skin and EVEN at 36 years old- after all the treatments I&#x27;ve mentioned, I was still breaking out like a teenager around my jaw line.  I would sometimes have large cysts but most of the time I would have several embarrassing blemishes on my face, jawline, and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried PanOxyl because- why not, I&#x27;ve tried everything else.  I am absolutely amazed.  I wash my face with it twice a day and then immediately use a light moisturizer.  I have had better success with PanOxyl than ANYTHING except Accutane--and if you know anything about Accutane, you know that comes with tons of painful side effects AND it&#x27;s only available by prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with PanOxyl, I buy several tubes at one because I never want to be without it.  For the first time in my life, I am comfortable going outside without makeup.  WITHOUT MAKEUP GIRLS.  If any of you feel like you could never do that, buy this stuff, use it twice a day consistently with a nice clean washcloth each time--and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only fear now is that they&#x27;ll stop making it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had any type of skin problems try this product. Skin clears in a weeks time. Best over the counter acne medicine.</li>
            <li> Before i started this product about a week ago i have quite a few white and black heads on my chin and forhead and a few on my cheeks and temples. The black heads on my foreheaad and chin are almost completely gone now! as for the white heads i think they are getting less and less, it dried my skin so before i sleep i put on an aveeno hydrating cream. I hope for the best and expect it too. get this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and I have to say its the best face wash I&#x27;ve used so far.  I am a 20 year old male and I&#x27;ve had minor-mild breakouts since I was around 12. After countless products I grabbed this product by chance at a grocery store. After 2-3 days my skin was clearer than ever and looked smooth with no red patches.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who is struggling with minor-mild acne as it seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few side notes;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This will bleach and stain EVERYTHING.  I had to switch to white towels after ruining a green towel set.  If you do have colored towels, find one that you don&#x27;t mind staining and make sure the rest are out of the splash zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This product can dry you out.  I have learned over the past few months to not use more than a small amount during my washes.  I have oily skin (especially in the summer) and after overwashing with this product my oil product began to get out of control.  I have since gone to washing with this once a night in a small amount and have seen results again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Be careful in the sun.  Over the summer I noticed my skin would burn much easier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would suggest this product to anyone who suffers from breakouts.  I would caution you to only use it in small amounts (once a day, two if you really need it) and not put too much cream on at one time (dime size - its foaming).  I would also suggest that if you do clear up to take a night or two off from washing with this, as you will just cause unnecessary irritation.</li>
            <li> This foaming wash has been excellent for my face.  It tigthens my skin and my face feels smooth like glass.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested I use this in addition to some other acne products.... I have fairly severe oily skin (though not cysts, for some reason) and I have been using this for 10 or so days. My skin is definitely clearer, smoother, and less red. I use it once a day, in the shower. I have yet to use it as a body wash, though I have used it some on my shoulders (which break out a lot) and it seems to have helped.</li>
            <li> May cause itchyness, tightness of the skin, and general discomfort if used more then once per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced itchy, watery eyes, and burning using it more then once per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked it down to once a day, at night. My acne is mainly reduced, and I&#x27;d say acne scars are slowly starting to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about the inclusion of hydrogenated castor oil in the product, but I&#x27;ve no ill effects from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So asides from it&#x27;s possibility of discomfort if used more then once a day, it&#x27;s a really good product to try. Very nice and creamy, foamy. Try using it only once a day, and move up to twice a day if you can.</li>
            <li> Excellent BP cleanser, lightly foaming, can be drying if you don&#x27;t already have fairly oily skin. I use it every other day for best results. Works best in warm, humid weather. (Panoxyl also as a gentler option that is only 4% BP that I use in the cold, dry months that also works very well.) I do think that this could be mixed with a gentler, moisturizing cleanser for those whose skin is more dry or sensitive. They would still be benefiting from the active ingredient without suffering extra-dry skin. The same could be done with the 4% formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful as this WILL bleach clothing and towels. I generally use it only in the shower or remove my shirt at the sink and use only white washcloths.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would work better after reading the reviews.  I have hormonal acne from birth control pills and was really hoping this would help with it, but I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> When Proactiv stopped working a year ago I started my search for something new. I began using the foaming wash about 8 weeks ago. Here is the review I wrote for the Panoxyl 10% BAR.&lt;br /&gt;I started with the creamy wash about 8 weeks ago. After having my worst break out in months I started going through reviews to troubleshoot about 2 weeks ago. I switched to the bar because per the reviews people seem to slightly prefer it. And despite its drying effect, I have cut out any other products (including moisturizer) in hopes that it will allow Panoxyl to do its thing. I do see some clearing; however, my chin frequently has pimples that develop and retreat without ever popping. They were barely visible anymore, but this has brought every one of those to a whitehead so it has been a painful process. I am holding out hope as I have never seen a product reviewed so consistently well by people who seem to have similar acne stories.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to update my review in a few weeks-months with more positive results.&lt;br /&gt;If the foaming wash doesn&#x27;t work try the bar.  If the bar doesn&#x27;t work try the foaming wash. Different people seem to have different results.</li>
            <li> Dries up your skin if used often, so read instructions!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Helped clear up my skin. Excellent Product. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was getting hard to find--I found it for a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was cheaper. I would not have tried it for $38.95 as it&#x27;s selling today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well to clear up adult acne. It dries my face out some but the next day when I wake up my skin is back to normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a tiny amount twice a day and it&#x27;s more than enough so I think the bottle may last me at least another couple of months. That may make the price worth it. I think when I need it again I will look for a cheaper price online before I come back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm! The price was a little high but it did its job. It pays to be beautiful sometimes</li>
            <li> i&#x27;v used countless acne products but this seems to do the trick. neutogena worked for me at a time but then my acne built up resistance to neutrogena over time. i have used up one tube of panoxyl and the change is obvious-just 1 or 2 small zits that only come during ovulation or menstruation, which is a real improvement. i take care of the dryness using a moisturizer, but this sure works! i only hope the acne doesnt build any resistance against this product. its not sold in canada, so i have to order it to my usa adress, and then pick it up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 10 days now and immediately noticed a difference the next day. I would recommend this to anyone needing help with body acne-especially on the back. Nothing else seems to work for me. However, just as indicated on the product, it may cause some dryness at first. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had mild to moderate acne breakouts and like most people I&#x27;ve tried many different products. I&#x27;m a 29 year old African American woman with oily and sensative skin so it&#x27;s hard to find good products that don&#x27;t overdry or irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve been using PanOxyl for two weeks now and this product has transformed my skin. It has dryed out the oil causing bacteria and I don&#x27;t have one blemish on my face. Honestly the first week I washed my face twice a day with the wash and my skin became irritated and dry. I then began to use the wash once a day (as instructed on the box) and then gradually started back to twice a day. I noticed within the first two days that blemishes on my cheeks and forehead started to dry out. My cheeks and chin began to peel within the first week and as a result lightened the post acne marks on my face. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I use [[ASIN:B000052YJM Clean &amp; Clear ESSENTIALS Dual Action Moisturizer, 4 Ounce]] daily after washing.</li>
            <li> i have horrible oily skin and most people said to use this product to help with oil, because of less alcohol or peroxide content ..well needless to say, my face is WORSE than ever. this didnt do much for me and im almost done the bottle.  no thank you</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week but I can see a change already. I have horrible acne on my face, neck and chest. I can already see a huge change on my chest which includes less acne/breakouts and clearer skin. I know my face will take more time but I can already notice a difference of it being less oily during the day and less major breakouts. I hope it keeps getting better. It does seem like a strong concentration because there are a few dry patches.  Word to the wise, when using benzoyl peroxide products you need to switch to white towels or else you will inevitably bleach everything you own!</li>
            <li> PLEASE READ: This product is great(for all the reasons others have listed which I won&#x27;t repeat), however the price is way over-inflated because the manufacturer is no longer making this product. The good news is that many other brands have products with the same active ingredient of Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, or lesser strengths if this is too harsh. There is no reason to spend this much money on this product when you can buy essentially the same thing for a fraction of the cost. Topix, Clean and Clear, and Glytone are examples of other products with the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works. I hope it goes back to over counter soon! Thanks for previous review, Ive been looking for it everywhere good to know it will be back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile and it really works.  Here lately, I hadn&#x27;t been able to find the PanOxyl in any of the drug stores so, that&#x27;s why I turned to Amazon in hope that it would be here.  The price is alot higher, but hopefully not for too much longer. Your face feels clean after every use and the pimples and blackheads are controlled.</li>
            <li> im using proactiv and decided to try this one im really hoping this one will work but nahh it doesent acne starting to show up. going back to proactiv to clear up my face again..</li>
            <li> Works well. Affordable price.</li>
            <li> I have spent years (many many years) taking very good care of my skin and using benzoyl peroxide washes and topical lotions to keep my sensitive skin and cystic acne in check.  After a sudden change to my health insurance policy, benzoyl peroxide washes we no longer covered and were therefore left to my discretion as an OTC item.  During my search I was able to buy my regular wash from the pharmacy at an elevated price (about $40/one month supply) since it was no longer covered by insurance.  After months of paying more than my budget would allow I decided to turn to Amazon to find a solution.  I used Panoxyl for approximately 6 weeks and my skin was ravaged.  Dry, broken out all over and texturally unpleasant.  Truly.  My skin hadn&#x27;t looked this bad since I was 13 years old.  Last Saturday I was desperate so I went to Walgreens looking for anything else.  I grabbed Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask, not expecting much.  However, in one short week (less than that) it gave me my skin back.  I don&#x27;t know how or why, but I am so grateful.  Once again it&#x27;s clear, smooth and not blotchy or dry.  I&#x27;m sure Panoxyl works great for many people, but for me it was the opposite of what I wanted.  Proceed with caution!</li>
            <li> My son uses this and his face looks better than it has in a very long time!  He&#x27;s tried everything.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it too (adult acne) and it has done good things for my skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled acne since early puberty, I&#x27;m now 21 and sooo sick of it. I was trying new things every other week, products might work a week or two but once my family gets too used to it it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;A cousin who I always knew as having a bad complexion and when I came to see her her face was clear. When I went to use her restroom i saw this on her sink. I decided to look it up and gave it a try, its very fairly priced so I figured why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high percentage of medication was apparently exactly what my skin needed, because it cleared my acne within a week, no joke. BUT! THIS WILL DRY YOUR SKIN OUT SUPER BAD ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING! I peeled so badly and it was the biggest pain, you HAVE to use moisturizer! I used neutrogena sensitive skin lotion and eventually my face got used to it and calmed down.&lt;br /&gt;But definitely worth a try, only thing to clear my skin consistently for years</li>
            <li> I have noticed a decrease in new breakouts but it&#x27;s not an automatic cure for back acne.  Nothing is automatic so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> We finally found something that works</li>
            <li> Broke out even more. Dried  my skin out so much that it started peeling. I was itchy all over and I stopped right after the first use. My guess is that it was too strong for me and I dont even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Stiefel&#x27;s PanOxyl has produced good acne products over the years.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve gone through a phase where the PanOxyl Soap BAR is extremely hard to find anymore, at least in suburban Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia.  I hate when companies produce a product that works, and for some dumb marketing or profit-based reason, they stop producing it, leaving dedicated-to-the-product consumers in the lurch.  So, the PanOxyl Foaming Wash is the next best thing.  I hope they will consider putting the Soap Bar back on the market in volume as before.  It was hard to keep on the shelves it was so well received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, get this and use it.  It is a whole lot cheaper than the multi-phased product you see in television and magazine ads, and, according to Consumer Reports, JUST AS EFFECTIVE!</li>
            <li> Keeps pimple at bay-- I use it as a body wash and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li> I just called the company at 1-888-STIEFEL (784-3335).  They said they are having production issue and they will be shipping to stores in November.  In the meantime I am giving Topix 10% Face wash a try.  I refuse to pay $75.00 for a BP wash even if it works great.  I will wait until November and buy it from Walmart for $9.</li>
            <li> No improvement in condition</li>
            <li> I have trouble skin and this wash came at a recommendation of my dermatologist. It&#x27;s great! soft,gentle foam leaves my face clean and refreshed. The price was reasonable and it arrived promptly. Would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> I have used this before in the past and decided to use it again when I found my other prescription face wash had almost the same ingredients. Works great but does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great  love it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product anymore in my local pharmacy so I decided to check it out here.  Glad I did.  This product works well to prevent acne.  The price is good.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best face soap ever! The 10% benzoyl peroxide is what the dermatologist perscribed. This is the same thing and much cheaper than the prescription. Use it daily, but be careful, if your skin isn&#x27;t use to it, it WILL dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> burnt the eff out of my face</li>
            <li> This product is incredibly strong. I used it twice a day for a week before it began to dry my skin out too much. It had already cleared my skin by 60% by then though. Four weeks later, having cut down my usage to once every three days, I am completely clear.</li>
            <li> Reason for purchase: scalp acne Does it work?: It did for me at least Does it bleach your hair?: It didn&#x27;t bleach my thick black asian hair Does it irritate/dry your scalp?: It didn&#x27;t for me  Bought this at a nearby pharmacy b/c I was for some reason breaking out -- in my head nonetheless. Frustrated I tried T/Sal that only made it worst. Read in a forum dog shampoo with benzoyl peroxide works. Couldn&#x27;t find any at a nearby pet store. Took my chances on this and it worked!  Routine: - I use H&amp;S anti-dandruff shampoo first on my hair--rinse--then follow it with panoxyl foaming wash--lather--leave on for 2 min then rinse.  I used it every other day and on the second week I noticed I didn&#x27;t break out in my scalp anymore.  Background: Hx of teenage acne-a-la Accutane as treatment. So I how it feels...Now in my early 30s. No longer have facial acne. Treatment? I stopped using cleansers! Yes even Cetaphil. Just plain NYC hard water and face cloth 1x or 2x a week to remove dead skin. Haven&#x27;t broken it ever since (face at least).  Scalp acne cause/trigger: For me I had cut my hair short, so I used more styling products to keep it syled &#x3D; clogged scalp follicles &#x3D; scalp acne.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that actually use benzoyl peroxide.  I have an allergy to the other stuff and this is easer on my skin then clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works of bad acne.</li>
            <li> I use this product and I think it works just great but I disagree with your price of this product that your selling for $35.00 when it cost only $8.75 at walmart and $11.00 at walgreens and CVS</li>
            <li> Thus far after 2 weeks of using it every other day because my skin started to become dry, my blackheads were at a minimum. I am also noticing that my blemishes are fading. Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this in breakout areas everyother day because it will dry your skin.  If used with a moisuturizer afterwards, it&#x27;s fine.  Keeps my skin really clear and heals breakouts well.</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement the next day after using PanOxyl. It began to dry out my sensitive skin, so I either use it with a light moisturizer or just use it every other day. If you have sensitive skin or your skin isn&#x27;t extremely oily, I suggest you consider the PanOxyl 4% instead of the 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful--it will bleach your towels/pillow cases.</li>
            <li> This wash is great for acne, you will see results in less than a week, I use about 3 times a week.  Love this stuff. The generic forms of this wash do not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for years especially around the shoulder area and this is the only stuff thats made a difference.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days and my acne has cleared up dramatically.  I use an exfoliater with it and also follow up with astringent.  It&#x27;s a little bit more expensive than other acne body washes but well worth it.  Despite other peoples opinions, it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin and I&#x27;ve been using it once a day.</li>
            <li> This is stronger than Proactiv, so it can be more drying - that&#x27;s a good or bad thing depending on your needs. You can use it on your face or body. Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for controlling acne caused by testosterone treatments.  Dermatologist said he had seen many cases of this problem and recommended this as daily wash.  This is combined with R A Lotion for overnight; unfortunately not carried by Amazon but available from pharmacist (no prescriptions needed) at local Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased because GSK (the manufacturer) after buying out Stiefel have decided to delete a whole range of Panoxyl products without any regard to their customer base. This is one of the few that has missed the cut (so far!!?). The product itself is only ok  - it&#x27;s more expensive and you have to use more of it, upto 3 times a day! -Not very convenient at all.  Instead of once a day (at night) with the Aquagel. So you can see what GSK are at - forcing everyone to spend more - nice company.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dermatologist. Love it. Doesn&#x27;t dry my oily skin out.</li>
            <li> I hate benzoyl peroxide but i have to give it up for this face wash. It&#x27;s the real deal. No delicate salicylic acid foaming wash here, just industrial acne destroyer 10% benzoyl peroxide here to decimate your sebum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally got this on my nostril and it made my skin all cracky and peely. The skin that actually has all the excess oils, however, is in the best shape it&#x27;s been in years. It&#x27;s amazing. My facial acne is very mild now, largely thanks to this face wash. Ten thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use a wash rag to lather skin, not a bath loofa. I find that it works better using a wash rag. I use this product for my thighs and after 3-4 days, my legs are cured from acne/red bumps. Read the directions for best results!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers-this stuff works really well. He has to use it with each shower, but if he does it knocks the acne down to a low, tolerable level. He is very sensitive to odors and skin irritation, and this seems to not bother him at all. He actually reminds me to get more when we run low.</li>
            <li> It did dry my skin out a bit when I first started using it but that did not last long. My skin really cleared up fast. I like the feel of the cleanser. It&#x27;s not harsh. It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> i used to buy this from wally world, but they stopped selling it. after trying a lot more products i gave up. this product truly works. i use it day and night and within a week, my face was almost clear!</li>
            <li> My teen daughter loves this product.  She has sensitive skin with occasional breakouts.  This product keeps her skin clean and acne free without causing any sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> Works great to quickly clear up out breaks and helps keep them from coming back. It&#x27;s a strong wash so you only need to use a small bit on the tip of your finger for it to wash your entire face that creates a fair amount of foam. One tube can last for months in that case. Use in combination with a benz peroxide cream of 10 % for maximum results and quick work.</li>
            <li> I am in my 20&#x27;s and have dealt with moderate to severe acne for as long as I can remember. About a year ago my dermatologist recommend this to me because I have pretty oily skin, and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because I have tried EVERYTHING ON THE MARKET. EVERYTHING from proactive to knock-off products of proactive, clean and clear, x-out, Murad, foreign face wash kits, antibiotics for years.... None it it seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using panoxyl 1-2 times a day depending on how I feel my skin is with the help of a vitamin mix for clearing up acne and it works great! I&#x27;ve always loved the feeling of being super dried out after washing my face (but some may not like how drying it is)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, try it out! The worst that&#x27;ll happen is it will dry you out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for back acne and after a month or so it sure seems to be doing the trick. I approve.</li>
            <li> My package was delivered on time and in tact. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered. I located the product in the store after my order but I learned my lesson to stockpile when you find something good that works. I use this product in combonation with Netrogena Tone correcting night serum. My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the only Face Wash that works. You need to keep the price down so people can afford it!</li>
            <li> Finally an acne product that hurts at first but actually works! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now &amp; I&#x27;m seeing results. It irritated my face for the first week since I have sensitive skin but after the 7 day&#x27;s my skin got used to it. I used aveeno lotion after applying PanOxyl to moisturize. If this wash is too harsh on your skin dilute with water. I put some on my hand then hold it over a bit of water (don&#x27;t use too much water) then rub on my face &amp; rinse. Also I bought my PanOxyl wash at walmart for about $10.</li>
            <li> This product really works. I&#x27;ve used the soap version and I was really excited to see that they have a foaming wash. I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, just the occasional breakouts which really bothers me and PanOxyl helps get rid of it quickly. This product works great but remember to always use a moisturizer after because it dries up your skin and also put sunscreen on before going out in the sun.</li>
            <li> This face foaming wash works great. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of weeks and wasn&#x27;t seeing results. Acne still looked red as ever. It had a good texture that makes you think it&#x27;s going to work but it&#x27;s ineffective as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I really liked the old 8% cream wash available until now.  Would you consider bringing it back in the future?</li>
            <li> Amazing results!  This product is absolutely top notch and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used so many products and they either don&#x27;t work or they stop working. This so far has worked very well. I would recommend you use allot of moisturizer after you wash. You can never have enough moisturizer so when you do use it there is no need to be use sparingly. I have adult acne and Benzoyl Peroxide is the only thing that works for me. I am allergic to anything else. You will be happy with this product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT!!! WITHIN TWO DAYS OF USING THIS PRODUCT I BEGAN TO SEE AMAZING RESULTS LEAVING MY SKIN, CLEANER, CLEARER &amp; SOFT. I AM A BLACK MALE IN MY MID 20&#x27;S &amp; MED DARK SKIN TONE, THE DARK SPOTS ONCE ON MY FACE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ERASED IS JUST A SHORT TIME. I USE THE FACE/CHEST/BODY WASH ON MY FACE &amp; I USE THE SOAP BAR FOR MY BODY. ALL I CAN SAY IS GIVE IT A TRY, BUT DO NOT OVER USE. I WOULD SAY START WITH ONCE A DAY &amp; I RECOMMEND USING IT AT NIGHT BECAUSE YOUR SKIN CAN &amp; WILL BECOME SENSITIVE TO THE SUN SO DEFINITELY USE A SPF30 OR BETTER IF GOING OUTSIDE.. IF PEELIING OCCURES DON&#x27;T WORRY, IT&#x27;S THE DEAD SKIN THAT&#x27;S COVERING YOUR FRESH CLEAR SKIN UNDERNEATH. LAST BUT NOT LEAST MOST IMPORTANT WITH THIS PRODUCT IS, YOU MUST USE A GOOD MOISTURIZER...</li>
            <li> I have used PanOxyl for a long time now and I would NEVER pay $20 for it! You can get it at either WalMart (behind the counter), Ulta, Walgreens, or Target for NO MORE THAN $10. This price is absolutely ridiculous. Don&#x27;t get ripped off anymore.</li>
            <li> Highly Rec. for anyone with acne This helps me keep clear and still do all the activities that I love like the GYM and Boxing. I tried their soap but it dried me out and made me break out. This foaming formula was the perfect balance and I am Loyal to them even though walmart has a similar product, I choose them because I know it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and have been battling acne for years and have had it under control for the most part recently. I typically would get one or two big nasty ones every week or two, have a few small ones, and have some non-colored bumps/ blackhead.  My idea of under control may differ from yours (Mine had some extremely bad times in the 12 years I have been battling with it).  I was using ACNE-FREE SEVER  SYSTEM which initially brought my face to the under control status I just described. However, my local Meijer quit carrying my product and that is when my friend told me about this which he also began using because a friend of his wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it to her.  I was skeptical because my face was bad before beginning the ACNE-FREE SEVER SYSTEM, but after reading the ingredients (which I later note), I decided to give it a try rather than pay considerably more for the ACNE-FREE products online ($53.00 currently on Amazon) compared to my local Meijer ($19.99).  Here is my transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My face cleared dramatically the first few days of use.  I was extremely surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The next few days I didn&#x27;t get anymore big nasty ones (as I typically would have). However, I started getting really small ones which only lasted a day or two and this concerned me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I continued use and the small ones continued to pop up and go away quickly, but then I began to realize that those were the small non-colored bumps and black heads being eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. After another couple days the occurrence of the small bumps has begun to slow down dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Currently, my skin is looking smoother and clearer than it has in a few years.  I still have some discolored spots from where acne was but those are fading quickly and I&#x27;m not concerned.  Very impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The product effectively clears existing acne and prevents more from forming.&lt;br /&gt;2. This is not one of those three step time consuming systems. (which I hated applying after getting home late, tired, and/or drunk)&lt;br /&gt;3. The product is a foaming wash.  (which I prefer to those you just kind of smear around your face)&lt;br /&gt;4. Contains 10% benzoyl peroxide.  (the number one topical treatment recommend by dermatologists)&lt;br /&gt;5. Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;6. You don&#x27;t need a lot per wash. So one bottle should go a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;7. Provides ph balancing for your face. (which helps keeps your face from getting oily throughout the day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. 10% benzoyl peroxide is no joke.  If you don&#x27;t suffer from oily skin or have sever acne it will cause over drying. However, PanOxyl does offer milder variations with less of this benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting fact:&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients PanOxyl contains are nearly identical to that of Brevoxyl-4.  A wash that I use to use which required a prescription and costed considerably more ($89.99 then, $24.99 currently on Amazon).  This was also a reason for my trust in this product.  Look up the ingredients in both, they are identical.  I&#x27;m guessing their patent timed out or this product would be an infringement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hints for managing acne.  You may have heard them before but over the years I have come to realize they truly do work.  (Not related to this product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Benzoyl Peroxide is anti-microbial so if it clears your acne now.  It will continue to do so, unlike some anti-biotic medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t pop or squeeze them.  They go away more quickly for the time being, but will return return bigger and deeper in the same location 2 to 4 weeks later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you have oily skin like mine. Don&#x27;t over wash your face to remove the oil.  The dryness after washing triggers your face to produce more oil which will hurt you in the long run.  Let it go, don&#x27;t touch it and eventually your face will produce less oil.  Wash your face 2 times a day or 3 times at the max if your not sweating and getting dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Sunscreen is no joke.  I got sunburned three times over the last few years which triggered breakouts that wrecked my face for months afterwards.  The turning over of dead skin cells from tanning or sunburn is what primarily clogs your pore causing acne.</li>
            <li> it was prescribed to by my dermatologist a year ago. It works the best. really take the acne away and also the scars</li>
            <li> I have had bad butt acne for years! It&#x27;s soooo disgusting and embarrasing. Nothing I ever used helped. After getting fed up with it, I did some more research and found out about Panoxyl. I&#x27;ve only used Panoxyl 3 times with a loofah and the results are fabulous. But butt is super smooth and no more acne. I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon, but I just wanted to leave a review because this product is great. I bought this at Walmart for $9, so don&#x27;t over spend.</li>
            <li> I am almost 30 and have suffered from adult acne for years. I&#x27;ve tried everything over and under the counter including minocyline and Retin-A. I&#x27;ve had a few decent results that lasted for a month or so but then my acne always comes back with a vengeance. I&#x27;ve always noticed that my skin seems to react better to Benzoyl peroxide than Salicylic acid, so I saw this with the 10% Benzoyl and looked up the reviews on here and figured it was well worth a shot. I am very, very impressed with the results so far. Literally within 8 hours of washing my face with this for the first time my acne (which was numerous and very painful and deep pimples) was less painful and red. Literally overnight! Within a few days of using morning and night I still had a few of the deeper, bigger ones but they aren&#x27;t sore, aren&#x27;t red, and shrinking. I don&#x27;t have to use a cover up at all now, even on the pimples that are still there! All of my smaller pimples are gone, even the red spots that stay for weeks sometimes are gone! I use this every morning and evening and after using it I rub a apple cider vinegar astringent on and my face looks bright and lovely! I hope it keeps up the good work because so far it seems like a little miracle. I recommend anyone with adult acne to give this a go.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to use on his back and it really seems to work well for getting rid of the pimples and preventing new ones.</li>
