            <li>Beautiful!  </li>
            <li>as you&#x27;ve noticed, I buy alot of these....  perfect hair fashion accessory..</li>
            <li>Some glue and its perfect.</li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>Great quality... well constructed.  </li>
            <li>Good weight to it</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Like it, but keep the glue handy</li>
            <li>Made very cheap it I did not expect a lot given the price</li>
            <li>Very pretty and good quality but had to fix one of the stones with glue when I received it.</li>
            <li>and as I touched it more cane off.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love these...</li>
            <li>The top part is an alloy</li>
            <li>This hair clip is pretty and the end flowers are nice all by themselves.</li>
            <li>The price was ridiculously cheap for the quality</li>
            <li>The piece is gorgeous and professional looking.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the weight of the Barrett but the flowers are very sparkly and beautiful.</li>
            <li>This hair comb has a beautiful sparkle to it, its very sturdy and much more durable than I expected.</li>
            <li>but if you have thinner straight hair I doubt this Barrett will work for you unless you have a stylist doing an elaborate up-do.</li>
            <li>Pretty but not well made!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Would probably be ok for gals with very long hair because the teeth seem pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Photo of item looks far better than the real thing.</li>
            <li>These are just as pretty as tge picture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>This comb is sooo pretty and blingy in person.  </li>
            <li>Color is pretty.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but VERY heavy!!</li>
            <li>so these really should not be falling out.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The 2 pink flowers are huge.</li>
            <li>Pretty, but bigger than it looks and quite heavy, someone with a lot if hair would be able to manage this well.</li>
            <li>but I pull my hair back with a hair band first and use this to hide the band so with that in place it stays put all day.</li>
            <li>but I received it with two flower petals already off, I was able to hot glue gun them back on and would not have had a problem doing that if we had for at least a wk but not delivered like that</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for but in this case it&#x27;s not really even worth the $2.50 I paid.</li>
            <li>Even when I put it in facing downwards it slips out of my head moves too far in any direction other than straight up and down.</li>

            <li> One of the pink large petals has broken off in transit but nothing a little super glue couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> After a long day it will fall out sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Larger than I expected</li>
            <li> I see some others who&#x27;ve stated it took too long to arrive</li>
            <li> But then again, after a long day &amp;#34;messy bun&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t begin to describe my hair!</li>
            <li> the pink is too large..too pronounced.</li>
            <li> sparkly and pink.</li>
            <li> One of the stones fell out and the comb turned black.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing the seller has made changes as mine arrived in less than 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those who may want to add a little pizazz.</li>
            <li> they are a little heavy, and I have wimpy hair, YET IT DOESN&#x27;T STOP ME FROM USING THEM.....</li>
            <li> Bit heavy but holds well.  </li>
            <li> Does not feel firmly placed in hair or seem to hold anything.</li>
            <li> , the comb is heavy (which I like)</li>
            <li> so its not a cheap plastic thing.</li>
            <li> only bad thing was a few stones came off in shipping.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> This works for me because I have very thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> but the comb is so thin as to appear to be plastic.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they slide out of my hair.</li>

            <li> Broke before I even opened it</li>
            <li> Pretty but not well made! One of the stones fell out and the comb turned black.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret having this one in your jewelry drawer.  Bit heavy but holds well.  I LOVE IT!  also took quite a bit of time to receive - but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Okay this is not perfect for just sticking in your hair.  It will fall out!  I stick them in my buns.  All of that hair holds them almost perfectly. After a long day it will fall out sometimes.  But then again, after a long day &amp;#34;messy bun&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t begin to describe my hair!</li>
            <li> Shitty.&lt;br /&gt;The beads broke off before I even opened the envelope and as I touched it more cane off.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and good quality but had to fix one of the stones with glue when I received it.</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected</li>
            <li> Pretty, but bigger than it looks and quite heavy, someone with a lot if hair would be able to manage this well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but VERY heavy!! This works for me because I have very thick, curly hair but if you have thinner straight hair I doubt this Barrett will work for you unless you have a stylist doing an elaborate up-do. I was surprised at the weight of the Barrett but the flowers are very sparkly and beautiful.</li>
            <li> These are just as pretty as tge picture but unfortunately they slide out of my hair. I have thick curly hair so these really should not be falling out. The teeth on the claw are too slippery. Even when I put it in facing downwards it slips out of my head moves too far in any direction other than straight up and down. Does not feel firmly placed in hair or seem to hold anything. I can use these only if my hair is secured in another way and just for decoration.</li>
            <li> This item came to me is not the same item that is in the photo, the photo has comb crystals, which get me does not.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  quality product. thanks</li>
            <li> This hair comb has a beautiful sparkle to it, its very sturdy and much more durable than I expected. One of the pink large petals has broken off in transit but nothing a little super glue couldn&#x27;t handle. The price was ridiculously cheap for the quality and I&#x27;m hoping they have similar combs for a similar price!</li>
            <li> love these... they are a little heavy, and I have wimpy hair, YET IT DOESN&#x27;T STOP ME FROM USING THEM..... as you&#x27;ve noticed, I buy alot of these....  perfect hair fashion accessory..</li>
            <li> Made very cheap it I did not expect a lot given the price but I received it with two flower petals already off, I was able to hot glue gun them back on and would not have had a problem doing that if we had for at least a wk but not delivered like that</li>
            <li> It was prettier than is pictured on line! Loved it! I went back and bought the purple one and blue one!</li>
            <li> This comb is sooo pretty and blingy in person.  Great quality... well constructed.  I see some others who&#x27;ve stated it took too long to arrive but I&#x27;m guessing the seller has made changes as mine arrived in less than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the comb is heavy (which I like) but I pull my hair back with a hair band first and use this to hide the band so with that in place it stays put all day.</li>
            <li> the pink is too large..too pronounced. The 2 pink flowers are huge. Reminds me of indian attire. Would probably be ok for gals with very long hair because the teeth seem pretty strong.</li>
            <li> While I did not get a chance to use this for the purpose I wanted to, I will let you guys know the reviews I get it from others when I soon do. The piece is gorgeous and professional looking. I would recommend it to those who may want to add a little pizazz.</li>
            <li> only bad thing was a few stones came off in shipping. Some glue and its perfect. Color is pretty. sparkly and pink. Good weight to it so its not a cheap plastic thing.</li>
            <li> Like it, but keep the glue handy</li>
            <li> Photo of item looks far better than the real thing. Item is described as an alloy but that is misleading. The top part is an alloy but the comb is so thin as to appear to be plastic. When I took it out of the bag and tried to put it into my hair, one of the petals fell off. You get what you pay for but in this case it&#x27;s not really even worth the $2.50 I paid.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is pretty and the end flowers are nice all by themselves.</li>
            <li> Literally broke as I removed it from the package</li>
