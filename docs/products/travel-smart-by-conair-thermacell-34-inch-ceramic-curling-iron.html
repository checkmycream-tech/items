            <li>I&#x27;m sure that will save on the butane.</li>
            <li>Most of the thermacell irons don&#x27;t come with cover.</li>

            <li>I believe there is a 30 day return, check first???  </li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s great for travel in Europe</li>
            <li>This Conair seems to be just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>Perfect hair tool for traveling, or really anywhere &amp; anytime, personally I use it everyday!!  </li>
            <li>Because I was going on an African safari, I purchased this curling iron because I knew I would not have easy access to electricity.  </li>
            <li>Heats up pretty fast and gets hot enough to give me a nice curl, my hair is about mid length.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast - works as well as my corded iron.</li>
            <li>The whole thing takes me five/six minutes tops.  </li>
            <li>Good for on the go and for camping if you&#x27;re not a true-blue natural camper and would spend a few minutes in the morning to do your make-up and hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot enough and I&#x27;m not tied to a cord.</li>
            <li>No big deal, really.  </li>
            <li>Wish they were still selling my refills for my old one.</li>
            <li>Replaced my old Thermacell curling iron.  </li>

            <li> According to air regulations, you can only take one butane canister in checked suitcases, and I was concerned how long the butane cartridge would work.  </li>
            <li> So.... if it&#x27;s not right for you simply return it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how slow it had become in heating up until I got my new one.</li>

            <li> Would rather have one that has a combined comb, which I had a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Even after three weeks in Africa, I came home with approximately 1/3 butane still left in the canister.  </li>
            <li> I went on a small sailing cruise ship and needed a cordless curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Way to small.</li>

            <li> Purchased this to take on a trip to Europe. You can not take it in a commercial plane. It runs on Butane. You sign an agreement saying that you have no flammable liquids in your bags when you get your boarding pass at the airport. This contain a flammable liquid under pressure. But I&#x27;m keeping it to use in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Great travel  curling iron.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s great for travel in Europe and I don&#x27;t have to worry about dragging several appliances with me, and the cartridge seems to last forever</li>
            <li> Great for traveling and works better then plug in curling irons.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  Heats up quickly, and travel proof.  No problems with airline security if packed in check in luggage.</li>
            <li> Quite a remarkable machine! Now all I have to do is learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> I just received mine that I purchased to go on a trip to Switzerland.  I booked a flight on Delta and checked their website and discovered that butane curling irons are not allowed on trips to Switzerland! So, BEWARE and not purchase one if you are going there.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip I was making overseas.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like or if it would even make it through on my checked bag.  It comes with a safety cover, which is required if you&#x27;re putting it in your checked bag.  I just put the curling iron and the cartridge in a ziploc bag and didn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This heated up quickly and gave a great curl.  The only drawback was the clamp didn&#x27;t always hold my hair.  No big deal, really.  The butane cartridge was only used up a little bit.  I used it every other day for 18 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is traveling and needs a portable curling iron.</li>
            <li> Works great easy to use</li>
            <li> Beats dealing wth a cord!i</li>
            <li> I use it often, it gets hotter than most curling irons.  Have had one for years the igniter goes out eventually but&lt;br /&gt;other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> Bought for camping when no electric is available. Works fine for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Great little travel curling iron! Works great!</li>
            <li> This is just a replacement for the one I have worn out.  This is such an amazing hair tool. Would defintately recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great idea!  I went on a small sailing cruise ship and needed a cordless curling iron.  Very cool product.</li>
            <li> It operates so easily, just as the directions say. In one week I didn&#x27;t put a dent in one cannister of gas. It&#x27;s lightweight, good for travel or home.</li>
            <li> I was in Africa, so needed a curling iron that did not need electricity!  I loved it!</li>
            <li> I used it twice for 4 minutes and the cartridge ran out. I was traveling and had to use it for a wedding and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Worked how it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use but does curl very well.  Would rather have one that has a combined comb, which I had a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This is so worth having!  Imagine no electricity...no need with this curling iron and it works great. Heats up in 90 seconds and the curl lasts all day. Simply love it!</li>
            <li> Good for those with middle length hair. Purchased for someone else and they like to travel with it as it&#x27;s hard to find</li>
            <li> Because I was going on an African safari, I purchased this curling iron because I knew I would not have easy access to electricity.  I have fine straight hair and I definitely need a curling iron to give my hair some &amp;#34;fluff.&amp;#34;  I absolutely loved this curling iron, using it every day and sometimes twice a day.  It is very easy to use and it worked beautifully.  According to air regulations, you can only take one butane canister in checked suitcases, and I was concerned how long the butane cartridge would work.  Even after three weeks in Africa, I came home with approximately 1/3 butane still left in the canister.  In my future travels, forget the curling iron with a cord.  I will be taking my cordless curling iron.</li>
            <li> This does not have as strong of clip to hold the hair like my old on but will work just not as easy of as good of curl. Wish they were still selling my refills for my old one.</li>
            <li> Had a Braun for many years and loved it. This Conair seems to be just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s being returned.  The clasp does not hold to do even a tiny curl.</li>
            <li> Way to small. Gets to hot.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast - works as well as my corded iron. Comes with 1 cartridge so you&#x27;ll definitely need to buy more. Easy to ignite. The clamp is very light against the hair. I have hair past my shoulders so the barrel length is small for me but I don&#x27;t think they make another length.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old Thermacell curling iron.  Didn&#x27;t realize how slow it had become in heating up until I got my new one. Less than a minute!! I&#x27;m sure that will save on the butane. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love my curling iron!  It works great!</li>
            <li> Perfect hair tool for traveling, or really anywhere &amp; anytime, personally I use it everyday!!  Heats up pretty fast and gets hot enough to give me a nice curl, my hair is about mid length.  I believe there is a 30 day return, check first???  So.... if it&#x27;s not right for you simply return it!</li>
            <li> I love it! It gets hot enough and I&#x27;m not tied to a cord. It also has a cover for the barrel which is why I ordered this specific one. Most of the thermacell irons don&#x27;t come with cover. I had a similar one years ago and this is just like it. Great for traveling as it does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and she will not do a review so I thought I would. She thinks it is a cool product. She likes the glow at the end that lets you know if the heater element is working. She&#x27;s had it about a month and has had no issues.</li>
            <li> This has got to be THE best curling iron ever.  No cords to deal with the only thing is to remember to remove the activator when you finish.  I have shoulder length hair and all I do is use it for a flip all around, or a pageboy if I&#x27;m in the mood.  The whole thing takes me five/six minutes tops.  I have two just in case I&#x27;m overnight somewhere as I always have one in my travel bag.  One of the best (and least expensive I might add) hair products I have ever in my (very long life) purchased.</li>
            <li> Good for on the go and for camping if you&#x27;re not a true-blue natural camper and would spend a few minutes in the morning to do your make-up and hair.  I mean, umm...you know, if, you were the type of girl to do that&lt;br /&gt;  The barrel, however, is not 3/4 inch. More like 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
