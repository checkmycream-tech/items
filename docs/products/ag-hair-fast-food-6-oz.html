            <li>This leave in conditioner is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy trail running &amp; riding in the dunes which causes great stress on my hair...</li>
            <li>cannot believe that my hair is in excellent condition despite how much I wash it.</li>
            <li>AG Hair Fast Food is one of the best products on the market.</li>
            <li>As you get older hair feels drier and this product is wonderful!</li>
            <li>and I love how healthy my hair is!</li>
            <li>What I can say about this product so far is that it smells great!</li>
            <li>Makes hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>It smells great and really works.  </li>
            <li>, I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>AG really smells great and almost worth the price, however it was not as good for my hair as the Wen line of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love to swim, and it also helps combat salt water and chlorine.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner is ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>and I thought that I would be spending precious time re-wetting, re-scrunching, re-shaping my mop, when to my surprise</li>
            <li>otherwise the fast food conditioner works great.</li>
            <li>I am 60 and dye my hair with L&#x27;Oreal Preference #9NB, a one step product mostly to cover grays.</li>
            <li>First of all, this stuff smells AMAZING, like better than any hair product I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot).</li>
            <li>Makes combing hair out easy.</li>
            <li>, I simply ran a large toothed comb through my hair, and it looked GREAT!</li>
            <li>HUGE TIME SAVER...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner that helps smooth out the frizzes and lets you style your hair with ease.</li>
            <li>I gave it a shot because it&#x27;s cruelty free</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t wow me like I had hoped but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft but not greasy, has a great light smell and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>lol  Wen may cost a little more</li>
            <li>What I love about AG Fast Food is that I don&#x27;t have to use it every day for the full effects, every other day is plenty and my hair looks pretty great, no matter how I style it (or don&#x27;t style it!)</li>
            <li>I used to use the Nexxus leave in conditioner and used to love this, but now I&#x27;ve found AG&#x27;s fast food.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this leave-in conditioner for several years now and feel it does a good job in protecting and conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good leave in conditioner, look no further.</li>
            <li>Love this product hair is soft and easy to manage</li>
            <li>but it is truly worth it.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my girlfriend as I was struggling to comb out fine hair each day.  </li>
            <li>I USE, THIS PRIDYCT ALLOWS ME TO COMB OR BRUSH RIGHT THROUGH IT.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel more fuller and give it a little more volume than the Nexxus.</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner softens my curls, and is a very important part of my daily hair routine.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my hair has become dry and it sure makes it feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, expediently delivered.  </li>
            <li>I was about to return the product because I thought that the date at the top was the expiration date but after calling AG myself they told me that the date is actually the date that it was made and that it has a 2 year shelf life after that.</li>
            <li>I get lots of complements on how pretty my hair is when I use this product, and my hair is noticeably healthier.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily and always get compliments on my hair and how healthy it is.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed cosmotologist and buy many products at my local Beauty Supply shop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny, it&#x27;s incredibly soft and I can&#x27;t see the damage anymore.  </li>
            <li>The real testament is that my customers who are taller</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>AG products seem much superior to many other salon sold brands, at least with my hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is very damaged because I prefer to be blond rather than my natural dark dishwater brown.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair so smooth and soft, it gives it body if I want to dry it straight</li>
            <li>leaves my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>I do not have much shrinkage so far in the humidity.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have dry hair and have tried many different products.  </li>
            <li>also used an AG shampoo &amp; conditioner, plus this product, plus a repair serum, plus their new AG Beach Bomb curl enhancer.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Granted, I am new to this product line, but so far I am sold.</li>
            <li>Amazing product for thick, course hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I saw recommendations at another hair site, thought I would try this with my natural hair which is between 3b and 3c.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned not to mixed the spa serum and the fast food conditioner together...</li>
            <li>Your hair feels soft to the touch and looks healthier after use.</li>
            <li>If your hair isn&#x27;t super dry, this will likely do well for you.</li>
            <li>Again, this means that the product I use in my hair has to dry beautifully, not greasy, control my fly-aways, and add that extra \\&quot;oomf\\&quot; to make my hair look great.</li>
            <li>I get a better result using a very small amount of my regular rinse-out conditioner as a leave in.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and can be coarse and most products make it either dull, greasy looking or ironically even more coarse.  </li>
            <li>I will stick to the Wen line of products it actually does leave your hair soft and shiny.  </li>

            <li> I will stick to the Wen line of products it actually does leave your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a light, non-greasy leave in conditioner to tame my naturally wavy, thick, somewhat coarse hair, and believe that I have found it in this AG product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Let hair dry naturally for the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; all day or blow dry for smoothness.</li>
            <li> My other challenge, as a busy mom/full-time employee, I like to wash</li>
            <li> This product does leave my hair a flat by the second day.  </li>
            <li> Definitely going to try their other products</li>
            <li> If I go very long without my morning conditioning routine the complements stop.  </li>
            <li> I do like this product, although if you have over proccessed or really dry hair</li>
            <li> It keeps my dry frizzy curly hair moisturized enough that I don&#x27;t have to use hairspray anymore, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair though.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I have to be really careful with the product I use because a lot of them make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t enough to tame my frizz.  </li>
            <li> Because you only use a very small amount on your hair, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> TO USE ANY OTHER CINDITIINER IN THE SHOWER...</li>
            <li> -n-go, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to use a blow dryer and rely heavily on mother nature to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I also blow dry and use a curling iron everyday on shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It give hair a ton of moisture and never weighs my hair down in any way.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either.</li>
            <li> One small dab is all you need to rub through toweled dry hair.</li>
            <li> It is terrible, left my hair looking more parched than before I applied the product</li>
            <li> I am a Black woman who washes her hair 5-7 times a week and my hairdresser (who I visit every 5 weeks)</li>
            <li> it is now way less frizzy than it used to be.</li>
            <li> Thought that I would need to wash my hair again soon after, expecting all of those products to create a matted mess by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product and will continue to use it for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> After dying it caused some damage I wanted to give this a whirl before chopping off the dried out ends.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, poker-straight hair, with little to no wave to it.</li>
            <li> It keeps the frizz out of my curls without making my hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Most products claiming to be leave-in conditioners or curl enhancers, have done an ugly number on my difficult hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so I don&#x27;t see it being that expensive either.</li>
            <li> No more scratchy, irritated neck for me</li>
            <li> did not do all that was promised and left me a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Well, to my surprise I am on day 2 of not washing my hair, (meant to but got up late and did not have time!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results, I have terrible luck with leave in conditioning treatments.</li>

            <li> My daughter has (non-ethnic) curly hair and this has been the best product I&#x27;ve found yet for taming it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for gray hair. Makes hair more manageable. Let hair dry naturally for the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; all day or blow dry for smoothness.</li>
            <li> this is the best leave in i have ever brought! leaves my hair so soft!! A must have!</li>
            <li> Thank you!  Exactly what I wanted, expediently delivered.  This leave-in conditioner softens my curls, and is a very important part of my daily hair routine.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for thick, course hair! Helps with detangling, defrizzing and softening.</li>
            <li> I got this ag leave on cuz it had a lot of good reviews and my girlfriend told me it was good as well I think not so good I did not like this product at all</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It give hair a ton of moisture and never weighs my hair down in any way. I process my hair a lot and this is the best stuff iv ever used.</li>
            <li> This is great!  Highly recommended by my girlfriend as I was struggling to comb out fine hair each day.  It smells great and really works.  Just use a dime size and work into ends. Makes combing hair out easy.</li>
            <li> It is terrible, left my hair looking more parched than before I applied the product</li>
            <li> I was about to return the product because I thought that the date at the top was the expiration date but after calling AG myself they told me that the date is actually the date that it was made and that it has a 2 year shelf life after that. I have not used it yet because I am waiting for the AG Re:Coil Curl Activator to get here. I have used the Re:Coil before and it is a 5 star for me so I figured I&#x27;d try it with the same brands leave-in. I am a 3b curly girl and have lots of it so I want a product that adds bounce, no crunch, and no poofiness, the Re:Coil does just that, I love it. What I can say about this product so far is that it smells great! I will post another review once I actually use it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It keeps the frizz out of my curls without making my hair feel stiff. Great product!</li>
            <li> Best leave-in conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and it works great on my hair. Can&#x27;t be without it. Because you only use a very small amount on your hair, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I used to use the Nexxus leave in conditioner and used to love this, but now I&#x27;ve found AG&#x27;s fast food.  It makes my hair feel more fuller and give it a little more volume than the Nexxus.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years.  My hair is so soft and shiny. I am a Black woman who washes her hair 5-7 times a week and my hairdresser (who I visit every 5 weeks) cannot believe that my hair is in excellent condition despite how much I wash it.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, poker-straight hair, with little to no wave to it. Therefore I have to be really careful with the product I use because a lot of them make my hair look greasy. My other challenge, as a busy mom/full-time employee, I like to wash-n-go, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to use a blow dryer and rely heavily on mother nature to dry my hair. Again, this means that the product I use in my hair has to dry beautifully, not greasy, control my fly-aways, and add that extra \\&quot;oomf\\&quot; to make my hair look great. I didn&#x27;t think that existed, until I tried this stuff. What I love about AG Fast Food is that I don&#x27;t have to use it every day for the full effects, every other day is plenty and my hair looks pretty great, no matter how I style it (or don&#x27;t style it!) I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product and will continue to use it for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> I saw recommendations at another hair site, thought I would try this with my natural hair which is between 3b and 3c.  So far so good.  I do not have much shrinkage so far in the humidity.  It is going to rain later today and I will see what my hair looks like when I get home. LOL</li>
            <li> AG Hair Fast Food is one of the best products on the market. It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner that helps smooth out the frizzes and lets you style your hair with ease. Perfect for all hair types, just use in moderation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for about  3 years now, and I love it  very good . and a very good price.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great shipping speed!</li>
            <li> Great product, I have rebel/coarse hair and is just excellent!!! for my hair. Finally my hair is silky, manageable, and shine.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. My daughter recommended this conditioner. It only takes a small amount. It can be left in or rinsed out. No more scratchy, irritated neck for me and I love how healthy my hair is!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is very damaged because I prefer to be blond rather than my natural dark dishwater brown. This stuff makes my hair so smooth and soft, it gives it body if I want to dry it straight and when I diffuse it to get a curly look it is now way less frizzy than it used to be. I love it. And it smells great. I like to put a dab on even when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair just to freshen it up. I also got the 32oz size not realizing it is gigantic. Probably a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> This is some pretty great stuff! It makes your hair soft but not greasy, has a great light smell and does exactly what it says. I will be purchasing again after a lot of product frustration.</li>
            <li> First of all, this stuff smells AMAZING, like better than any hair product I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot). It keeps my dry frizzy curly hair moisturized enough that I don&#x27;t have to use hairspray anymore, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> AG really smells great and almost worth the price, however it was not as good for my hair as the Wen line of products.&lt;br /&gt;It did not do all that was promised and left me a little disappointed.  I probably should not have bought as much rather just a few items to test its worthiness.  I will stick to the Wen line of products it actually does leave your hair soft and shiny.  The real testament is that my customers who are taller then me have on more than 1 occasion expressed how nice my hair smelled!  lol  Wen may cost a little more but it is truly worth it.</li>
            <li> love it, great conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love this product hair is soft and easy to manage</li>
            <li> Have been using this leave-in conditioner for several years now and feel it does a good job in protecting and conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> THE BEST...BEST CONDITIONER/DETANGLER EVER EVER EVER!!! NO NEED AT ALL TO USE ANY OTHER CINDITIINER IN THE SHOWER... NO MATTER HOW TANGLED OR MATTED MY HAIR GETS FRM WHATEVER SHAMPIO I USE, THIS PRIDYCT ALLOWS ME TO COMB OR BRUSH RIGHT THROUGH IT. IF I STILL WORKED IN A SALON AS A HAIR STYLIST, I WOULD DEFINITWLY USE RHIS PRODYCR OVER CINDITIINER. HUGE TIME SAVER... HUGE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a leave in conditioner as I have curly hair.  I used the leave in after is spritz my curls and before I use the diffuser.  This product does leave my hair a flat by the second day.  It does smell goo, though but this is not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I gave it a shot because it&#x27;s cruelty free and I appreciate a company that doesn&#x27;t support animal testing when the majority do.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results, I have terrible luck with leave in conditioning treatments. My hair is very thick and can be coarse and most products make it either dull, greasy looking or ironically even more coarse.  After dying it caused some damage I wanted to give this a whirl before chopping off the dried out ends. In just two uses my hair feels amazing. It&#x27;s super shiny, it&#x27;s incredibly soft and I can&#x27;t see the damage anymore.  Believe me I&#x27;m shocked. A little bit goes a long way, so I don&#x27;t see it being that expensive either. I use about a dime size on my shoulder length hair.  Definitely going to try their other products I&#x27;m so impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> I use this product with Biosilk silk therapy for hair every morning after I shower as a leave in conditioner.  I get lots of complements on how pretty my hair is when I use this product, and my hair is noticeably healthier.  If I go very long without my morning conditioning routine the complements stop.  This leave in conditioner is amazing.  I love to swim, and it also helps combat salt water and chlorine.  If you are looking for a good leave in conditioner, look no further.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and always get compliments on my hair and how healthy it is.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was happy to find it. I tend to have dry hair and have tried many different products.  This is by far my favorite leave in conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair has become dry and it sure makes it feel so soft. I plan to continue using it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t wow me like I had hoped but it does a good job.  I get a better result using a very small amount of my regular rinse-out conditioner as a leave in.  I have very dry hair though.  If your hair isn&#x27;t super dry, this will likely do well for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Great price! I have been using this instead of conditioners that you rinse out and I love it!  My hairdresser recommended it to me!</li>
            <li> This product shipped on time. I am just starting to use it.  thanks.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner is ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  It wasn&#x27;t enough to tame my frizz.  But it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a light, non-greasy leave in conditioner to tame my naturally wavy, thick, somewhat coarse hair, and believe that I have found it in this AG product!&lt;br /&gt;I also used an AG shampoo &amp; conditioner, plus this product, plus a repair serum, plus their new AG Beach Bomb curl enhancer. Thought that I would need to wash my hair again soon after, expecting all of those products to create a matted mess by the end of the day. Well, to my surprise I am on day 2 of not washing my hair, (meant to but got up late and did not have time!). Got up this morning and I thought that I would be spending precious time re-wetting, re-scrunching, re-shaping my mop, when to my surprise, I simply ran a large toothed comb through my hair, and it looked GREAT! Granted, I am new to this product line, but so far I am sold. I am a licensed cosmotologist and buy many products at my local Beauty Supply shop. Most products claiming to be leave-in conditioners or curl enhancers, have done an ugly number on my difficult hair. AG products seem much superior to many other salon sold brands, at least with my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you AG! I love my hair again!</li>
            <li> I do like this product, although if you have over proccessed or really dry hair then I recommend the split end spa serum. I&#x27;ve learned not to mixed the spa serum and the fast food conditioner together...it tends to negate the products &amp; they dont work as well. I use the fast food if I havent been too harsh on my hair. I enjoy trail running &amp; riding in the dunes which causes great stress on my hair...otherwise the fast food conditioner works great. I love the AG product line!</li>
            <li> I am 60 and dye my hair with L&#x27;Oreal Preference #9NB, a one step product mostly to cover grays. I also blow dry and use a curling iron everyday on shoulder length hair. As you get older hair feels drier and this product is wonderful! One small dab is all you need to rub through toweled dry hair. Your hair feels soft to the touch and looks healthier after use. I think it is a good bang for the buck!</li>
