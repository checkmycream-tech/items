            <li>It looks and feels of good quality and the results after a face  </li>
            <li>reason I can say that it is shatter resistant is because my shower caddy decided it was a good day to product</li>
            <li>Quality seems good</li>
            <li>and I do brush my face sometimes, not convinced that is even a good idea</li>
            <li>I wouldve loved it if the handle was made of wood instead.</li>
            <li>The brush itself IS good</li>
            <li>I used this about 3 times before I decided that it was doing my damage to my face than good.</li>

            <li>Super awesome and a good price.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for your great prices, availability and awesome shipping.</li>
            <li>What makes this brush exceptional are the bristles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY pleased with it</li>
            <li>I love this complexion brush!  </li>
            <li>I love how this brush for my face!</li>

            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>- I love it!</li>
            <li>Love that!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>i love this!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I use this in the shower at night with Dove soap, and have yet to find anything better!</li>
            <li>I have used complexion brushes for decades and this one  is better and cheaper than those fancy battery powered brushes!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Great bristles on brush but handle broke easily.</li>
            <li>amazing product.</li>
            <li>It feels AMAZING on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Follow up with seaweed mask and the results have been amazing.</li>
            <li>But honestly, I truly do not need an electric brush to suit my needs--</li>
            <li>The bristles do a great job on their own, so light circular motions when washing.</li>
            <li>This brush is so well made and effective.</li>
            <li>this is the honest truth.  </li>
            <li>Rinse with luke warm water&lt;</li>
            <li>They were amazed and loved them more than the sonic ones.</li>
            <li>FAST shipping &amp; GREAT price!  A+++</li>
            <li>but then the bristles get to soften up after being in contact with warm water for a minute or so.</li>
            <li>So I have to drill my own 1/4\\&quot; hook hole in the handle to hang it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited and happy about this brush for three showers.</li>
            <li>worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>Face remarkably clean showing great improvement on skin.</li>
            <li>Very easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It came very fast, it is attractive and a nice size.</li>
            <li>It is perfect even for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this so far.</li>
            <li>Best one I&#x27;ve tried so far..</li>
            <li>But I stuck with this brush and within a couple weeks I found that I liked it better.</li>
            <li>Happy customer;)</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth and I almost never break out.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel now</li>
            <li>i think it is better than the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>and I love how my face feels.</li>
            <li>I  tryed many difrante face brushes</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This brush is truly magical.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I found this one in Arizona and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say it was great, not harsh but still effective.</li>
            <li>I like the brush but would like it better if the handle wasn&#x27;t plastic.</li>
            <li>I really love this brush.</li>
            <li>Now I love it.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks more radiant.</li>
            <li>Maybe better for the rest of the body, but don&#x27;t like on my face.</li>
            <li>so I am able to store in the shower without worrying about wood swelling.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>My skin is in love.</li>
            <li>Another product I just gift because there are so many people</li>
            <li>Cute as can be.  </li>
            <li>, maybe I need more guidance?</li>
            <li>but OK thereafter.  </li>
            <li>im pleased with this</li>
            <li>I only use it 2x a week, but it still makes a great difference!</li>
            <li>This is a healthy habit I&#x27;ve been able to maintain for quite a while now.</li>
            <li>Bought three more for my daughters and they like it too.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It is more like a shoe scrubber.</li>
            <li>This facial brush is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush, along with another brush, because I wasn&#x27;t sure which brush</li>
            <li>This face brush is such great quality!</li>
            <li>THE BEST FACIAL BRUSH YET</li>
            <li>and this makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>Have used it vigorously for many months now</li>
            <li>This time when i looked on the pictures i saw 3 brushes for $9 made me thought i got a better deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to buy more for my family as a gift</li>
            <li>but I like this one much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush, my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>I use this brush with both a facial scrub and the coconut oil that I use to wash my face, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>However, I have used these brushes prior and they are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this one almost two weeks now and am extremely satisfied with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it and will reorder again</li>
            <li>This brand will be in my shower hereon in, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad it&#x27;s available through Amazon!</li>
            <li>I really love this brush.  </li>
            <li>A sponge seems to clean out the pores on my face better and gives my skin an allover glow, which i love!</li>
            <li>and I liked that you can clean them better.</li>
            <li>The bristles of this brush are perfect for getting my face clean and clear of debris.  </li>
            <li>(make sure it&#x27;s the good stuff - there are a lot of cheap oils out there) with coconut, grapeseed, sweet almond or jojoba oil - olive oil</li>
            <li>(make sure it&#x27;s the good stuff - there are a lot of cheap oils out there) with coconut, grapeseed, sweet almond or jojoba oil - olive oil</li>
            <li>I generally have a very good complexion</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower in the morning, and the bristles are so soft, yet do such a great job at exfoliating my face, making it feel wonderfully refreshed.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush on a whim, and I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>This is the best brush for dry brushing your face.</li>
            <li>But this can be used to clean the grout in my bathroom!</li>
            <li>This is the PERFECT brush for dry brushing my face and neck!</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin brushing face &amp; neck!</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought and shipped it to my 17 daughter who struggles with acne</li>
            <li>Look into essential oils, seriously - good for so many things!</li>
            <li>It gets your skin just as clean and feels better as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;#4 Switching from conventional (even though they were \\&quot;natural\\&quot;) moisturizers may have been one of my best decisions ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#4 Switching from conventional (even though they were \\&quot;natural\\&quot;) moisturizers may have been one of my best decisions ever.</li>
            <li>The brushing action feels wonderful and immediately produces a more clear skin tone.</li>
            <li>It really works with whatever soap I use on my face and scrubs away the grime and dirt and my face feels very very smooth!</li>
            <li>- I am ordering my own from Amazon, because the health store I bought the first ones have been out.</li>
            <li>but this Bass brush is the perfect size and bristle stiffness for me.</li>
            <li>The world is getting to be a place where one has to read the fine print for fear of being deceived.</li>
            <li>the product is fine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I can see a huge difference in appearance.</li>
            <li>this was fabulous brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush for facial scrubbing.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy the face brush</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I saved the wrapper</li>
            <li>It has even dropped lightly onto the floor a couple times and didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>gives your skin that polished shiny smooth look.</li>
            <li>It works great except that the plastic material used in the handle is very fragile.</li>
            <li>I was looking for facial cleansing brushes and this one had a great review, so I opted to try it out.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to buff off the extra skin.</li>
            <li>This brush is lovely for a fresh brush up every day.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so clear, bright, and youthful.</li>
            <li>After using it, I put a night cream on, and my face is so smooth in the morning</li>
            <li>I have to say it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall it was a great alternative.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so smooth for a fraction of the price of the electric brushes.</li>
            <li>After I brush, my skin has an even tone and smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>If you are a mom of boys, you know how amazing that really is.</li>
            <li>The quality seems good so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good..</li>
            <li>The bristles weren&#x27;t too soft, and they did a good job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li>my face feels so soft and smooth after using this, good buy.  </li>
            <li>Look into essential oils, seriously - good for so many</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff, and for me, they are a perfect texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good brush for the face or any other part</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this brush for dry brushing my face, and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Very nice facial brush.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and fresh after I use it, way better than my hands.</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t shed, the brush is easy to clean and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>If you desire a brush to better cleanse your face, BUY THIS FIRST.</li>
            <li>Softens to perfection after first use.&lt;br /&gt;A must have for better skin.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>and I do feel like I get a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>Its sturdy, the bristles don&#x27;t shed and my face is squeaky clean after every use.</li>
            <li>Talk about clean.  </li>
            <li>While gentle exfoliation is great, these bristles feel far too abrasive on my face.</li>
            <li>Love this simple, yet effective, skin care product.</li>
            <li>This brush is great for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is the best facial brush I have used.</li>
            <li>I run the brush under very hot water for about 20 seconds before using it, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>brush is pretty dense, has natural bristles with plastic body, which is perfect cause wooden body would&#x27;ve molded easily.</li>
            <li>none of them did good enough job to bay it again !!!</li>
            <li>The natural bristles have a nice feel when washing your face.  </li>
            <li>I wouldnt switch from using my clarisonic full time for this</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>I tried this out last night and it works just as good.</li>
            <li>Love this item, very durable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I love this face brush so much.  </li>
            <li>Like I mentioned above, it is wise to soften the bristles before use on your face.  </li>
            <li>For the price this can&#x27;t be beat, I really don&#x27;t see the need to spend more unless you need the luxury of a Clarisonic or something.</li>
            <li>This was fine at first, but after two weeks the bristles started falling out.  </li>
            <li>my skin is more clear, smooth, even tone.</li>
            <li>make sure to soften the bristles in hot water first and throughout brushing.</li>
            <li>The handle is not made of cheap wood, as is the case with most natural bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been lucky so-far and managed to get it done each time</li>
            <li>and I believe that  using this along with getting rid of face makeup (this is the other most important part), soaps, lotions and anything other than this brush and water on my face has been the best remedy out there</li>
            <li>and I feel like I&#x27;m getting a nice, deep clean.</li>
            <li>They are great, but you DO have to rough up the brush the first time</li>
            <li>Because I avoid alcohol, use sunscreen, and do not smoke, I feel my skin looks pretty good, so I was just enhancing some tried-and-true techniques, such as brushing, to ensure it holds its luster.</li>
            <li>I use this facial brush in the shower every day and love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been doing it for a couple weeks, and I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it!</li>
            <li>I have never used a facial brush before, but I am enjoying the feel of my skin after using this one!</li>
            <li>Love this natural fiber brush!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this tool!!!</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research reading reviews on different blogs and on amazon of the electric brushes and came to the conclusion that the good ones were way overpriced and the not-so-good ones weren&#x27;t worth it either without trying a manual brush first.</li>
            <li>This is for beginners who can&#x27;t tolerate much pain or pressure!!</li>
            <li>I love the brush and have notice improved complexion since switching from a less effective brush about 2 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this brush based on many positive reviews, however, my package was received in a unacceptable condition.  </li>
            <li>Pure&#x27;s \\&quot;Seafoam Lavender\\&quot; facewash is all natural and just all-around good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can use any tea bad,i use peppermint because of the fresh minty feeling after..</li>
            <li>Provides a nice lather and facial scrub when used.</li>
            <li>It really gives you that super clean feeling leaving your skin softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>But overall the brush is a reasonably priced item, and the seller provided swift and good service.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is natural bristles.</li>
            <li>That will make it worth the money.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but firm and the handle is perfect.</li>
            <li>If you are ONLY selling ONE Brush, then show one brush, be honest.</li>
            <li>This facial brush might not be great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a bit abrasive, but it&#x27;s certainly not harsh.</li>
            <li>Brush seems ok, clear plastic handle on mine.</li>
            <li>These brushes are an effective cost saving means of exfoliating on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes my skin is more sensitive to the bristles than others...</li>
            <li>vanity wins out in this case.</li>
            <li>It does give you such a deep clean and is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Each day you shower you are able to affordably and thoroughly clean your entire body.</li>
            <li>The size is just right.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful facial brush, that makes my skin feel clean, and makes my pores look smaller and black head free!</li>
            <li>ALSO Bass makes the best wooden hair brush.</li>
            <li>Using this has been better than my Clarisonic brush actually, shocker but true.</li>
            <li>Brushing my face while I soap it up in the shower is my way of waking up in the morning, and my face feels really clean and ready for my Ambi moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dry brush on my face, but I use this brush with my cleanser and REALLY love the way it exfoliates!</li>
            <li>The head of the brush is very large.  </li>
            <li>Great brush and alternative to the highly priced Clarisonic and other mechanical brushes.</li>
            <li>I was super bent on buying the Clarisonic brush (or similar) but wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d benefit from a brush at all</li>
            <li>This is if my first facial brush (I was interested in a Clarisonic but read that facial brushes are just as good -- and cheaper, too!).</li>
            <li>it is great for exfoliation of dead skin!</li>
            <li>My complexion really looks great, my pores are much smaller and my complexion is clear.  </li>
            <li>and they are very gentle and do just the right scrubbing without stripping my face.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a cheap, lightweight option that would keep my skin looking clear and fresh.</li>
            <li>Even applying minimal pressure seemed to not make it more comfortable for me.</li>
            <li>This brush is truly an investment, my skin feels so clean and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and this is fine on my hands/arms/etc, but there is no way I can use it on my face.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a worthy investment because it lasts much longer than an exfoliating cleanser and does the same job :)</li>
            <li>But I would totally buy it again, just because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace a brush I am currently using and love.</li>
            <li>I didnt feel like risking loosing my clarisonic on a recent trip out of the country, so I brought this brush that I was gifted by a friend</li>
            <li>:)  I will likely buy one of these again.</li>
            <li>so I opted to try this first.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I made the mistake using it before it had time to “warm” up and get completely wet.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that for the first four months of using this brush I would agree with all the claims made in the 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>pretty abrasive.  </li>
            <li>with cleanser and hot water it is not scratchy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Bristles seems pretty attached</li>
            <li>My daughters first had the sonic ones that I would use.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I have been able to use it regularly when washing my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Works nice and isn&#x27;t to rough.</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s summer, I especially like having this one around for better cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that wetting the bristles first and then swirling it around on the palm of my hand softens them up sufficiently to then use on my face with the product of my choice.</li>
            <li>(I wet the bristles with warm water a couple minutes before using to soften them up a bit).</li>
            <li>They both love them, and the difference in their skin is evident after only 2 days of use.</li>
            <li>Low and behold they had softened up and became more pliable.</li>
            <li>I now love this brush and use it in the shower daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered in the last year (for those of you who have nothing better to do than read on):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>addition:  I enjoy shopping on Amazon for the savings it offers me as a \\&quot;Prime Member,\\</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it is a good way to wash your face.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using the brush twice a week it is still in good shape.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for dry brushing once daily as my cleanser is no joke and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Good product; well made; bristles are stiff atr first use</li>
            <li>and to be honest i think this works WAY better than clarisonic or other electric facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>Really great product - seems to exfoliate just fine and has led me to believe those electric brushes are just an expensive gimmick (granted</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and began using this for a &#x27;deeper&#x27; clean.</li>
            <li>, it hurt my sensitive face a little bit but for the next use it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>The benefits of dry brushing first thing in the morning are: energizing, refreshing, cleansing, revitalizing.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen them in a long time and I was glad that I found it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not used to brushing your face, then you definitely want to start easy, increasing pressure over the days.</li>
            <li>Many of them had never heard of dry brushing either.  </li>
            <li>and i can say i haven&#x27;t seen more than 2 single hairs come out of the brush.</li>
            <li>It is a pure pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I am familiar with the brand, I never expected this product would be so effect.</li>
            <li>Nice facial brush, a bit abrasive at first but softens after several uses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love if this review helped others suffering from acne, dry, oily and very unbalanced skin.  </li>
            <li>Using it for dry brushing currently, but from what I could see it would make an excellent wet wash brush as well.</li>
            <li>soft bristles, great for facial dry brushing, or</li>
            <li>It is very high quality</li>
            <li>Realistically, how much can you really remove and do you really need yet another electronic device just to wash your face?</li>
            <li>I really like the job this brush does on my face.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this purchase to anyone considering it!</li>
            <li>Once it is roughed up, it is a fabulous brush for deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>It actually really makes my skin smoother.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much, much smoother, even without lotion.</li>
            <li>Works really well at giving my face a thorough cleaning while gently exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li>so it was really disheartening.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Plastic handle is very sturdy and is not slippery.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>and it really helps exfoliate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>For now, I&#x27;m noticing smoother skin, and it seems to absorb moisturizers really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this face brush.</li>
            <li>This has helped so much and my skin is on the up and up since buying this.</li>
            <li>Gentle on  the skin....</li>
            <li>This works well to gently exfoliate my face.  </li>
            <li>The more you do it, your skin will adjust and it won&#x27;t seem so rough.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>This brush really exfolliates</li>
            <li>I much prefer the density and texture of these bristles, too.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t express how much this brush has helped the texture of my skin…</li>
            <li>Hopefully the price won&#x27;t creep up too high though!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a battery operated one.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to those with blackheads because within one time of using this brush mine were all gone!</li>
            <li>BUT I really do have problem skin.</li>
            <li>and I figured I would have to get another brush because it hurt that much.</li>
            <li>If it dries out too much</li>
            <li>fast shipper.  </li>
            <li>Love these natural bristle facial brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone with delicate skin, so this was surprising to me.</li>
            <li>After a few more days and people really noticing my face looking better, I realized the only thing I did different was clean my face with this brush.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean and soft and clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li>I use it about every other day, my face absorbs moisturizer so much better</li>
            <li>This is a good natural bristle brush that lasts a long time (we just bought a pair to replace the ones we used for the last two years).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t press too hard, just a little light pressure works great.</li>
            <li>can use it past the minute or two from the clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a nice product</li>
            <li>To me it feels great and my face is so soft after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Firm as all-get-out but very effective in exfoliating away dry skin around the nose and chin, provided you use circular strokes (recommended).</li>
            <li>The things that I really like about this brush is that the handle is high quality plastic (it is easy to clean and dry) and the bristles are not synthetic, they exfoliate very well and are not too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the bristles would be too rough for my sometimes sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>At first it was (obviously) a bit harsh on my face but as the bristles broke in a bit, it became a nice addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates nicely without drying skin out like other methods and works well with my current face-washing routine.  </li>
            <li>I love this little brush.  </li>
            <li>I have had great results dry brushing my body with a very stiff Yerba Prima body brush</li>
            <li>With all dry brushing you are supposed to use a very light touch, such as the smallest amount of force you would use to push a coin across a table with the brush.</li>
            <li>Need to run the brush under hot warmer to get it to soften up enough to be used gently on one&#x27;s face......good product and recommended.</li>
            <li>and I can already see my pores becoming smaller after only a week of use.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s also prevented some of the acne I normally have on my chin before my cycle.</li>
            <li>Using a portable tanning light on my face every few days for just 30 seconds to a min has really helped my skin!</li>
            <li>I used it with Pure Seafoam Facial Cleanser to get a deep clean</li>
            <li>With this brush my facial cleaner suds right up</li>
            <li>The brush is great, but the plastic handle is very poor quality.</li>
            <li>Definitely gentle enough for adult first time skin brushing.</li>
            <li>Other reviews made it sound like they were.</li>
            <li>I like it, it is a little rough on the face but works good.</li>
            <li>and I live in a desert region.</li>
            <li>It was ripped and the brush did not appear new at all.  </li>
            <li>it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>MY FACE IS ONLY SO LARGE!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin and my last brush was super soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft for the face</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Plain and simple, but definitely effective.</li>
            <li>You should rub the bristles on the back of your hand just to soften them at first.  </li>
            <li>and I still have the two brushes I ordered back when I first wrote this.</li>
            <li>I wake up soft and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>I wake up soft and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality facial brush I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love this Bass Facial Brush.</li>
            <li>It took a little longer to go through my skincare routine - if I applied too much pressure or went too quickly, it would irritate my skin and leave my cheeks/nose/etc.</li>
            <li>I used the brush from Sephora which seemed a lot softer and less effective (as I needed to use it wet).</li>
            <li>When I used it the FIRST day, I had several people compliment me on my makeup, I mean over the top compliment.</li>
            <li>Additionally, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s organic soaps works fine with this and the brush will soften after a few uses.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush that wasn&#x27;t too hard to use on my face right away!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if it was dropped hard, it would shatter the handle</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every day in combination with my favorite soap (african black soap) on my face and since I have been using it I have noticed less blemishes.</li>
            <li>I prefer using the manual brush to clean my face and body, plus I know it will last long!</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are too soft for my needs but thank you.</li>
            <li>Whole foods and Giant Eagle Market District may carry it in your area.</li>
            <li>I should have ordered one of those brushes that people said were too soft.”  </li>
            <li>I might try the wooden handle, because I like the bush part so much.</li>
            <li>I found the bristles to be too soft.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this considerably cheaper brush</li>
            <li>but this is all your skin needs as you won&#x27;t be stripping away natural oils</li>
            <li>I really like it and after 6 months of daily use</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle to the hand, but feel coarse on my face...</li>
            <li>Once your bristles are broke in, you only have to use gentle brushing to exfoliate without irritation.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a soft bristle brush for my face.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates my skin and leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li>too much roughness on the skin causes the same problem</li>
            <li>Bristles are very coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Way too coarse and scratchy for the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not too abrasive, holds up well so far (1 month).</li>
            <li>I think the natural bristles absorb some of the soap or cleanser used so after a while it might get smelly.</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference when I skip it for several days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a better job than any generic exfoliant (which is actually harsh on the skin).</li>
            <li>Firm, but helps to really clean your face, leaving it soft!</li>
            <li>I gladly tell them about dry brushing with my Bass brush.  </li>
            <li>It does take a while to dry and the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>I use it every other day with Walgreens brand oil free Daily face wash.</li>
            <li>I normally dry brush and follow it with witch hazel toner and sometimes an all-natural moisterizer (if its a hot arid day.)  </li>
            <li>The bristles appear to be of a high enough quality to last for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after using my new Bass facial brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this got so many stars again unless the vendor sent me a different model completely</li>
            <li>My older son actually commented on it and thanked me.</li>
            <li>so the price was a little high for me, considering the size and the fact that you can get a full body brush for the same price.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality facial brush.</li>
            <li>The brush has an overall high quality feel to it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the bristles to be too stiff, especially after a soak in warm water; I&#x27;ll even use it dry sometimes.  </li>
            <li>It seems a lot of the others on amazon that have natural bristles also tend to be flimsy, too harsh, and/or lose their bristles quickly.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty careful and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>Rough at first</li>
            <li>i received a hot pink brush.</li>
            <li>At first this brush was WAY to rough for my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bristles are of high quality and keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to replace every X amount of months but after a second wash after washing my face, this brush is like new after 1 year of daily use.</li>
            <li>So I mean, if you&#x27;re too sensitive to it just don&#x27;t scrub/press as hard lol.</li>
            <li>That was fun trying to pick up before it all went down the drain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real stiff</li>
            <li>I loved the steamer, but hated the battery operated brush because it was just too soft to effectively deep clean &amp; my face just didn&#x27;t feel as clean as with my Bass brush.  </li>
            <li>I loved the steamer, but hated the battery operated brush because it was just too soft to effectively deep clean &amp; my face just didn&#x27;t feel as clean as with my Bass brush.  </li>
            <li>As I read other reviews on this Brush I needed to try it on my face and have found it to be quite an amazing brush that is gentle enough, but firm enough to cleanse my facial skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started a whole dry brushing regimine, so</li>
            <li>the size of the head of the brush is larger than the common ones you see on the market, making it efficiently being able to cover your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 28 y/o male with somewhat sensitive skin, and so far have had no problems with irritation during or after use.</li>
            <li>At first the brush is very stiff and rough,however after three uses it completely softens,great for exfoliating,i use coconut oil mixed with a peppermint tea bag that was dipped in hot milk.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin, but had started having patches of dry skin, which was something new to me.  </li>
            <li>That brush was also harder to keep clean, either because of the design or wet use, but the bristles often got musty.</li>
            <li>; unless you&#x27;re brushing too hard, it&#x27;s a nice soft but gently firm brush.</li>
            <li>This has been the key to helping my skin clear up.  </li>
            <li>, i got a clear handle with off white bristles</li>
            <li>I had another facial brush from Amazon with a clear handle that I think was 99 cents.  </li>
            <li>My old one finally got to retire.</li>
            <li>You may need to apply different levels of pressure depending on how sensitive your skin is any given day - mine changes.</li>
            <li>I did find that I only need to use it a couple times a week or it makes my face sensitive.</li>
            <li>I thought I was doing something wrong, and tried again a couple of weeks later, this time being more gentle.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a natural sponge, rather than a facial brush.  </li>
            <li>I think now that my last brush was too soft.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin, yet leaves me with a hue of pink on my cheeks, detailing that it&#x27;s thoroughly cleaned my skin&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li>It was slightly rough at first, so I took the advice of another review &amp; softened it up by using it on the back of my hand for about a week.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a Clairsonic brush, but I had to go on a long trip</li>
            <li>Peels of dead skin and gives a fresh glow.</li>
            <li>I used to dry brush in high school and college and decided to return to the ancient practice for healthier-looking skin but also to release and help my lymphatic system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also had an opportunity to compare this brush against a new battery operated brush when my husband bought me a facial steamer as a present.  </li>
            <li>so I think those with sensitive/dry skin would be better off using a less harsh brush.</li>
            <li>It does exfoliate but I often find that after using it my face has dry patches where it wouldn&#x27;t normally have them.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll never NOT dry brush again!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a dry brush!  </li>
            <li>Not only is the surface area larger than most brushes, but the bristles are thin and stiff enough to really clean those pores, remove all makeup and stimulate circulation.  </li>
            <li>Getting those dead skin particles off the face help to open pores and really get down and deep clean.  </li>
            <li>Each has easily lasted me over a year before losing enough bristles to warrant a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the bristles are stiff enough to get the job done but not too stiff to irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So her initial impression was that it was rougher / less gentle than her old brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks or so, but mainly to help with some of the dry patches I was having on my chin.</li>
            <li>I think it is soft enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>Yes, at first the bristles are fairly hard but after just a few uses, they soften significantly.</li>
            <li>Just the right brush for your face, not too harsh, but enough stiffness to feel like it is doing something.  </li>
            <li>This product is harsh on your face when you first use it you have to soften the bristles.</li>
            <li>Nice product &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have noticed several comments where users felt this brush was too rough &amp; irritating to their skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Bass brush.</li>
            <li>Far too harsh on my skin (for cleansing or dry brushing), and it started shedding bristles during the first use.</li>
            <li>It did take a week or so to \\&quot;break in\\&quot; - the bristles were a bit tough at first but just be gentle with your face for awhile and don&#x27;t scrub too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;( I just bought Tanya zavastas dry skin brush for the face a few weeks ago and it really made a difference for me!!</li>
            <li>but I had no idea until recently that it was the main source of my skin problems - an extremely unacceptable side-effect IMO</li>
            <li>The theory is clear,  that we need to exfoliate the dead cells and stimulate for the new.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly the combination of softness and stiff bristles that I was looking for, however I left my brush in the shower for use as needed and all of the bristles have begun to bend and fray.</li>
            <li>Tear the tea bag then add pure coconut oil mix then apply to face,leave on for 10 minutes then use the brush to scrub and remove dead skin and dirt.</li>
            <li>It seemed a little pricey but it works very well.</li>
            <li>I am very careful with my face - I don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals or scrub hard because I want to keep my skin looking as good as long as possible.</li>
            <li>i have overly dry skin often so I needed a brush hard enough to really clean deep.</li>

            <li> It looks and feels of good quality and the results after a face  </li>
            <li> reason I can say that it is shatter resistant is because my shower caddy decided it was a good day to product</li>
            <li> Quality seems good</li>
            <li> and I do brush my face sometimes, not convinced that is even a good idea</li>
            <li> I wouldve loved it if the handle was made of wood instead.</li>

            <li> What makes this brush exceptional are the bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY pleased with it</li>
            <li> I love this complexion brush!  </li>
            <li> I love how this brush for my face!</li>

            <li> I love this brush!</li>
            <li> - I love it!</li>
            <li> Love that!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> i love this!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower at night with Dove soap, and have yet to find anything better!</li>
            <li> I have used complexion brushes for decades and this one  is better and cheaper than those fancy battery powered brushes!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  </li>
            <li> Great bristles on brush but handle broke easily.</li>
            <li> amazing product.</li>
            <li> It feels AMAZING on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Follow up with seaweed mask and the results have been amazing.</li>
            <li> But honestly, I truly do not need an electric brush to suit my needs--</li>
            <li> The bristles do a great job on their own, so light circular motions when washing.</li>
            <li> This brush is so well made and effective.</li>
            <li> this is the honest truth.  </li>
            <li> Rinse with luke warm water&lt;</li>
            <li> They were amazed and loved them more than the sonic ones.</li>
            <li> FAST shipping &amp; GREAT price!  A+++</li>
            <li> but then the bristles get to soften up after being in contact with warm water for a minute or so.</li>
            <li> So I have to drill my own 1/4\\&quot; hook hole in the handle to hang it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited and happy about this brush for three showers.</li>
            <li> worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Face remarkably clean showing great improvement on skin.</li>
            <li> Very easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It came very fast, it is attractive and a nice size.</li>
            <li> It is perfect even for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this so far.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve tried so far..</li>
            <li> But I stuck with this brush and within a couple weeks I found that I liked it better.</li>
            <li> Happy customer;)</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth and I almost never break out.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel now</li>
            <li> i think it is better than the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> and I love how my face feels.</li>
            <li> I  tryed many difrante face brushes</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is truly magical.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I found this one in Arizona and love it.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say it was great, not harsh but still effective.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but would like it better if the handle wasn&#x27;t plastic.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush.</li>
            <li> Now I love it.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks more radiant.</li>
            <li> Maybe better for the rest of the body, but don&#x27;t like on my face.</li>
            <li> so I am able to store in the shower without worrying about wood swelling.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> My skin is in love.</li>
            <li> Another product I just gift because there are so many people</li>
            <li> Cute as can be.  </li>
            <li> , maybe I need more guidance?</li>
            <li> but OK thereafter.  </li>
            <li> im pleased with this</li>
            <li> I only use it 2x a week, but it still makes a great difference!</li>
            <li> This is a healthy habit I&#x27;ve been able to maintain for quite a while now.</li>
            <li> Bought three more for my daughters and they like it too.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It is more like a shoe scrubber.</li>
            <li> This facial brush is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush, along with another brush, because I wasn&#x27;t sure which brush</li>
            <li> This face brush is such great quality!</li>
            <li> THE BEST FACIAL BRUSH YET</li>
            <li> and this makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> Have used it vigorously for many months now</li>
            <li> This time when i looked on the pictures i saw 3 brushes for $9 made me thought i got a better deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to buy more for my family as a gift</li>
            <li> but I like this one much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush, my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> I use this brush with both a facial scrub and the coconut oil that I use to wash my face, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> However, I have used these brushes prior and they are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one almost two weeks now and am extremely satisfied with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it and will reorder again</li>
            <li> This brand will be in my shower hereon in, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad it&#x27;s available through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I really love this brush.  </li>
            <li> A sponge seems to clean out the pores on my face better and gives my skin an allover glow, which i love!</li>
            <li> and I liked that you can clean them better.</li>
            <li> The bristles of this brush are perfect for getting my face clean and clear of debris.  </li>
            <li> (make sure it&#x27;s the good stuff - there are a lot of cheap oils out there) with coconut, grapeseed, sweet almond or jojoba oil - olive oil</li>
            <li> (make sure it&#x27;s the good stuff - there are a lot of cheap oils out there) with coconut, grapeseed, sweet almond or jojoba oil - olive oil</li>
            <li> I generally have a very good complexion</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower in the morning, and the bristles are so soft, yet do such a great job at exfoliating my face, making it feel wonderfully refreshed.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush on a whim, and I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for dry brushing your face.</li>
            <li> But this can be used to clean the grout in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT brush for dry brushing my face and neck!</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin brushing face &amp; neck!</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought and shipped it to my 17 daughter who struggles with acne</li>
            <li> Look into essential oils, seriously - good for so many things!</li>
            <li> It gets your skin just as clean and feels better as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;#4 Switching from conventional (even though they were \\&quot;natural\\&quot;) moisturizers may have been one of my best decisions ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#4 Switching from conventional (even though they were \\&quot;natural\\&quot;) moisturizers may have been one of my best decisions ever.</li>
            <li> The brushing action feels wonderful and immediately produces a more clear skin tone.</li>
            <li> It really works with whatever soap I use on my face and scrubs away the grime and dirt and my face feels very very smooth!</li>
            <li> - I am ordering my own from Amazon, because the health store I bought the first ones have been out.</li>
            <li> but this Bass brush is the perfect size and bristle stiffness for me.</li>
            <li> The world is getting to be a place where one has to read the fine print for fear of being deceived.</li>
            <li> the product is fine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I can see a huge difference in appearance.</li>
            <li> this was fabulous brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush for facial scrubbing.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy the face brush</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I saved the wrapper</li>
            <li> It has even dropped lightly onto the floor a couple times and didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> gives your skin that polished shiny smooth look.</li>
            <li> It works great except that the plastic material used in the handle is very fragile.</li>
            <li> I was looking for facial cleansing brushes and this one had a great review, so I opted to try it out.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to buff off the extra skin.</li>
            <li> This brush is lovely for a fresh brush up every day.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so clear, bright, and youthful.</li>
            <li> After using it, I put a night cream on, and my face is so smooth in the morning</li>
            <li> I have to say it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall it was a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so smooth for a fraction of the price of the electric brushes.</li>
            <li> After I brush, my skin has an even tone and smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> If you are a mom of boys, you know how amazing that really is.</li>
            <li> The quality seems good so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good..</li>
            <li> The bristles weren&#x27;t too soft, and they did a good job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> my face feels so soft and smooth after using this, good buy.  </li>
            <li> Look into essential oils, seriously - good for so many</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff, and for me, they are a perfect texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good brush for the face or any other part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this brush for dry brushing my face, and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Very nice facial brush.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and fresh after I use it, way better than my hands.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t shed, the brush is easy to clean and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> If you desire a brush to better cleanse your face, BUY THIS FIRST.</li>
            <li> Softens to perfection after first use.&lt;br /&gt;A must have for better skin.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> and I do feel like I get a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> Its sturdy, the bristles don&#x27;t shed and my face is squeaky clean after every use.</li>
            <li> Talk about clean.  </li>
            <li> While gentle exfoliation is great, these bristles feel far too abrasive on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this simple, yet effective, skin care product.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is the best facial brush I have used.</li>
            <li> I run the brush under very hot water for about 20 seconds before using it, and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> brush is pretty dense, has natural bristles with plastic body, which is perfect cause wooden body would&#x27;ve molded easily.</li>
            <li> none of them did good enough job to bay it again !!!</li>
            <li> The natural bristles have a nice feel when washing your face.  </li>
            <li> I wouldnt switch from using my clarisonic full time for this</li>
            <li> I love this so much</li>
            <li> I tried this out last night and it works just as good.</li>
            <li> Love this item, very durable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this face brush so much.  </li>
            <li> Like I mentioned above, it is wise to soften the bristles before use on your face.  </li>
            <li> For the price this can&#x27;t be beat, I really don&#x27;t see the need to spend more unless you need the luxury of a Clarisonic or something.</li>
            <li> This was fine at first, but after two weeks the bristles started falling out.  </li>
            <li> my skin is more clear, smooth, even tone.</li>
            <li> make sure to soften the bristles in hot water first and throughout brushing.</li>
            <li> The handle is not made of cheap wood, as is the case with most natural bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky so-far and managed to get it done each time</li>
            <li> and I believe that  using this along with getting rid of face makeup (this is the other most important part), soaps, lotions and anything other than this brush and water on my face has been the best remedy out there</li>
            <li> and I feel like I&#x27;m getting a nice, deep clean.</li>
            <li> They are great, but you DO have to rough up the brush the first time</li>
            <li> Because I avoid alcohol, use sunscreen, and do not smoke, I feel my skin looks pretty good, so I was just enhancing some tried-and-true techniques, such as brushing, to ensure it holds its luster.</li>
            <li> I use this facial brush in the shower every day and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been doing it for a couple weeks, and I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it!</li>
            <li> I have never used a facial brush before, but I am enjoying the feel of my skin after using this one!</li>
            <li> Love this natural fiber brush!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this tool!!!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research reading reviews on different blogs and on amazon of the electric brushes and came to the conclusion that the good ones were way overpriced and the not-so-good ones weren&#x27;t worth it either without trying a manual brush first.</li>
            <li> This is for beginners who can&#x27;t tolerate much pain or pressure!!</li>
            <li> I love the brush and have notice improved complexion since switching from a less effective brush about 2 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this brush based on many positive reviews, however, my package was received in a unacceptable condition.  </li>
            <li> Pure&#x27;s \\&quot;Seafoam Lavender\\&quot; facewash is all natural and just all-around good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can use any tea bad,i use peppermint because of the fresh minty feeling after..</li>
            <li> Provides a nice lather and facial scrub when used.</li>
            <li> It really gives you that super clean feeling leaving your skin softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> But overall the brush is a reasonably priced item, and the seller provided swift and good service.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is natural bristles.</li>
            <li> That will make it worth the money.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but firm and the handle is perfect.</li>
            <li> If you are ONLY selling ONE Brush, then show one brush, be honest.</li>
            <li> This facial brush might not be great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a bit abrasive, but it&#x27;s certainly not harsh.</li>
            <li> Brush seems ok, clear plastic handle on mine.</li>
            <li> These brushes are an effective cost saving means of exfoliating on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes my skin is more sensitive to the bristles than others...</li>
            <li> vanity wins out in this case.</li>
            <li> It does give you such a deep clean and is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Each day you shower you are able to affordably and thoroughly clean your entire body.</li>
            <li> The size is just right.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial brush, that makes my skin feel clean, and makes my pores look smaller and black head free!</li>
            <li> ALSO Bass makes the best wooden hair brush.</li>
            <li> Using this has been better than my Clarisonic brush actually, shocker but true.</li>
            <li> Brushing my face while I soap it up in the shower is my way of waking up in the morning, and my face feels really clean and ready for my Ambi moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dry brush on my face, but I use this brush with my cleanser and REALLY love the way it exfoliates!</li>
            <li> The head of the brush is very large.  </li>
            <li> Great brush and alternative to the highly priced Clarisonic and other mechanical brushes.</li>
            <li> I was super bent on buying the Clarisonic brush (or similar) but wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d benefit from a brush at all</li>
            <li> This is if my first facial brush (I was interested in a Clarisonic but read that facial brushes are just as good -- and cheaper, too!).</li>
            <li> it is great for exfoliation of dead skin!</li>
            <li> My complexion really looks great, my pores are much smaller and my complexion is clear.  </li>
            <li> and they are very gentle and do just the right scrubbing without stripping my face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a cheap, lightweight option that would keep my skin looking clear and fresh.</li>
            <li> Even applying minimal pressure seemed to not make it more comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is truly an investment, my skin feels so clean and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and this is fine on my hands/arms/etc, but there is no way I can use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a worthy investment because it lasts much longer than an exfoliating cleanser and does the same job :)</li>
            <li> But I would totally buy it again, just because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace a brush I am currently using and love.</li>
            <li> I didnt feel like risking loosing my clarisonic on a recent trip out of the country, so I brought this brush that I was gifted by a friend</li>
            <li> :)  I will likely buy one of these again.</li>
            <li> so I opted to try this first.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I made the mistake using it before it had time to “warm” up and get completely wet.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that for the first four months of using this brush I would agree with all the claims made in the 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> pretty abrasive.  </li>
            <li> with cleanser and hot water it is not scratchy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Bristles seems pretty attached</li>
            <li> My daughters first had the sonic ones that I would use.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I have been able to use it regularly when washing my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Works nice and isn&#x27;t to rough.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s summer, I especially like having this one around for better cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that wetting the bristles first and then swirling it around on the palm of my hand softens them up sufficiently to then use on my face with the product of my choice.</li>
            <li> (I wet the bristles with warm water a couple minutes before using to soften them up a bit).</li>
            <li> They both love them, and the difference in their skin is evident after only 2 days of use.</li>
            <li> Low and behold they had softened up and became more pliable.</li>
            <li> I now love this brush and use it in the shower daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered in the last year (for those of you who have nothing better to do than read on):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> addition:  I enjoy shopping on Amazon for the savings it offers me as a \\&quot;Prime Member,\\</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it is a good way to wash your face.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using the brush twice a week it is still in good shape.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily for dry brushing once daily as my cleanser is no joke and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Good product; well made; bristles are stiff atr first use</li>
            <li> and to be honest i think this works WAY better than clarisonic or other electric facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> Really great product - seems to exfoliate just fine and has led me to believe those electric brushes are just an expensive gimmick (granted</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and began using this for a &#x27;deeper&#x27; clean.</li>
            <li> , it hurt my sensitive face a little bit but for the next use it was perfect.  </li>
            <li> The benefits of dry brushing first thing in the morning are: energizing, refreshing, cleansing, revitalizing.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen them in a long time and I was glad that I found it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not used to brushing your face, then you definitely want to start easy, increasing pressure over the days.</li>
            <li> Many of them had never heard of dry brushing either.  </li>
            <li> and i can say i haven&#x27;t seen more than 2 single hairs come out of the brush.</li>
            <li> It is a pure pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I am familiar with the brand, I never expected this product would be so effect.</li>
            <li> Nice facial brush, a bit abrasive at first but softens after several uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d love if this review helped others suffering from acne, dry, oily and very unbalanced skin.  </li>
            <li> Using it for dry brushing currently, but from what I could see it would make an excellent wet wash brush as well.</li>
            <li> soft bristles, great for facial dry brushing, or</li>
            <li> It is very high quality</li>
            <li> Realistically, how much can you really remove and do you really need yet another electronic device just to wash your face?</li>
            <li> I really like the job this brush does on my face.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this purchase to anyone considering it!</li>
            <li> Once it is roughed up, it is a fabulous brush for deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> It actually really makes my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much, much smoother, even without lotion.</li>
            <li> Works really well at giving my face a thorough cleaning while gently exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li> so it was really disheartening.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Plastic handle is very sturdy and is not slippery.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> and it really helps exfoliate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It came fast.</li>
            <li> For now, I&#x27;m noticing smoother skin, and it seems to absorb moisturizers really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this face brush.</li>
            <li> This has helped so much and my skin is on the up and up since buying this.</li>
            <li> Gentle on  the skin....</li>
            <li> This works well to gently exfoliate my face.  </li>
            <li> The more you do it, your skin will adjust and it won&#x27;t seem so rough.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> really</li>
            <li> This brush really exfolliates</li>
            <li> I much prefer the density and texture of these bristles, too.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t express how much this brush has helped the texture of my skin…</li>
            <li> Hopefully the price won&#x27;t creep up too high though!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a battery operated one.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to those with blackheads because within one time of using this brush mine were all gone!</li>
            <li> BUT I really do have problem skin.</li>
            <li> and I figured I would have to get another brush because it hurt that much.</li>
            <li> If it dries out too much</li>
            <li> fast shipper.  </li>
            <li> Love these natural bristle facial brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone with delicate skin, so this was surprising to me.</li>
            <li> After a few more days and people really noticing my face looking better, I realized the only thing I did different was clean my face with this brush.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean and soft and clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li> I use it about every other day, my face absorbs moisturizer so much better</li>
            <li> This is a good natural bristle brush that lasts a long time (we just bought a pair to replace the ones we used for the last two years).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t press too hard, just a little light pressure works great.</li>
            <li> can use it past the minute or two from the clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a nice product</li>
            <li> To me it feels great and my face is so soft after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Firm as all-get-out but very effective in exfoliating away dry skin around the nose and chin, provided you use circular strokes (recommended).</li>
            <li> The things that I really like about this brush is that the handle is high quality plastic (it is easy to clean and dry) and the bristles are not synthetic, they exfoliate very well and are not too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the bristles would be too rough for my sometimes sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> At first it was (obviously) a bit harsh on my face but as the bristles broke in a bit, it became a nice addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates nicely without drying skin out like other methods and works well with my current face-washing routine.  </li>
            <li> I love this little brush.  </li>
            <li> I have had great results dry brushing my body with a very stiff Yerba Prima body brush</li>
            <li> With all dry brushing you are supposed to use a very light touch, such as the smallest amount of force you would use to push a coin across a table with the brush.</li>
            <li> Need to run the brush under hot warmer to get it to soften up enough to be used gently on one&#x27;s face......good product and recommended.</li>
            <li> and I can already see my pores becoming smaller after only a week of use.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s also prevented some of the acne I normally have on my chin before my cycle.</li>
            <li> Using a portable tanning light on my face every few days for just 30 seconds to a min has really helped my skin!</li>
            <li> I used it with Pure Seafoam Facial Cleanser to get a deep clean</li>
            <li> With this brush my facial cleaner suds right up</li>
            <li> The brush is great, but the plastic handle is very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Definitely gentle enough for adult first time skin brushing.</li>
            <li> Other reviews made it sound like they were.</li>
            <li> I like it, it is a little rough on the face but works good.</li>
            <li> and I live in a desert region.</li>
            <li> It was ripped and the brush did not appear new at all.  </li>
            <li> it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> MY FACE IS ONLY SO LARGE!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin and my last brush was super soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft for the face</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, but definitely effective.</li>
            <li> You should rub the bristles on the back of your hand just to soften them at first.  </li>
            <li> and I still have the two brushes I ordered back when I first wrote this.</li>
            <li> I wake up soft and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> I wake up soft and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality facial brush I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this Bass Facial Brush.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer to go through my skincare routine - if I applied too much pressure or went too quickly, it would irritate my skin and leave my cheeks/nose/etc.</li>
            <li> I used the brush from Sephora which seemed a lot softer and less effective (as I needed to use it wet).</li>
            <li> When I used it the FIRST day, I had several people compliment me on my makeup, I mean over the top compliment.</li>
            <li> Additionally, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s organic soaps works fine with this and the brush will soften after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush that wasn&#x27;t too hard to use on my face right away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if it was dropped hard, it would shatter the handle</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much every day in combination with my favorite soap (african black soap) on my face and since I have been using it I have noticed less blemishes.</li>
            <li> I prefer using the manual brush to clean my face and body, plus I know it will last long!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are too soft for my needs but thank you.</li>
            <li> Whole foods and Giant Eagle Market District may carry it in your area.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered one of those brushes that people said were too soft.”  </li>
            <li> I might try the wooden handle, because I like the bush part so much.</li>
            <li> I found the bristles to be too soft.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this considerably cheaper brush</li>
            <li> but this is all your skin needs as you won&#x27;t be stripping away natural oils</li>
            <li> I really like it and after 6 months of daily use</li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle to the hand, but feel coarse on my face...</li>
            <li> Once your bristles are broke in, you only have to use gentle brushing to exfoliate without irritation.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a soft bristle brush for my face.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates my skin and leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li> too much roughness on the skin causes the same problem</li>
            <li> Bristles are very coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Way too coarse and scratchy for the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not too abrasive, holds up well so far (1 month).</li>
            <li> I think the natural bristles absorb some of the soap or cleanser used so after a while it might get smelly.</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference when I skip it for several days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a better job than any generic exfoliant (which is actually harsh on the skin).</li>
            <li> Firm, but helps to really clean your face, leaving it soft!</li>
            <li> I gladly tell them about dry brushing with my Bass brush.  </li>
            <li> It does take a while to dry and the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> I use it every other day with Walgreens brand oil free Daily face wash.</li>
            <li> I normally dry brush and follow it with witch hazel toner and sometimes an all-natural moisterizer (if its a hot arid day.)  </li>
            <li> The bristles appear to be of a high enough quality to last for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean after using my new Bass facial brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this got so many stars again unless the vendor sent me a different model completely</li>
            <li> My older son actually commented on it and thanked me.</li>
            <li> so the price was a little high for me, considering the size and the fact that you can get a full body brush for the same price.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality facial brush.</li>
            <li> The brush has an overall high quality feel to it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the bristles to be too stiff, especially after a soak in warm water; I&#x27;ll even use it dry sometimes.  </li>
            <li> It seems a lot of the others on amazon that have natural bristles also tend to be flimsy, too harsh, and/or lose their bristles quickly.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty careful and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> Rough at first</li>
            <li> i received a hot pink brush.</li>
            <li> At first this brush was WAY to rough for my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bristles are of high quality and keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to replace every X amount of months but after a second wash after washing my face, this brush is like new after 1 year of daily use.</li>
            <li> So I mean, if you&#x27;re too sensitive to it just don&#x27;t scrub/press as hard lol.</li>
            <li> That was fun trying to pick up before it all went down the drain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real stiff</li>
            <li> I loved the steamer, but hated the battery operated brush because it was just too soft to effectively deep clean &amp; my face just didn&#x27;t feel as clean as with my Bass brush.  </li>
            <li> I loved the steamer, but hated the battery operated brush because it was just too soft to effectively deep clean &amp; my face just didn&#x27;t feel as clean as with my Bass brush.  </li>
            <li> As I read other reviews on this Brush I needed to try it on my face and have found it to be quite an amazing brush that is gentle enough, but firm enough to cleanse my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started a whole dry brushing regimine, so</li>
            <li> the size of the head of the brush is larger than the common ones you see on the market, making it efficiently being able to cover your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 28 y/o male with somewhat sensitive skin, and so far have had no problems with irritation during or after use.</li>
            <li> At first the brush is very stiff and rough,however after three uses it completely softens,great for exfoliating,i use coconut oil mixed with a peppermint tea bag that was dipped in hot milk.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin, but had started having patches of dry skin, which was something new to me.  </li>
            <li> That brush was also harder to keep clean, either because of the design or wet use, but the bristles often got musty.</li>
            <li> ; unless you&#x27;re brushing too hard, it&#x27;s a nice soft but gently firm brush.</li>
            <li> This has been the key to helping my skin clear up.  </li>
            <li> , i got a clear handle with off white bristles</li>
            <li> I had another facial brush from Amazon with a clear handle that I think was 99 cents.  </li>
            <li> My old one finally got to retire.</li>
            <li> You may need to apply different levels of pressure depending on how sensitive your skin is any given day - mine changes.</li>
            <li> I did find that I only need to use it a couple times a week or it makes my face sensitive.</li>
            <li> I thought I was doing something wrong, and tried again a couple of weeks later, this time being more gentle.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a natural sponge, rather than a facial brush.  </li>
            <li> I think now that my last brush was too soft.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin, yet leaves me with a hue of pink on my cheeks, detailing that it&#x27;s thoroughly cleaned my skin&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li> It was slightly rough at first, so I took the advice of another review &amp; softened it up by using it on the back of my hand for about a week.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a Clairsonic brush, but I had to go on a long trip</li>
            <li> Peels of dead skin and gives a fresh glow.</li>
            <li> I used to dry brush in high school and college and decided to return to the ancient practice for healthier-looking skin but also to release and help my lymphatic system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also had an opportunity to compare this brush against a new battery operated brush when my husband bought me a facial steamer as a present.  </li>
            <li> so I think those with sensitive/dry skin would be better off using a less harsh brush.</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate but I often find that after using it my face has dry patches where it wouldn&#x27;t normally have them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll never NOT dry brush again!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a dry brush!  </li>
            <li> Not only is the surface area larger than most brushes, but the bristles are thin and stiff enough to really clean those pores, remove all makeup and stimulate circulation.  </li>
            <li> Getting those dead skin particles off the face help to open pores and really get down and deep clean.  </li>
            <li> Each has easily lasted me over a year before losing enough bristles to warrant a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the bristles are stiff enough to get the job done but not too stiff to irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So her initial impression was that it was rougher / less gentle than her old brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks or so, but mainly to help with some of the dry patches I was having on my chin.</li>
            <li> I think it is soft enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> Yes, at first the bristles are fairly hard but after just a few uses, they soften significantly.</li>
            <li> Just the right brush for your face, not too harsh, but enough stiffness to feel like it is doing something.  </li>
            <li> This product is harsh on your face when you first use it you have to soften the bristles.</li>
            <li> Nice product &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have noticed several comments where users felt this brush was too rough &amp; irritating to their skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Bass brush.</li>
            <li> Far too harsh on my skin (for cleansing or dry brushing), and it started shedding bristles during the first use.</li>
            <li> It did take a week or so to \\&quot;break in\\&quot; - the bristles were a bit tough at first but just be gentle with your face for awhile and don&#x27;t scrub too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;( I just bought Tanya zavastas dry skin brush for the face a few weeks ago and it really made a difference for me!!</li>
            <li> but I had no idea until recently that it was the main source of my skin problems - an extremely unacceptable side-effect IMO</li>
            <li> The theory is clear,  that we need to exfoliate the dead cells and stimulate for the new.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly the combination of softness and stiff bristles that I was looking for, however I left my brush in the shower for use as needed and all of the bristles have begun to bend and fray.</li>
            <li> Tear the tea bag then add pure coconut oil mix then apply to face,leave on for 10 minutes then use the brush to scrub and remove dead skin and dirt.</li>
            <li> It seemed a little pricey but it works very well.</li>
            <li> I am very careful with my face - I don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals or scrub hard because I want to keep my skin looking as good as long as possible.</li>
            <li> i have overly dry skin often so I needed a brush hard enough to really clean deep.</li>
            <li> It was a little rough at first.</li>
            <li> The other brush&#x27;s bristles were too soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the large side (about 1.75 inches diameter brush head) but the bristles feel firm enough to remove dirt and oil but soft enough for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I used this the first time and my face broke out into these huge, ugly boils.</li>
            <li> After reading several articles on it &amp; watching several videos on the proper way to dry brush, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned at first, as I read some reviews of the bristles being too stiff and rough.</li>
            <li> and it began to come out with some rough patches and a generally sallow/dull skin tone.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough for even my eyelids, and firm enough to help wake me up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used facial cleansing brushes for a long time and these scrape my face..</li>
            <li> --look elsewhere if your preference is for a long (or short) handle.  </li>
            <li> Bass Brushes is a quality product that is affordable and made of natural hair.  </li>
            <li> My skin has totally become softer after dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought a wooden Bass facial brush from my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem a little soft for me...</li>
            <li> I usually counteract this by using a ton of cleanser, using gentle pressure, and only using it every other day...</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Bass natural fiber brushes with wooden handles</li>
            <li> I feel that this was done deliberately and this kind of thing always leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t had one of these brushes long before now.  </li>
            <li> How long am I supposed to wait for this thing to soften up?</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these for my teen aged sons (17 &amp; 14).</li>
            <li> You also might want to break it in by using it on your hand first since the bristles are a little stiff to start.</li>
            <li> A little stiff at first</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised because I was skeptical that this whole dry brushing thing actually worked!</li>
            <li> This brush has a larger bristle area than my previous facial brush, which I like.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff - but not too soft so as not to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It says on the package that if can be used wet or dry but I am only using it for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used other types that are smaller, and bought something shaped like this from sephora.</li>
            <li> I only wish I didn&#x27;t get a pink one!</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts a long time as well!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my body dry brush</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a dry skin problem since.</li>
            <li> At morning or night when your face is dry, use in a circular motion all over face and neck&lt;</li>
            <li> Do it in the shower or dry.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this brush for anyone looking to try dry skin brushing on the face.</li>
            <li> I ended up liking both brushes, but I use this brush specifically for dry brushing my face &amp; neck.  </li>
            <li> I had never heard of dry brushing, until I started searching beauty articles on how to solve my dry skin problem.  </li>
            <li> This dry skin brush works well and exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li> If used dry, this is the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to dry brush</li>
            <li> I let it air dry over night and</li>
            <li> I just apply a little liquid facial soap to the brush and wet it, and then wash my entire face - even around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Bass Brush bristles are a bit stiffer and definitely do a thorough cleaning!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm and can be hard on tender areas of skin at first.</li>
            <li> Rinses well and no odor when dry!</li>
            <li> I use it wet and dry for shower and face washing.</li>
            <li> I have one that I use wet  and one that I use for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I tried both dry and wet brushing my face with it.</li>
            <li> At first I considered it to small however being small helps to limit its intended use to the face and ears as you then go to a lrger brush for the rest.</li>
            <li> It only takes me a few minutes to dry brush &amp; I have had no problems with irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> a little red.</li>
            <li> Not as rough as my body brush, but enough to set my skin tingling a little.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> I like either soft or hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft, not too hard.</li>
            <li> I did not know what I was missing, but now I will probably use this product (or a similar product) for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to find them with a plastic rather than wood handle.  </li>
            <li> The bristles felt way to rough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much on grabbing tons of beauty products</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a facial scrub with firm bristles.</li>
            <li> I would not have chosen pink and would like to have been allowed to choose.</li>
            <li> Too rough to use on my face</li>
            <li> I was looking like crazy for a facial brush with natural soft bristles.</li>
            <li> For starters, this is too rough to be used on the face.</li>
            <li> Too rough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> If you use too much pressure &amp; brush for an extended period of time, it can be irritating to the skin.  </li>
            <li> They were rough</li>
            <li> Quality product that works as expected.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday in the shower, not too harsh on my face and I have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dry brushing with this facial brush works wonders at getting the oily residue off and I think my hard to see wrinkles are even harder to see now!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I thought I must ordered it wrong.  </li>
            <li> or Im not sure you&#x27;ll have the same results.</li>
            <li> I could never understand why people would spend $200 for a brush with a battery or needing to be constantly charged, when a manual brush would work just as well, if not better.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were way too sharp for my face; I felt like I was taking a piece of sandpaper to my skin.  </li>
            <li> only problem with it is that I have a small face</li>
            <li> Why shop any other way?</li>
            <li> So far, its worked nicely, not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I get so dirty that these brushes do a super job of cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> Initially this brush was VERY stiff.  </li>
            <li> You can wet it a little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too rough for me.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a little rough on my face.</li>
            <li> Brush may seem hard prior to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this Bass Brush based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use Bass brush for my skin care.  </li>
            <li> Come-on Bass ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands/styles from Amazon and elsewhere</li>
            <li> few other tips for breakouts and problematic combination skin</li>
            <li> Also this brush is hard not very soft, so it depends on what you like.</li>
            <li> This one is too rough and leaves my face raw.</li>
            <li> My pores are less clogged and my skin feels softer.</li>
            <li> My brush has an odd odor.</li>
            <li> But after about 2 weeks the wood started rotting, turning black, at the bristle line.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother-in-law, who had been using her previous brush for YEARS (decades).</li>
            <li> The handle snapped in half as I was scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> unit like some of the expensive facial brushes on the market.cial steamer as a present.  </li>
            <li> but the picture and description was for a black brush.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this face brush for about a year and a half now</li>
            <li> I noticed some other comments complaining that the brush was too stiff.</li>
            <li> I use it wet with my usual cleanser</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit course and stiff and if you&#x27;re not careful scrubbing, that can irritate your face (so don&#x27;t brush too hard!)</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to use it on my face, so I first tried it on my arm.  </li>
            <li> It fell apart in my hands with little pieces going all over bathtub.</li>
            <li> For anyone who has little bumps from having &amp;#34;congested skin,&amp;#34; try this brush before you spend your money or any creams or peels.</li>
            <li> The first use was a little unpleasant.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use too often and have to be careful not to press hard.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they haven&#x27;t softened enough and are still rough on my face.</li>
            <li> Part of the brush part broke after a few months, and then the handle snapped off after about a year.</li>
            <li> exfoliates dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> The product came cracked, while I believe in having a scrub I feel it is a touch to harsh.  </li>
            <li> The brush was TOO HARSH to be used for any part of the body.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be exfoliating dead skin cells away to let your skin breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a few uses for the bristles to soften.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this brush for heavy exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This was too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, but not abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Brush softens after a few days.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my face, had to stop using...</li>
            <li> I soak them in hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol diluted with water every few weeks or months or whenever I think of it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re messy to use at a sink</li>
            <li> Very rough and felt like I was using a cleaning brush on my skin!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are VERY rough!!</li>
            <li> Find a brush with a wooden handle, this one won&#x27;t last for very long :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really stiff</li>
            <li> and I do not find the bristles stiff at all.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t find this one overly stiff at all.</li>
            <li> They were stiff and felt plastic.</li>
            <li> not sure why some of the reviewers feel the bristles are harsh</li>
            <li> Prob not great for you in the long run but</li>
            <li> After using, my face feels raw and sore.  </li>
            <li> also has a weird &#x27;wet dog&#x27; odor when wet.</li>
            <li> Brissles are a little too stiff for delicate skin on the face.</li>
            <li> SMALL BUT WORKS</li>
            <li> Then it slipped out of my hand one morning and the brush head split the second it hit the counter, rendering it completely useless.  </li>
            <li> unit like some of the expensive facial brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> I am very hopeful that this practice will delay the development of &amp;#34;jowls&amp;#34; I am afraid that I inherited from my father!</li>
            <li> When I first used this I thought crap</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t press too hard agains tthe skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush is too hard on my face.</li>
            <li> Too hard for my face.</li>
            <li> Bass face brush !!!</li>
            <li> I use this at least 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li> It came in pink which I like, weirdly.</li>
            <li> Just as using a nail brush at least once a day results in stronger, healthier nails, this complexion brush produces noticeable results including reduced pore size in my T-zone area.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very hard and it&#x27;s not enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> Not a terribly good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> While you&#x27;d think a bristle brush would be very unpleasant, I found it actually fairly soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to weak</li>
            <li> I had been dry-brushing my body, but thought the bristles would be too tough for my face.</li>
            <li> -- I have not experienced the brush falling apart in any way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times and it hasn&#x27;t cracked or broken.</li>
            <li> I like a serious exfoliation!</li>
            <li> I am even doubtful if it can be used wet.</li>
            <li> Bristles feel tight in base.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T FIND THE NEED TO PURCHASE THE EXPENSIVE ELECTRIC ONES.  </li>
            <li> The brush bristles felt rigid, which made this uncomfortable to use on my face.</li>
            <li> This works as well an any of those expensive, plug in or battery operated brushes.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> Expensive and the picture showed 2 brushes</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower every day to keep the hairs from getting stuck under the surface and giving me ugly bumps.</li>
            <li> made me felt totally stupid.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> It made washing my face a terrible experience.</li>

            <li> The brushes seem a little soft for me...I use it daily. I don&#x27;t feel like I can see a huge difference in appearance.</li>
            <li> At first the brush is very stiff and rough,however after three uses it completely softens,great for exfoliating,i use coconut oil mixed with a peppermint tea bag that was dipped in hot milk.Tear the tea bag then add pure coconut oil mix then apply to face,leave on for 10 minutes then use the brush to scrub and remove dead skin and dirt.This is very effective..You can use any tea bad,i use peppermint because of the fresh minty feeling after..</li>
            <li> This is if my first facial brush (I was interested in a Clarisonic but read that facial brushes are just as good -- and cheaper, too!). It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I would have imagined... so the price was a little high for me, considering the size and the fact that you can get a full body brush for the same price. But I would totally buy it again, just because I love it so much! If you&#x27;re not used to brushing your face, then you definitely want to start easy, increasing pressure over the days. You also might want to break it in by using it on your hand first since the bristles are a little stiff to start. I love the way it makes my face feel now -- I use it just about every day!</li>
            <li> this was fabulous brush. i&#x27;ve used other types that are smaller, and bought something shaped like this from sephora. none of those compares to this. my skin is more clear, smooth, even tone. i think it is better than the clarisonic. don&#x27;t press too hard agains tthe skin. the size of the head of the brush is larger than the common ones you see on the market, making it efficiently being able to cover your face. i def recommend and will re-purchase (but seeing how durable this brush is, i feel like that will not be for awhile).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks or so, but mainly to help with some of the dry patches I was having on my chin. So far, its worked nicely, not too harsh. I use it wet with my usual cleanser and I do feel like I get a deeper clean. so until I can afford a clarisonic, this will do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush daily for about two weeks and I love how my face feels. My pores are less clogged and my skin feels softer.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and opted to try this instead of shelling out hundreds for the &amp;#34;sonic variety.&amp;#34;  GREAT move!  I&#x27;m VERY pleased with it and my skin is LOVING it!  I&#x27;ve started a whole dry brushing regimine, so I figured I&#x27;d include something for my face as well.  I don&#x27;t dry brush on my face, but I use this brush with my cleanser and REALLY love the way it exfoliates!</li>
            <li> I really like the job this brush does on my face. My face feels throughly refreshed after it&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;Although I am familiar with the brand, I never expected this product would be so effect.</li>
            <li> Well made brush. Inexpensive. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> works great, feels great, love it!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look and feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works great for its price and has a great handle with good structure. I use it wet and dry for shower and face washing. Great cleansing tool to have in the bathroom</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality facial brush I&#x27;d highly recommend. It looks and feels of good quality and the results after a face  cleanse is obvious it&#x27;s designed well for the task.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace a brush I am currently using and love. The bristles on this brush are too soft for my needs but thank you.</li>
            <li> Brush was not as coarse as I thought but it works. Also product was shipped on time.</li>
            <li> Great brush for facial scrubbing. I only wish I didn&#x27;t get a pink one!</li>
            <li> I  tryed many difrante face brushes none of them did good enough job to bay it again !!! Bass face brush !!! Love it !!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is perfect even for my sensitive skin. I have been using it for a while now and I love it. It does take a while to dry and the first time I tried it, it hurt my sensitive face a little bit but for the next use it was perfect.  I travel and take it everywhere with me. This brush is truly magical.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Provides a nice lather and facial scrub when used. Rinses well and no odor when dry! Let&#x27;s go!</li>
            <li> The natural bristles have a nice feel when washing your face.  The bristles don&#x27;t shed, the brush is easy to clean and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it pretty much every day in combination with my favorite soap (african black soap) on my face and since I have been using it I have noticed less blemishes. It really gives you that super clean feeling leaving your skin softer to the touch. It is gentle yet the bristles are firm enough to get things done. Before I had this brush I did not know what I was missing, but now I will probably use this product (or a similar product) for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Far too harsh on my skin (for cleansing or dry brushing), and it started shedding bristles during the first use.</li>
            <li> I like a serious exfoliation! But this can be used to clean the grout in my bathroom! Buy another brush, I&#x27;m now using it to scrub my shower. Very rough and felt like I was using a cleaning brush on my skin!! Plus the bristles fell out!</li>
            <li> Very nice facial brush. Using it for dry brushing currently, but from what I could see it would make an excellent wet wash brush as well. Handle is not wood which will protect it from molding, something I have experienced with EVERY wood handled brush ever bought and I live in a desert region.</li>
            <li> SMALL BUT WORKS WELL. DON&#x27;T FIND THE NEED TO PURCHASE THE EXPENSIVE ELECTRIC ONES.  MY FACE IS ONLY SO LARGE!</li>
            <li> I have been using complexion brushes for 50 years.  It is getting harder and harder to find them with a plastic rather than wood handle.  I found this one in Arizona and love it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It came very fast, it is attractive and a nice size. The quality seems good so far. The bristles are a bit course and stiff and if you&#x27;re not careful scrubbing, that can irritate your face (so don&#x27;t brush too hard!) But overall the brush is a reasonably priced item, and the seller provided swift and good service.</li>
            <li> Love these natural bristle facial brushes.  I haven&#x27;t seen them in a long time and I was glad that I found it.  My old one finally got to retire.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this brush based on many positive reviews, however, my package was received in a unacceptable condition.  It was ripped and the brush did not appear new at all.  The nerve of the seller to send me a product in such a way.  Will never order from them again!</li>
            <li> great service, will use again.....</li>
            <li> I didnt feel like risking loosing my clarisonic on a recent trip out of the country, so I brought this brush that I was gifted by a friend and I have to say it was great, not harsh but still effective. I wouldnt switch from using my clarisonic full time for this but I would definitely bring it again on a trip again and use this instead for a short period. It is very high quality and I love that it is natural bristles.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but would like it better if the handle wasn&#x27;t plastic.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush is too hard on my face. I threw away the package it was in so I can not take it back. Maybe my daughter can use the brush on her baby doll hair.</li>
            <li> I am very careful with my face - I don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals or scrub hard because I want to keep my skin looking as good as long as possible. I bought this brush on a whim, and I am not disappointed! I use it in the shower in the morning, and the bristles are so soft, yet do such a great job at exfoliating my face, making it feel wonderfully refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it never scratches. I just apply a little liquid facial soap to the brush and wet it, and then wash my entire face - even around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this purchase to anyone considering it!</li>
            <li> amazing product. I definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teenage sons for their acne.  They are great, but you DO have to rough up the brush the first time so it does not feel like sandpaper on your skin.  Once it is roughed up, it is a fabulous brush for deep cleaning.  I bought one for myself for travel so I do not have to cart around my Clairsonic on the road.</li>
            <li> I use this at least 4-5 times a week. It&#x27;s not too hard and not too soft. You may need to apply different levels of pressure depending on how sensitive your skin is any given day - mine changes. :)  I will likely buy one of these again.</li>
            <li> I bought it for $10 and it works just like the pro&#x27;s. I use it every other day with Walgreens brand oil free Daily face wash. This the best skin regimen that ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> The plastic disintegrated within3 weeks.  It fell apart in my hands with little pieces going all over bathtub. That was fun trying to pick up before it all went down the drain.</li>
            <li> I also have a clarisonic but I enjoy the face brush also.&lt;br /&gt;I can use it past the minute or two from the clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a nice product</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to replace my Mia 2 while traveling overseas - I wanted to find a cheap, lightweight option that would keep my skin looking clear and fresh. The brush bristles felt rigid, which made this uncomfortable to use on my face. I&#x27;m not someone with delicate skin, so this was surprising to me. It took a little longer to go through my skincare routine - if I applied too much pressure or went too quickly, it would irritate my skin and leave my cheeks/nose/etc. a little red. Although I would not re-purchase this item, I would explore similar brush options with softer bristles.</li>
            <li> If you desire a brush to better cleanse your face, BUY THIS FIRST. You have nothing to lose spending $10 on this brush. I was super bent on buying the Clarisonic brush (or similar) but wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d benefit from a brush at all so I opted to try this first. I no longer have ANY desire to buy the electronic brushes. None. This does everything I need it to do (especially at this price!). Eventually when I have an extra $150 saved up I MAY think about it. But honestly, I truly do not need an electric brush to suit my needs-- and you may not either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: I did not purchase my brush from Amazon. I bought a wooden Bass facial brush from my local grocery store. Whole foods and Giant Eagle Market District may carry it in your area. Additionally, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s organic soaps works fine with this and the brush will soften after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I love this complexion brush!  This is the first brush that wasn&#x27;t too hard to use on my face right away!</li>
            <li> Just the right brush for your face, not too harsh, but enough stiffness to feel like it is doing something.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This works as well an any of those expensive, plug in or battery operated brushes. I liked it so much that I saved the wrapper so I can find it again.Packaged well, No problems. Arrived on time. I did find that I only need to use it a couple times a week or it makes my face sensitive. I really love this brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles felt way to rough.  I thought to myself… “Oh no!  I should have ordered one of those brushes that people said were too soft.”  Now I love it.  When I first used it, I made the mistake using it before it had time to “warm” up and get completely wet.  I use it when I shower now and it works great.</li>
            <li> Bass Brushes is a quality product that is affordable and made of natural hair.  Face brushing not only stimulates the blood on your face bringing out its natural youthful glow, but it also detoxifies and exfoliates the rough outer surface of your skin.  I&#x27;m not much on grabbing tons of beauty products so the simplicity of the face brush is essential part of my daily regimen.  Throw out the drab array of over-priced facial washes and stick with the basics.  I normally dry brush and follow it with witch hazel toner and sometimes an all-natural moisterizer (if its a hot arid day.)  Plain and simple, but definitely effective.</li>
            <li> soft bristles, great for facial dry brushing, or I have used it in the shower too. Definitely not too coarse for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. At first it was (obviously) a bit harsh on my face but as the bristles broke in a bit, it became a nice addition to my morning routine. I massage my skin twice a day with/without a cleanser. It actually really makes my skin smoother. I have really dry skin and it began to come out with some rough patches and a generally sallow/dull skin tone. I also have a lot of red/purple spots from acne marks. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the evenness and color of my skin and it&#x27;s much, much smoother, even without lotion. It does a better job than any generic exfoliant (which is actually harsh on the skin). I think it&#x27;s a worthy investment because it lasts much longer than an exfoliating cleanser and does the same job :)</li>
            <li> This is a good natural bristle brush that lasts a long time (we just bought a pair to replace the ones we used for the last two years). The bristles are firm and can be hard on tender areas of skin at first. Great for scrubbing under a beard or mustache, though!</li>
            <li> Works really well at giving my face a thorough cleaning while gently exfoliating the skin. I&#x27;m a 28 y/o male with somewhat sensitive skin, and so far have had no problems with irritation during or after use. The bristles do a great job on their own, so light circular motions when washing. One of the best grooming products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This brush is so well made and effective. It is a pure pleasure to use. My skin looks more radiant. I have one that I use wet  and one that I use for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Brissles are a little too stiff for delicate skin on the face. After using, my face feels raw and sore.  Maybe better for the rest of the body, but don&#x27;t like on my face.</li>
            <li> Very soft for the face</li>
            <li> I love how this brush for my face!</li>
            <li> This product is harsh on your face when you first use it you have to soften the bristles. Soak this brush with water. and lots of it. Otherwise it got rid of my pimple on my chin. I love this so much and I do recommend it. Also, when you get yours, sniff it. My brush has an odd odor. It smells like a dog. I think that&#x27;s only my brush though.</li>
            <li> Nice facial brush, a bit abrasive at first but softens after several uses.  Handle is plastic so I am able to store in the shower without worrying about wood swelling.</li>
            <li> Great brush for face.  Bristles are perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a facial scrub with firm bristles. The size is just right. Very easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outdoors a lot, around horses, in a barn and hiking in the mountains.  I get so dirty that these brushes do a super job of cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this about six months ago after reading the reviews, which indicated that the bristles softened with use. Unfortunately, they haven&#x27;t softened enough and are still rough on my face. I occasionally use the brush on the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; areas that tend toward blackheads, but wish it was softer. Regardless, I have seen some benefit from its use.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Not too stiff - but not too soft so as not to get the job done. My skin is in love.</li>
            <li> i have overly dry skin often so I needed a brush hard enough to really clean deep. I&#x27;ve been using my body dry brush and I haven&#x27;t had a dry skin problem since. I tried this out last night and it works just as good. -1 star because the handle doesn&#x27;t have a loop to hang from anywhere.</li>
            <li> After I used it, my face broke out.  I generally have a very good complexion so it was really disheartening.  I guess I can use this to exfoliate something that is not my face, maybe my arms or legs or something.  It&#x27;s really stiff and I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it on my face again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t had one of these brushes long before now.  The theory is clear,  that we need to exfoliate the dead cells and stimulate for the new.  The brushing action feels wonderful and immediately produces a more clear skin tone. I will get a lot of use from this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is great, but the plastic handle is very poor quality. Part of the brush part broke after a few months, and then the handle snapped off after about a year. Shouldn&#x27;t these last longer? I might try the wooden handle, because I like the bush part so much.</li>
            <li> Good manual face brush; very good quality for $10 or so. Its sturdy, the bristles don&#x27;t shed and my face is squeaky clean after every use. Only drawback, no cap for it, but I can deal.</li>
            <li> Another product I just gift because there are so many people I know that do not wash their face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using your hands comes nowhere close to what this brush will do for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic handle is very sturdy and is not slippery.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I can say that it is shatter resistant is because my shower caddy decided it was a good day to product test.&lt;br /&gt;Not a scratch on it after a 5 foot fall on a tile floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are of high quality and keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to replace every X amount of months but after a second wash after washing my face, this brush is like new after 1 year of daily use.</li>
            <li> I have to say that for the first four months of using this brush I would agree with all the claims made in the 5 star reviews.  Then I started noticing the the bristles were gradually discoloring.  By the time about 1/3 of them had become brown, I stopped using  (after about only 4 months) because I  could no longer handle the aesthetics.  Threw out and replaced with another brush - also thru Amazon - don&#x27;t remember the brand (in set of two) - which had a wooden handle.  Cute as can be.  But after about 2 weeks the wood started rotting, turning black, at the bristle line.  Have just thrown those out.  To replace have just ordered a Shisheido.  Much more expensive.  But hopefully will do the job without rotting out.  That will make it worth the money.</li>
            <li> How long am I supposed to wait for this thing to soften up? Quality seems good and I do brush my face sometimes, not convinced that is even a good idea, maybe I need more guidance?</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother-in-law, who had been using her previous brush for YEARS (decades). So her initial impression was that it was rougher / less gentle than her old brush. I suspect she got accustomed to it though...</li>
            <li> Definitely gentle enough for adult first time skin brushing.</li>
            <li> Good product; well made; bristles are stiff atr first use but OK thereafter.  What I don&#x27;t like is that they just send you whatever color they want.  I would not have chosen pink and would like to have been allowed to choose.</li>
            <li> Love this item, very durable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It was exactly the combination of softness and stiff bristles that I was looking for, however I left my brush in the shower for use as needed and all of the bristles have begun to bend and fray. Disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I found the bristles to be too soft. Other reviews made it sound like they were. Will probably not use.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush.  I had an electric cleansing brush but it ended up breaking.  With this brush my facial cleaner suds right up and I feel like I&#x27;m getting a nice, deep clean.</li>
            <li> I use this facial brush in the shower every day and love it! You can wet it a little and it has a rougher feel or let the water soak in for a minute to make it softer. I use it with a foaming cleanser and it really helps exfoliate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this brush for several months and have not had any problems. It has even dropped lightly onto the floor a couple times and didn&#x27;t break. I&#x27;m sure if it was dropped hard, it would shatter the handle but I&#x27;m pretty careful and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> I like it, it is a little rough on the face but works good. It came fast. im pleased with this</li>
            <li> I used the Clarisonic Mia brush for about 1 year until it broke.  I decided to try this considerably cheaper brush and it&#x27;s great.  It gets your skin just as clean and feels better as well.  Realistically, how much can you really remove and do you really need yet another electronic device just to wash your face?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this brush for dry brushing my face, and it works beautifully. I&#x27;ve only been doing it for a couple weeks, and I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin improves over time! For now, I&#x27;m noticing smoother skin, and it seems to absorb moisturizers really well. I only use it 2x a week, but it still makes a great difference! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this so far. It seemed a little pricey but it works very well. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Too rough to use on my face but I will find another use for it.</li>
            <li> The benefits of dry brushing first thing in the morning are: energizing, refreshing, cleansing, revitalizing.  The bristles are soft enough for even my eyelids, and firm enough to help wake me up.  I highly recommend this as a dry brush!  This is a healthy habit I&#x27;ve been able to maintain for quite a while now.</li>
            <li> pretty abrasive.  can&#x27;t use too often and have to be careful not to press hard.  also has a weird &#x27;wet dog&#x27; odor when wet.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial brush, that makes my skin feel clean, and makes my pores look smaller and black head free!</li>
            <li> brush is pretty dense, has natural bristles with plastic body, which is perfect cause wooden body would&#x27;ve molded easily. works well with a cream/liquid cleanser. make sure to soften the bristles in hot water first and throughout brushing. apply cleanser on your face and what&#x27;s left in your palm on the brush. brush your face in circular motion toward the temples. with cleanser and hot water it is not scratchy. cleanses pores and makeup residue off so well. exfoliates dead skin cells. might be too rough for extremely sensitive skin. gives your skin that polished shiny smooth look. i&#x27;ve had it for months and it held up great (but I don&#x27;t keep it in the shower)</li>
            <li> Works perfect, bristles didn&#x27;t fall out, great value. I use it everyday and it is a good way to wash your face.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first, as I read some reviews of the bristles being too stiff and rough. I have very sensitive skin and I do not find the bristles stiff at all. I run the brush under very hot water for about 20 seconds before using it, and it&#x27;s fantastic. This brush has a larger bristle area than my previous facial brush, which I like. I was using a smaller nylon brush before, it lasted 2 years. I hope this one lasts a long time as well!</li>
            <li> The product came cracked, while I believe in having a scrub I feel it is a touch to harsh.  Even applying minimal pressure seemed to not make it more comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> best face brush out there!!!! love it!! it cleans my makeup with the cleanser i have !!! perfect!! worth the money!!!👍</li>
            <li> From the description and based on review, I purchased this facial cleansing brush.  The first time I used this product, I thought I must ordered it wrong.  The brush was TOO HARSH to be used for any part of the body.  I can&#x27;t imagine using it anywhere but to wash my bathtub....this is the honest truth.  When I reported this in the review of the seller for inaccuracy of the product, my review was removed.  So that will tell you a lot.</li>
            <li> The first use was a little unpleasant. I think my skin just wasn&#x27;t used to it and the brush has seemed to soften a bit, so hang in there. Now it&#x27;s great and I wouldn&#x27;t change it. Great service. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It works great except that the plastic material used in the handle is very fragile. I used one for about a month, it broke, I bought another and it broke after two days.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love this Bass Facial Brush. Feels great on face. Better than expensive brushes on market. Face remarkably clean showing great improvement on skin. Please Note: Brush may seem hard prior to use. Softens to perfection after first use.&lt;br /&gt;A must have for better skin.</li>
            <li> I love this face brush so much.  This has been the key to helping my skin clear up.  I got rid of all cleansers and soaps and scrubs. This is the perfect routine to save your skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) At morning or night when your face is dry, use in a circular motion all over face and neck&lt;br /&gt;2) Rinse with luke warm water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it seems too simple but this is all your skin needs as you won&#x27;t be stripping away natural oils and you&#x27;ll be exfoliating dead skin cells away to let your skin breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had acne for years and I believe that  using this along with getting rid of face makeup (this is the other most important part), soaps, lotions and anything other than this brush and water on my face has been the best remedy out there and I&#x27;ve tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love if this review helped others suffering from acne, dry, oily and very unbalanced skin.  This product works so well but don&#x27;t skip the step of ditching the makeup, soaps and lotions either or Im not sure you&#x27;ll have the same results.</li>
            <li> I really like this face brush. Yes, at first the bristles are fairly hard but after just a few uses, they soften significantly. It does give you such a deep clean and is great for exfoliating. I would take this over a $200-$300 face cleaning system any day of the week. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I really like it and after 6 months of daily use it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> I was so excited and happy about this brush for three showers. During the fourth time using it the acrylic snapped into three pieces. Find a brush with a wooden handle, this one won&#x27;t last for very long :(</li>
            <li> I was looking for facial cleansing brushes and this one had a great review, so I opted to try it out. This has helped so much and my skin is on the up and up since buying this.</li>
            <li> Great bristles on brush but handle broke easily.</li>
            <li> Love It!  Gentle on  the skin....it does the job. Bought three more for my daughters and they like it too.</li>
            <li> I was looking like crazy for a facial brush with natural soft bristles. This seemed legit so i got it. So far so good.. Bristles seems pretty attached and they are very gentle and do just the right scrubbing without stripping my face. I wouldve loved it if the handle was made of wood instead.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to buff off the extra skin. Rough at first but the bristles soften up. Love it</li>
            <li> Great brush for face &amp; body.</li>
            <li> Throw away this brush if you haven&#x27;t done so already. For starters, this is too rough to be used on the face. It is more like a shoe scrubber. I used this the first time and my face broke out into these huge, ugly boils. I thought I was doing something wrong, and tried again a couple of weeks later, this time being more gentle. Same effect. Now I have flung it in the trash bin.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. Its too coarse to be used as a facial brush. It made washing my face a terrible experience.</li>
            <li> This works well to gently exfoliate my face.  I love this brush!</li>
            <li> My daughters first had the sonic ones that I would use.  I ran across these and I liked that you can clean them better. They were amazed and loved them more than the sonic ones. When I used it the FIRST day, I had several people compliment me on my makeup, I mean over the top compliment. I said it&#x27;s the same mineral make up I have been using for years. After a few more days and people really noticing my face looking better, I realized the only thing I did different was clean my face with this brush. - I am ordering my own from Amazon, because the health store I bought the first ones have been out. *ALSO Bass makes the best wooden hair brush. My three daughters and my mother, beg me to brush their hair with only it. It feels AMAZING on the scalp. I agree! Thanks Amazon for your great prices, availability and awesome shipping.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought and shipped it to my 17 daughter who struggles with acne I think it will help and save her $</li>
            <li> Need to run the brush under hot warmer to get it to soften up enough to be used gently on one&#x27;s face......good product and recommended.</li>
            <li> This brush is lovely for a fresh brush up every day. Do it in the shower or dry. Peels of dead skin and gives a fresh glow.</li>
            <li> This brush is truly an investment, my skin feels so clean and vibrant.  You cant go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> It says on the package that if can be used wet or dry but I am only using it for dry brushing. I have had great results dry brushing my body with a very stiff Yerba Prima body brush so I don&#x27;t find this one overly stiff at all. To me it feels great and my face is so soft after only a few uses.  With all dry brushing you are supposed to use a very light touch, such as the smallest amount of force you would use to push a coin across a table with the brush. The more you do it, your skin will adjust and it won&#x27;t seem so rough. I am very hopeful that this practice will delay the development of &amp;#34;jowls&amp;#34; I am afraid that I inherited from my father! Also great to use on the neck, brushing upward, to prevent sagging skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for dry brushing your face. The bristles are soft but firm and the handle is perfect. My skin has never looked so clear, bright, and youthful. I would recomend this brush for anyone looking to try dry skin brushing on the face.</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT brush for dry brushing my face and neck! If I forget a day, my face definitely notices the difference! Dry brushing with this facial brush works wonders at getting the oily residue off and I think my hard to see wrinkles are even harder to see now! Highly recommended! Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll never NOT dry brush again!</li>
            <li> Too rough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> The bristles are VERY rough!! I&#x27;ve used facial cleansing brushes for a long time and these scrape my face.. i even soaked it in water the next night before my shower thinking they had to soften and they didnt.  I would not recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not get the brown one in the picture, i got a clear handle with off white bristles so maybe its a different model.  I&#x27;m not sure how this got so many stars again unless the vendor sent me a different model completely</li>
            <li> I have never used a facial brush before, but I am enjoying the feel of my skin after using this one! The bristles are gentle to the hand, but feel coarse on my face... it is great for exfoliation of dead skin! After using it, I put a night cream on, and my face is so smooth in the morning - I love it!</li>
            <li> This facial brush is the best I have ever used. It&#x27;s not real stiff so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re giving yourself a peel! My face feels so clean and fresh after I use it, way better than my hands. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Talk about clean.  I had another facial brush from Amazon with a clear handle that I think was 99 cents.  The handle snapped in half as I was scrubbing.  I bought this Bass Brush based on the reviews.  I have to say it&#x27;s fantastic.  You will definitely notice a difference.  The other brush&#x27;s bristles were too soft.  The Bass Brush bristles are a bit stiffer and definitely do a thorough cleaning!  If you think Clarisonic works, wait until you try this brush!</li>
            <li> This was fine at first, but after two weeks the bristles started falling out.  Then it slipped out of my hand one morning and the brush head split the second it hit the counter, rendering it completely useless.  This is not what I expect from a $13 product.  I&#x27;m going to look for something with a wooden handle in the hope of finding a brush that can last an entire month.</li>
            <li> I could never understand why people would spend $200 for a brush with a battery or needing to be constantly charged, when a manual brush would work just as well, if not better.  I purchased this brush, along with another brush, because I wasn&#x27;t sure which brush I would like.  I ended up liking both brushes, but I use this brush specifically for dry brushing my face &amp; neck.  It was slightly rough at first, so I took the advice of another review &amp; softened it up by using it on the back of my hand for about a week.  I have sensitive, combination skin, but had started having patches of dry skin, which was something new to me.  I had never heard of dry brushing, until I started searching beauty articles on how to solve my dry skin problem.  After reading several articles on it &amp; watching several videos on the proper way to dry brush, I decided to give it a try.  I just wish I had known about it years ago.  My friends have even noticed the difference &amp; have asked what I am doing differently with my skincare routine.  I gladly tell them about dry brushing with my Bass brush.  Many of them had never heard of dry brushing either.  I will continue to use Bass brush for my skin care.  Nice product &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have noticed several comments where users felt this brush was too rough &amp; irritating to their skin.  I wanted to post an update on how I use it without irritation.  It isn&#x27;t necessary to use a lot of pressure when using this brush.  If you use too much pressure &amp; brush for an extended period of time, it can be irritating to the skin.  Like I mentioned above, it is wise to soften the bristles before use on your face.  Once your bristles are broke in, you only have to use gentle brushing to exfoliate without irritation.  It only takes me a few minutes to dry brush &amp; I have had no problems with irritated skin.  I also had an opportunity to compare this brush against a new battery operated brush when my husband bought me a facial steamer as a present.  It came with a battery operated facial cleansing brush &amp; sponge attachment for moisturizer.  I loved the steamer, but hated the battery operated brush because it was just too soft to effectively deep clean &amp; my face just didn&#x27;t feel as clean as with my Bass brush.  Not only do I save money using a manual brush, I also don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing batteries or worrying  whether I have a &amp;#34;fully charged&amp;#34; unit like some of the expensive facial brushes on the market.cial steamer as a present.

            <li> The world is getting to be a place where one has to read the fine print for fear of being deceived. The brush itself IS good BUT the ad says BRUSHES AND shows multiple brushes. I feel that this was done deliberately and this kind of thing always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. If you are ONLY selling ONE Brush, then show one brush, be honest.</li>
            <li> While gentle exfoliation is great, these bristles feel far too abrasive on my face. Over time, they get a bit softer, but still not enough to exfoliate without irritation. I prefer cleansing grains to this brush.</li>
            <li> the brush itself it great. but the picture and description was for a black brush.....i received a hot pink brush. really</li>
            <li> This face brush is such great quality! Firm, but helps to really clean your face, leaving it soft! Best one I&#x27;ve tried so far..</li>
            <li> Love this simple, yet effective, skin care product.</li>
            <li> As I read other reviews on this Brush I needed to try it on my face and have found it to be quite an amazing brush that is gentle enough, but firm enough to cleanse my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I used this about 3 times before I decided that it was doing my damage to my face than good. It&#x27;s a little too rough for me. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it on my feet.</li>
            <li> THE BEST FACIAL BRUSH YET</li>
            <li> Initially this brush was VERY stiff.  I was a little afraid to use it on my face, so I first tried it on my arm.  After a couple of uses, the bristles began to soften up enough to us it on my face.  Since then, I have been able to use it regularly when washing my face and neck.  This brush really exfolliates well.  Love that!</li>
            <li> Cleaned my face well. Also this brush is hard not very soft, so it depends on what you like. I like either soft or hard so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I wanted a soft bristle brush for my face. This one is too rough and leaves my face raw. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Great brush and alternative to the highly priced Clarisonic and other mechanical brushes. Keeps my face clean and soft and clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li> The people that have given this a 5 star rating must have skin of steel!  The bristles were way too sharp for my face; I felt like I was taking a piece of sandpaper to my skin.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and this is fine on my hands/arms/etc, but there is no way I can use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Too hard for my face.</li>
            <li> I really like the Bass brush. It takes a few uses for the bristles to soften.</li>
            <li> Firm as all-get-out but very effective in exfoliating away dry skin around the nose and chin, provided you use circular strokes (recommended). I use it primarily for dry brushing once daily as my cleanser is no joke and am very pleased with it. I used the brush from Sephora which seemed a lot softer and less effective (as I needed to use it wet). That brush was also harder to keep clean, either because of the design or wet use, but the bristles often got musty. The bristles on this brush do not. I much prefer the density and texture of these bristles, too. If you&#x27;re aren&#x27;t going to bother with a Clarisonic I&#x27;d recommend this brush for heavy exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This was too harsh for me. I tried both dry and wet brushing my face with it. I am even doubtful if it can be used wet. Anyway did not work for me. However I have begun to use it on hands and feet which works well</li>
            <li> This dry skin brush works well and exfoliates my skin. I use a spa regularly for pain which dries my skin out and this makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower, its very effective. Exfoliates my skin and leaves my face soft. Super awesome and a good price. Happy customer;)</li>
            <li> This facial brush might not be great for those with sensitive skin. It does exfoliate but I often find that after using it my face has dry patches where it wouldn&#x27;t normally have them. I usually counteract this by using a ton of cleanser, using gentle pressure, and only using it every other day...plus I do a good job with moisturizer. No exfoliation equals flakiness but too much roughness on the skin causes the same problem so I think those with sensitive/dry skin would be better off using a less harsh brush.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean after using my new Bass facial brush. I may have to order another brush for my overnight bag.</li>
            <li> This brush feels great on my skin.  It is well priced and does just what it says it does.  I may get another</li>
            <li> I find this to be a little rough on my face. The bristles are very hard and it&#x27;s not enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t express how much this brush has helped the texture of my skin… Have used it vigorously for many months now and i can say i haven&#x27;t seen more than 2 single hairs come out of the brush. literally. best face brush ever.  and to be honest i think this works WAY better than clarisonic or other electric facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> Great for scrubbing my face!</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a natural sponge, rather than a facial brush.  A sponge seems to clean out the pores on my face better and gives my skin an allover glow, which i love!</li>
            <li> Works nice and isn&#x27;t to rough.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Love this brush!!!! Hopefully the price won&#x27;t creep up too high though!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  The bristles are firm, but not abrasive.  The head of the brush is very large.  It is durable and well-made. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> At first this brush was WAY to rough for my face. I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin and my last brush was super soft. But I stuck with this brush and within a couple weeks I found that I liked it better. I think now that my last brush was too soft. It didn&#x27;t exfoliate as well as this one does...plus I think it softened up a bit. Now that it&#x27;s summer, I especially like having this one around for better cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with it is that I have a small face and it&#x27;s a bit big (I&#x27;m 29 and short and still wear kids sized glasses). My last brush had a smaller head which I found easier for scrubbing all areas of my face, especially around my nose.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for dry brushing.  It&#x27;s bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff, and for me, they are a perfect texture.</li>
            <li> At first I considered it to small however being small helps to limit its intended use to the face and ears as you then go to a lrger brush for the rest.</li>
            <li> Last time i bought this for only $4/1brush.This time when i looked on the pictures i saw 3 brushes for $9 made me thought i got a better deal.Just got the package and only 1 brush in there made me felt totally stupid.I&#x27;m about to buy more for my family as a gift but i guess  this will be me last time ever....ever....</li>
            <li> I normally use a Clairsonic brush, but I had to go on a long trip so I decided to try out this brush instead. Overall it was a great alternative. The bristles weren&#x27;t too soft, and they did a good job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I lost my Olay ProX battery-powered brush and didn&#x27;t want to spend another $25 to replace it - I have to say though, this product works just as well! My battery-powered brush was water-resistant, not water proof, so I was hesitant to use it in the shower. I prefer using the manual brush to clean my face and body, plus I know it will last long! For the price this can&#x27;t be beat, I really don&#x27;t see the need to spend more unless you need the luxury of a Clarisonic or something. Makes my face feel so smooth for a fraction of the price of the electric brushes.</li>
            <li> Enough \\&quot;dermabrasion\\&quot; for those of us who like a vigorous complexion cleansing.  The handle is not made of cheap wood, as is the case with most natural bristle brushes.  Medium handle length--look elsewhere if your preference is for a long (or short) handle.  The bristles appear to be of a high enough quality to last for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this brush is too rough for me- would often leave my face irritated for hours so I switched for a softer one.</li>
            <li> Love this natural fiber brush!  I have purchased other Bass natural fiber brushes with wooden handles but I like this one much better.  It dries faster and the bristles are a bit shorter on this brush which make it sturdier.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Bristles are very coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Way too coarse and scratchy for the face.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a foot brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, my skin looks and feels so much better. I don&#x27;t press too hard, just a little light pressure works great. I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a battery operated one.</li>
            <li> This brush does what it says it&#x27;ll do. Not too abrasive, holds up well so far (1 month). I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size and bristle firmness for the face. I use it every morning and I can already see my pores becoming smaller after only a week of use. Pleasantly surprised because I was skeptical that this whole dry brushing thing actually worked!</li>
            <li> great brush! I really like it.</li>
            <li> I noticed some other comments complaining that the brush was too stiff. If used dry, this is the case. I have found that wetting the bristles first and then swirling it around on the palm of my hand softens them up sufficiently to then use on my face with the product of my choice. I use this brush with both a facial scrub and the coconut oil that I use to wash my face, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. My skin is very smooth and I almost never break out. I&#x27;m not going to attribute all of that to the brush since I drink a lot of water, eat a health diet, and moisturize regularly, but I think the brush helps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good brush for the face or any other part you dare use it for. I&#x27;m a man so I use it for washing my face and exfoliating before shaving. I don&#x27;t find the bristles to be too stiff, especially after a soak in warm water; I&#x27;ll even use it dry sometimes.  It came in pink which I like, weirdly. Drawbacks? I think the natural bristles absorb some of the soap or cleanser used so after a while it might get smelly. I don&#x27;t remember this happening with synthetic brush but a simple cleaning every once in a while should do the trick.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> While you&#x27;d think a bristle brush would be very unpleasant, I found it actually fairly soft. Sure, it&#x27;s a bit abrasive, but it&#x27;s certainly not harsh. I paired it with a foaming castile soap, and my face has never been smoother or clearer.</li>
            <li> i love this! my face feels so soft and smooth after using this, good buy.  I use it about every other day, my face absorbs moisturizer so much better</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt smoother or softer! Using this has been better than my Clarisonic brush actually, shocker but true.</li>
            <li> Mine came from Swanson and took almost 2 weeks to arrive. Brush seems ok, clear plastic handle on mine. Bristles feel tight in base. Made in China.</li>
            <li> My complexion really looks great, my pores are much smaller and my complexion is clear.  This is a high quality facial brush.</li>
            <li> FAST shipping &amp; GREAT price!  A+++</li>
            <li> Good quality.  I think it is soft enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best facial brush I have used. It is gentle on my skin, yet leaves me with a hue of pink on my cheeks, detailing that it&#x27;s thoroughly cleaned my skin&#x27;s surface. I used it with Pure Seafoam Facial Cleanser to get a deep clean and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush about two months ago, and I think it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my face. I had been dry-brushing my body, but thought the bristles would be too tough for my face. With this brush, that&#x27;s not the case. After I brush, my skin has an even tone and smooth appearance. I think it&#x27;s also prevented some of the acne I normally have on my chin before my cycle. For anyone who has little bumps from having &amp;#34;congested skin,&amp;#34; try this brush before you spend your money or any creams or peels. It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for my face.  Good quality.  I&#x27;m using it to dry brush my face occasionally when I don&#x27;t have scrub but also use it to cleanse my face using my facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> These brushes are for granddaughters and they do not actually have them as yet.  However, I have used these brushes prior and they are wonderful.  Thanks much.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this facial brush I was a bit apprehensive.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if the bristles would be too rough for my sometimes sensitive skin. The things that I really like about this brush is that the handle is high quality plastic (it is easy to clean and dry) and the bristles are not synthetic, they exfoliate very well and are not too rough on the skin. You should rub the bristles on the back of your hand just to soften them at first.  After a few weeks of using the brush twice a week it is still in good shape. I highly recommend to those with blackheads because within one time of using this brush mine were all gone! I didn&#x27;t use the brush for a week and they did come back, so just use the brush on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> I used to dry brush in high school and college and decided to return to the ancient practice for healthier-looking skin but also to release and help my lymphatic system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why some of the reviewers feel the bristles are harsh; unless you&#x27;re brushing too hard, it&#x27;s a nice soft but gently firm brush. I use this in the a.m. before my morning shower. It invigorates my skin and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement. Because I avoid alcohol, use sunscreen, and do not smoke, I feel my skin looks pretty good, so I was just enhancing some tried-and-true techniques, such as brushing, to ensure it holds its luster.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the face. My skin has totally become softer after dry brushing. Follow up with seaweed mask and the results have been amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face brush for about a year and a half now and I love it! I replace the brush about every 2 to 3 months for hygiene reasons only -- I have not experienced the brush falling apart in any way. I used to use a buff puff to wash my face and decided to give this brush a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did! It cleans well without allowing me to over scrub. I definitely plan to continue using this face brush, and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> A little stiff at first but then the bristles get to soften up after being in contact with warm water for a minute or so.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush. Perfect for dry skin brushing face &amp; neck!</li>
            <li> These brushes are an effective cost saving means of exfoliating on a daily basis.  Each day you shower you are able to affordably and thoroughly clean your entire body.</li>
            <li> What makes this brush exceptional are the bristles. Not only is the surface area larger than most brushes, but the bristles are thin and stiff enough to really clean those pores, remove all makeup and stimulate circulation.  I use this in the shower at night with Dove soap, and have yet to find anything better! My skin is healthier using this complexion brush, and find that I no longer need to use toner to remove residual makeup that I thought I had removed. Just as using a nail brush at least once a day results in stronger, healthier nails, this complexion brush produces noticeable results including reduced pore size in my T-zone area.  I have used complexion brushes for decades and this one  is better and cheaper than those fancy battery powered brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve used. It really works with whatever soap I use on my face and scrubs away the grime and dirt and my face feels very very smooth! Sometimes my skin is more sensitive to the bristles than others... So I mean, if you&#x27;re too sensitive to it just don&#x27;t scrub/press as hard lol. Boom. Magic.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely impressed with this product. Was going to buy a clarisonic but don&#x27;t think I am going to after buying this. Leaves my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Male user here. I&#x27;ve been through several of these brushes. I use the brush daily with a face scrub for exfoliation in the shower before or after shaving. Each has easily lasted me over a year before losing enough bristles to warrant a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the bristles are stiff enough to get the job done but not too stiff to irritate my sensitive skin (I wet the bristles with warm water a couple minutes before using to soften them up a bit). I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands/styles from Amazon and elsewhere but this Bass brush is the perfect size and bristle stiffness for me. The wooden version would be my fall-back if I couldn&#x27;t get this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem: It doesn&#x27;t have a hole in the handle with which to hang it on a hook. Come-on Bass ... no handle hole to hang on a hook?! One star off for that. So I have to drill my own 1/4\\&quot; hook hole in the handle to hang it. I&#x27;ve been lucky so-far and managed to get it done each time without the acrylic handle cracking/shattering.</li>
            <li> perfect for brushing grandbaby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It was a little rough at first. Brush softens after a few days. It helps with my acne. I also spray it with alcohol often after uses.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and began using this for a &#x27;deeper&#x27; clean. It irritated my skin, instead, and cause me to break out. BUT I really do have problem skin. If you have a tougher face then it will probably work wonderfully. I did, however, keep it to exfoliate my bikini area. You know - you shave and break out and get ingrown hairs. I use this in the shower every day to keep the hairs from getting stuck under the surface and giving me ugly bumps. It&#x27;s awesome for that, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these for my teen aged sons (17 &amp; 14). They both love them, and the difference in their skin is evident after only 2 days of use. My older son actually commented on it and thanked me. If you are a mom of boys, you know how amazing that really is.</li>
            <li> When I first used this I thought crap these are plastic bristles. They were stiff and felt plastic. They were rough and I figured I would have to get another brush because it hurt that much. I let it air dry over night and the next morning I went to move it and felt the bristles. Low and behold they had softened up and became more pliable. I now love this brush and use it in the shower daily. If it dries out too much I just let the water soak in for a bit before using it again.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my face, had to stop using...</li>
            <li> Kinda too soft when it gets wet. Not a terribly good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday in the shower, not too harsh on my face and I have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this tool!!! I did a lot of research reading reviews on different blogs and on amazon of the electric brushes and came to the conclusion that the good ones were way overpriced and the not-so-good ones weren&#x27;t worth it either without trying a manual brush first. It seems a lot of the others on amazon that have natural bristles also tend to be flimsy, too harsh, and/or lose their bristles quickly. I&#x27;ve been using this one almost two weeks now and am extremely satisfied with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: So it&#x27;s been about a year and I still have the two brushes I ordered back when I first wrote this. I love them! No problems with bristles falling out. I soak them in hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol diluted with water every few weeks or months or whenever I think of it. They&#x27;re messy to use at a sink so I only use them in the shower. Really great product - seems to exfoliate just fine and has led me to believe those electric brushes are just an expensive gimmick (granted, I&#x27;ve never used one). It did take a week or so to \\&quot;break in\\&quot; - the bristles were a bit tough at first but just be gentle with your face for awhile and don&#x27;t scrub too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other tips for breakouts and problematic combination skin I&#x27;ve discovered in the last year (for those of you who have nothing better to do than read on):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 BEWARE OF BIRTH CONTROL They prescribe it sometimes to help with acne but I had no idea until recently that it was the main source of my skin problems - an extremely unacceptable side-effect IMO (along with hair loss and weight gain - never putting progesterone in my body again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 Using a portable tanning light on my face every few days for just 30 seconds to a min has really helped my skin! Prob not great for you in the long run but vanity wins out in this case. I really notice a difference when I skip it for several days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 100% Pure&#x27;s \\&quot;Seafoam Lavender\\&quot; facewash is all natural and just all-around good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Switching from conventional (even though they were \\&quot;natural\\&quot;) moisturizers may have been one of my best decisions ever. I dilute tea tree essential oils (make sure it&#x27;s the good stuff - there are a lot of cheap oils out there) with coconut, grapeseed, sweet almond or jojoba oil - olive oil might even work - and use that on my face before bed - I wake up soft and not greasy at all! Look into essential oils, seriously - good for so many things!around good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Switching from conventional (even though they were \\&quot;natural\\&quot;) moisturizers may have been one of my best decisions ever.

            <li> Not enough strength in the bristles! It&#x27;s to weak and I don&#x27;t feel that it helped at all;( I just bought Tanya zavastas dry skin brush for the face a few weeks ago and it really made a difference for me!! This is for beginners who can&#x27;t tolerate much pain or pressure!!</li>
            <li> Expensive and the picture showed 2 brushes&lt;br /&gt;But the product is fine</li>
            <li> Excellent for cleaning your face with my mary kay products.  Will buy again.. fast shipper.  Love it and will reorder again</li>
            <li> Quality product that works as expected.</li>
            <li> The bristles of this brush are perfect for getting my face clean and clear of debris.  Getting those dead skin particles off the face help to open pores and really get down and deep clean.  Brushing my face while I soap it up in the shower is my way of waking up in the morning, and my face feels really clean and ready for my Ambi moisturizing cream.  I love the brush and have notice improved complexion since switching from a less effective brush about 2 weeks ago.  This brand will be in my shower hereon in, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition:  I enjoy shopping on Amazon for the savings it offers me as a \\&quot;Prime Member,\\&quot; the savings on shipping, and on gas (from having to drive to town to shop).  The savings make up for any price difference.  Why shop any other way?</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  Not as rough as my body brush, but enough to set my skin tingling a little.  Exfoliates nicely without drying skin out like other methods and works well with my current face-washing routine.  So glad it&#x27;s available through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s not too soft, not too hard. Seems as if the bristles will keep their strength over time. It exfoliates well. I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times and it hasn&#x27;t cracked or broken. I&#x27;ll update the review, if necessary.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush.  It&#x27;s a bit on the large side (about 1.75 inches diameter brush head) but the bristles feel firm enough to remove dirt and oil but soft enough for everyday use.  The brush has an overall high quality feel to it and I foresee lots of use out of it.</li>
