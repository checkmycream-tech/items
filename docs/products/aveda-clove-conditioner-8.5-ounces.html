            <li>It is a fabulous product and restored my beautiful color.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the result!</li>
            <li>I use this once a week and it gives my hair a beautiful rich brown color that I always get plenty of comments on.</li>
            <li>Aveda Clove Conditionenr effectively masked my blondish highlights to match my brown roots, without having to dye my hair.  </li>
            <li>Adds warm highlights to brown hair with a silky finish.</li>
            <li>and I can do my own hair\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While this product can stain your hands/shower if you&#x27;re not careful, it works great for me!  </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to comb it all the way through your hair while it&#x27;s soaking in.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to color my hair, but wanted to get rid of the brassiness and turn it more of a brown.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>And it makes my hair appear more brown.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it will let me extend the time between salon colorings.</li>
            <li>though ok here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased Aveda hasn&#x27;t changed the formula one bit in those years either.</li>
            <li>repeated this once more the day after</li>
            <li>After shampooing, I mix the Aveda clove with Biolage conditioner and add a touch of Aveda madderroot conditioner and get the most beautiful and natural color!  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!!</li>
            <li>It easily adds 6 weeks to the duration of my color.  </li>
            <li>Will stain easily so beware but has never caused me a problem to the extent I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>I loved the product but the price was too high.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been such a pleasant surprise that I still have this nice rich brunette shade.</li>

            <li>I have fine brunette hair, with a smattering of grays.  </li>
            <li>And a really nice bonus is this conditioner contains a lot of healthy all natural ingredients AND is animal-friendly!</li>

            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>you get from cheap &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It covered my blonde highlights, and I was happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how good it made my hair look and feel.  </li>
            <li>It is silky, shiny, and a nice, rich shade of medium brown - better than my natural color before it started to show any gray.  </li>
            <li>Its drying, but if you use a high end conditioner with this then it will work out nicely.</li>
            <li>what I what I originally wanted.......</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I makes your hair shiny and a rich brown.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, worth the money, and hasn&#x27;t stirred up my skin allergies.</li>
            <li>Was surprised it was more of a color conditioner, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>aveda leaves your hair soft and glossy.the color is amazing.</li>
            <li>I also rinses out slowly over time- as it does it leaves my hair with wonderful highlights.</li>
            <li>Keeps your color extremely fresh and extremely rich.</li>
            <li>Smells a little like cloves, which I love that smell, so it is good for me.  </li>
            <li>A quick rub gets it off before it dries.</li>
            <li>It could stain, and quickly.</li>
            <li>I spend quite a bit of my day outdoors, don&#x27;t like hats, so my color job on my hair always fades quickly and my hair turns blondish.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great of you mess up your hair color and have to wait a while to die it again.</li>
            <li>Now I use this conditioner everyday and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>I have red hair, and this makes my hair a nice shade of darker auburn.  </li>
            <li>hair turned out far too light than I had anticipated!</li>
            <li>I did keep the product because I needed it right away, but I paid about $10 more than I should&#x27;ve and would not waste the money again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try right?</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the extra $ to have a product that delivers such beautiful results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does leave a bit of a stain in my shower but a weekly once over takes it right out.</li>
            <li>good with my dark hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To start off it is a very intense brown.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but this product is not heavy</li>
            <li>My hair feels a bit stripped after the shampoo (and it rinses out some of the previous color deposit), but after conditioning my hair is super soft and silky, with amazing shine!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gets any better than that!healthy looking and still basically maintains the same depth of color as it had 2 months ago!    </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take the gray out, but it sure does add the brown tones back in.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to use it as a daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So glad to finally find a product that works.</li>
            <li>I bought (for the first time in my life)</li>
            <li>I cannot speak highly enough of this product--it does the job, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>2 months later my hair is STILL a rich chocolate brown!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it will work when my whole head of hair turns truly gray, but I&#x27;m certainly going to keep using it to find out!  </li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair that has always tended to get light quite easily in the sun and wind.</li>
            <li>I love how it adds rich color back to my ends especially, and gets rid of that brassy look from the summer sun.  </li>
            <li>, it makes my hair super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>After only using it twice, I have seen a huge change in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Bottle is huge, so Ii put it in a smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li>Although this is a conditioner, I can&#x27;t really say much for it&#x27;s moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>This conditioner did not do much conditioning nor color enhancing.</li>
            <li>It sounds like a lot of work, but really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>it helped so much.</li>
            <li>I had damaged hair so this was very nourishing, just what my hair needed.</li>
            <li>The seller delivered the product on time and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>and I am now absolutely happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely</li>
            <li>I leave the conditioner on for about 5 minutes (the first time I used it, I left it on for 20min, fyi) before a quick rinse.</li>
            <li>I need a really rich intense conditioner to replenish loss of moisture and softness in my hair and this does only a so-so job.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more expensive than most other conditioners, and I have to use slightly more than usual to get adequate conditioning, but I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>Despite using sulfate free shampoos, my hair lightens and reddens long before it&#x27;s time to color again.  </li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s a medium brown color with slight reddish highlights and I love</li>
            <li>My roots ended up a totally different color than the rest of my hair and were a brassy orange rather than the milky natural light brown</li>
            <li>If you have brunette hair this may be a good one for you, a little flat in color</li>
            <li>As a working mom of 3, I need to be able to get from shower to minivan in as little as 30 minutes some days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the great reviews, I was still a bit skeptical about using it on my hair and if it would work.</li>
            <li>What I usually do is after shampooing, I slather the Clove conditioner all over my hair being sure to work it in really well</li>
            <li>The red faded (usually pretty fast) and I&#x27;ve got about 2 inches of roots that are not too noticeable.  </li>
            <li>put it on dry hair (absorbs colour more) and left for 20mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to my new Holy Grail of Hair</li>
            <li>Even if it didn&#x27;t tone down the grays it would have been nice to at least enjoy it as a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair slightly textured, with super volume, and keeps its original deep brown shiny color without the salon.  </li>
            <li>My stylist used a demi-permenant glaze (only supposed to last 16-20 shampoos) and warned me since it was my first time having my hair dyed a darker shade and especially because my hair is so poreous, I would most likely have to have my hair dyed again in around 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I usually put it in before using my body wash, because then you&#x27;re able to wash the color off your hands.  </li>
            <li>I dont use it every day, more like every other or every third day.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it may leave spots in the tub and turn your fingernails a bit brown, but if you give a quick scrub with soap and a nail brush, it&#x27;s really not a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally medium brown hair that gets dull in certain light.</li>
            <li>tough I used this product for a somewhat unconventional reason, I think it is amazing</li>
            <li>This covers enough of the gray to get by a little longer without going to the salon for more color.</li>
            <li>I use a very generous amount and after 2 months I still have 1/4 tube left.</li>
            <li>I use a very generous amount and after 2 months I still have 1/4 tube left.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered mine directly from Aveda&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>I have my hair professionally colored and then use Biolage shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have brown hair naturally.</li>
            <li>I have a 6 week old relaxer in my hair, it needs to be done.</li>
            <li>the color looks professional, it covered the gray hairs and</li>
            <li>All natural product from aveda</li>
            <li>I discovered this product in the early 1990s and it&#x27;s been a staple in my shower ever since.</li>
            <li>has stayed brown for 3 weeks now and is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Then I just rinse and style as usual and my hair comes out shiny and healthy looking and still basically maintains the same depth of color as it had 2 months</li>
            <li>But when summer came around my roots became very noticeable because my hair gets really light from the sun, but the hair that I had dyed previously stayed dark brown.  </li>
            <li>I recently went to a new salon on a Groupon (ugh) and decided to just get all over color and a trim...</li>
            <li>It kept washing out and leaving my hair a dull almost greenish light brown.</li>
            <li>Months ago I had it professional colored (w/ Aveda color) to a lighter red color.  </li>
            <li>It may not cover completely but definitely helps!</li>
            <li>I use this product every time I wash my hair with my normal shampoo and conditioner and only just started my second bottle after almost 5 months.</li>
            <li>No odd smell from deep color.</li>
            <li>It took my hair from dull to rich and shiny.</li>
            <li>The color is rich and doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes or skin - but it will stain the shower stall if you leave it on, so I just keep it carefully in my hand and try not to make a mess.</li>
            <li>When my auburn hair color inevitably gets brassy, this really helps to tone it down.</li>
            <li>I let it sit for a couple of minutes, then I apply my usual deep conditioner right over it and let everything sit on my hair for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>If my hair color becomes too red as a result of this, I sometimes run Aveda&#x27;s Black Malva through it to cool down the color.</li>
            <li>I really like that you can use a little at a time and still see the difference.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gets any better than that!healthy looking and still basically maintains the same depth of color as it had 2 months ago!    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take the gray out, but it sure does add the brown tones back in.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to use it as a daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So glad to finally find a product that works.</li>
            <li> I bought (for the first time in my life)</li>
            <li> I cannot speak highly enough of this product--it does the job, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> 2 months later my hair is STILL a rich chocolate brown!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it will work when my whole head of hair turns truly gray, but I&#x27;m certainly going to keep using it to find out!  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that has always tended to get light quite easily in the sun and wind.</li>
            <li> I love how it adds rich color back to my ends especially, and gets rid of that brassy look from the summer sun.  </li>
            <li> , it makes my hair super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> After only using it twice, I have seen a huge change in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is huge, so Ii put it in a smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li> Although this is a conditioner, I can&#x27;t really say much for it&#x27;s moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> This conditioner did not do much conditioning nor color enhancing.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a lot of work, but really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> it helped so much.</li>
            <li> I had damaged hair so this was very nourishing, just what my hair needed.</li>
            <li> The seller delivered the product on time and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> and I am now absolutely happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely</li>
            <li> I leave the conditioner on for about 5 minutes (the first time I used it, I left it on for 20min, fyi) before a quick rinse.</li>
            <li> I need a really rich intense conditioner to replenish loss of moisture and softness in my hair and this does only a so-so job.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more expensive than most other conditioners, and I have to use slightly more than usual to get adequate conditioning, but I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Despite using sulfate free shampoos, my hair lightens and reddens long before it&#x27;s time to color again.  </li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s a medium brown color with slight reddish highlights and I love</li>
            <li> My roots ended up a totally different color than the rest of my hair and were a brassy orange rather than the milky natural light brown</li>
            <li> If you have brunette hair this may be a good one for you, a little flat in color</li>
            <li> As a working mom of 3, I need to be able to get from shower to minivan in as little as 30 minutes some days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews, I was still a bit skeptical about using it on my hair and if it would work.</li>
            <li> What I usually do is after shampooing, I slather the Clove conditioner all over my hair being sure to work it in really well</li>
            <li> The red faded (usually pretty fast) and I&#x27;ve got about 2 inches of roots that are not too noticeable.  </li>
            <li> put it on dry hair (absorbs colour more) and left for 20mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to my new Holy Grail of Hair</li>
            <li> Even if it didn&#x27;t tone down the grays it would have been nice to at least enjoy it as a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair slightly textured, with super volume, and keeps its original deep brown shiny color without the salon.  </li>
            <li> My stylist used a demi-permenant glaze (only supposed to last 16-20 shampoos) and warned me since it was my first time having my hair dyed a darker shade and especially because my hair is so poreous, I would most likely have to have my hair dyed again in around 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I usually put it in before using my body wash, because then you&#x27;re able to wash the color off your hands.  </li>
            <li> I dont use it every day, more like every other or every third day.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it may leave spots in the tub and turn your fingernails a bit brown, but if you give a quick scrub with soap and a nail brush, it&#x27;s really not a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium brown hair that gets dull in certain light.</li>
            <li> tough I used this product for a somewhat unconventional reason, I think it is amazing</li>
            <li> This covers enough of the gray to get by a little longer without going to the salon for more color.</li>
            <li> I use a very generous amount and after 2 months I still have 1/4 tube left.</li>
            <li> I use a very generous amount and after 2 months I still have 1/4 tube left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered mine directly from Aveda&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I have my hair professionally colored and then use Biolage shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have brown hair naturally.</li>
            <li> I have a 6 week old relaxer in my hair, it needs to be done.</li>
            <li> the color looks professional, it covered the gray hairs and</li>
            <li> All natural product from aveda</li>
            <li> I discovered this product in the early 1990s and it&#x27;s been a staple in my shower ever since.</li>
            <li> has stayed brown for 3 weeks now and is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Then I just rinse and style as usual and my hair comes out shiny and healthy looking and still basically maintains the same depth of color as it had 2 months</li>
            <li> But when summer came around my roots became very noticeable because my hair gets really light from the sun, but the hair that I had dyed previously stayed dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I recently went to a new salon on a Groupon (ugh) and decided to just get all over color and a trim...</li>
            <li> It kept washing out and leaving my hair a dull almost greenish light brown.</li>
            <li> Months ago I had it professional colored (w/ Aveda color) to a lighter red color.  </li>
            <li> It may not cover completely but definitely helps!</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair with my normal shampoo and conditioner and only just started my second bottle after almost 5 months.</li>
            <li> No odd smell from deep color.</li>
            <li> It took my hair from dull to rich and shiny.</li>
            <li> The color is rich and doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes or skin - but it will stain the shower stall if you leave it on, so I just keep it carefully in my hand and try not to make a mess.</li>
            <li> When my auburn hair color inevitably gets brassy, this really helps to tone it down.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for a couple of minutes, then I apply my usual deep conditioner right over it and let everything sit on my hair for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> If my hair color becomes too red as a result of this, I sometimes run Aveda&#x27;s Black Malva through it to cool down the color.</li>
            <li> I really like that you can use a little at a time and still see the difference.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to darken my hair (I had natural dark blonde hair that was a bit brassy from being in the sun).  </li>
            <li> If it could bring my hair from brittle to shiny, I&#x27;m sure it could weigh down thin hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it would be a little too heavy for someone with very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Also, any stains on my hands usually come off pretty easily, so it&#x27;s really not that big of a</li>
            <li> Needed it after how dry the clove shampoo left my hair.</li>
            <li> After my hair started becoming brittle and completely unmanagable (and after getting sick of the bleach blonde look) I decided to go brunette.</li>
            <li> Comes out with Comet or other similar bathroom cleaners and simple soap for skin.</li>
            <li> used aveda clove mixed with aveda black malva left  it in my hair with a deep placentia hair conditioner for 40 minutes with a plastic cap on my hair.</li>
            <li> , I cannot believe my hair color has lasted as long as it has.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To try to make my color last longer as well as improve the overall condition of my hair, I only shampoo my hair every few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no question that my hair color has lasted as long as it has because of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not to mention this conditioner lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after the initial application, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> Not only had it slightly darkened my hair, it had also managed to tone</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am SO impressed with this product! I have naturally dark dirty blonde hair but have been bleaching my hair for the past decade. After my hair started becoming brittle and completely unmanagable (and after getting sick of the bleach blonde look) I decided to go brunette. 2 months ago I went to the salon and went from bleach blonde to chocolate brown. My stylist used a demi-permenant glaze (only supposed to last 16-20 shampoos) and warned me since it was my first time having my hair dyed a darker shade and especially because my hair is so poreous, I would most likely have to have my hair dyed again in around 3 weeks. She recommended buying the Aveda Clove conditioner to help prolong my color. I was skeptical because $18 is a bit steep compared to what I usually spend on hair products, but I trust my stylist and took her suggestion and I am SO glad I did! 2 months later my hair is STILL a rich chocolate brown! There has been very minimal fade and considering I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time at the beach in the blazing sun in the salty ocean water, I cannot believe my hair color has lasted as long as it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To try to make my color last longer as well as improve the overall condition of my hair, I only shampoo my hair every few days. I use a clarifying shampoo once a week or so and a heat defense shampoo when I do have to blow dry/straighten my hair. Although this is a conditioner, I can&#x27;t really say much for it&#x27;s moisturizing properties. I need a really rich intense conditioner to replenish loss of moisture and softness in my hair and this does only a so-so job. What I usually do is after shampooing, I slather the Clove conditioner all over my hair being sure to work it in really well (wash those hands well afterwards because it&#x27;s dark brown and does stain skin!) I let it sit for a couple of minutes, then I apply my usual deep conditioner right over it and let everything sit on my hair for 10-15 minutes. Then I just rinse and style as usual and my hair comes out shiny and healthy looking and still basically maintains the same depth of color as it had 2 months ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no question that my hair color has lasted as long as it has because of this conditioner. I had also bought the John Frieda Brunette Glaze to compare to this one, and there honestly is no comparison. The few times I used the JF glaze in place of the Clove conditioner I noticed an immediate dullness in my hair once it dried. I&#x27;d rather spend the extra $8 and get a product that truly works! Not to mention this conditioner lasts a long time. I use a very generous amount and after 2 months I still have 1/4 tube left. Considering I went from one color extreme to another and because my hair is so fragile and poreous it&#x27;s been such a pleasant surprise that I still have this nice rich brunette shade. For as long as I have brunette hair, I will continue buying this conditioner! If this conditioner prolongs the life of my demi-permenant glazed and previously stripped-of-all-color hair, I have no doubt it well work for anyone!! And a really nice bonus is this conditioner contains a lot of healthy all natural ingredients AND is animal-friendly!

            <li> I cannot say enough about this conditioner! After a horrid highlight job (not Aveda) and several attempted corrections, I had given up regaining my brown hair and resigned myself to brassy orange (or hats) for several years until grown out. Then I came across reviews for Aveda products and thought, \\&quot;that&#x27;s a lot of $, but people say it works,\\&quot; so... here I am two weeks later with nary a touch of brass and GLORIOUS brown hair returned! An added bonus: the roots blend, so I don&#x27;t have a grow-out line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the clove shampoo, followed by conditioning with a half-clove, half-black malva (to help tone down the brass and add ash tones) blend. I leave the conditioner on for about 5 minutes (the first time I used it, I left it on for 20min, fyi) before a quick rinse. My hair feels a bit stripped after the shampoo (and it rinses out some of the previous color deposit), but after conditioning my hair is super soft and silky, with amazing shine! It is definitely worth the extra $ to have a product that delivers such beautiful results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people mention staining... my thought is that that&#x27;s the point!  Yes, it may leave spots in the tub and turn your fingernails a bit brown, but if you give a quick scrub with soap and a nail brush, it&#x27;s really not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered mine directly from Aveda&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> The descriptions say this product is not for gray hair, but it works beautifully on my just-starting-to-gray hair.  I am a 67-year-old woman who has never tinkered with my hair color, but it had begun to show a dull grayish cast in the last year or two.  While my daughter was visiting recently, I was musing over whether to color it.  She suggested I try this product and left her tube of it with me.  I was pleasantly surprised by how good it made my hair look and feel.  It is silky, shiny, and a nice, rich shade of medium brown - better than my natural color before it started to show any gray.  I don&#x27;t know how well it will work when my whole head of hair turns truly gray, but I&#x27;m certainly going to keep using it to find out!  It&#x27;s easy to use, worth the money, and hasn&#x27;t stirred up my skin allergies.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. Restores moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for 3 years now. I have naturally medium brown hair that gets dull in certain light. I use this once a week and it gives my hair a beautiful rich brown color that I always get plenty of comments on. It smells wondeful and evens out color during the summer. It does stain the tile and grout in my shower but I just plan to wash it after.</li>
            <li> This product has solved my &amp;#34;in between color issues&amp;#34; like a pro.  I love how it adds rich color back to my ends especially, and gets rid of that brassy look from the summer sun.  It doesn&#x27;t take the gray out, but it sure does add the brown tones back in.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> I have red hair, and this makes my hair a nice shade of darker auburn.  Be careful to rinse off the walls and floor of the shower, because this stuff can stain. Also, be sure to comb it all the way through your hair while it&#x27;s soaking in.  I usually put it in before using my body wash, because then you&#x27;re able to wash the color off your hands.  I think it has just enough conditioning properties, but it works wonders if you mix a little bit of your regular conditioner in with it when applying.  Warning:  Don&#x27;t use on blond hair, when I had highlights, it made the blond look like a dingy brown-grayish color.</li>
            <li> I have fine brunette hair, with a smattering of grays.  This conditioner did not do much conditioning nor color enhancing. Even if it didn&#x27;t tone down the grays it would have been nice to at least enjoy it as a conditioner.  I decided to use a gray enhancing shampoo instead so now my grays are sparkly silver not brassy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to darken my hair (I had natural dark blonde hair that was a bit brassy from being in the sun).  I didn&#x27;t want to color my hair, but wanted to get rid of the brassiness and turn it more of a brown.  While this product can stain your hands/shower if you&#x27;re not careful, it works great for me!  Also, any stains on my hands usually come off pretty easily, so it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to leave it on your hair 2-5 minutes before rinsing and I tend to leave it on 5-10 and use about 1 1/2 times my usual amount of conditioner.  After only using it twice, I have seen a huge change in my hair.  Now, it&#x27;s a medium brown color with slight reddish highlights and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it&#x27;s more expensive than most other conditioners, and I have to use slightly more than usual to get adequate conditioning, but I absolutely love it and I don&#x27;t have to color my hair!</li>
            <li> This is the second season I&#x27;ve used this conditioner to extend the duration of my color.  I have medium brown hair and I like to go lighter in the spring/summer and darker in fall/winter.  I have my hair professionally colored and then use Biolage shampoo.  After shampooing, I mix the Aveda clove with Biolage conditioner and add a touch of Aveda madderroot conditioner and get the most beautiful and natural color!  It easily adds 6 weeks to the duration of my color.  It sounds like a lot of work, but really isn&#x27;t.  As a working mom of 3, I need to be able to get from shower to minivan in as little as 30 minutes some days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution:  it can stain shower and/or hands so watch out if you splash.  Comes out with Comet or other similar bathroom cleaners and simple soap for skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. No matter what i use i always come back to it for shine and softness! It does leave a bit of a stain in my shower but a weekly once over takes it right out. Well worth it!!</li>
            <li> I had a ombre done to my hair. I was unhappy with how light the bottom came out. I used a little bit every time I washed it for a week- it helped so much. I really like that you can use a little at a time and still see the difference. I also rinses out slowly over time- as it does it leaves my hair with wonderful highlights.</li>
            <li> Made my dark brown damaged hair very dark, almost black.  Sometimes I sleep with it in. Kinda messy, but nothing 2 seconds of showerhead cleaning won&#x27;t fix.  Does not really CONDITION my dry hair... I use it as a dark brown color maintenance.</li>
            <li> Needed it after how dry the clove shampoo left my hair.</li>
            <li> Aveda Clove Conditionenr effectively masked my blondish highlights to match my brown roots, without having to dye my hair.  I was skeptical at first, but after the initial application, I was hooked.  I cannot speak highly enough of this product--it does the job, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I just purchased my second tube.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I have medium brown hair that I color to cover gray.  Despite using sulfate free shampoos, my hair lightens and reddens long before it&#x27;s time to color again.  I have fine hair, but this product is not heavy so I&#x27;m able to use it as a daily conditioner.  One caution: if it splatters on the walls of my shower it will stain, so I look around carefully before I step out. A quick rub gets it off before it dries.</li>
            <li> When my auburn hair color inevitably gets brassy, this really helps to tone it down. Won&#x27;t cover grey roots but ah well. Reliable product, have used it, Madder Root and Annatto which I dont think is made anymore.</li>
            <li> I have brown hair naturally. Months ago I had it professional colored (w/ Aveda color) to a lighter red color.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for about 18 months.  The red faded (usually pretty fast) and I&#x27;ve got about 2 inches of roots that are not too noticeable.  I&#x27;m trying to decided if I want to go back to brown. This product is a great solution.  It brings out the warmth in my hair.  The faded out color problem is gone. And it makes my hair appear more brown.  I dont use it every day, more like every other or every third day.  It&#x27;s a great conditioner as well as temp color enhancer. You must ring your hands and shower immediately. It could stain, and quickly.</li>
            <li> I used to be a blonde and decided to have my hair dyed brown, but unfortunately my hair didn&#x27;t take the new color. It kept washing out and leaving my hair a dull almost greenish light brown. It looked horrible. I even went back and she toned it, but it washed out again. Now I use this conditioner everyday and my hair looks great. I am so happy. It took my hair from dull to rich and shiny. I had damaged hair so this was very nourishing, just what my hair needed. I&#x27;m not sure if it would be a little too heavy for someone with very fine hair. I noticed someone saying it weighed down their thin hair. This makes sense to me. If it could bring my hair from brittle to shiny, I&#x27;m sure it could weigh down thin hair.</li>
            <li> good price good product</li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews, I was still a bit skeptical about using it on my hair and if it would work. No worries!! The seller delivered the product on time and it was packaged very well. It is a fabulous product and restored my beautiful color. I am sure it will let me extend the time between salon colorings. I also use Batiste dry shampoo to extend the time between washing. That helps to preserve the color as well. I also use the Holy Cow Towel instead of a regular towel to dry my hair. Helps to dry it faster and is less damaging to the hair.</li>
            <li> Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d gone from blonde to brunette 4 weeks ago and was due for recolour. This time it went a hideous dark ash on the ends and patchy all over (never use John Frieda mousse)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I did a wee pit of research and read about this. Got it delivered at a fraction of the price of the Aveda website and though ok here we go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off it is a very intense brown. It WILL stain anything it touches so wear gloves and use dark towels. Smells heavenly of lavender and no sweet cloying scent like today&#x27;s shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on dry hair (absorbs colour more) and left for 20mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFECTLY FLAWLESS GLOSSY BRUNETTE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just what I what I originally wanted.......so no more box dye for me it&#x27;s Aveda all the way now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to my new Holy Grail of Hair</li>
            <li> I recently went to a new salon on a Groupon (ugh) and decided to just get all over color and a trim... after all... hard to mess up, right? Wrong! My roots ended up a totally different color than the rest of my hair and were a brassy orange rather than the milky natural light brown the rest of my hair was. The stylist left an initial color mix roots then had to make another batch to color the rest of my hair... I was horrified! After just ONE condition with a focus on the roots, my hair has immensely changed and the orange has blended in well with the rest of my color. Problem solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you AVEDA! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> this stuff is wonderful.I have a 6 week old relaxer in my hair, it needs to be done.I did not have the time to do my hair so I washed it put sebastian dark brunette cellophane in my hair which I always use,stayed under the hair dryer for 20 minutes to let it set.then used aveda clove mixed with aveda black malva left  it in my hair with a deep placentia hair conditioner for 40 minutes with a plastic cap on my hair.OMG! the color looks professional, it covered the gray hairs and the color is dark like I wanted it to be.I will buy these color deposit conditioners again.at least your hair will not fall out.because regular hair dye will damage your hair especially if you have permed or relaxed hair. aveda leaves your hair soft and glossy.the color is amazing.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great. No odd smell from deep color. Keeps your color extremely fresh and extremely rich. Gives hair great shine. Will stain easily so beware but has never caused me a problem to the extent I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. All natural product from aveda so no worries about harsh waxes, sulfates or product build up you get from cheap &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have been living on this for a few years now.  It leaves my hair slightly textured, with super volume, and keeps its original deep brown shiny color without the salon.  Can&#x27;t say enough about it!</li>
            <li> Using this to tone down the red in my hair. Does the job after leaving it on my hair for about 5 min. Need to use it a couple times a week to maintain the color. Also covers a couple of gray hairs. No chemical smell, very nice scent.</li>
            <li> Adds warm highlights to brown hair with a silky finish. If my hair color becomes too red as a result of this, I sometimes run Aveda&#x27;s Black Malva through it to cool down the color.</li>
            <li> very messy, This is dark brown and stains your shower .</li>
            <li> good with my dark hair.  Not great with conditioning so I add another when I condition.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that has always tended to get light quite easily in the sun and wind. I discovered this product in the early 1990s and it&#x27;s been a staple in my shower ever since. I&#x27;m so pleased Aveda hasn&#x27;t changed the formula one bit in those years either. When my hair starts to feel a little too &#x27;brassy&#x27; or sun lightened, I add just about a quarter size to my handful of conditioner (I have long hair) to keep my color just as I like it. The color is rich and doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes or skin - but it will stain the shower stall if you leave it on, so I just keep it carefully in my hand and try not to make a mess. I use it every ten days or so and it&#x27;s perfect. One bottle lasts me about a year.</li>
            <li> If you have brunette hair this may be a good one for you, a little flat in color but it would help you to wait for your next hair coloring, postponing it a little longer and then hence saving some money. Its not conditioning. Its drying, but if you use a high end conditioner with this then it will work out nicely.</li>
            <li> This covers enough of the gray to get by a little longer without going to the salon for more color.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 3 years. It is a very good product. I makes your hair shiny and a rich brown.</li>
            <li> I spend quite a bit of my day outdoors, don&#x27;t like hats, so my color job on my hair always fades quickly and my hair turns blondish.  I was tired of spending money having my hair colored, but to have it fade away.  Did some research and this product was recommended, so I thought I would give it a try.  It has actually worked as advertised, by brown hair has stayed brown for 3 weeks now and is soft and shiny.  Smells a little like cloves, which I love that smell, so it is good for me.  Bottle is huge, so Ii put it in a smaller bottle.  So glad to finally find a product that works.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair that I used to dye really dark brown.  A year ago I decided that I didn&#x27;t want to keep dying my hair because it was expensive and my hair was drying out.  But when summer came around my roots became very noticeable because my hair gets really light from the sun, but the hair that I had dyed previously stayed dark brown.  So I bought this conditioner and not only does it blend my roots into the rest of my hair, it makes my hair super shiny and soft.  I use this product every time I wash my hair with my normal shampoo and conditioner and only just started my second bottle after almost 5 months. It doesn&#x27;t stain my hands and I like the smell too.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I loved the product but the price was too high.  I did keep the product because I needed it right away, but I paid about $10 more than I should&#x27;ve and would not waste the money again.  I will just go to an Aveda salon to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Was surprised it was more of a color conditioner, but I love it.  It covered my blonde highlights, and I was happy with the product.  It makes my hair shine, too.</li>
            <li> I am naturally a dark strawberry blonde and for the summer I wanted to go a bit lighter. I bought (for the first time in my life) one of those do-it-yourself box dyes in the spirit of \\&quot;I am in control of my life and I can do my own hair\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;My hair turned out far too light than I had anticipated! Not only had it gone too blonde, it had also brought out the copper tones in my hair, giving my (extremely blonde) locks a reddish hue.&lt;br /&gt;It was an utter nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the Aveda shop too see if they could recommend something to salvage my hair. I was not eager to dye it again as I was afraid of damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The shop assistant advised the clove conditioner, just the conditioner, not the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got home I gave it a go. I left it in for 20 minutes (Instead of the 2-5 minutes as stated on the back of the bottle),and rinsed it out. I was so pleased with the result! Not only had it slightly darkened my hair, it had also managed to tone done the copper shades.&lt;br /&gt;I repeated this once more the day after and I am now absolutely happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use it once a week too keep this colour and I am absolutely thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner smells great and did wonders for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even tough I used this product for a somewhat unconventional reason, I think it is amazing and I would recommend this to anyone who made the same mistake I did. It&#x27;s worth a try right?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  This conditioner softens your hair.  It goes well with the Aveda Clove Shampoo.  It has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great of you mess up your hair color and have to wait a while to die it again. I recently wanted to go a little red (I am brunette with blonde highlights) and my hair turned awful burgundy. And was lightening with washes a pinkish color because it was a semi permanent. This stuff tames the horrible color. It may not cover completely but definitely helps!</li>
            <li> I love this this product and will continue to buy it!!</li>
