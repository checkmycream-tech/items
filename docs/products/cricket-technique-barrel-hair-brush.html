            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I ordered this and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>so I could do my hair more easily...</li>
            <li>really adds volume and very easy to use!</li>
            <li>The brush says its static free or something like that, but It hasn&#x27;t been that way for me...</li>
            <li>Goes thru hair easily.</li>
            <li>This brush works as well as the one my hairdresser uses to twirl segments of hair and blow-dry them very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, light weight</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush for the price and helps me get a &amp;#34;bit of curl&amp;#34; into the ends of my hopelessly straight ends.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several Cricket brushes and love them for many years.  </li>

            <li>Great little brush, well constructed, heats up like a hot roller with the blow dryer, has a little hair pick inserted in the handle, seems sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>The brush performs very well.</li>
            <li>Great brush for thin hair!</li>
            <li>It pulled my hair and did not really assist in drying my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>..maybe this brush is just not suitable for my hair type, I have wavy/curly hair and its making it more frizzy and not so soft..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny and it does not do the job for blow our your hair straight.</li>
            <li>I have fairly thick but fine hair.  </li>
            <li>So, my old brush didn&#x27;t hurt when you brushed your hair.  </li>
            <li>I am not great at doing my own hair, but this brush has made things a little easier on me.</li>

            <li> I am not great at doing my own hair, but this brush has made things a little easier on me.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have very very short hair, like inches long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting brushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 1-1/2 inch and it was much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> On my old brush, there were round tips on each of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tangle in my long hair.</li>
            <li> (my rational was that it is slightly less expensive but it will do the same thing, right?)  </li>
            <li> just wanted to point that out because it&#x27;s a false and uneducated claim that might deter people from buying this decent brush.</li>
            <li> As per the other reviews that is a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> I was issued a refund and told to keep the brush because I was sent a duplicate of the Cricket brush like some other people mentioned.</li>
            <li> Ouch...so sharp!</li>
            <li> Other styling brushes with little bulbs on the tips of the bristles got stuck in my hair</li>
            <li> This one hurts a little.  </li>
            <li> Not comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I tried using it a few times but the hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> Did not like how stiff it is.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the small.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too hard.</li>
            <li> But the Bristles are too hard, scratch your head.</li>
            <li> ; instead of what it should say &amp;#34;ANTIMICROBIAL&amp;#34;, but that reviewer was totally ignorant of what that means when she suggested that her hair was feeling damaged because &amp;#34;hand sanitizer is bad for your hair&amp;#34; (paraphrased).</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that this brush does not catch and hold my hair on the barrel.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ouch...so sharp! Not comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the small. It&#x27;s tiny and it does not do the job for blow our your hair straight. Maybe if you have very very short hair, like inches long.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too hard. I tried using it a few times but the hurt my scalp. It is not in use at all.</li>
            <li> Great little brush, well constructed, heats up like a hot roller with the blow dryer, has a little hair pick inserted in the handle, seems sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> Did not like how stiff it is.</li>
            <li> Great brush for thin hair! really adds volume and very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Great brush, gets the job done</li>
            <li> I bought the 1-1/2 inch and it was much smaller than I expected. My length goes below my shoulders. I gave this brush to my mother who has shorter hair. However, it didn&#x27;t really snag in my hair, I just didn&#x27;t like the way this size round brushed it.</li>
            <li> This purchase was the 3rd time I&#x27;ve bought this same brush.  I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.com.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair and feels good in my hand.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for blow-drying hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, light weight</li>
            <li> Bristles pull away from the brush</li>
            <li> Counterfeit product received labeled &amp;#34;centrix&amp;#34; &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Greart brush...easier to use</li>
            <li> My wife says it takes some doing, but loves it.  The extra &amp;#34;doing&amp;#34; is why I gave it a 4 star, otherwise I would have gave it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hair stylist and I love these brushes.  Smooth hair amazing, grip on handle is awesome.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt ur wrist.  Long lasting brushes.  Great quality</li>
            <li> On my old brush, there were round tips on each of the bristles.  So, my old brush didn&#x27;t hurt when you brushed your hair.  This one hurts a little.  It does a good job when blow drying, but it is a bit painful to use.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick but fine hair.  I am disappointed that this brush does not catch and hold my hair on the barrel.  I&#x27;ll have to keep shopping.</li>
            <li> Love it and great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Cricket brushes and love them for many years.  This time I decided to go with the 1 1/2 inch version (my rational was that it is slightly less expensive but it will do the same thing, right?)  I was wrong.  I definitely don&#x27;t like this one as much as my larger brushes.  I just can&#x27;t get my hair to straighten the same way.  But if you know this is the perfect size for you (maybe for bangs or layers?) this will definitely work!</li>
            <li> I received a brush that has Centrix and anti-bacterial etched on it. As per the other reviews that is a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> ..maybe this brush is just not suitable for my hair type, I have wavy/curly hair and its making it more frizzy and not so soft..</li>
            <li> I am not great at doing my own hair, but this brush has made things a little easier on me. The brush says its static free or something like that, but It hasn&#x27;t been that way for me... maybe the winter air has just overpowered its capabilities.  Anyway, I just wish it came with extra hands so I could do my hair more easily... how does my stylist move her hands like that?!?! She&#x27;s magic. :)  Oh! It took me like 3 weeks to figure out that the nub at the end of the handle pulls out and when reversed is a sectioning pic. Genius!</li>
            <li> Hair gets tangled....not a good brush at all!</li>
            <li> OUCH! Might as well just pound some nails through a board and beat yourself with it</li>
            <li> The brush performs very well. Goes thru hair easily. Air gets through well for drying. It even has a pick to use on your hair embedded into the end of the handle which I found about about because it keeps falling out. Would repurchase.</li>
            <li> The reviewers were right that this brush doesn&#x27;t tangle.  Other styling brushes with little bulbs on the tips of the bristles got stuck in my hair and I had to pull some hair out to disengage the brush!  This brush works as well as the one my hairdresser uses to twirl segments of hair and blow-dry them very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve frizzy curly hair and this is totally unsuitable for my hair type. I don&#x27;t know why I bought this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush for the price and helps me get a &amp;#34;bit of curl&amp;#34; into the ends of my hopelessly straight ends.  Doesn&#x27;t tangle in my long hair.</li>
            <li> I was issued a refund and told to keep the brush because I was sent a duplicate of the Cricket brush like some other people mentioned. Like one reviewer pointed out, it does say &amp;#34; ANTIBACTERIAL&amp;#34; instead of what it should say &amp;#34;ANTIMICROBIAL&amp;#34;, but that reviewer was totally ignorant of what that means when she suggested that her hair was feeling damaged because &amp;#34;hand sanitizer is bad for your hair&amp;#34; (paraphrased). That is not what that means, there is no hand sanitizer on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to point that out because it&#x27;s a false and uneducated claim that might deter people from buying this decent brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and love it. I had no idea that the bottom of it had a removable parting stick. What&#x27;s awesone is that on never falls out so you never have to worry about losing it!!</li>
            <li> Not that great a brush. It pulled my hair and did not really assist in drying my hair quickly. Not the best brush I ever purchased. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was replacing the same model I had purchased several years ago. But the Bristles are too hard, scratch your head.</li>
