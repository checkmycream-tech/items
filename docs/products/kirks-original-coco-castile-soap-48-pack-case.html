            <li>great stuff</li>
            <li>This is great soap.</li>

            <li>but this soap is great.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing!</li>
            <li>This was studied at the University of Iowa many years ago (to the best of my memory) and can be researched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BEST soap on the market... :)</li>
            <li>Loved the smell,lather,and ingredients.</li>
            <li>Definitely good when tasting a wine since you don&#x27;t need extraneous perfume scents around the area.</li>
            <li>So, it may be good to reconsider the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li>That is how good it is.</li>
            <li>As described; good value, good service</li>
            <li>The best part about this soap is that you feel really clean afterwards and you don&#x27;t feel like you have any residue on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Best price right here.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a soap without animal fat, or tallow, and came across Kirk&#x27;s and glad I did!</li>
            <li>item was as described packed securely and shipped promptly this is awesome soap that suds easily and can be used as a hand soap or bath soap</li>
            <li>In softer water the lather is off the charts, with great, huge bubbles.</li>
            <li>good lather ,shampoo what ever you use it for you will love this soap</li>
            <li>#34;Dad&#x27;s Soap&amp;#34; and found I still liked it and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>But in an honest world, this product would be labeled as &amp;#34;Glycerin Bar with Soap and Coconut Oil&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy lather, leaves you very clean, and also very good for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and washes away clean without a filmy residue.</li>
            <li>Was very pleased to be able to order it online.</li>
            <li>pleasant light scent.  </li>
            <li>Great soap, came quickly.</li>
            <li>But I must say, Kirk&#x27;s is one of the best you can get outside of making your own.</li>
            <li>Love Kirk&#x27;s soap.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the results</li>
            <li>When I do, I just make sure to start rinsing the soap off immediately.</li>
            <li>but but not so much so that it cancels this great deal.</li>
            <li>We also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell.</li>
            <li>So glad we have Amazon.</li>
            <li>There is more glycerin in the bar than soap.  </li>
            <li>you really want a good quality soap, you must make your own.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>feel very clean after using it&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>A number of folks have asked about the soap since it has a nice effect and mild lathering.  </li>
            <li>Toothpaste is very hazardous to gums and teeth, especially the fluoride kind.  </li>
            <li>All around this soap is a great purchase and great buy especially for large families like ours.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent, reasonably priced, U.S. made product by a family-owned company with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>this makes your skin so clean love it.</li>
            <li>My wife and I really enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li>This case is for the fragranced variety (not fragrance free as others have stated.)</li>
            <li>lathers nice but bar melts kinda fast.</li>
            <li>Free of fragrance, dies or otherwise you don&#x27;t have to worry about itching, rashes or residue.</li>
            <li>I hope Kirk&#x27;s will always be available, but I buy it by the case just in case it disappears from store shelves some day.  </li>
            <li>Feels good and all natural.</li>
            <li>Glycerin (as well as coconut oil to a degree) is strongly anti-microbial when the concentration is high enough (80% or so to the best of my memory), in fact, it&#x27;s used as a microbial preservative.  </li>
            <li>,  nice to the skin, leaves you feeling clean,  got a decent price on a 48 bar case.</li>
            <li>We have used the Kirks Original Coco Castile Soap Bars at our house for decades.  </li>
            <li>If you have a place to store a full case of bar soap, this is a very economical source.</li>
            <li>He says it makes him feel really clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>Kirk&#x27;s leaves me feeling clean and cool with shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast, arrived in good condition, decent price, no complaints.</li>
            <li>We also tried this as a tooth paste and were pleasantly surprised at how much we liked it.</li>
            <li>earlier now I use 1 product for cleansing head to toe, for hair just rinse out with diluted ACV and you are good to go,</li>
            <li>Love that I can order so much at once and be done with it.</li>
            <li>It makes great laundry soap when combined with other ingredients too.</li>
            <li>dislike the added glycerin which I believe is primarily added to lessen the cost (glycerin is almost free for the taking on the market and much cheaper than coconut oil).</li>
            <li>Lathers good, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the burning sensation was much more intense when I first started using it and has been negligible since.</li>
            <li>It lathers extremely well and just leaves a good, clean feeling.</li>
            <li>no chemicals all natural good old fashion product!</li>
            <li>A case lasts about a year for our family of four, so it is economical if bought by the case.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled with the quality of the soap and just bought a batch of 48 bars to save on the per unit price.</li>
            <li>I make my own liquid laundry soap, shampoo and dish soap and needed a regular supply of castile to have around.</li>
            <li>Kirks Products have diversified but this is the one worth having.  </li>
            <li>It has a great, clean smell and lathers wonderfully in hard water.</li>
            <li>It just gives you a clean feel and is so much better than any commercial, brand name soap.</li>
            <li>That is true with all pure soaps ...</li>
            <li>Kirk&#x27;s is a powerful highly soluble soap that will get you clean while leaving no residue that I have ever noticed.  </li>
            <li>Many people complain that they get a burning feeling on their face or groin from the soap, but the real key to these problems may be the fact that the soap primarily irritates areas of the body with the highest microbial concentrations, which may indicate that high colonizations of susceptable microbes in the skin in those areas are the problem - and not the soap.  </li>
            <li>It makes lots of lather and works  great in hard water.</li>
            <li>I am surprised they are able to maintain any kind of serious business operations after my experience with them, but they seem to be happy serving a small loyal base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This soap does melt down more quickly than others so there is a trade off</li>
            <li>Love this soap as long as they leave the recipe in tact.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made the switch from regular commercial soap products to this more natural alternative product, and my husband and I are really pleased with Kirks.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t call it a mild soap, nor am I completely convinced that it should be called hypo-allergenic.  </li>
            <li>This pure castile soap is a wonder.</li>
            <li>We have very hard water, which is great for drinking but doesn&#x27;t suds at all.</li>
            <li>good with our hard water.</li>
            <li>thanks a bunch</li>
            <li>really well on my oily skin</li>
            <li>Buying a whole case of it I should have it around for a while.</li>
            <li>The simplest soap I could find, reasonably priced by buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the shipper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really like night and day difference.  </li>
            <li>real sudsy with a non perfumed scent.</li>
            <li>I know that there are more natural products out there, but I really like the price of this one and that the list of ingredients is not a mile long.  </li>
            <li>But more to the point is that I believe all these complaints about rashes/burning/stinging have more to do with skin infections  (yeast/fungi) and die-off than &amp;#34;being sensitive&amp;#34;, which is really a silly term because skin cells are skin cells, and unless your whole body is burning from head to toe, you have a problem in a certain area, which is most likely due to the population of microorganisms in that particular area, as opposed to a completely different kind of skin ...</li>
            <li>The fragrance-free has these words in bold red font at the bottom and the wrapping is actually a light blue color vs. the white for the original soap.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, that makes it useful for cleaning because you can just put the bar in a bucket, fill it with hot water, and then take the bar out, and you have a bucket with just the right amount of soap to do some cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My wife and daughters love this soap, my wife is very allergic to soaps and this is one of the few that she can use.</li>
            <li>even though a little price fluctuation sucks... but not bad... great soap...</li>
            <li>In addition to &amp;#34;chemical soaps&amp;#34; containing things that may harden water, coconut oil soap, due to it&#x27;s chemical nature, naturally rinses cleaner, and it probably also has to do with the fact that glycerin is part of the &amp;#34;scum&amp;#34;, and most glycerin is removed from &amp;#34;chemical soaps&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coconut soap is the only soap that will lather in ocean water, and it produces loads of suds in fresh water.  </li>
            <li>or so that is normal in a natural soap.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a burning in sensitive areas that other reviews have mentioned but that issue seems to lessen significantly with each use.</li>
            <li>Other than an occasional splash of a popular peppermint liquid soap or some fancy clear bar soap, Kirk&#x27;s is the only soap I use on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And also, Kirk&#x27;s is 100% a corporate commodity, while Bronner&#x27;s is still pretty much a family affair and supports various &amp;#34;green/fair trade&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Contrary to people that think they are allergic to glycerin, true allergies are generated by the immune system which responds to foreign proteins, not things like glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One of our local stores used to carry Kirks Castile, until a large corporation took over.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to find in most local stores, so buying a year&#x27;s worth online makes sense.</li>
            <li>This was suppose to be castille soap, and it very well may be, but I suspect its glycerin has been stripped as its not gentle on the skin like real handcrafted soap.</li>
            <li>...glad to buy in bulk...should last the whole year.....updated.... lasted a year with 6 to spare...</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old</li>
            <li>but overall I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>Kirk&#x27;s soap leaves your hands soft.</li>
            <li>The Castile soap has not harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>and I use it in my bathroom at Old Oaks Vineyard, Bonifay, FL for customers.  </li>
            <li>And for those that use Bronner&#x27;s for the EO effects, it is far better to mix Tea Tree + Eucalyptus 50/50 than to use either alone, at least as far as anti-microbial effect is concerned.</li>
            <li>Showers are filled with moisture and the substances put out from sneezing, peeing, breathing, dead skin cells, all the oils and organic substances washed off the skin and hair, and just tons of stuff that make it a super-petri dish.</li>
            <li>Really, a shower is the most unhealthy place you could ever step into.  </li>
            <li>The less strange ingredients in my cleaning products the better, and my savings account is seeing the benefit of this approach.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The difference between Bronner&#x27;s and Kirk&#x27;s is that Kirk&#x27;s is super-fatted with Coconut Oil, and does not contain other essential oils, but does contain extra added Glycerin (lye + oil &#x3D; soap + glycerin) on top of the 50%</li>
            <li>The only knock I have is that it doesn&#x27;t tend to last as long as regular soap today; but it doesn&#x27;t contain many of the chemicals those soaps have either.</li>
            <li>But mainly, the difference is that Bronner&#x27;s contains added Essential Oils but no added Glycerin.</li>
            <li>Also, it is critical to have high value nutrition with the co-dependent vitamins</li>
            <li>This product is fragrance free but has all the same qualities and ingredients as the bars in the red, white and blue wrapper.  </li>
            <li>Kirk&#x27;s soap is mild and contains very few ingredients: coconut soap, water, vegetable glycerin, coconut oil and natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for general health, it is important to understand that the shower is one of the dirtiest places in a home due to daily moisture - the mold and bacterial growth is phenomenal in a shower - just entering the shower and turning the water on releases zillions of spores into your lungs from all the invisible mold in a shower, in fact, enough to be a very serious bio/health hazard.</li>
            <li>2 swipes across a hand is enough to create gobs of lather, and everyone complaining that it melts fast is missing the main factor which is that this is a &amp;#34;mostly glycerin&amp;#34; bar of &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for years for bathing, leaves skin feeling clean after a hard days work.</li>
            <li>My general experiences are that I don&#x27;t feel any burning the vast majority of the time.</li>
            <li>Despite the very hard tap water in my home, Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soap does a good job of cutting through sebum, oils, grease, and dirt, then rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>Got the large package (I think 48 bars) and it has lasted us a few months.</li>
            <li>Therefore the extra added glycerin may be at the root of these types of problems, but it may be a good problem that eventually makes your skin healthier, as opposed to a bad product that is hurting skin.  </li>

            <li> Shipped fast, arrived in good condition, decent price, no complaints.</li>
            <li> We also tried this as a tooth paste and were pleasantly surprised at how much we liked it.</li>
            <li> earlier now I use 1 product for cleansing head to toe, for hair just rinse out with diluted ACV and you are good to go,</li>
            <li> Love that I can order so much at once and be done with it.</li>
            <li> It makes great laundry soap when combined with other ingredients too.</li>
            <li> dislike the added glycerin which I believe is primarily added to lessen the cost (glycerin is almost free for the taking on the market and much cheaper than coconut oil).</li>
            <li> Lathers good, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the burning sensation was much more intense when I first started using it and has been negligible since.</li>
            <li> It lathers extremely well and just leaves a good, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> no chemicals all natural good old fashion product!</li>
            <li> A case lasts about a year for our family of four, so it is economical if bought by the case.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled with the quality of the soap and just bought a batch of 48 bars to save on the per unit price.</li>
            <li> I make my own liquid laundry soap, shampoo and dish soap and needed a regular supply of castile to have around.</li>
            <li> Kirks Products have diversified but this is the one worth having.  </li>
            <li> It has a great, clean smell and lathers wonderfully in hard water.</li>
            <li> It just gives you a clean feel and is so much better than any commercial, brand name soap.</li>
            <li> That is true with all pure soaps ...</li>
            <li> Kirk&#x27;s is a powerful highly soluble soap that will get you clean while leaving no residue that I have ever noticed.  </li>
            <li> Many people complain that they get a burning feeling on their face or groin from the soap, but the real key to these problems may be the fact that the soap primarily irritates areas of the body with the highest microbial concentrations, which may indicate that high colonizations of susceptable microbes in the skin in those areas are the problem - and not the soap.  </li>
            <li> It makes lots of lather and works  great in hard water.</li>
            <li> I am surprised they are able to maintain any kind of serious business operations after my experience with them, but they seem to be happy serving a small loyal base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This soap does melt down more quickly than others so there is a trade off</li>
            <li> Love this soap as long as they leave the recipe in tact.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made the switch from regular commercial soap products to this more natural alternative product, and my husband and I are really pleased with Kirks.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t call it a mild soap, nor am I completely convinced that it should be called hypo-allergenic.  </li>
            <li> This pure castile soap is a wonder.</li>
            <li> We have very hard water, which is great for drinking but doesn&#x27;t suds at all.</li>
            <li> good with our hard water.</li>
            <li> thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> really well on my oily skin</li>
            <li> Buying a whole case of it I should have it around for a while.</li>
            <li> The simplest soap I could find, reasonably priced by buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the shipper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really like night and day difference.  </li>
            <li> real sudsy with a non perfumed scent.</li>
            <li> I know that there are more natural products out there, but I really like the price of this one and that the list of ingredients is not a mile long.  </li>
            <li> But more to the point is that I believe all these complaints about rashes/burning/stinging have more to do with skin infections  (yeast/fungi) and die-off than &amp;#34;being sensitive&amp;#34;, which is really a silly term because skin cells are skin cells, and unless your whole body is burning from head to toe, you have a problem in a certain area, which is most likely due to the population of microorganisms in that particular area, as opposed to a completely different kind of skin ...</li>
            <li> The fragrance-free has these words in bold red font at the bottom and the wrapping is actually a light blue color vs. the white for the original soap.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, that makes it useful for cleaning because you can just put the bar in a bucket, fill it with hot water, and then take the bar out, and you have a bucket with just the right amount of soap to do some cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My wife and daughters love this soap, my wife is very allergic to soaps and this is one of the few that she can use.</li>
            <li> even though a little price fluctuation sucks... but not bad... great soap...</li>
            <li> In addition to &amp;#34;chemical soaps&amp;#34; containing things that may harden water, coconut oil soap, due to it&#x27;s chemical nature, naturally rinses cleaner, and it probably also has to do with the fact that glycerin is part of the &amp;#34;scum&amp;#34;, and most glycerin is removed from &amp;#34;chemical soaps&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coconut soap is the only soap that will lather in ocean water, and it produces loads of suds in fresh water.  </li>
            <li> or so that is normal in a natural soap.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a burning in sensitive areas that other reviews have mentioned but that issue seems to lessen significantly with each use.</li>
            <li> Other than an occasional splash of a popular peppermint liquid soap or some fancy clear bar soap, Kirk&#x27;s is the only soap I use on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And also, Kirk&#x27;s is 100% a corporate commodity, while Bronner&#x27;s is still pretty much a family affair and supports various &amp;#34;green/fair trade&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Contrary to people that think they are allergic to glycerin, true allergies are generated by the immune system which responds to foreign proteins, not things like glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One of our local stores used to carry Kirks Castile, until a large corporation took over.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find in most local stores, so buying a year&#x27;s worth online makes sense.</li>
            <li> This was suppose to be castille soap, and it very well may be, but I suspect its glycerin has been stripped as its not gentle on the skin like real handcrafted soap.</li>
            <li> ...glad to buy in bulk...should last the whole year.....updated.... lasted a year with 6 to spare...</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old</li>
            <li> but overall I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> Kirk&#x27;s soap leaves your hands soft.</li>
            <li> The Castile soap has not harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> and I use it in my bathroom at Old Oaks Vineyard, Bonifay, FL for customers.  </li>
            <li> And for those that use Bronner&#x27;s for the EO effects, it is far better to mix Tea Tree + Eucalyptus 50/50 than to use either alone, at least as far as anti-microbial effect is concerned.</li>
            <li> Showers are filled with moisture and the substances put out from sneezing, peeing, breathing, dead skin cells, all the oils and organic substances washed off the skin and hair, and just tons of stuff that make it a super-petri dish.</li>
            <li> Really, a shower is the most unhealthy place you could ever step into.  </li>
            <li> The less strange ingredients in my cleaning products the better, and my savings account is seeing the benefit of this approach.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The difference between Bronner&#x27;s and Kirk&#x27;s is that Kirk&#x27;s is super-fatted with Coconut Oil, and does not contain other essential oils, but does contain extra added Glycerin (lye + oil &#x3D; soap + glycerin) on top of the 50%</li>
            <li> The only knock I have is that it doesn&#x27;t tend to last as long as regular soap today; but it doesn&#x27;t contain many of the chemicals those soaps have either.</li>
            <li> But mainly, the difference is that Bronner&#x27;s contains added Essential Oils but no added Glycerin.</li>
            <li> Also, it is critical to have high value nutrition with the co-dependent vitamins</li>
            <li> This product is fragrance free but has all the same qualities and ingredients as the bars in the red, white and blue wrapper.  </li>
            <li> Kirk&#x27;s soap is mild and contains very few ingredients: coconut soap, water, vegetable glycerin, coconut oil and natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for general health, it is important to understand that the shower is one of the dirtiest places in a home due to daily moisture - the mold and bacterial growth is phenomenal in a shower - just entering the shower and turning the water on releases zillions of spores into your lungs from all the invisible mold in a shower, in fact, enough to be a very serious bio/health hazard.</li>
            <li> 2 swipes across a hand is enough to create gobs of lather, and everyone complaining that it melts fast is missing the main factor which is that this is a &amp;#34;mostly glycerin&amp;#34; bar of &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for years for bathing, leaves skin feeling clean after a hard days work.</li>
            <li> My general experiences are that I don&#x27;t feel any burning the vast majority of the time.</li>
            <li> Despite the very hard tap water in my home, Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soap does a good job of cutting through sebum, oils, grease, and dirt, then rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> Got the large package (I think 48 bars) and it has lasted us a few months.</li>
            <li> Therefore the extra added glycerin may be at the root of these types of problems, but it may be a good problem that eventually makes your skin healthier, as opposed to a bad product that is hurting skin.  </li>
            <li> All natural, no funny smell.</li>
            <li> I have always lived in the country with water from wells where the water is very hard and so full of iron that at times you couldn&#x27;t see the bottom of a tub of water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s of my opinion that the bar doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as traditional soap</li>
            <li> Kirks lathers really well in our hard water.</li>
            <li> Also, the ingredient list has changed in the last few years from extra coconut oil &amp;#62; glycerin to extra glycerin &amp;#62; coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few years now and never had an issue with it&#x27;s natural ingredients breaking out my skin.  </li>
            <li> cause it really suds up in hard water and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I had dry and irritated skin</li>
            <li> ; idea, because there really is nothing too irritating in this soap - check diet and overall skin health before claiming &amp;#34;sensitive</li>
            <li> While Bronner&#x27;s may be slightly super-fatted with oil to ensure the lye is completely utilized in the reaction, they do not say with what oil - so possibly is slightly super-fatted with their combinations of oils.</li>
            <li> Leaves a dry film on EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> /&gt;My previous order of 48 bars lasted about 32 months of daily use.  </li>
            <li> Getting very hard to find Kirks around here and very high priced when found.</li>
            <li> Before I learned about Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap, I had very dry skin and was bothered by the cost and perfumes in all the fancy products I had tried.</li>
            <li> Harder to find in supermarkets since it was peddled off by P&amp;G as an &amp;#34;obsolete&amp;#34; brand.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s not available locally.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful in that the photos do not always match.  </li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t use coconut soap like other soaps, because a little goes a long way unlike other soaps.  </li>
            <li> As one poster stated, if you are not interested in &amp;#34;cucumber mint melon breeze&amp;#34; in your soap, this may be what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, these are all products of soap mfg.  </li>
            <li> That is why it &amp;#34;decays&amp;#34; faster than other soaps in water.  </li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> When you consider the thickness of  a soap film, the amount of glycerin and coconut oil on the skin is very very small, and especially considering that it is only on the skin for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I heartily recommend this soap, with the caveat to those with sensitive skin to be wary of any potential issues with burning sensations.</li>
            <li> mentioned in other reviews, this soap can burn a little bit if you leave it on your skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema and other skin issues, and using this soap has helped a little.  </li>
            <li> I found stores that had 10 or less</li>
            <li> For a time it was getting difficult to find in stores, and for a short period of time when P&amp;G still owned the brand but was manufacturing it in the Philippines there were serious quality issues, but since P&amp;G sold the brand and it is made in the USA again by Kirk&#x27;s natural products the purity and quality is restored.  </li>
            <li> a little drying to skin</li>
            <li> I think I may have given a few bars away.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past down here on the farm</li>
            <li> It has even helped with a skin issue I was having, which was a little bonus!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> but it was getting hard to find it.  </li>
            <li> We have extremely hard water</li>
            <li> people note that it doesn&#x27;t leave hard-to-get-off-the-tub soap scum.  </li>
            <li> seriously why didn&#x27;t I know about this</li>
            <li> At its worst it caused some mild discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are really a little stupid for not just selling a single TeaTree+Eucalyptus soap.</li>
            <li> You can use this soap in cold water to was even greasy dishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly tasteless, whereas olive oil soap tastes yacky; however, if you do so, you must brush 3x/day, since your teeth will have no protection, but therefore, they will remineralize, and your gums will thank your for it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best soap ever! Lathers good, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters love this soap, my wife is very allergic to soaps and this is one of the few that she can use.</li>
            <li> Been using Kirk&#x27;s since 1972 when my only bath was a mountain river.</li>
            <li> Love Kirk&#x27;s soap.  I like that there are no artifical scents/chemicals in this soap.  Hard to find in stores.  A great bargin!</li>
            <li> great stuff...glad to buy in bulk...should last the whole year.....updated.... lasted a year with 6 to spare...yay!...ordering yet again....even though a little price fluctuation sucks... but not bad... great soap...thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> My grandmother born in 1899. She told me about this soap and I have used it every since she has told me about it.I am 56 years old I had dry and irritated skin but now I do not.</li>
            <li> purest soap on the market . good lather ,shampoo what ever you use it for you will love this soap</li>
            <li> Best soap ever. It will burn your eyes, though.</li>
            <li> My grandfather used this soap and I have for 50 years. It has a great, clean smell and lathers wonderfully in hard water. In softer water the lather is off the charts, with great, huge bubbles. I have not used it to wash my hair, although my grandpa did, and I have done so if I&#x27;ve run out of shampoo. It just gives you a clean feel and is so much better than any commercial, brand name soap. A case lasts about a year for our family of four, so it is economical if bought by the case. It is an excellent, reasonably priced, U.S. made product by a family-owned company with all natural ingredients. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Before I learned about Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap, I had very dry skin and was bothered by the cost and perfumes in all the fancy products I had tried. I was so pleased with the results, I now buy it by the case so I can share and never run out. I have turned my family on to this wonderful soap and they are as happy as I am.   Thank you,  Brenda Leon</li>
            <li> This is great soap. I ran across it about six months ago in a grocery store and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well&lt;br /&gt;I feel very clean after using it&lt;br /&gt;Works really well on my oily skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in other reviews, this soap can burn a little bit if you leave it on your skin. My general experiences are that I don&#x27;t feel any burning the vast majority of the time. When I do, I just make sure to start rinsing the soap off immediately. It stops burning once it has been rinsed off. I also noticed that the burning sensation was much more intense when I first started using it and has been negligible since. At its worst it caused some mild discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the sometimes-burning effect of the soap is not a deal breaker. Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled with the quality of the soap and just bought a batch of 48 bars to save on the per unit price. I heartily recommend this soap, with the caveat to those with sensitive skin to be wary of any potential issues with burning sensations.</li>
            <li> Found this soap at the grocery store and bought it on a whim. Loved the smell,lather,and ingredients. I did notice a burning in sensitive areas that other reviews have mentioned but that issue seems to lessen significantly with each use. This soap does melt down more quickly than others so there is a trade off but but not so much so that it cancels this great deal. We also tried this as a tooth paste and were pleasantly surprised at how much we liked it. All around this soap is a great purchase and great buy especially for large families like ours.</li>
            <li> My wife and I really enjoy this soap. It lathers extremely well and just leaves a good, clean feeling. It has even helped with a skin issue I was having, which was a little bonus! The only knock I have is that it doesn&#x27;t tend to last as long as regular soap today; but it doesn&#x27;t contain many of the chemicals those soaps have either.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years for bathing, leaves skin feeling clean after a hard days work.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past down here on the farm cause it really suds up in hard water and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Couldn&#x27;t find it a HEB grocery store in Annaville so had to order online.</li>
            <li> All natural, no funny smell. Been using it for 30+ years. It&#x27;s tough to find in most local stores, so buying a year&#x27;s worth online makes sense.</li>
            <li> Getting very hard to find Kirks around here and very high priced when found. Buying a whole case of it I should have it around for a while. We have very hard water, which is great for drinking but doesn&#x27;t suds at all. Kirks lathers really well in our hard water.</li>
            <li> This case is for the fragranced variety (not fragrance free as others have stated.) Kirk&#x27;s soap is mild and contains very few ingredients: coconut soap, water, vegetable glycerin, coconut oil and natural fragrance. I was looking for a soap without animal fat, or tallow, and came across Kirk&#x27;s and glad I did! Smells great and washes away clean without a filmy residue. It&#x27;s of my opinion that the bar doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as traditional soap but I wouldn&#x27;t trade even if I had to.</li>
            <li> seriously why didn&#x27;t I know about this earlier now I use 1 product for cleansing head to toe, for hair just rinse out with diluted ACV and you are good to go, no chemicals all natural good old fashion product!</li>
            <li> pleasant light scent.  lathers nice but bar melts kinda fast. a little drying to skin but overall I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> this is my soap for all things washing...I found stores that had 10 or less but I wanted to get a deal. This supplier was on time and as ordered</li>
            <li> item was as described packed securely and shipped promptly this is awesome soap that suds easily and can be used as a hand soap or bath soap</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap. He says it makes him feel really clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> I make my own liquid laundry soap, shampoo and dish soap and needed a regular supply of castile to have around. When I finish off my bar soap in the bath, I will switch to this product also. The less strange ingredients in my cleaning products the better, and my savings account is seeing the benefit of this approach.</li>
            <li> My dad used this soap... and after trying out a bunch of brand names back in the 70s, I ended up trying &amp;#34;Dad&#x27;s Soap&amp;#34; and found I still liked it and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Harder to find in supermarkets since it was peddled off by P&amp;G as an &amp;#34;obsolete&amp;#34; brand.  Kirks Products have diversified but this is the one worth having.  Buy it by the case and never run out.</li>
            <li> Vegetable based castille soap.  The simplest soap I could find, reasonably priced by buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> I like this soap.  It makes lots of lather and works  great in hard water.</li>
            <li> This pure castile soap is a wonder. You can use this soap in cold water to was even greasy dishes.Kirk&#x27;s soap leaves your hands soft. Your nails are not dries out from this soap. It is wonderful for shampooing your hair. I take a bath with it. Leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made the switch from regular commercial soap products to this more natural alternative product, and my husband and I are really pleased with Kirks.  I know that there are more natural products out there, but I really like the price of this one and that the list of ingredients is not a mile long.  My husband has eczema and other skin issues, and using this soap has helped a little.  The best part about this soap is that you feel really clean afterwards and you don&#x27;t feel like you have any residue on your skin.  We also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell.</li>
            <li> This was suppose to be castille soap, and it very well may be, but I suspect its glycerin has been stripped as its not gentle on the skin like real handcrafted soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap, came quickly.Love that I can order so much at once and be done with it. Thanks to the shipper.</li>
            <li> Some of the best soap you can buy.  Rich, creamy lather, leaves you very clean, and also very good for your hair.  No need to buy shampoo separately!  Love this soap as long as they leave the recipe in tact.  One of our local stores used to carry Kirks Castile, until a large corporation took over.  Now it&#x27;s not available locally.  So glad we have Amazon.</li>
            <li> Only soap we use, even on our baby.</li>
            <li> The Castile soap has not harsh chemicals and I use it in my bathroom at Old Oaks Vineyard, Bonifay, FL for customers.  A number of folks have asked about the soap since it has a nice effect and mild lathering.  Definitely good when tasting a wine since you don&#x27;t need extraneous perfume scents around the area.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, arrived in good condition, decent price, no complaints.</li>
            <li> As one poster stated, if you are not interested in &amp;#34;cucumber mint melon breeze&amp;#34; in your soap, this may be what you are looking for.  I think it is also the best soap for brushing your teeth.  It&#x27;s nearly tasteless, whereas olive oil soap tastes yacky; however, if you do so, you must brush 3x/day, since your teeth will have no protection, but therefore, they will remineralize, and your gums will thank your for it.  Toothpaste is very hazardous to gums and teeth, especially the fluoride kind.  The glycerin in a glob of toothpaste creates a Saran Wrap-like coating that prevents remineralization, and the fluoride destroys the enzymes in the mouth that help bond the gums to the teeth.  Also, it is critical to have high value nutrition with the co-dependent vitamins A/D/K if you are concerned with remineralization and gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a &amp;#34;mild hypoallergenic&amp;#34; soap as some claim, it is just soap with extra glycerin and coconut oil added for anti-microbial and moisturizing effects.  Which is critical, since coconut soap is the strongest soap of all oils/fats one can saponify.  Coconut soap is the only soap that will lather in ocean water, and it produces loads of suds in fresh water.  Many people complain that they get a burning feeling on their face or groin from the soap, but the real key to these problems may be the fact that the soap primarily irritates areas of the body with the highest microbial concentrations, which may indicate that high colonizations of susceptable microbes in the skin in those areas are the problem - and not the soap.  Contrary to people that think they are allergic to glycerin, true allergies are generated by the immune system which responds to foreign proteins, not things like glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dislike the added glycerin which I believe is primarily added to lessen the cost (glycerin is almost free for the taking on the market and much cheaper than coconut oil). Also, the ingredient list has changed in the last few years from extra coconut oil &amp;#62; glycerin to extra glycerin &amp;#62; coconut oil. On the other hand, these are all products of soap mfg.  But more to the point is that I believe all these complaints about rashes/burning/stinging have more to do with skin infections  (yeast/fungi) and die-off than &amp;#34;being sensitive&amp;#34;, which is really a silly term because skin cells are skin cells, and unless your whole body is burning from head to toe, you have a problem in a certain area, which is most likely due to the population of microorganisms in that particular area, as opposed to a completely different kind of skin ... Glycerin (as well as coconut oil to a degree) is strongly anti-microbial when the concentration is high enough (80% or so to the best of my memory), in fact, it&#x27;s used as a microbial preservative.  Therefore the extra added glycerin may be at the root of these types of problems, but it may be a good problem that eventually makes your skin healthier, as opposed to a bad product that is hurting skin.  In such cases, it may be usefuI to keep using it daily even if it burns a lot, and then decide after several weeks if skin health is improving or not.  When you consider the thickness of  a soap film, the amount of glycerin and coconut oil on the skin is very very small, and especially considering that it is only on the skin for a few minutes.  So, it may be good to reconsider the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; idea, because there really is nothing too irritating in this soap - check diet and overall skin health before claiming &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between Bronner&#x27;s and Kirk&#x27;s is that Kirk&#x27;s is super-fatted with Coconut Oil, and does not contain other essential oils, but does contain extra added Glycerin (lye + oil &#x3D; soap + glycerin) on top of the 50% or so that is normal in a natural soap.  While Bronner&#x27;s may be slightly super-fatted with oil to ensure the lye is completely utilized in the reaction, they do not say with what oil - so possibly is slightly super-fatted with their combinations of oils. But mainly, the difference is that Bronner&#x27;s contains added Essential Oils but no added Glycerin. And also, Kirk&#x27;s is 100% a corporate commodity, while Bronner&#x27;s is still pretty much a family affair and supports various &amp;#34;green/fair trade&amp;#34; business practices and lefty causes.  And for those that use Bronner&#x27;s for the EO effects, it is far better to mix Tea Tree + Eucalyptus 50/50 than to use either alone, at least as far as anti-microbial effect is concerned. They are really a little stupid for not just selling a single TeaTree+Eucalyptus soap. Personally, I got turned off to Bronner&#x27;s when dealing with the company - it was like dealing with an ad hoc business run by a part-time employee with no business experience.  I am surprised they are able to maintain any kind of serious business operations after my experience with them, but they seem to be happy serving a small loyal base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can&#x27;t use coconut soap like other soaps, because a little goes a long way unlike other soaps.  2 swipes across a hand is enough to create gobs of lather, and everyone complaining that it melts fast is missing the main factor which is that this is a &amp;#34;mostly glycerin&amp;#34; bar of &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.  There is more glycerin in the bar than soap.  That is why it &amp;#34;decays&amp;#34; faster than other soaps in water.  On the other hand, that makes it useful for cleaning because you can just put the bar in a bucket, fill it with hot water, and then take the bar out, and you have a bucket with just the right amount of soap to do some cleaning.  But in an honest world, this product would be labeled as &amp;#34;Glycerin Bar with Soap and Coconut Oil&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people note that it doesn&#x27;t leave hard-to-get-off-the-tub soap scum.  That is true with all pure soaps ... In addition to &amp;#34;chemical soaps&amp;#34; containing things that may harden water, coconut oil soap, due to it&#x27;s chemical nature, naturally rinses cleaner, and it probably also has to do with the fact that glycerin is part of the &amp;#34;scum&amp;#34;, and most glycerin is removed from &amp;#34;chemical soaps&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for general health, it is important to understand that the shower is one of the dirtiest places in a home due to daily moisture - the mold and bacterial growth is phenomenal in a shower - just entering the shower and turning the water on releases zillions of spores into your lungs from all the invisible mold in a shower, in fact, enough to be a very serious bio/health hazard. Personally, I wash my shower every day with a powder bleach cleanser, and recommend that to everyone!  Showers are filled with moisture and the substances put out from sneezing, peeing, breathing, dead skin cells, all the oils and organic substances washed off the skin and hair, and just tons of stuff that make it a super-petri dish. Really, a shower is the most unhealthy place you could ever step into.  This was studied at the University of Iowa many years ago (to the best of my memory) and can be researched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want a good quality soap, you must make your own.  Any commercial soap is like comparing Wonder Bread to home-made bread. It&#x27;s really like night and day difference.  I have never found any commercial soap to even come close to the quality of a home-made soap. Not even close.  But I must say, Kirk&#x27;s is one of the best you can get outside of making your own.</li>
            <li> Great deal and awesome soap. Feels good and all natural.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! Free of fragrance, dies or otherwise you don&#x27;t have to worry about itching, rashes or residue. It makes great laundry soap when combined with other ingredients too. Our family has been using it exclusively!</li>
            <li> Despite the very hard tap water in my home, Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soap does a good job of cutting through sebum, oils, grease, and dirt, then rinses clean.  Other than an occasional splash of a popular peppermint liquid soap or some fancy clear bar soap, Kirk&#x27;s is the only soap I use on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call it a mild soap, nor am I completely convinced that it should be called hypo-allergenic.  The &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34; is not obnoxious, but I wish there was a scent-free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous order of 48 bars lasted about 32 months of daily use.  I think I may have given a few bars away.  If you have a place to store a full case of bar soap, this is a very economical source.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Great price. Convenient. Helps to avoid trips to the store.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years and was buying it at the grocery store but it was getting hard to find it.  Was very pleased to be able to order it online.</li>
            <li> We use this soap in our body wash, hand soap, laundry detergent, and dish soap. Love it. Got the large package (I think 48 bars) and it has lasted us a few months. Just as expected.</li>
            <li> If you have any type of skin sensitivity, this is the soap for you.  I have used it for a few years now and never had an issue with it&#x27;s natural ingredients breaking out my skin.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Finally after 3 failed attempts to order a case of the &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; variety, I&#x27;m glad to finally have it.  Be careful in that the photos do not always match.  The fragrance-free has these words in bold red font at the bottom and the wrapping is actually a light blue color vs. the white for the original soap.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> Best soap you can buy. Best price right here. The case will last me well over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this soap for decades.</li>
            <li> this makes your skin so clean love it.</li>
            <li> We have used the Kirks Original Coco Castile Soap Bars at our house for decades.  This product is fragrance free but has all the same qualities and ingredients as the bars in the red, white and blue wrapper.  We have extremely hard water but this soap is great.</li>
            <li> Great soap! Best lathering soap I&#x27;ve used. I used to wash my steers with the soap and now I am using it on myself.</li>
            <li> I have been using Kirk&#x27;s Castile for fifty nine years as both body soap and shampoo. I have always lived in the country with water from wells where the water is very hard and so full of iron that at times you couldn&#x27;t see the bottom of a tub of water.  Kirk&#x27;s always lathers well in any water.  Kirk&#x27;s is a powerful highly soluble soap that will get you clean while leaving no residue that I have ever noticed.  Kirk&#x27;s leaves me feeling clean and cool with shiny hair.  I have also used Kirk&#x27;s to wash hunting clothes.  It leaves no scent or brighteners that give you away to the sight or sense of smell of a deer.  For a time it was getting difficult to find in stores, and for a short period of time when P&amp;G still owned the brand but was manufacturing it in the Philippines there were serious quality issues, but since P&amp;G sold the brand and it is made in the USA again by Kirk&#x27;s natural products the purity and quality is restored.  I hope Kirk&#x27;s will always be available, but I buy it by the case just in case it disappears from store shelves some day.  That is how good it is.</li>
            <li> Leaves a dry film on EVERYTHING! The tub, the tile, my sink, my kids&#x27; bodies and hands. No thanks!</li>
            <li> been using Kirk&#x27;s for years.  real sudsy with a non perfumed scent.,  nice to the skin, leaves you feeling clean,  got a decent price on a 48 bar case.</li>
            <li> great to get it in this amount! good with our hard water. still soaps well</li>
            <li> As described; good value, good service</li>
            <li> BEST soap on the market... :)</li>
