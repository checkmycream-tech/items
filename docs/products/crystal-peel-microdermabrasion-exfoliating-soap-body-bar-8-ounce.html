            <li>It really smooth&#x27;s my skin</li>
            <li>Makes your skin smooth by increasing blood flow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best to use it on my arms very briefly every day, rather than using it more extensively once or twice a week.</li>

            <li>Geat soap, but the price is a bit high.  </li>
            <li>I live in California</li>
            <li>this bar does wonders, leaves my skin so smooth and keeps any breakouts on my back and shoulders from starting.</li>
            <li>Works ok but very harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>In addition to using PFB vanish and this exfoliating bar, my skin is rejuvenated and most of my dark spots are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>My skin stays so soft when I use this.  </li>

            <li> but I can see it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> For me, using plain old baking soda as an exfoliant gives me the same results.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this if you have very seriously tough skinâ€”I have severe keratosis pilaris and this has been very helpful on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Not particularly enticed by this product.  </li>
            <li> so I guard it carefully</li>
            <li> They work well but are quite rough.</li>
            <li> The granuals in the soap does slough dead skin, especially during the winter months, but I started to notice scratches on parts of my body after my showers.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use too roughly</li>
            <li> Use this on very rough and tough skin only, it can and probably will damage any sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> works for those little bumps you get on thighs and arms</li>
            <li> A little pricy</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week or sometimes a little longer.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use it just for exfoliating purposes on my neck and chest, but it was way too harsh</li>
            <li> A waste of Money.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend everyday usage.  </li>
            <li> Too harsh for the face or other delicate areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those of you with hard skin, by all means, try it out.</li>
            <li> It seriously felt like I was running sand paper on myself.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I think it is too expensive as well.</li>
            <li> but I am unable to use it unless it&#x27;s with a shower scrunchy, or washcloth.  </li>

            <li> as advertised.  works for those little bumps you get on thighs and arms</li>
            <li> Geat soap, but the price is a bit high.  Would buy more often if they lowered the price by about 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> Great service, great product! Will buy from this seller again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works ok but very harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this body bar, I use it daily after my sweaty gym workouts, I have sensitive skin and this bar does wonders, leaves my skin so smooth and keeps any breakouts on my back and shoulders from starting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this as much as I probably should, but so far I really like it.  A little pricy but I can see it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This was sooooo great! I love love love it. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love this..I don&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! This is only the second bar that I&#x27;ve purchased. I use it about once a week or sometimes a little longer.</li>
            <li> This soap is the truth. Ive been struggling with KP for over 25 years, and ive tried almost every product on the market. After one use, I can feel the difference in my skin already.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this if you have very seriously tough skinâ€”I have severe keratosis pilaris and this has been very helpful on my arms and legs. I have tried to use it just for exfoliating purposes on my neck and chest, but it was way too harsh and I actually ended up with a severe breakout...it&#x27;s the only time that&#x27;s every happened to me anywhere but on my face. Use this on very rough and tough skin only, it can and probably will damage any sensitive areas. And do NOT over use it. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best to use it on my arms very briefly every day, rather than using it more extensively once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> This soap isn&#x27;t as effective as I thought it would be. It is similar to using a drugstore body scrub. I was not impressed. I think it is too expensive as well. For me, using plain old baking soda as an exfoliant gives me the same results.</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliating soap I have ever found. It&#x27;s pricey so I guard it carefully, don&#x27;t leave it in water or let the kids play with it!  I live in California so it works great on my sun damaged skin, also great on the bottom of the feet.  Too harsh for the face or other delicate areas.</li>
            <li> I happened upon this soap at a spa on vacation.  It does the job with ingrown hairs and breakouts.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I do really like this.  My skin stays so soft when I use this.  I love it on my elbow area and legs.  Second time I bought this. I love it.  It really smooth&#x27;s my skin</li>
            <li> A waste of Money. I saw no difference at all in my skin, and my kp. Used that whole var of soap, made no difference</li>
            <li> if you like to rub your bodynwth sandpaper, go for it. it is what it is. they described it very well.</li>
            <li> love these crystal peel soaps but you have to be careful to not scrub your skin with them as they will scratch your skin. They work well but are quite rough.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliator for your body. Makes your skin smooth by increasing blood flow. I also use it for cellulite.</li>
            <li> This soap is great - the woman who owns the company is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had thought of this product but just glad someone did!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap. I suffer from ingrown hairs after waxing and/or shaving. In addition to using PFB vanish and this exfoliating bar, my skin is rejuvenated and most of my dark spots are starting to fade. This is the best bar I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used, I highly recommend it ! The expense per bar is worth it</li>
            <li> Not particularly enticed by this product.  The granuals in the soap does slough dead skin, especially during the winter months, but I started to notice scratches on parts of my body after my showers.  Didn&#x27;t use too roughly but I am unable to use it unless it&#x27;s with a shower scrunchy, or washcloth.  Would not recommend everyday usage.  I alternate between the soap and a shower gel, using the soap 2 or 3 times a week.  Use with a light hand if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for keeping you skin soft and smooth from head to toe!  Even my husband likes it!</li>
            <li> This is so awesome to exfoliate, best body product I have found.  It works better than&lt;br /&gt;the loufa sponges.  Love it</li>
            <li> I liked it, has a pleasant scent, it does the job but leaves the skin a bit too dry for my taste. I had put quite a bit of moisturizing cream on my body not to itch from dryness . I did not notice discoloration disappearing but maybe it is just a matter of time, skin left very smooth after use on the face... overall good soap.</li>
            <li> fabulous lats forever really exfoliates wonderfull feel to skin after use</li>
            <li> Your legs will be its softest!  At first bar kind of hurts but you will get used to it and your legs will never be more beautiful.  My KP is almost gone .</li>
            <li> This soap is most definitely not for people with sensitive skin. Even if you gently rub it on your skin expect to see tons of red marks. It seriously felt like I was running sand paper on myself. Will not be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you with hard skin, by all means, try it out.</li>
