            <li>Love mine!</li>
            <li>So cute!</li>
            <li>These were super cute and the perfect size!</li>
            <li>the product looked great in the packaging, however upon closer examination they reeked of sea water and had to be placed in Clorox to get rid of smell hoever after they were fine.</li>
            <li>Amazing cause</li>
            <li>its a nice clip and all but the problem i had when i opened it</li>
            <li>I let it soak in warm water and dish soap and the smell went away.</li>
            <li>Like it came from the ocean and kind of concentrated a bit</li>
            <li>But other than that, it is beautiful &amp; a very good decision indeed!</li>
            <li>youll want to order more than 1! :-)</li>
            <li>Strong!  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend, perfect to achieve that adorable beachy look!</li>
            <li>Cute and easy to clip in!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine!  </li>
            <li>The price was ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments on them. :)</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;d like 2 (like in the picture) then be sure to order two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many have said they smell.</li>
            <li>but I still think it&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would love this...</li>
            <li>I wish that I had bought more.</li>
            <li>so that was misleading, but it was cute.</li>
            <li>Love it super cute gave it a four cause</li>
            <li>its a very beautiful hair piece, but like the other reviews say, the star fish smells.</li>
            <li>and I could easily see using it for a beach wedding.</li>
            <li>You can easily solve this by soaking the starfish in 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup of dawn overnight</li>
            <li>Amazing beautiful little starfish</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>i loved it sooo much, it goes great with my long hair.</li>
            <li>Since it was so cheap however, I ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s larger then I thought, but it still works great to keep the hair out of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on them, and they look great in my dark hair.</li>
            <li>Giving it a 5 star because although the smell wasnt removed from the star fish, I still think its super neat and cute and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Very pretty clip, however it has rust on the clip</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be dumb but no its awesome!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty big and smells really strong of the sea, like super strong at first</li>
            <li>Maybe not quite as large as it looks in the photo, but it still measures 2 1/2&amp;#34; at its widest point!</li>
            <li>Pure D fish!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair accessory that is inexpensive &amp; cute.</li>
            <li>When I first received it and opened up the package, the first thing that hit me was the smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real Star fish it will!</li>
            <li>Thought it was my breath at first.</li>
            <li>this a real starfish!  </li>
            <li>then I thought, clench your first together</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real!  </li>
            <li>I recommend buying two, because it only comes with one, and you&#x27;ll end up wishing you had more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to get rid of it EXACTLY, but I washed itout with soup and sprayed it</li>
            <li>The starfish was pretty but it smelled like the ocean.</li>
            <li>Seriously it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>It is a cute little accessory, I just didn&#x27;t like the strong smell</li>
            <li>Of course, these are REAL starfish and thus have a certain &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>DONT USE REAL BABY STARFISH.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note that there is only 1 per order, so</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize they were real starfish.</li>
            <li>But I am extremely excited to wear this, especially when I&#x27;m out by the pool.</li>
            <li>These are well worth the low price.</li>
            <li>The first few times of use white power came off it into my hair but after that it was fine.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and it is super cute and durable as long as you dont have thick, heavy hair or are out in the wind</li>
            <li>LOOK BETTER ON THE PICTURE, WHEN I RECEIVED THEM THEY WERE BROKEN.</li>
            <li>Clip is so tiny barely grabs hair or even open</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but i think they send u a real starfish glued to a clip pretty sad threw it away immediately</li>
            <li> Very cute, just smelled bad.</li>
            <li> Got mine earlier than expected but it does smell fishy.</li>
            <li> Only other upside is that it came a lot sooner than predicted.</li>
            <li> These are fragile though so be careful!</li>
            <li> When I received this I was surprised to see it was a REAL starfish which I was questionable about putting in my hair.</li>
            <li> Well, dried sea creatures do have a bit of a smell but nothing major.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s about three fingers wide.</li>
            <li> Shows 2 you only get one an it smells like dead fish!</li>
            <li> Other than the smell</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful accessory for the summer, unfortunately I cannot wear it after finding out I just got head lice :(</li>
            <li> I took a to of star fish home with me form a trip from Denmark, I let them sit in a box for a few weeks , got them alittle wet, and the smell vanished.</li>
            <li> The only negative things about this hairclip is that the starfish smells a little.</li>
            <li> THEY KILLED BABY STARFISH</li>
            <li> They are in the garbage...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Pretty.. but it smells soooo bad... planning on airbrushing in 3 diff colors and sprayin some smell goods ...</li>
            <li> KILLED BABY STARFISH!  </li>
            <li> IT SMELLS LIKE A FRESHLY KILLED STARFISH!</li>
            <li> Not pleased with it,</li>
            <li> Though these are lovely, the smell is so terrible that I have never worn them.</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Only thing wrong is it has a bad-ish smell to it.</li>
            <li> Also, I am a little afraid to be rough with this clip because I&#x27;m scared the starfish might break or the clip will break.</li>
            <li> All though its pretty fancy looking it has an awful smell.</li>
            <li> Came in broken and it smelled i thought it may have been plastic</li>
            <li> a piece was broken off despite being wrapped by bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> BUY FAKE STARFISH AND PUT IT</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> thoroughly disappointed :/</li>
            <li> After about two days I realized that it smelled like ocean, not the candle crap but the dead fish and seaweed with a decaying starfish.</li>
            <li> They smelled so bad and they were broken too.  </li>
            <li> CRAZY IT</li>
            <li> STINKS</li>
            <li> Very faint odor.</li>
            <li> But the smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it was already broken and falling apart and it smelled like a disgusting ocean.</li>
            <li> I was kinda disappointed when I received my order.</li>
            <li> the starfish was chipped :(</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> It was so awful.</li>
            <li> When I opened the lil plastic bag with my teeth a horrible smell attacked me!  </li>
            <li> It was terrible -</li>
            <li> This smelled so bad!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very cute, just smelled bad.</li>
            <li> Pretty.. but it smells soooo bad... planning on airbrushing in 3 diff colors and sprayin some smell goods ...hopefully itll work!</li>
            <li> It is a cute little accessory, I just didn&#x27;t like the strong smell it had(fishy smell), I had to wash real good before putting it on.</li>
            <li> Shows 2 you only get one an it smells like dead fish! So gross!</li>
            <li> Clip is so tiny barely grabs hair or even open</li>
            <li> I was kinda disappointed when I received my order. The clip is very cute indeed. But as soon I opened it, some stones on the clip had come off already. It also has an odor to it. Very unpleasant. In the description it does not clarify if it comes as a pair or 1 by itself. Mine only came with 1. The price was ok. I guess you do get what you pay for. Like I said the clip is very cute. Only other upside is that it came a lot sooner than predicted.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A HEART THEY KILLED BABY STARFISH TO MAKE THE HAIR CLIP! KILLED BABY STARFISH!  BUY FAKE STARFISH AND PUT IT ON THERE DONT USE REAL BABY STARFISH. CRAZY IT STINKS IT SMELLS LIKE A FRESHLY KILLED STARFISH! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL</li>
            <li> Horrible product. I bought this to add to my costume for Halloween. When I first received it and opened up the package, the first thing that hit me was the smell. It was so awful. The next thing I noticed was that it was practically falling apart. Since it was so cheap however, I ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Giving it a 5 star because although the smell wasnt removed from the star fish, I still think its super neat and cute and shipping was fast! You can remove the scent by soaking it in isopropyl alcohol for 48 hours. No big deal.</li>
            <li> its a nice clip and all but the problem i had when i opened it the starfish was chipped :(</li>
            <li> I bought the star, and it came with a crack already in it. Not pleased with it, but I guess it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> the product looked great in the packaging, however upon closer examination they reeked of sea water and had to be placed in Clorox to get rid of smell hoever after they were fine.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful accessory for the summer, unfortunately I cannot wear it after finding out I just got head lice :( But I am extremely excited to wear this, especially when I&#x27;m out by the pool. The only negative things about this hairclip is that the starfish smells a little. But the smell is not too bad. Also, I am a little afraid to be rough with this clip because I&#x27;m scared the starfish might break or the clip will break. But other than that, it is beautiful &amp; a very good decision indeed! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair accessory that is inexpensive &amp; cute.</li>
            <li> The starfish were cuter in person. The delivery was fast. I can not wait to see them in my bridesmaids hair! Perfect for our beach wedding!</li>
            <li> Got mine earlier than expected but it does smell fishy. Hopefully soaking it in soapy water will help w/ the smell. Other than the smell I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are smelly! My kids would not wear them in their hair. They are in the garbage...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> very cute product and yes its a starfish so it will smell but if you go online there are different ways to get rid of that. Mine never arrived but I contacted them and they promptly sent a replacement. Great customer service though.</li>
            <li> Came unbroken! Amazing cause it seems fragile. Love mine! Still unbroken and i wear it alot!</li>
            <li> Love it super cute gave it a four cause I thought I was getting two because of the pick I didn&#x27;t read the description</li>
            <li> So cute! I get lots of compliments on them. :)</li>

            <li> Came in broken and it smelled i thought it may have been plastic but i think they send u a real starfish glued to a clip pretty sad threw it away immediately</li>
            <li> I got these for the beach and going to the lake. They look so awesome in the hair!</li>
            <li> Maybe not quite as large as it looks in the photo, but it still measures 2 1/2&amp;#34; at its widest point! It&#x27;s important to note that there is only 1 per order, so if you&#x27;d like 2 (like in the picture) then be sure to order two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this for an Ariel cosplay but this is great quality and I could easily see using it for a beach wedding.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. Of course, these are REAL starfish and thus have a certain &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;. You can easily solve this by soaking the starfish in 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup of dawn overnight and it smells great in the morning! These are fragile though so be careful!</li>
            <li> Amazing beautiful little starfish youll want to order more than 1! :-)</li>
            <li> These are well worth the low price. They&#x27;ll work perfect for what I need them for.  Many have said they smell. Well, dried sea creatures do have a bit of a smell but nothing major. Very faint odor. I&#x27;ll just air them out in the sun for a bit or rinse them in bleach water.</li>
            <li> its a very beautiful hair piece, but like the other reviews say, the star fish smells. it&#x27;s real Star fish it will! just leave it out for  afew days it&#x27;ll be fine. I took a to of star fish home with me form a trip from Denmark, I let them sit in a box for a few weeks , got them alittle wet, and the smell vanished. doing the same with this. it&#x27;ll work believe me. it&#x27;s larger then I thought, but it still works great to keep the hair out of my eyes. and only one come&#x27;s when you order One .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty big and smells really strong of the sea, like super strong at first but I still think it&#x27;s cute and if I feel like being a mermaid any day I can be.</li>
            <li> Cute and easy to clip in!</li>
            <li> When I opened the lil plastic bag with my teeth a horrible smell attacked me!  Pure D fish!  Thought it was my breath at first. Good heavens!  But it was the clip! P U!&lt;br /&gt;Is this a real starfish!  -Anyway I soaped it a sprayed it w perfume!  It&#x27;s fine!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Great pin. only one in pack.</li>
            <li> SMELLS suuuuuuuper FISHY</li>
            <li> a piece was broken off despite being wrapped by bubble wrap. It smells like it&#x27;s is rotten. thoroughly disappointed :/</li>
            <li> Though these are lovely, the smell is so terrible that I have never worn them.</li>
            <li> When I received this I was surprised to see it was a REAL starfish which I was questionable about putting in my hair. After about two days I realized that it smelled like ocean, not the candle crap but the dead fish and seaweed with a decaying starfish. I let it soak in warm water and dish soap and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Smells, but nothing perfume can&#x27;t fix. Awesome clip! Strong!  Smaller then I thought, clench your first together, it&#x27;s about three fingers wide. It&#x27;s real!  I thought it was going to be dumb but no its awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone talks of the smell. However, if you take the time to soak them in alcohol overnight, or for about 10 hours, you can&#x27;t smell it at all. These were super cute and the perfect size! I recommend buying two, because it only comes with one, and you&#x27;ll end up wishing you had more. The clips are well on there, and holds hair well. Definitely recommend, perfect to achieve that adorable beachy look!</li>
            <li> It was terrible - I didn&#x27;t realize they were real starfish. They smelled so bad and they were broken too.  Would never order these again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would love this... had it actually come in the mail.</li>
            <li> Very pretty clip, however it has rust on the clip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Florida girl and I see these everywhere, but they&#x27;re always on a flimsy clasp that breaks within a day. Not this one! I use it daily and it&#x27;s perfect! It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or leave a crease!</li>
            <li> LOOK BETTER ON THE PICTURE, WHEN I RECEIVED THEM THEY WERE BROKEN. NOT HAPPY WITH PURCHASE. DO IT YOUR SELF</li>
            <li> All though its pretty fancy looking it has an awful smell. I don&#x27;t know how to get rid of it EXACTLY, but I washed itout with soup and sprayed it but the smell is still there. :|</li>
            <li> Very nice but they smell!!</li>
            <li> This item was so beautiful I wish that I had bought more.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these hair accessories and will be buying more. I get so many compliments on them, and they look great in my dark hair.</li>
            <li> The starfish was pretty but it smelled like the ocean. I tried to wash out the smell but it didn&#x27;t work. So I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it is super cute and durable as long as you dont have thick, heavy hair or are out in the wind</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it was already broken and falling apart and it smelled like a disgusting ocean. It was two dollars but it was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> I thought it came with two but only one came so that was misleading, but it was cute. The first few times of use white power came off it into my hair but after that it was fine.</li>
            <li> This smelled so bad!!! Seriously it&#x27;s pretty but no one wants to walk around smelling like dead starfish</li>
            <li> i loved it sooo much, it goes great with my long hair.</li>
            <li> Came in great shape. No chips or cracks. Only thing wrong is it has a bad-ish smell to it. Like it came from the ocean and kind of concentrated a bit</li>
