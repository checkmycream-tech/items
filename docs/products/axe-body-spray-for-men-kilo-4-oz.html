            <li>Two thumbs up ;-)</li>
            <li>Smells like a tuna sandwich when you leave it in your locker all day on a hot day.</li>
            <li>At first, it seems this stuff can smell strange, but, for me, it seem to get a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, masculine scent&lt;br</li>

            <li>but it was tqken so much time</li>
            <li>The only down side is that the price is definitely over the top!  </li>

            <li>As much as I love the smell the little can received is not worth the price I paid!</li>

            <li> One short spray is enough to last you for the better part of the day, plus it doesn&#x27;t smell bad when you sweat.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Too much is overpowering in a bad way</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift, very hard to find body  spray in Kilo.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed please sell what you advertise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> Okay, Kilo has got to be the best AXE bodyspray out there.  One short spray is enough to last you for the better part of the day, plus it doesn&#x27;t smell bad when you sweat.  Here&#x27;s an overview:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Fresh, masculine scent&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Too much is overpowering in a bad way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product.  You definitely get your bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. Axe will probably discontinue it now!</li>
            <li> At first, it seems this stuff can smell strange, but, for me, it seem to get a lot better.  I wear it all the time, and I get no complaints.  :)</li>
            <li> This is my Husbands favorite Axe and I must say I think it smells yummy on him ! Two thumbs up ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of all AXE products.  Period.  Order it and make your sweetie happy.  You won&#x27;t regret this buy.</li>
            <li> I think this smells great.  I bought this for my husband and he really likes it as well.  The only down side is that the price is definitely over the top!  As much as I love the smell the little can received is not worth the price I paid!</li>
            <li> Product differs from image displayed. All said and done, this is the best product in the AXE range of bodysprays. Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally. The body spray came as advertised, and was undamaged. The scent is exactly what I was expecting, and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Was sent incorrect scent and used it had tried to get to a person and return it for the correct one but it was tqken so much time I couldnt&#x27;t wait so iI used this scent any way. I don&#x27;t know why no one checked it for the proper scent. I don&#x27;t feel like this was appropiate.. - No reply for this..</li>
            <li> Smells like a tuna sandwich when you leave it in your locker all day on a hot day. Think I may of gotten a mislabeled bottle of Axe Tuna-ilo</li>
            <li> The pic shows the old round top can which i wanted because the new can doesn&#x27;t smell the same.Highly disappointed please sell what you advertise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift, very hard to find body  spray in Kilo. I could find everything else but the spray., My husband loves it!</li>
