    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very Impressed.</li>
            <li>In my experience, this is the best beard trimmer ever made,and it&#x27;s out of production.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in three days, too, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about eight months now, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for over a year now, and it&#x27;s still perfect.</li>
            <li>Also, the separate moustache trimmer is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for both hair and beards.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;precision blades - the best Ive tried</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>I ordered two of these shavers, and they both work great, but one of the chargers didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>This is a great refurb deal.</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>This is really a great trimmer - just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful thing to own.</li>
            <li>I emailed Shaver Outlet, telling them that I wanted to return it for a good one.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s fair,</li>
            <li>A good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>A reburished items is good for our environment &amp; your wallet.</li>
            <li>I had one of these and loved it</li>
            <li>I bought this refurbished trimmer and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I got this primarily to trim my mustache and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my son, because he liked the one had</li>
            <li>I had tried out two others and neither one was nearly as effective.  </li>
            <li>He came out of the bathroom and said \\&quot; I have never had anything that works as good as this.. Please order more...</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li>Then, I began an odyssey from store to store, examining shavers by peering through clear plastic clamshells as best</li>
            <li>and as far as I am concerned, the Wahl is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>The design is great and makes safe and very close shaves.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure pleased they are available on a refurbished basis!</li>
            <li>This trimmer does a phenomenal job for what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Blessed with a contour-rich face, I found that interesting.</li>
            <li>A razor popped up that appeared identical to the razor that I had enjoyed for so many years.</li>
            <li>I shave about three times a week, occasionally more often on request, and the razor can go about three weeks between charges.</li>
            <li>All I can say is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I HAVE A PRECISION MB40 AND LOVE</li>
            <li>I bought this for personal grooming, and it is working wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I order 2 more</li>
            <li>Great product; easy to use the first time.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>It also has a pop out trimmer, which I don&#x27;t use, that provides more precise trimming, perhaps for a goatee.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I now own two of these models, the first one is still going strong after six years.  </li>
            <li>But it works just fine plugged in.</li>
            <li>Some came with a half dozen heads that did marvelous things to your beard; a SensoTech razor with Gyroflex technology promised to follow every contour of my face.</li>
            <li>Because of its light weight it is easy to maneuver around around my neck and either side of my face.</li>
            <li>Getting a refurbished was a fantastic alternative.  </li>
            <li>The review I read said it was a great shaver and being a referb I bought 2 for the low price.  </li>
            <li>Does everything I need with no problems, easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It shaves great, holds a charge for a long time and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Used the new one for two weeks to make sure of no issues, strong battery</li>
            <li>&quot; It is a chore to keep my beard and  mustache neat, and the shaver  was a wonderful instrument to trim the long hairs on the sides and front and neatly shape the areas that I wanted to keep clear.</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;ll have two good chargers and three trimmers, which ought to last me for life.way-style beard</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;ll have two good chargers and three trimmers, which ought to last me for life.</li>
            <li>I finally found a good trimmer and it is discontinued.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mention earlier that the original charging problem turned out to be the charger, not the trimmer, so when Shaver Outlet sent me a new one--with a new charger included--I ended up with a good charger and two good trimmers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve trimmed many a beard and moustache over the past 40 years and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used, period.</li>
            <li>Mine are the MB30s, no longer available, but almost exactly like the MB40.  </li>
            <li>Trims quickly and evenly the first time you use it--zero learning curve.</li>
            <li>Not a lot to say other than it does what it says and is good at it.  </li>
            <li>Right now two units need replaceing.  </li>
            <li>It is sleeker and has two rubberized strips along either side that are not only attractive but make the razor easier to hold, especially for those tricky manipulations around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>and he likes it very much.</li>
            <li>so far, it is working fine.  </li>
            <li>The head adjustments give me exactly what I want for length.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased and plan to buy another one for a second location.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is obvious that I was pleased with my purchase, but now about 16 months after putting the razor into service, the battery no longer holds a charge.  </li>
            <li>So for those of you who might be contemplating buying a \\&quot;rebuilt\\&quot; razor be aware of the limitations.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted in a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was pretty PO&#x27;d that it wasn&#x27;t being made by the Mfg</li>
            <li>was pretty pricey compared to finding this model here at Amazon.    </li>
            <li>, I could not get the exact model I had, but this was very close</li>
            <li>My first beard trimmer, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I shook it, banged it smartly on my hand, plugged the power cord in and out, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I found the Remington trimmer to be large and unwieldy for me.  </li>
            <li>Did I really want a used razor, a razor someone else discarded perhaps laden with yucky hair?</li>
            <li>It is well-made,  feels solid and fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;a very well put together machine,</li>
            <li>One relatively minor annoyance is the charging light does not indicate when the razor is fully charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am disabled and have some difficulty getting my hands to cooperate and perhaps because of that I preferred the size of the Wahl trimmer much more than the rather large Remington.  </li>
            <li>I was less than pleased with the clip-on guide provided by Wahl</li>
            <li>And I got the good one in less overall time than I had expected for the original one anyway.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the easy height adjustment and the fact that it stays in place, unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>The only reason we had to purchase it was because we dropped the first one!</li>
            <li>It arrived packaged well with all new accessories.  </li>
            <li>Works well , no problems so far .Seems to be decent quality from what i see.  </li>
            <li>Since this is a discontinued model, I&#x27;m tempted to buy another one while supplies are still available in case my the first one breaks down sometime in the future.</li>
            <li>My old shaver was purchased new, and has metal mail shaving blades.</li>
            <li>Another BIG bonus with this thing is that it will run for several weeks on a full charge.</li>
            <li>ive had lot of trimmers and ive killed them all this one is still going strong</li>
            <li>The trimmer arrived in spotless condition, works completely well</li>
            <li>I cannot offer much on its durability because after two attempts I came back and purchased a Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is our second one and we find it very dependable.  </li>
            <li>stand - this lends the unit to frequent drops</li>
            <li>Examining it carefully and shaking it over white paper it appeared to be squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I also read what other people said about this Trimmer and they were very positive.</li>
            <li>Used the trimmer on my Hemingway-style beard every other day and it was still running at full speed when we got back.</li>
            <li>Bought this one to have for when the first gives up the ghost as they are getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback - and unfortunately this is a HUGE drawback - is that it totally lacks juice when it&#x27;s being used free from an electrical connection.</li>
            <li>(a la General Lee and others)</li>
            <li>It holds a charge long enough to trim my whole beard a couple of times over.</li>
            <li>This is my third Wahl [I&#x27;m 63 years old]</li>
            <li>One for 19 yr old son and a back up for hubby.....</li>
            <li>He wanted the same trimmer as he had before, but he was really surprised when the item came with enhanced features.</li>
            <li>I really like the length adjustment which unlike the other two I had, stays in place.  </li>
            <li>While similar to my old shaver it was nonetheless different.</li>
            <li>BTW, one of my trimers has a stainless steel blade and the other has a white ceramic blade, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference in use.</li>
            <li>I am picky and this thing surprised me with its effectiveness and how long it will last on a charge.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is so hard to find a replacement model for this.  Getting a refurbished was a fantastic alternative.  If they have this, go for it!</li>
            <li> Works well , no problems so far .Seems to be decent quality from what i see.  Only complaint was high postage cost</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these shavers, and they both work great, but one of the chargers didn&#x27;t work.  I sent them an email, and the very next day I received a replacement charger!</li>
            <li> I got this primarily to trim my mustache and it works great.  The head adjustments give me exactly what I want for length.  I don&#x27;t use it often and so far the initial charge shows no sign of slowing down.  This is a great refurb deal.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of this trimmer on Amazon, I canceled my order for a more expensive model. After receiving the trimmer and using it, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Even though it is advertised as \\&quot;refurbished\\&quot; the only thing different from brand-new was the box. I particularly like the easy height adjustment and the fact that it stays in place, unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve had. Since this is a discontinued model, I&#x27;m tempted to buy another one while supplies are still available in case my the first one breaks down sometime in the future.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s hard to complain. The only drawback - and unfortunately this is a HUGE drawback - is that it totally lacks juice when it&#x27;s being used free from an electrical connection. I have tried twice now to leave it charged for 24 hours only to find it die on me shortly after disconnecting the unit from the power source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGE disappointment. But it works just fine plugged in.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim up my neckline once or twice a week and leave it on charge otherwise and so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, because he liked the one had, I could not get the exact model I had, but this was very close and he likes it very much. I also read what other people said about this Trimmer and they were very positive.</li>
            <li> Have used infrequently.  Holds its charge well.  Still working with adjustable settings.  Seems to cut beard hair well.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I was a little worry about making this purchase. Shock that it worked so well. Very Impressed.</li>
            <li> Not a lot to say other than it does what it says and is good at it.  A tad noisy compared to my former shaver, but a small point.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary buying a reconditioned shaver but took the plunge anyway.  It arrived packaged well with all new accessories.  I would never have known it was \\&quot;used\\&quot;.  The design is great and makes safe and very close shaves.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> In my experience, this is the best beard trimmer ever made,and it&#x27;s out of production.  I looked several times,and only found this refurbished version by luck.  so far, it is working fine.  I am pleased and plan to buy another one for a second location.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about purchasing a \\&quot;refurbished\\&quot; trimmer, but at the low price and lots of 5-star reviews, I gave it a shot. I figured Shaver Outlet would send it to me in 7-10 days. It arrived in three. Unfortunately, it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I emailed Shaver Outlet, telling them that I wanted to return it for a good one. They emailed me right back, apologizing, saying there was no need to return the bad trimmer, and informing me that they were mailing me another one. It arrived in three days, too, and it works perfectly. Great product; easy to use the first time. And I got the good one in less overall time than I had expected for the original one anyway. A 5-star Shaver Outlet performance for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (2010/12/21) Well, I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about eight months now, and it&#x27;s perfect. Trims quickly and evenly the first time you use it--zero learning curve. I used to use one of those tiny TV-advertised trimmers to trim my eyebrows. Took a couple of minutes. This Remington MB-40 will do that tiny job in about five seconds. Another BIG bonus with this thing is that it will run for several weeks on a full charge. My wife and I went on a three and one-half week road trip recently and I purposely didn&#x27;t take the charger with me. Used the trimmer on my Hemingway-style beard every other day and it was still running at full speed when we got back. Since I didn&#x27;t need to take the charger with me, I ran no risk of leaving it pugged into a motel room somewhere. I&#x27;d give this thing ten stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (2011/05/15) I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for over a year now, and it&#x27;s still perfect. I didn&#x27;t mention earlier that the original charging problem turned out to be the charger, not the trimmer, so when Shaver Outlet sent me a new one--with a new charger included--I ended up with a good charger and two good trimmers. BTW, one of my trimers has a stainless steel blade and the other has a white ceramic blade, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference in use. I still have a Hemingway-style beard and I still trim it every other day, and each of my trimmers will go a month or two without needing a recharge. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering again, just to get a backup charger. Then I&#x27;ll have two good chargers and three trimmers, which ought to last me for life.way-style beard and I still trim it every other day, and each of my trimmers will go a month or two without needing a recharge.

            <li> This is really a great trimmer - just what I was looking for.  I had tried out two others and neither one was nearly as effective.  I really like the length adjustment which unlike the other two I had, stays in place.  Also, the separate moustache trimmer is excellent.  I do not know why they discontinued making this model but I am sure pleased they are available on a refurbished basis!</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these identical shavers. My old shaver was purchased new, and has metal mail shaving blades. This shaver has PLASTIC blades.  I do not understand this.  But beware.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a phenomenal job for what I paid for it.  It holds a charge long enough to trim my whole beard a couple of times over.</li>
            <li> One day the Remington electric shaver that I received for Christmas a few years ago stopped and, like the proverbial grandfather&#x27;s clock, \\&quot;Never to run again.\\&quot; It is a chore to keep my beard and  mustache neat, and the shaver  was a wonderful instrument to trim the long hairs on the sides and front and neatly shape the areas that I wanted to keep clear. I relied on the shaver exclusively, glaring at any barber who offered to trim my beard; now it was broken. I shook it, banged it smartly on my hand, plugged the power cord in and out, but nothing worked. Then, I began an odyssey from store to store, examining shavers by peering through clear plastic clamshells as best I could.  Some came with a half dozen heads that did marvelous things to your beard; a SensoTech razor with Gyroflex technology promised to follow every contour of my face. Blessed with a contour-rich face, I found that interesting. Another had Ultratech technology and could be used wet or dry; with visions of being electrocuted at my bathroom sink, I put that one back.  Another came with \\&quot;cut and lift\\&quot; that sounded a bit too athletic.&lt;br /&gt; I searched a long time and all the while my beard continued to flourish-as noted by my wife.  So I resorted to using a scissors and a comb  (a la General Lee and others) while I continued my quest. This worked for the longer hairs but was useless around my neck, and I visualized General Lee with a hairy neck.&lt;br /&gt;As my wife&#x27;s interest intensified, I went on Amazon, typed in Remington Precision electric razors, and voila! A razor popped up that appeared identical to the razor that I had enjoyed for so many years. Joyfully, I proceeded with my order until I noted the warning \\&quot;these are rebuilt razors.\\&quot; My heart skipped a beat. Did I really want a used razor, a razor someone else discarded perhaps laden with yucky hair? I hesitated for a few days, but finally ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;The package from Amazon arrived promptly and I opened it cautiously outside in my shop. Examining it carefully and shaking it over white paper it appeared to be squeaky clean. While similar to my old shaver it was nonetheless different. It is sleeker and has two rubberized strips along either side that are not only attractive but make the razor easier to hold, especially for those tricky manipulations around my mouth.  It is well-made,  feels solid and fits comfortably in my hand.  Because of its light weight it is easy to maneuver around around my neck and either side of my face. The depth of the cut is set with a numbered dial that is manipulated with the thumb, and a white numbered dial \\&quot;remembers\\&quot; the setting. A removable head straightens up the hairs for trimming. With the guard removed the bared cutting edge can be used to trim my mustache. It also has a pop out trimmer, which I don&#x27;t use, that provides more precise trimming, perhaps for a goatee.&lt;br /&gt; It comes with a detachable power cord and a long lived battery.  I shave about three times a week, occasionally more often on request, and the razor can go about three weeks between charges. One relatively minor annoyance is the charging light does not indicate when the razor is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;It is obvious that I was pleased with my purchase, but now about 16 months after putting the razor into service, the battery no longer holds a charge.  My inquiry to Amazon was forwarded to Shaver outlet who replied that they accept returns for 30 days, and Remington guarantees rebuilt shavers for one year.  I guess that&#x27;s fair, but not what I was expecting.  So for those of you who might be contemplating buying a \\&quot;rebuilt\\&quot; razor be aware of the limitations.</li>
            <li> The trimmer arrived in spotless condition, works completely well, I&#x27;ve had it for weeks and used it several times and still have never had to plug it in.  This is exactly what I wanted in a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer as a replacement for my Wahl beard trimmer that was showing its age.  I was less than pleased with the clip-on guide provided by Wahl so I bought this trimmer because of the built-in guide.  I found the Remington trimmer to be large and unwieldy for me.  I am disabled and have some difficulty getting my hands to cooperate and perhaps because of that I preferred the size of the Wahl trimmer much more than the rather large Remington.  I cannot offer much on its durability because after two attempts I came back and purchased a Wahl trimmer.  This is my third Wahl [I&#x27;m 63 years old] and as far as I am concerned, the Wahl is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I have three of these razors.  Mine are the MB30s, no longer available, but almost exactly like the MB40.  I keep one in my suitcase and have one in each house.  Right now two units need replaceing.  The batteries are no longer working properly.  I&#x27;m replacing both units now with the MB40.  I&#x27;ve bought some others to replace these but I don&#x27;t like them as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent for both hair and beards.  A good value for the money.  A reburished items is good for our environment &amp; your wallet.</li>
            <li> My first beard trimmer, and I really like it.  The review I read said it was a great shaver and being a referb I bought 2 for the low price.  I&#x27;m set know for some time to come.  It shaves great, holds a charge for a long time and is easy to use.  Does everything I need with no problems, easy to clean too.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trimmed many a beard and moustache over the past 40 years and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used, period.</li>
            <li> I had one of these and loved it but when I moved recently a refrigerator crushed it.    I was pretty PO&#x27;d that it wasn&#x27;t being made by the Mfg and it&#x27;s replacement was pretty pricey compared to finding this model here at Amazon.    Killer deal, killer price, works as well as the crushed one ever did.</li>
            <li> I now own two of these models, the first one is still going strong after six years.  Bought this one to have for when the first gives up the ghost as they are getting harder to find.  Used the new one for two weeks to make sure of no issues, strong battery no problems.  When looking at trimmers, pay close attention to those silly attachments, take it from someone who knows, those attachments fall off after the trimmer has some wear.  I prefer one with a single guard like the MB40 with a slide lever to adjust trimming needs.    Trimmers with vacuums do NOT shave as close, i.e. the location of the vacuums and are not all they are cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> All I can say is outstanding. I finally found a good trimmer and it is discontinued. I bought this refurbished trimmer and am very pleased with it. I am picky and this thing surprised me with its effectiveness and how long it will last on a charge. Very good.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A PRECISION MB40 AND LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DOG ATE MY CHARGING CORD AND NOW IT DOES NOT WORK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES anybody know where I CAN GET A  &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;CHARGING CORD&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; THAT PLUGS IN WALL FOR MY MB40. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  It said factory refurbished, but you could have fooled me!  This is our second one and we find it very dependable.  The only reason we had to purchase it was because we dropped the first one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before and it eventually died, but after a year or two.  I wish there was one additional close crop setting between the closest and the next up, but still a relatively dependable product.</li>
            <li> Had a couple of problems because of bad electrical cord, but they were so quick at trying to solve that I still had to go with 5 stars !</li>
            <li> I bought this for personal grooming, and it is working wonderfully. I appreaciate the built in guard, and the cordless ability.    Wonderful thing to own.</li>
            <li> I got one of these Remington mb 40 and my hubby used it and I would of thought he hit the millon dollar ticket. He came out of the bathroom and said \\&quot; I have never had anything that works as good as this.. Please order more... So I did I order 2 more&gt;&gt;&gt; One for 19 yr old son and a back up for hubby.....</li>
            <li> My husband could not be happier! He wanted the same trimmer as he had before, but he was really surprised when the item came with enhanced features. It arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li> Used the product for a little while, but after 6 months this trimmer refused a charge and would no longer turn on.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;price&lt;br /&gt;precision blades - the best Ive tried&lt;br /&gt;long life battery&lt;br /&gt;a very well put together machine, a stand-out among a sea of wannabees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no stand - this lends the unit to frequent drops&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a bit too rounded to hold ideally&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the device&#x27;s rotary setting to toggle between hair height LACKS numbers for accuracy</li>
            <li> i love this trimmer it cuts thru my very thick beard  and barley bog&#x27;s down. ive had lot of trimmers and ive killed them all this one is still going strong</li>
