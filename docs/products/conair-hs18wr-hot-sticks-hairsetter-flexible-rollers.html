            <li>Quick and easy to use!</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and the curl lasts, even with my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The openings fit both sizes.  </li>
            <li>The curlers do not get very hot and the end slips out of the loop.</li>

            <li>As far as the gripping on to the roller, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought them for my 12 year old granddaughter, she found them easy to use with the desired results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that there is any way the model on the box was able to curl her hair with only those 14 rollers to get that effect.  </li>
            <li>the extra money on a better one.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get it to work very well.  </li>
            <li>and I have very longhair.</li>
            <li>my old ones were almost to hot to handle</li>

            <li>Gets hot enough but it is hot to handle when bending.  </li>
            <li>second they don&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li>I was excited to read in the instructions that you can order additional rollers of either size for a minimal price.</li>
            <li>Maybe a look for some new science fiction character, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>first thing is they only have 14 rollers my old set had 20 and</li>
            <li>At least for this baby fine hair!</li>
            <li>Just what I ordered, works very well, about the only thing that will curl my hair</li>
            <li>So, I ended up with slightly curly roots and straight ends.  </li>
            <li>hair must be long enough to wind well over the ends or they won&#x27;t work and bending a hot roller is not fun.  </li>

            <li> I was disappointed, but didn&#x27;t send it back because I did use them.</li>

            <li> Perfect curls every time.  I will never use the tiny tight curlers, tho, so will have to find someone who likes that size and trade sticks.  The openings fit both sizes.  Other reviewers mentioned burning their hands but I have not had that problem.  I put them in while my hair is still damp, then put on my makeup.  By the time I&#x27;m done, my curls are set and dry.  Quick and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the overall experience.  I realize that there were only 14 rollers, but I expected them to be larger.

            <li> Hard to get the hair on the roller.</li>
            <li> I bought for my mom who has short hair and they work so well. So easy to use. I used them too and I have very longhair. The results were amazing!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; are great</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered these.  I have fine hair, and these work very well.  They&#x27;re easy to use and the curl lasts, even with my fine hair.  I was excited to read in the instructions that you can order additional rollers of either size for a minimal price.</li>
            <li> I used these way back in the 80 s they work great ! only thing that works on my hair. Then they stopped making them ???I found them here on amazon, and they are like brand new !</li>
            <li> They work great but Walmart has them for 20 bucks!</li>
            <li> Want curls this product does the job!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> The curlers do not get very hot and the end slips out of the loop.</li>
            <li> Not as good of a product as I had hoped... The rollers dont get very warm, even after you wait the full time. And it seems like its pretty cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spend the extra money on a better one.</li>
            <li> I love them!  Work great, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great description and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered, works very well, about the only thing that will curl my hair</li>
            <li> Super price, work great. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Would be okay for longer hair.  Gets hot enough but it is hot to handle when bending.  On my pixie length hair, the hair reds pop out as I bend the curler. So, I ended up with slightly curly roots and straight ends.  Maybe a look for some new science fiction character, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair must be long enough to wind well over the ends or they won&#x27;t work and bending a hot roller is not fun.  Called Conair to ask if the sold clips for the rollers and the customer service rep was very rude but told me no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the curlers.</li>
            <li> I got these for my mom and she loves them. They are easier for her to use than other curlers. I would highly recommend these hot curlers to anyone with shorter, thin hair! They work great!</li>
            <li> I had these rollers in the 80&#x27;s and all through the nineties I loaned them to someone and never got them back I loved the ones I had before... these are the same brand and they look the same but...  the difference is that they are not as they used to be..... first thing is they only have 14 rollers my old set had 20 and second they don&#x27;t get very hot my old ones were almost to hot to handle but I always got great results these just don&#x27;t cut it I&#x27;m better off finding a vintage set on eBay</li>
            <li> I had a set of these several years ago and they haven&#x27;t changed a bit.  Totally love the curl it gives my hear and the curl lasts forever!  Great product.  Such speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 12 year old granddaughter, she found them easy to use with the desired results.</li>
            <li> Helps make and keep those curls no matter the length or fineness of your hair.  Would suggest some type of product to help with body to roots before using.  At least for this baby fine hair!</li>
            <li> Something about the curl I don&#x27;t like but I kept it</li>
