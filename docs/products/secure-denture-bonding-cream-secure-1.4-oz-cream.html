            <li>good item!</li>
            <li>It holds great and hardens like cement.</li>
            <li>I have been using another zinc based product and even though it is not the best for you, it works much better than this product.</li>
            <li>GOOD...</li>
            <li>Their website is not even any good for anything.</li>
            <li>Best stuff on the market, I wish it were available in stores and not just online.</li>
            <li>Since I started wearing dentures recently, I have tried every adhesive I could find in order to choose the best that suited me.&lt;br /&gt;I found out that two adhesive products worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to receive my Amazon placed order so quickly and packaged perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I immediately ordered more to have on hand!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>If you need liners, then get that and the Secure, and your dentures will fit perfect and you can eat anything.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Now-first thing to think about is this: Do my dentures fit good?</li>
            <li>This is very important.</li>
            <li>I can go for hours with the top plate very secure.</li>
            <li>--I use it to make sure the uppers don&#x27;t wander away by themselves.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product works better than anything I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>What more can be asked of a product?  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased and grateful.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>said it works better then most</li>
            <li>This does work better than anything I have tried to date.  </li>
            <li>This adhesive allows her to feel more secure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real easy and fast.</li>
            <li>It can be applied as quickly and easily as the water soluble adhesives, but it is more comfortable and longer lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>works better than poly dent has no after taste holds up great even on loose bridge</li>
            <li>This is buy far the best product I used so far.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for holding your lower denture solid, no movement eating steak,</li>
            <li>I went in for cheap dentures which I don&#x27;t recommend anybody else to do, if they can help it.  </li>
            <li>in the short term it works great just not 12 hours as purported in the ad.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Secure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please keep SECURE in stock, I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li>I would compare to Fixodent original and a&lt;br /&gt;bit cheaper, has a thicker consistency and holds very&lt;</li>
            <li>For a super hold, sprinkle powdered Fixodent over the Secure once you have it spread on the denture.</li>
            <li>It wears off as soon as I eat a full meal.</li>
            <li>I will say the product does hold better than all the others I have tried, but this product is very over rated..</li>
            <li>No Bad taste, lots of confidence while using it.</li>
            <li>This adhesive does grab on pretty strong...</li>
            <li>The lower dentures, make sure you don&#x27;t put too much, you will learn the right amount as you use this adhesive.  </li>
            <li>If you do it right, and it&#x27;s easy, and use both products, your going to have teeth that feel and act very real and are held in like their screwed in.</li>
            <li>There was no unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li>The first &#x27;Cushion Grip&#x27; is also excellent, but hard to apply, although with practice it becomes easier to use.</li>
            <li>Only lasts about 6 hours at best then the denture gets loose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In order to become effective, one has to wait about 20 minutes before starting his meal.</li>
            <li>second, &#x27;Secure&#x27; is very easy to apply, and lasts for the whole</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;adhesive is superior to other adhesive products I have tried, and that is &amp;#34;many&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This will hold up for 12 hours, if you apply it right.</li>
            <li>It only lasts about 4hours, but its better than any other product of its kind!</li>
            <li>/&gt;slightly less longer but GOOD</li>
            <li>thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>Any residue left after removing my dentures was easily and quickly removable.  </li>
            <li>Bought this and another high rated product for my husband who has full set dentures.</li>
            <li>Be aware that Proctor and Gamble, the owner of Fixodent, is being sued for the zinc in their product.</li>
            <li>I think that this denture adhesive cream would be more a personal judgement.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with being able to actually eat something when wearing my dentures for years.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>I am amazed at some of the negative reviews as this is by far the best holding denture adhesive current available.</li>
            <li>The top ones fit well without any denture product, but the bottom ones are a little deformed.  </li>
            <li>Holds all day long, Love it.</li>
            <li>and I am very particular how I proceed in getting this paste to work.  </li>
            <li>I make sure the denture is completely dry and apply it according to the instructions.  </li>
            <li>I use Secure on the strange-shaped bottom dentures when I want staying power that lasts until I&#x27;m out of public, and it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>and she can eat anything she wants without worry.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know side effects</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work too well on my lowers, but that is because i don&#x27;t have much gum line</li>
            <li>Overall though this is the best product for holding ill fitting dentures, especially the lower ones.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I have seen that carries this Secure product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is any better than any of the other denture pastes and powders I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product for my bottom denture.  </li>
            <li>It does hold a little  better  than  </li>
            <li>But, you can do the new liner yourself.</li>
            <li>got this for a co-worker with new dentures, he had been struggling to find an adhesive that worked...</li>
            <li>Closest stores are in new York City or buy on line.</li>
            <li>Only thing I have found is that it does not last 12 hours,  but it does last longer than most.</li>
            <li>If they are loose and rock around or don&#x27;t sit right, then nothing will keep them in.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it gives a twinge of a bite on gum if you have had a problem and made a sore spot from eating when dentures were not tight.  </li>
            <li>Top dentures, you would only need a very small amount, just in one place.  </li>
            <li>Regular denture adhesives completely dissolve from my lower dentures within an hour or two.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like this adhesive.</li>
            <li>The Secure takes less then the other waterbased brands.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves no residual taste in the mouth, and can easily be wiped off the denture, and reapplied when it gets weak, or before a meal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed that there seems to be fewer sellers on Amazon for the product and with the available sellers, it takes 3 times longer to receive my Secure denture cream.</li>
            <li>This product actually worked and my dentures stayed in and secure after hours of hot and cold drinks.</li>
            <li>His lowers were a little troublesome and Fixodent and Poligrip weren&#x27;t really keeping them in place.</li>

            <li> His lowers were a little troublesome and Fixodent and Poligrip weren&#x27;t really keeping them in place.</li>
            <li> They both are insoluble in water, which makes them last long.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t apply it as you would other commercial products; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and she had a difficult time keeping them in her mouth securely until she found this product online through amazon.</li>
            <li> Depressed that I had to have my teeth pulled and sorry until I used Secure.</li>
            <li> Fixadent lasts about an hour on the bottom dentures, and polident doesn&#x27;t make it that long</li>
            <li> although initially it was a firm hold the length of time it actually held was about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> The only draw back in my opinion, it&#x27;s really hard to remove from my plate.</li>
            <li> This only needs 3 small dabs on the bottom.</li>
            <li> when the item arrived the box was prized open and there was no seal on the cover, i was forced to throw it away</li>
            <li> It does sting for about a minute and a half</li>
            <li> but if you get even a little  film of it on your teeth  </li>
            <li> The cream oozes out from under the denture and you swallow it.</li>
            <li> The tube seemed a little small compared to the picture.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all the denture suffers everywhere.</li>
            <li> Very little adhesive is needed for each application, and it thus becomes cheaper to use than the water soluble ones.</li>
            <li> Worked no better than the stuff I buy a LOT cheaper at Wal Mart</li>
            <li> The cleaner is also very expensive and the quantity per box is far to small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> This glue gets hard, it burns</li>
            <li> corn on the cob etc.for at least 8-10 hours.  </li>
            <li> Some of the negative reviews you see are company plants.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> and they are trying very hard to block this product from coming to the stores.</li>
            <li> The cost to buy on line is expensive considering you also have to pay ridiculous shipping and handling fees.</li>
            <li> it works barely but has an awful smell and should you taste any</li>
            <li> It is expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was desperate, nothing held my dentures in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, but this should be taken off the market!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy,but it is rather expensive!</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>
            <li> this is a horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is great for holding your lower denture solid, no movement eating steak, corn on the cob etc.for at least 8-10 hours.  I sometimes replace with another application after that time, especially if I plan to dine out later etc.</li>
            <li> It does hold a little  better  than  the store bought  denture adhesive but if you get even a little  film of it on your teeth  it&#x27;s hard to get off. When you eat it does loosen  up a bit. Does not last 12 hrs.</li>
            <li> when the item arrived the box was prized open and there was no seal on the cover, i was forced to throw it away</li>
            <li> I am amazed at some of the negative reviews as this is by far the best holding denture adhesive current available. This will not get in your mouth or fall apart when you eat. This will hold up for 12 hours, if you apply it right. Now-first thing to think about is this: Do my dentures fit good? If they are loose and rock around or don&#x27;t sit right, then nothing will keep them in. But, you can do the new liner yourself. Get some Cushion Grip on here and read the directions. It&#x27;s real easy and fast. For a super hold, sprinkle powdered Fixodent over the Secure once you have it spread on the denture. These two work great together!   If you need liners, then get that and the Secure, and your dentures will fit perfect and you can eat anything. The Cushion Grip only needs to be reapplied every month or two. It holds great and hardens like cement. The Secure takes less then the other waterbased brands. This only needs 3 small dabs on the bottom. I smear it in, let it sit for a minute, then pop em in. If you do it right, and it&#x27;s easy, and use both products, your going to have teeth that feel and act very real and are held in like their screwed in. Be aware that Proctor and Gamble, the owner of Fixodent, is being sued for the zinc in their product. This has none and they are trying very hard to block this product from coming to the stores. Some of the negative reviews you see are company plants. Don&#x27;t be fooled, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to receive my Amazon placed order so quickly and packaged perfectly.  This dental&lt;br /&gt;adhesive is superior to other adhesive products I have tried, and that is &amp;#34;many&amp;#34;.  I would recommend it&lt;br /&gt;highly to anyone who is considering its usage.</li>
            <li> I went in for cheap dentures which I don&#x27;t recommend anybody else to do, if they can help it.  The top ones fit well without any denture product, but the bottom ones are a little deformed.  (I&#x27;m the only person of whom I know who can clench their teeth and stick their tongue out at the same time.)  Fixadent lasts about an hour on the bottom dentures, and polident doesn&#x27;t make it that long--I use it to make sure the uppers don&#x27;t wander away by themselves.  I use Secure on the strange-shaped bottom dentures when I want staying power that lasts until I&#x27;m out of public, and it works like a charm.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It works as stated. Definitely holds for longer periods of time. I think that this denture adhesive cream would be more a personal judgement. It is expensive.</li>
            <li> The best there is on the market to date. Unless you can screw in your dentures this stuff is your best bet.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected. I can go for hours with the top plate very secure. I can chew meat. I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> This product works better than anything I&#x27;ve used to date. What more can be asked of a product?  I am quite pleased and grateful.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the best. I have tried all i can buy at the drug store and this one works. I highly recommend it to all the denture suffers everywhere.</li>
            <li> it works barely but has an awful smell and should you taste any you would probably gag.  I would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Bought this and another high rated product for my husband who has full set dentures. His lowers were a little troublesome and Fixodent and Poligrip weren&#x27;t really keeping them in place. I read the reviews and gave this a try, didn&#x27;t help at all. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with being able to actually eat something when wearing my dentures for years. This product actually worked and my dentures stayed in and secure after hours of hot and cold drinks. Regular denture adhesives completely dissolve from my lower dentures within an hour or two.  Any residue left after removing my dentures was easily and quickly removable.  There was no unpleasant taste. I immediately ordered more to have on hand!</li>
            <li> good item! thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> also brought 4 grandma;she said it works better then most</li>
            <li> Horrible product! Does not hold at ALL!! I&#x27;m sorry to say, but this should be taken off the market! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> My aunt had to get dentures recently and she had a difficult time keeping them in her mouth securely until she found this product online through amazon. This adhesive allows her to feel more secure and she can eat anything she wants without worry.</li>
            <li> This adhesive does grab on pretty strong... No Bad taste, lots of confidence while using it. The only draw back in my opinion, it&#x27;s really hard to remove from my plate. I&#x27;ve tried soaking over night, different cleaners, etc... Other than that, I really like this adhesive.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product for my bottom denture.  It wears off as soon as I eat a full meal. I followed the directions exactly and I am very particular how I proceed in getting this paste to work.  I make sure the denture is completely dry and apply it according to the instructions.  It does sting for about a minute and a half and then it goes away.  I don&#x27;t think it is any better than any of the other denture pastes and powders I have tried.  Isn&#x27;t there a miracle denture paste out there somewhere in this world?  Well, I have not found it yet.  Not for me anyways.</li>
            <li> although initially it was a firm hold the length of time it actually held was about 6 hours. in the short term it works great just not 12 hours as purported in the ad.  The tube seemed a little small compared to the picture.</li>
            <li> works better than poly dent has no after taste holds up great even on loose bridge don&#x27;t really know side effects</li>
            <li> GOOD...I would compare to Fixodent original and a&lt;br /&gt;bit cheaper, has a thicker consistency and holds very&lt;br /&gt;slightly less longer but GOOD</li>
            <li> got this for a co-worker with new dentures, he had been struggling to find an adhesive that worked... he LOVES this... says it is the best ever and he looks forward to eating as his dentures will actually STAY PUT!</li>
            <li> Only lasts about 6 hours at best then the denture gets loose. The cream oozes out from under the denture and you swallow it. It then stays stuck in your throat for some time. The product can not be purchased locally. Closest stores are in new York City or buy on line. The cost to buy on line is expensive considering you also have to pay ridiculous shipping and handling fees. The cleaner is also very expensive and the quantity per box is far to small. I will say the product does hold better than all the others I have tried, but this product is very over rated.. Their website is not even any good for anything.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed.  This does work better than anything I have tried to date.  Only thing I have found is that it does not last 12 hours,  but it does last longer than most.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  i have been using it for about 3 years now and my upper dentures stay put all day.  I can eat practically anything without worry of the dentures falling out.  It doesn&#x27;t work too well on my lowers, but that is because i don&#x27;t have much gum line any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m disappointed that there seems to be fewer sellers on Amazon for the product and with the available sellers, it takes 3 times longer to receive my Secure denture cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for holding power of dentures.  Sometimes it gives a twinge of a bite on gum if you have had a problem and made a sore spot from eating when dentures were not tight.  Overall though this is the best product for holding ill fitting dentures, especially the lower ones.  Top dentures, you would only need a very small amount, just in one place.  The lower dentures, make sure you don&#x27;t put too much, you will learn the right amount as you use this adhesive.  Amazon is the only place I have seen that carries this Secure product.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market, I wish it were available in stores and not just online.</li>
            <li> It only lasts about 4hours, but its better than any other product of its kind! I will continue to buy,but it is rather expensive!</li>
            <li> Since I started wearing dentures recently, I have tried every adhesive I could find in order to choose the best that suited me.&lt;br /&gt;I found out that two adhesive products worked the best for me. They both are insoluble in water, which makes them last long. The first &#x27;Cushion Grip&#x27; is also excellent, but hard to apply, although with practice it becomes easier to use. It lasts 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;The second, &#x27;Secure&#x27; is very easy to apply, and lasts for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves no residual taste in the mouth, and can easily be wiped off the denture, and reapplied when it gets weak, or before a meal. It can be applied as quickly and easily as the water soluble adhesives, but it is more comfortable and longer lasting.&lt;br /&gt;In order to become effective, one has to wait about 20 minutes before starting his meal. This is very important. Very little adhesive is needed for each application, and it thus becomes cheaper to use than the water soluble ones.</li>
            <li> this is a horrible product. I have been using another zinc based product and even though it is not the best for you, it works much better than this product. This glue gets hard, it burns and I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT!  Its the only denture adhesive I have found that actually works, and I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was desperate, nothing held my dentures in.  I stumbled upon Secure. and it actually works!  Dentures stay in all day with one application!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep SECURE in stock, I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> Depressed that I had to have my teeth pulled and sorry until I used Secure. My dentures stay put with no &#x27;flopping&#x27; around and I can now eat just about anything and, can belly-laugh without fear of denture embarrassment. Just remember...a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t apply it as you would other commercial products; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> No! I received two adhesive, didn&#x27;t receive Bond Cream</li>
            <li> Holds all day long, Love it. This is buy far the best product I used so far. would Buy agine.</li>
            <li> It did not meet up to my expectations at all.  Worked no better than the stuff I buy a LOT cheaper at Wal Mart</li>
