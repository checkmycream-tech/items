            <li>This is one of my signature scents and women always love it and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li>I save more musky fragrances for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love love love this fragrance and Amazon is beating everywhere</li>
            <li>well - this is pretty much one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>in evenings and cool climates under 69 degrees to warm climates say 70-85 degrees.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is warm and sweet.</li>
            <li>Very sweet smell good first cologne</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent that women love.  </li>
            <li>Love the clean manly smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>The staying power isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like for a cologne at this price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh, declicous, and super sexy!</li>
            <li>It was nicely packaged even got a free sample ;)</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, elegant and soft.</li>
            <li>and I have found that it is not used by many and have rarely, if ever, smelled it on anyone else.</li>
            <li>No matter guys (and some ladies) - if you&#x27;re secure with yourself, you will wear this cologne because it is basically a three-spray woman magnet.</li>
            <li>so I did not open and smell but person receiving was also happy with item.</li>
            <li>I primarily wear it during the daytime as it is a lighter fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Eau De Toilette Spray  was in original  package  </li>
            <li>rich fragrance for evening wear</li>
            <li>Its is a true Homme smell.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect</li>
            <li>I use about 4 sprays in various places and it lasts a good 8 hours.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this for my husband and it came in the mail super fast and was here in penty of time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>This cologne is so awesome that I actually use it regularly, even for those not-so-special occasions.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it lasts as much as I would want, but for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it and still smells great!!</li>
            <li>say that like it.&lt;br /&gt;You will seem more of a classy guy with this on.</li>
            <li>My two sisters and mother both liked the scent so that was enough for me.</li>
            <li>They are sophisticated and, yet, masculine.  </li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, and I was happy to see that it&#x27;s the real deal (I compared it to the old bottle, which I kept with a few sprays still in it).</li>
            <li>L&#x27;homme YSL is one of those \\&quot;man-flower\\&quot; colognes (compare to [[ASIN:9790780214 Egoiste Platinum by Chanel for men 1.7 oz Eau De Toilette EDT Spray]], another great cologne that is light) that is masculine but a little floral/feminine.</li>
            <li>I have used this fragrance twice in the past and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li>Its soft enough for a guy to wear every day or really nice for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>4 stars only because the top leaks</li>
            <li>Maybe people are having problems with the testers because they&#x27;ve gotten too hot or sat in the sun?</li>
            <li>For the price it should feel and look first class:  It is not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it was a gift i purchased years ago and never left a comment.</li>
            <li>What ultimately sold me on this cologne is that close to 85% or more of the reviews for this product were solely from women raving about its sent.</li>
            <li>night was the first time I tried YSL on a date.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this cologne!</li>
            <li>I was a dedicated user for casual Friday, but this colon is one of the best out there.</li>
            <li>for anyone 20yo +&lt;br /&gt;can wear casual events but think its best for formal events or dates.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>compared to the original price got it almost 50% off, love the fragrance, mature and universal scent for men or women</li>
            <li>The review was quite positive ;</li>
            <li>its honestly not worth it unless your wearing this just before &amp;#34;doing the deed&amp;#34; it makes for an amazing aphrodisiac...</li>
            <li>It take awhile to wear off, and lasts pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li>but it fades so fast...</li>
            <li>Fast forward a couple years.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like this cologne on my husband.</li>
            <li>Quality product delivered as expected at a more affordable price.</li>
            <li>I think i will try Another fragAnce in the near future, but its ok.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based upon many reviews but while the package was new, the product was old and did not have the same strength of versions that I smelled at department stores.  </li>
            <li>and the smell stays way to close to the skin, not enough projection will most likely buy in store from now on</li>
            <li>It is very masculine with hints of citrus and is not too overpowering!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li>Came really well packaged and the bottle is pretty big!</li>
            <li>Just pay the extra money and purchase a fresh bottle at the store.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a deep rich scent similar to Paco Rabanne 1Million,</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, first cologne I&#x27;ve warn since middle school.</li>
            <li>I bought this Eau De Toilette for the first time 5 years ago, and it is the only one I can, and want, to use.</li>
            <li>He surprised me by bringing the strip home and asking for my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have three of the four that YSL has developed using L&#x27;homme.  </li>
            <li>There are a few colognes that sit in what I call the \\&quot;man-flower\\&quot; category - light colognes that don&#x27;t smell as musky or woody as someone would expect from a \\&quot;cologne.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The cologne&#x27;s scent faded after 1/2 an hour (unwrapped and beat-up box - probably old, discarded stock) and because of Amazon&#x27;s return policy on fragrances, I couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li>The only difference being is that this bottle is much cheaper than the one I got from Sephora.</li>
            <li>i really do not remember this very much.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have the same long lasting smell it use to have as the previous one I used to own.</li>
            <li>tend to be somewhat obsessive before making my purchases so I spent close to half a day reading through customer reviews of the top recommended male colognes out there.</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be the same and purchased the same (appearing) item for my adult son.  </li>
            <li>on the other hand, she is (obviously) older</li>
            <li>it was delivered carefully packaged and was brand new wrapped in box.</li>
            <li>Perhaps YSL got a really good price;  too bad.</li>

            <li> Really like this cologne on my husband.</li>
            <li> Quality product delivered as expected at a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> I think i will try Another fragAnce in the near future, but its ok.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based upon many reviews but while the package was new, the product was old and did not have the same strength of versions that I smelled at department stores.  </li>
            <li> and the smell stays way to close to the skin, not enough projection will most likely buy in store from now on</li>
            <li> It is very masculine with hints of citrus and is not too overpowering!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> Came really well packaged and the bottle is pretty big!</li>
            <li> Just pay the extra money and purchase a fresh bottle at the store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a deep rich scent similar to Paco Rabanne 1Million,</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, first cologne I&#x27;ve warn since middle school.</li>
            <li> I bought this Eau De Toilette for the first time 5 years ago, and it is the only one I can, and want, to use.</li>
            <li> He surprised me by bringing the strip home and asking for my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have three of the four that YSL has developed using L&#x27;homme.  </li>
            <li> There are a few colognes that sit in what I call the \\&quot;man-flower\\&quot; category - light colognes that don&#x27;t smell as musky or woody as someone would expect from a \\&quot;cologne.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The cologne&#x27;s scent faded after 1/2 an hour (unwrapped and beat-up box - probably old, discarded stock) and because of Amazon&#x27;s return policy on fragrances, I couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> The only difference being is that this bottle is much cheaper than the one I got from Sephora.</li>
            <li> i really do not remember this very much.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have the same long lasting smell it use to have as the previous one I used to own.</li>
            <li> tend to be somewhat obsessive before making my purchases so I spent close to half a day reading through customer reviews of the top recommended male colognes out there.</li>
            <li> so I thought this would be the same and purchased the same (appearing) item for my adult son.  </li>
            <li> on the other hand, she is (obviously) older</li>
            <li> it was delivered carefully packaged and was brand new wrapped in box.</li>
            <li> Perhaps YSL got a really good price;  too bad.</li>
            <li> My only qualms is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long</li>
            <li> Amazon is currently selling this cologne for $41 and the other major retailers (Nordstrom, Sephora) are selling it for $60 - you can do the math -</li>
            <li> I usually have a few \\&quot;refined\\&quot; ones on hand for special occasions and a couple \\&quot;beater\\&quot; colognes for every day use.</li>
            <li> This is either old product or a diluted, very, very faint version of the original.  </li>
            <li> What I ordered doesn&#x27;t have the same color as what you buy in Macy&#x27;s or other stores.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;homme is the source of several other flankers.  </li>
            <li> I have seen other reviews which seem to indicate that Amazon has goods that are old and therefore are \\&quot;less</li>
            <li> I have NEVER gotten a thing from Amazon that did not live up to its on-line appearance.</li>
            <li> Could last a little longer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m guessing they might have received old stock or testers, which are commonly sold at outlets and online.</li>
            <li> but that could be due to any number of factors.</li>
            <li> See other reviews.</li>
            <li> I had a concern because I&#x27;ve had mixed results buying fragrances from Amazon in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The 120-something odd reviews sum up this fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned probably half the colognes out there at some point</li>
            <li> Dolce&amp;Gabanna The One and a little like Jay-Z Gold.</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with the scent</li>
            <li> but, Ive used this product everyday and have recieved no compliments.</li>
            <li> Also, smell doesn&#x27;t last past an hour, very weak even with three spurts.</li>
            <li> cologne for someone who you are not sure wears cologne or not.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure I can blame it on the cologne or something else.</li>
            <li> though I was wary of buying a fragrance online, I feel like this was the same quality as buying it at the mall.</li>
            <li> This problem may resolve itself over the summer months, but during the winter it has seemed to be subtle at best.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It is much less expensive to buy online than in store</li>
            <li> but  old/spoiled...very  weak scent  </li>
            <li> I also bought one cologne that was 40% off and also 40% worse in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> Also the picture shows 3.3oz bottle while 2oz is what you are buying- talk about false advertising.</li>
            <li> Try to get it online as it is expensive in store.</li>
            <li> He loves it and needless to say his wife does too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Looks Wrong</li>
            <li> This is fake.</li>
            <li> Unable to give review since I did not use product.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product by Amazon and would not recommend anybody else purchase this item.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One of the best smelling colognes ever. I would recommend it to everyone. I am sure you will fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love this, smells sooo good on my man!!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;homme Yves Saint Laurent By Yves Saint Laurent For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray  was in original  package  but  old/spoiled...very  weak scent  compared  to  department  store  versions of  same  product...I  will never  buy this  kind of  product  from  Amazon again</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because the top leaks</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and I was happy to see that it&#x27;s the real deal (I compared it to the old bottle, which I kept with a few sprays still in it). Maybe people are having problems with the testers because they&#x27;ve gotten too hot or sat in the sun? I bought the regular package because it fits in my travel-case.</li>
            <li> my favourite colone of all time</li>
            <li> It smells good but, Ive used this product everyday and have recieved no compliments. I think its so popular you might as well be wearing nothing. This product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne I own. Could last a little longer. But still, get compliments always.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Came in perfect as well. Smells amazing. I&#x27;m all over my husband!</li>
            <li> I was a dedicated user for casual Friday, but this colon is one of the best out there. Highly recommend it. Try to get it online as it is expensive in store.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes my girlfriend loves it on me. I wanted to get something for my dad as a gift . He loves it and needless to say his wife does too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it was a hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a deep rich scent similar to Paco Rabanne 1Million, Dolce&amp;Gabanna The One and a little like Jay-Z Gold. Its is a true Homme smell.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect cologne for someone who you are not sure wears cologne or not.&lt;br /&gt;Good for anyone 20yo +&lt;br /&gt;can wear casual events but think its best for formal events or dates.&lt;br /&gt;Best in evenings and cool climates under 69 degrees to warm climates say 70-85 degrees. in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;I personally have had women of different cultures,ethnicity, and ages say that like it.&lt;br /&gt;You will seem more of a classy guy with this on.</li>
            <li> Smells great!! I have seen other reviews which seem to indicate that Amazon has goods that are old and therefore are \\&quot;less potent\\&quot;....I dunno about that. My GF loves this stuff....it seems to have the same strength as the same product purchased at Sephora. I have NEVER gotten a thing from Amazon that did not live up to its on-line appearance. Add to that excellent customer service good to excellent prices, and you just cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great smelling! I absolutely love this for my husband and it came in the mail super fast and was here in penty of time for Christmas. Recommend!</li>
            <li> The ladies cannot resist me.  Looks like I don&#x27;t need to brush my teeth after all.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent that women love.  It take awhile to wear off, and lasts pretty much all day.  Body heat reactivates the scent.  Good choice.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! Its one of the best. The price was right. it was delivered carefully packaged and was brand new wrapped in box.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells amazing. but it fades so fast... you find yourself re-applying just to get a compliment or two. its honestly not worth it unless your wearing this just before &amp;#34;doing the deed&amp;#34; it makes for an amazing aphrodisiac...</li>
            <li> Smelled this on a friend years ago, bought this for my boyfriend for our anniversary. He can wear this for hours at a time and still smell as if he just sprayed it. The fragrance is warm and sweet. I love this!</li>
            <li> I received the cologne within two days and it was packaged so that it wouldn&#x27;t break. I was not familiar with the scent but I bought it off the strength of an article about the best colognes for men. I am very pleased overall. My two sisters and mother both liked the scent so that was enough for me. My only qualms is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long but that could be due to any number of factors. So I&#x27;m not sure I can blame it on the cologne or something else.</li>
            <li> Looks Wrong&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is mis-proportioned.  For the price it should feel and look first class:  It is not.  More care should have been taken.  Perhaps YSL got a really good price;  too bad.</li>
            <li> i really do not remember this very much. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was a gift i purchased years ago and never left a comment.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have the same long lasting smell it use to have as the previous one I used to own. and the smell stays way to close to the skin, not enough projection will most likely buy in store from now on</li>
            <li> This is fake. See other reviews. What I ordered doesn&#x27;t have the same color as what you buy in Macy&#x27;s or other stores. Also, smell doesn&#x27;t last past an hour, very weak even with three spurts.</li>
            <li> Smells Great, delivered as estimated</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, elegant and soft. I think i will try Another fragAnce in the near future, but its ok.</li>
            <li> My husband discovered the scent strip for L&#x27;homme Yves Saint Laurent in a magazine. He surprised me by bringing the strip home and asking for my opinion. It smelled great, so I ordered it right away. We are both pleased!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is so sophisticated. My boyfriend loves it and I have found that it is not used by many and have rarely, if ever, smelled it on anyone else. I love this scent. It&#x27;s not too musky or old-man-ish so-to-speak...it&#x27;s fresh, declicous, and super sexy!</li>
            <li> Amazing smell that lasts but doesn&#x27;t over power</li>
            <li> It is what my son asked for, so it met expectations. Unable to give review since I did not use product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with Dolce &amp; Gabbana Pour Homme. This cologne is simply amazing. I put it on around 7 this morning and now it&#x27;s around 9pm and I can still smell it on my wrists. The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering. I&#x27;m sold on YSL.</li>
            <li> YSL produces excellent colognes.  They are sophisticated and, yet, masculine.  Additionally, they have excellent longevity.  L&#x27;homme is the source of several other flankers.  I have three of the four that YSL has developed using L&#x27;homme.  All of them are terrific.  I would identify this as a good day-use cologne.  It is a compliment getter.  You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne and my girlfriend loves it its really good every time i wear it i get compliments its amazing</li>
            <li> All ysl products are made in France NOT Italy like it says so Amazon you lost another sale! Also the picture shows 3.3oz bottle while 2oz is what you are buying- talk about false advertising. What a letdown Amazon-</li>
            <li> After sampling over 15 different colognes in the mall I finally settled with YSL L&#x27;Homme.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be somewhat obsessive before making my purchases so I spent close to half a day reading through customer reviews of the top recommended male colognes out there. What ultimately sold me on this cologne is that close to 85% or more of the reviews for this product were solely from women raving about its sent. I wear cologne for my own enjoyment but seeing how many women were in love with this cologne is what had me sold.&lt;br /&gt;Last night was the first time I tried YSL on a date. The review was quite positive ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would definitely be a 5 star product in my mind if I didn&#x27;t have to use 4-6 sprays before getting noticed. The staying power isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like for a cologne at this price. This problem may resolve itself over the summer months, but during the winter it has seemed to be subtle at best.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I would highly recommend this cologne. I may even have to invest in the 6 oz bottle if my  dating results continue!</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance twice in the past and have always been happy with it. Got great compliments from the ladies and they surely do love it!</li>
            <li> The 120-something odd reviews sum up this fragrance well - this is pretty much one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I usually have a few \\&quot;refined\\&quot; ones on hand for special occasions and a couple \\&quot;beater\\&quot; colognes for every day use. This cologne is so awesome that I actually use it regularly, even for those not-so-special occasions. I&#x27;ve owned probably half the colognes out there at some point so I am selective about what I like. Most colognes smell like Polo knock-offs (check \\&quot;elderly\\&quot;) or fake sporty junk (Polo Sport? Nautica?). There are a few colognes that sit in what I call the \\&quot;man-flower\\&quot; category - light colognes that don&#x27;t smell as musky or woody as someone would expect from a \\&quot;cologne.\\&quot; L&#x27;homme YSL is one of those \\&quot;man-flower\\&quot; colognes (compare to [[ASIN:9790780214 Egoiste Platinum by Chanel for men 1.7 oz Eau De Toilette EDT Spray]], another great cologne that is light) that is masculine but a little floral/feminine. No matter guys (and some ladies) - if you&#x27;re secure with yourself, you will wear this cologne because it is basically a three-spray woman magnet. I don&#x27;t think it smells THAT feminine, but my mother thought I was wearing women&#x27;s perfume when she smelled it... on the other hand, she is (obviously) older so she probably expects Polo or Stetson. Women closer to my age love this cologne and I get many compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is where Amazon comes in. Amazon is currently selling this cologne for $41 and the other major retailers (Nordstrom, Sephora) are selling it for $60 - you can do the math - it&#x27;s basically 30% off. I had a concern because I&#x27;ve had mixed results buying fragrances from Amazon in the past. I bought two colognes that were top-quality and 30-40% off retail. I also bought one cologne that was 40% off and also 40% worse in terms of quality. The cologne&#x27;s scent faded after 1/2 an hour (unwrapped and beat-up box - probably old, discarded stock) and because of Amazon&#x27;s return policy on fragrances, I couldn&#x27;t return it. Ivowed I would never order cologne from Amazon again. Fast forward a couple years. I bought L&#x27;homme at Sephora and needed to buy another bottle but the price put me off. I saw all the good reviews on here at Amazon and thought, why not - and I&#x27;m GLAD I DID. The cologne was wrapped, the box was intact and the cologne itself is IDENTICAL to the one I purchased from Sephora. The scent lasts all day, comparable to the one I purchased at the store in person. The only difference being is that this bottle is much cheaper than the one I got from Sephora. I noticed some people complaining that they received fakes and I&#x27;m guessing they might have received old stock or testers, which are commonly sold at outlets and online. However, in my case, this is a brand new bottle at an awesome price or this just happens to be a phenomenally great tester. I don&#x27;t know how Amazon does it. Either way, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and the price I paid for it and you probably will be too. Give this a shot!</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter chose this scent for me last Christmas replacing my Xyreus. It is much less expensive to buy online than in store</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my uncle.  I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li> Just smelled like alcohol</li>
            <li> This cologne smells AMAZING! I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas. Came really well packaged and the bottle is pretty big!</li>
            <li> Love the clean manly smell of this cologne. Will be buying more when this is gone. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this purchase.  It was a gift so I did not open and smell but person receiving was also happy with item.</li>
            <li> rich fragrance for evening wear</li>
            <li> compared to the original price got it almost 50% off, love the fragrance, mature and universal scent for men or women</li>
            <li> Very sweet smell good first cologne</li>
            <li> Really like this cologne on my husband.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells awesome and gets a lot of compliments! I&#x27;m not sure if it lasts as much as I would want, but for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it and still smells great!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering. Its soft enough for a guy to wear every day or really nice for a special occasion. My fiance likes it a lot. Definitely buying from this vendor again. It was nicely packaged even got a free sample ;)</li>
            <li> Quality product delivered as expected at a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, first cologne I&#x27;ve warn since middle school. Ladies seem to like as well.</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> I really loved the scent, just purchased for my husband from Nordstroms so I thought this would be the same and purchased the same (appearing) item for my adult son.  What a disappointment.  This is either old product or a diluted, very, very faint version of the original.  As it obviously can&#x27;t be returned, probably should not be purchasing this type of product online.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for a daytime office scent. I use about 4 sprays in various places and it lasts a good 8 hours. Great buy! Citrus notes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based upon many reviews but while the package was new, the product was old and did not have the same strength of versions that I smelled at department stores.  I am very disappointed in this product by Amazon and would not recommend anybody else purchase this item.  Just pay the extra money and purchase a fresh bottle at the store.  I will attempt to return this item if at all possible.</li>
            <li> I bought this Eau De Toilette for the first time 5 years ago, and it is the only one I can, and want, to use. Great smell, great looks, good for the summer and winter season. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my younger brother (he&#x27;s a teenager) and he was very happy with it. Both of us think it smells great and isn&#x27;t overpowering like some colognes can be. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my signature scents and women always love it and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  I primarily wear it during the daytime as it is a lighter fragrance.  I save more musky fragrances for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I was wary of buying a fragrance online, I feel like this was the same quality as buying it at the mall.</li>
            <li> I ordered cologne, and I received cologne. Good deal.</li>
            <li> Love love love this fragrance and Amazon is beating everywhere I checked on price! Gonna give this bottle as a gift and getting another for me!</li>
            <li> Everything as expect. No surprises.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend after smelling ky in a magazine, this is the best smell ever !!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this cologne! It is very masculine with hints of citrus and is not too overpowering!</li>
