            <li>Another reviewer said it perfectly:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that awesome.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Body Shop&#x27;s chamomile butter makeup remover and it&#x27;s incredible</li>
            <li>But incredibly, they do.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Both are great products for washing your face and removing makeup, but I prefer the bamboo microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps it would be good at exfoliating, but it was not for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a great wash cloth and I am glad that I ordered two.</li>

            <li>Very soft and great for removing makeup, and the color also hides the stains that come with that job.</li>
            <li>And it rinses clean too!  </li>

            <li>i loved this cloth so much i wanted the bath towel and hair towel too,</li>
            <li>It is extremely effective at getting your skin super clean without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my face is when I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin yet effectively removes makeup, even mascara (with use of cleanser of course).</li>
            <li>Reaches into pores with its fine fibers and cleans.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a fantastic washcloth, and I have permanently switched from the run of the mill washcloths that match my towels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s does a super job of cleansing all make-up off and exfoliates lightly.</li>

            <li>It is so soft and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Nice for exfoliation, yet soft.</li>
            <li>This is seriously THE BEST washcloth EVER!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s suitable for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>This Appearus Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber wash cloth is very soft and enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>Not in the wholesome, non-perverse thoughts kind of sense, but more in the less dirt particles on my sweaty body sort of sense.</li>
            <li>So far, both products have washed up well in the washer, with most of the makeup removed, but the softness and color of the bamboo cloth gives it the edge.</li>
            <li>I love washing my face with this, so soft and doesn&#x27;t get stinky.</li>
            <li>It also dries very fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft, and it feels like a more natural product.</li>
            <li>I love the antibacterial properties of this cloth, since I suffer from acne, and need to eliminate all possible sources of bacteria growth.</li>
            <li>Be gentle!</li>
            <li>Softer than a washcloth, but don&#x27;t scrub too much thinking it&#x27;s not working as well!</li>
            <li>but then when you get out of the shower you realize that you may have scrubbed a bit too much so use with caution!</li>
            <li>I also use them to wipe down my bath tub after each shower and they do an amazing job of getting the tub spotless.  </li>
            <li>They are so soft and sweet thanks</li>
            <li>This wash cloth came in a nice bag with a little info card.</li>
            <li>These also perform very well for me.  </li>
            <li>After using cotton wash cloths for many years, I started noticing I had eye makeup residue on my lower eyelid, just below my lashes, no matter how much time I spent going over that area.  </li>
            <li>They also feel a bit more plush and soft than the white cloths.</li>
            <li>said instead of putting it in the washing machine and so far it&#x27;s still soft and still clean.</li>
            <li>The other products I tried did a much better job of washing, rinsing, removing makeup and exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>It completely removes makeup and rinses clean, leaving no black eye makeup smudges all over it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and gentle</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m going to be purchasing a few more of these or myself</li>
            <li>Buying a few more.</li>
            <li>Very soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of days and my skin looks so much healthier!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and soft, feels weird when wet, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I also purchased from my local Bed Bath and Beyond store, their Pure Performance wash cloths which are very soft and made of 88% polyester and 12% nylon.  </li>
            <li>This cloth is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely soft...</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering some for my whole family.</li>
            <li>SOFT.</li>
            <li>My only negative is that it kind of drags over the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a little loop sewn on to the corner to hang it on a hook to dry.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a real pleasure to dry my face with.</li>
            <li>After using a Buf Puf for years for exfoliating the less sensitive areas of my face, I never would have believed that a very soft, fluffy, luxurious feeling microfiber cloth could exfoliate, AND also gently remove makeup from the sensitive lower lid area.  </li>

            <li> My facial cleansing routine involves rubbing skin savior waterless beauty balm all over my face to remove makeup and cleanse then wipe that off with a dry one of these.</li>
            <li> Crazy expensive, but the single best washcloth I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I also like the heather gray color since it hides makeup stains in the long run.</li>
            <li> After using the both White Plush Microfiber Wash Cloths and the Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber Wash Cloths a few times, I prefer the Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber Wash Cloths because their lovelyheathered grey color does not show the residual eye makeup being removed.  </li>
            <li> However, it is exfoliating if you rub harder.</li>
            <li> The cloth, because it&#x27;s synthetic, has a slightly draggy feel, but I found that if you leave the cloth on the wet side,close to sopping wet, rather than wringing it out, it reduces the drag.</li>
            <li> like non other</li>
            <li> I actually rubbed too hard and my cheeks felt like I got burned.</li>
            <li> It is an odd, rectangular shape, and not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The micro fiber is a tricky thing because it won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re getting the dead skin cells off -</li>
            <li> Because of the odd size and shape, this cloth is too small for me.  </li>
            <li> No more grungy stainy washcloths hanging in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> crazy soft...</li>
            <li> It also was not effective in removing the residual eye makeup below my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Makes me less dirty.</li>

            <li> The best washcloth I&#x27;ve found for removing makeup.</li>
            <li> This cloth is extremely soft. I use it exclusively for my face and it&#x27;s a real pleasure to dry my face with.</li>
            <li> I love this wash cloth.  It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin yet effectively removes makeup, even mascara (with use of cleanser of course).</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice is it&#x27;s generous size, absorb-ability, and easy to clean.  After a shower or bath you can wring it out well and blot most of the water off your body before you step out.  It&#x27;s does a super job of cleansing all make-up off and exfoliates lightly. After I clean my face I buff it with a white terry towel and nary a bit of make up remains.  I soak it in my bath basin about once a week in water and about 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to freshen it.  My only negative is that it kind of drags over the skin.  I&#x27;ve gotten accustomed to this and it isn&#x27;t a big problem - just doesn&#x27;t glide over the skin like a regular cloth. I would buy it again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> The most amazing washcloth in the world. I use it with the Body Shop&#x27;s chamomile butter makeup remover and it&#x27;s incredible, my face has never felt so clean. It&#x27;s very soft and gentle so it&#x27;s suitable for sensitive skin like mine. I&#x27;ve been soaking it in a solution of vinegar and water like another reviewer said instead of putting it in the washing machine and so far it&#x27;s still soft and still clean. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very soft.  I guess I was expecting something more abrasive but I like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because of the great reviews and the crowd was right on! Love these face clothes...like non other I have had before. Your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> Soft and fluffy  but not so soft that it adversely affects the cleaning ability.  Reaches into pores with its fine fibers and cleans.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Nice and soft----takes the makeup right off!!  And it rinses clean too!  No more grungy stainy washcloths hanging in my bathroom.  I purchased 2, glad I did!  :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Another reviewer said it perfectly: it&#x27;s like washing your face with a bunny. The cloth, because it&#x27;s synthetic, has a slightly draggy feel, but I found that if you leave the cloth on the wet side,close to sopping wet, rather than wringing it out, it reduces the drag. I love the antibacterial properties of this cloth, since I suffer from acne, and need to eliminate all possible sources of bacteria growth. I haven&#x27;t noticed any mouldy smell from this cloth, even if I leave it damp in a plastic bag overnight.  The heather-grey color is really nice, too, since it hides any eye makeup stains. It also dries very fast. I love how well this removes cleanser from my face without feeling abrasive. However, it is exfoliating if you rub harder. The only drawback is that the hanging loop came off from both sides after just one use, but the care label is big enough to use as a hanging loop, so this wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> This is a great wash cloth and I am glad that I ordered two. It is so soft and nice on the skin. However, don&#x27;t let that fool you into believing you can just rub this on your face like a maniac. I actually rubbed too hard and my cheeks felt like I got burned. Be gentle! This wash cloth came in a nice bag with a little info card. It would be a nice gift for your beauty-loving friends.</li>
            <li> This is seriously THE BEST washcloth EVER! It&#x27;s extremely soft...crazy soft...like washing your face with a cloud and a baby bunny. It is extremely effective at getting your skin super clean without being too abrasive. It completely removes makeup and rinses clean, leaving no black eye makeup smudges all over it. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of days and my skin looks so much healthier! I love that it has a little loop sewn on to the corner to hang it on a hook to dry. It&#x27;s really a fantastic washcloth, and I have permanently switched from the run of the mill washcloths that match my towels. Omg, they should make bath towels! I&#x27;d buy em. In fact, I&#x27;m going to be purchasing a few more of these or myself and I&#x27;m getting one for everyone for Christmas. It&#x27;s that awesome.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my face is when I use it. I will definitely be ordering some for my whole family.</li>
            <li> expensive but I am not using washcloths on my face ever again... They are so soft and sweet thanks&lt;br /&gt;have not torn apart in the dryer like I was worried about so they are keepers.</li>
            <li> Makes me less dirty. Not in the wholesome, non-perverse thoughts kind of sense, but more in the less dirt particles on my sweaty body sort of sense. Softer than a washcloth, but don&#x27;t scrub too much thinking it&#x27;s not working as well! The micro fiber is a tricky thing because it won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re getting the dead skin cells off - but then when you get out of the shower you realize that you may have scrubbed a bit too much so use with caution!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite washcloth for makeup removal. My facial cleansing routine involves rubbing skin savior waterless beauty balm all over my face to remove makeup and cleanse then wipe that off with a dry one of these. My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> i loved this cloth so much i wanted the bath towel and hair towel too, and now i use all  of them !!!</li>
            <li> This Appearus Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber wash cloth is very soft and enjoyable to use. After buying Bamboo towels we wanted to try a washcloth too. They are terrific!</li>

            <li> After using cotton wash cloths for many years, I started noticing I had eye makeup residue on my lower eyelid, just below my lashes, no matter how much time I spent going over that area.  I ordered several products to try.  The Wonder Cloth Makeup Remover performed poorest of all those I tested.  It is an odd, rectangular shape, and not easy to use.  I wash my face using my finger tips and cleanser morning and evening, then use a cloth and plenty of water to rinse off the cleanser and remove residual eye makeup under my lower lashes.  Because of the odd size and shape, this cloth is too small for me.  The fabric has a prickly feel.  I thought perhaps it would be good at exfoliating, but it was not for me.  It also was not effective in removing the residual eye makeup below my lashes.  The other products I tried did a much better job of washing, rinsing, removing makeup and exfoliating.  The Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber Wash Cloth, and Plush Microfiber Wash Cloth 12x12 White (both of which I ordered from Amazon), were both outstanding for washing, rinsing, exfoliating and removing eye makeup.  I also purchased from my local Bed Bath and Beyond store, their Pure Performance wash cloths which are very soft and made of 88% polyester and 12% nylon.  These also perform very well for me.  After using a Buf Puf for years for exfoliating the less sensitive areas of my face, I never would have believed that a very soft, fluffy, luxurious feeling microfiber cloth could exfoliate, AND also gently remove makeup from the sensitive lower lid area.  But incredibly, they do.  I also use them to wipe down my bath tub after each shower and they do an amazing job of getting the tub spotless.  The Wonder Cloth Makeup Remover cloth will now be relegated to my cleaning rag collection.&lt;br /&gt;Update 1-2-13  After using the both White Plush Microfiber Wash Cloths and the Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber Wash Cloths a few times, I prefer the Bamboo Charcoal Microfiber Wash Cloths because their lovelyheathered grey color does not show the residual eye makeup being removed.  The white cloths do of course show the makeup.  Most of it does come out in the wash, but I believe over time, the Bamboo Charcoal Cloths will hold their appearance better.  They also feel a bit more plush and soft than the white cloths.</li>
            <li> I love this wash cloth.  Glad I bought 2.  I have used it every day since I got it.  It washes the soap out very easily.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and soft, feels weird when wet, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I have to say. SOFT. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE CARE OF IT. I&#x27;ve been searching for wash cloths here and there but this is by far the best one I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and the Plush Microfiber Wash Cloth 12x12 in white. Both are great products for washing your face and removing makeup, but I prefer the bamboo microfiber cloth. It&#x27;s super soft, and it feels like a more natural product. I also like the heather gray color since it hides makeup stains in the long run. So far, both products have washed up well in the washer, with most of the makeup removed, but the softness and color of the bamboo cloth gives it the edge. Plus, it comes in a cute mesh bag for gift-giving. I bought 2 and am buying 3 more today!</li>
            <li> Well made. Nice for exfoliation, yet soft. Very glad I got this for my Husband-he really likes it! Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold smells like regular washcloths. Buying a few more.</li>
            <li> I love washing my face with this, so soft and doesn&#x27;t get stinky.</li>
            <li> I tried these strictly for my face and they&#x27;re just lovely. Very soft and great for removing makeup, and the color also hides the stains that come with that job.</li>
            <li> Crazy expensive, but the single best washcloth I have ever owned.</li>
