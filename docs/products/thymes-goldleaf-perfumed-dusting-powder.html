            <li> Do not buy from this company.  They do not follow through on their orders.  My order is still waiting to be processed from May and it was a Mother&#x27;s Day gift.  I have received 3 emails since May from Amazon saying that they cannot get this product from this company.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li> the power I received was old stock, and had smelled like cigarette smoke. Yes I returned it.</li>
            <li> I received this product today and it&#x27;s scent is soft and soothing!  I would buy this product again!  I&#x27;m a satisfied consumer of the Thymes products I have purchased.  My home is never without these products!  Thanks again Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn body powder for years.  Best one yet and absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li> Bought with the bubble bath.  Great gift</li>
            <li> She used to use this a while back and was thrilled to find it on line! She loves the scent and getting powdered up after a bath! She will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
            <li> It had been a long time since using a powder for me because it seemed to rub off onto my clothes causing powder spots. I am so happy to find this powder stays on me! The smell is heavenly, the puff so soft and the powder rubs into my skin and has never come off onto my clothing.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this powder, along with the soap and body lotion.  It leaves a nice scent after bathing or just when dressing for the day.  Leaves a silky feel to the skin.  It is a better grade of product than what you would buy in the drugstore, but not so expensive that it is a stretch to use it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell very much, was kind of an old lady smell imo.  But luckily my mom thought it was fine.</li>
            <li> My girlfriends favorite powder!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent another way to envelop my self in this</li>

            <li> I had not used dusting powder in a box with a powder puff for a long time but it seems to me that it was a smaller amount than I used to see sitting out on a counter.  The container is attractive and displays nicely so it joins my perfumes on a glass mirrored tray.</li>
            <li> Just love it. I love anything Goldleaf!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A delightful way to stay cool in the summer.  The fragrance is wonderful, not too heavy. The box is very pretty sitting on my bsathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have used it the past.  But I purchased it from a local store.  They no longer are able to get this line, so I was very glad to see it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this powder for my wife for years.  Drive 40 miles or more and pay more, I guess you call that the old school way. My purchase  came in 4 days to my home and I saved $$$$$.  Great doing business with you.</li>
            <li> Prompt service, good product.  Happy lady!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. I must find ways to stretch my budget so I add an equal amount of unscented talc. Still has that great fragrance.</li>
            <li> The goldleaf fragrance is so rich without being heavy. I am so glad they make the dusting powder to layer the scent with the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it.  This transaction was perfect!</li>

            <li> A classic scent with a lovely box.  I bought this for my sister for a gift.</li>
            <li> Love Thymes products and especially this fragrance. Only gave it 4 stars because powder was all over the container when received. Have ordered it in the past and didn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> CLASSIC DUSTING POWDER  -  LOVE THE&lt;br /&gt;FRAGRANCE OF IT  -  ALSO LOOKS WONDERFUL&lt;br /&gt;ON A SHELF IN MY BATHROOM - VERY DECORATIVE</li>
            <li> I know this product and scent from previous purchases elsewhere. The quality is exceptional and the scent is wonderful. The&lt;br /&gt;order was timely and the price reasonable. Would purchase another item from this line in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this Dusting Powder. Wish they would make it in some other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have been hooked on this scent for 15 years. It&#x27;s of incredibly high quality, lots of the lovely, soft scent. Never overwhelming, but long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I love all the Thymes Goldleaf products - wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> but this powder will keep you fresh as a daisy and pleasant to touch. The fragrance is just enough to make you worth standing close to so enjoying your Southern hospitality will be a pleasure for those around you.</li>
