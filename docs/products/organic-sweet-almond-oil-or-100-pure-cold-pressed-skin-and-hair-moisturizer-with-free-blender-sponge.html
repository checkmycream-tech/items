            <li>Considering how dry they have been, this is awesome!!</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this light and lovely skin oil.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is not greasy and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs into my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice oil that was delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>It comes in a clear plastic pump bottle, a very nicely made bottle, the very first thing I did, was unscrewed the pump lid to dip a finger in This stuff</li>
            <li>so it glides light on skin</li>
            <li>I also love how quickly it absorbs right into my skin!</li>
            <li>i love the pump smooth consistent output.</li>
            <li>After purchasing and using the Lux almond oil, it has become my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I am excited about this product.</li>
            <li>This oil was shipped quickly and securely.  </li>
            <li>, the price is right, and dang are they spartan when it comes to packaging!</li>
            <li>You so much :-).</li>
            <li>My skin just sucks it up and the change in texture and appearance is wonderful.</li>
            <li>how novel, a true skin &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>one of my new favorite products.</li>
            <li>Actually feels very pleasant and soothing to my super dry skin.</li>
            <li>No mess what so ever! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Also love the pump because it is not messy.</li>
            <li>I love the way Lux oil makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>And I  consider this to be a major selling point for me, then I see a very detailed section, on skin, scalp, massage, carrier...</li>
            <li>I use right after bath, soaks right in,</li>
            <li>it truly soaks right into your skin .....</li>
            <li>I put it on my face right after I wash my face</li>
            <li>has made my skin on my face look and feel great in just the past week</li>
            <li>Like butter....... Just add a little bit of essential oils and have the best feeling skin you have ever had</li>
            <li>I have also been using this on my daughters dry skin &amp; it has been amazing for her.  </li>
            <li>I have used it daily and love the way my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>first let me start</li>
            <li>definetly getting more, especially since it has helped my girls  </li>
            <li>When i opened the box, it was the first thing I reached for.</li>
            <li>is light and airy, not heavy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely recommend this SAO, to anyone and everyone.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to adding some essential oils to it, to give it a special scent and also to use in some blends, for therapeutic use!</li>
            <li>so much easier than trying to figure out how much and wasting when I poured too much!</li>
            <li>can tell it was a smart purchase, but it did spill a bit in transit.</li>
            <li>I received it so fast, with no leaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Rainbath user and have really found a comfort in its scent</li>
            <li>but it sometimes combats my perfume scent.. and who wants that ?</li>
            <li>I really like how this oil has no scent.</li>
            <li>I did however notice and enjoy how the oil did not burn any tiny cuts and scrapes that are on my hands.</li>
            <li>for the bottle I think its very well made.</li>
            <li>so it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I apply straight out the shower on damp skin.</li>
            <li>I use this as a carrier oil for my essential oils and so far I love the blends that I create.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the past week and love it!</li>
            <li>By far the lux almond oil is far superior than the one I previously used.</li>
            <li>Recently, I purchased Lux Skin Sweet Almond Oil and to my amazement</li>
            <li>I have a normal to oily complexion and have not broken out with this oil.</li>
            <li>The bottle leaked a little when I turned the pump the first time I used it but has been fine since then.</li>
            <li>It really absorbs quick and leaves your skin soft.my girls have ashy skin because of all the sun and chlorine ( we live in FL so it is pretty much summer all year round.)</li>
            <li>I really like putting something natural on my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and silky while not adding an oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>This oil leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without the greasy feeling I&#x27;ve had with other products.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>So far, I like this oil.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and does not look greasy after i apply it.</li>
            <li>It took a few days of applications before I noticed that my skin was remained soft for most of the day, I started using it after my shower and found that I didn&#x27;t need to re-apply it until the next day.</li>
            <li>I also started using it on my face before bed and it makes my skin so soft, but no break outs.  </li>
            <li>it is not heavy</li>
            <li>like I said this is not a heavy oil</li>
            <li>makes shaving a breeze and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>this has softened their skin considerably.</li>
            <li>(Although I am particular about left over product on my hands, I even dont like leftover lotion on my hands)</li>
            <li>I live in central FL</li>
            <li>so much I often use it just by itself for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>so my girls skin is pretty ashy due to the beach and all the chlorine in pools and water parks.</li>
            <li>This SAO is worth every penny, I&#x27;ve been reading and researching oils, I&#x27;m a newbie, so I read the good, bad, the best and worst.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hands and arms because I wash my hands frequently, working in the medical field.</li>
            <li>I soaks right in and leaves little to no oily residue on my hands.</li>
            <li>so now I have to work extra hard to fight those wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>but since using this oil every night for the past few weeks my skin has become very moisturized, smooth, and glowy without feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>I was starting to feel old and I am only 38.  </li>
            <li>It is rare that I write a review and shame on me because they usually influence my decision to purchase, but I have to share the wonders of this product.</li>
            <li>This SAO got my attention very quickly, 100% pure, cold pressed, and they tell you who, what, when and where on the origin of this SAO.</li>
            <li>have very dry sensitive skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> No mess what so ever! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Also love the pump because it is not messy.</li>
            <li> I love the way Lux oil makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> And I  consider this to be a major selling point for me, then I see a very detailed section, on skin, scalp, massage, carrier...</li>
            <li> I use right after bath, soaks right in,</li>
            <li> it truly soaks right into your skin .....</li>
            <li> I put it on my face right after I wash my face</li>
            <li> has made my skin on my face look and feel great in just the past week</li>
            <li> Like butter....... Just add a little bit of essential oils and have the best feeling skin you have ever had</li>
            <li> I have also been using this on my daughters dry skin &amp; it has been amazing for her.  </li>
            <li> I have used it daily and love the way my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> first let me start</li>
            <li> definetly getting more, especially since it has helped my girls  </li>
            <li> When i opened the box, it was the first thing I reached for.</li>
            <li> is light and airy, not heavy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely recommend this SAO, to anyone and everyone.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to adding some essential oils to it, to give it a special scent and also to use in some blends, for therapeutic use!</li>
            <li> so much easier than trying to figure out how much and wasting when I poured too much!</li>
            <li> can tell it was a smart purchase, but it did spill a bit in transit.</li>
            <li> I received it so fast, with no leaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Rainbath user and have really found a comfort in its scent</li>
            <li> but it sometimes combats my perfume scent.. and who wants that ?</li>
            <li> I really like how this oil has no scent.</li>
            <li> I did however notice and enjoy how the oil did not burn any tiny cuts and scrapes that are on my hands.</li>
            <li> for the bottle I think its very well made.</li>
            <li> so it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I apply straight out the shower on damp skin.</li>
            <li> I use this as a carrier oil for my essential oils and so far I love the blends that I create.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past week and love it!</li>
            <li> By far the lux almond oil is far superior than the one I previously used.</li>
            <li> Recently, I purchased Lux Skin Sweet Almond Oil and to my amazement</li>
            <li> I have a normal to oily complexion and have not broken out with this oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked a little when I turned the pump the first time I used it but has been fine since then.</li>
            <li> It really absorbs quick and leaves your skin soft.my girls have ashy skin because of all the sun and chlorine ( we live in FL so it is pretty much summer all year round.)</li>
            <li> I really like putting something natural on my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and silky while not adding an oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> This oil leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without the greasy feeling I&#x27;ve had with other products.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> So far, I like this oil.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and does not look greasy after i apply it.</li>
            <li> It took a few days of applications before I noticed that my skin was remained soft for most of the day, I started using it after my shower and found that I didn&#x27;t need to re-apply it until the next day.</li>
            <li> I also started using it on my face before bed and it makes my skin so soft, but no break outs.  </li>
            <li> it is not heavy</li>
            <li> like I said this is not a heavy oil</li>
            <li> makes shaving a breeze and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> this has softened their skin considerably.</li>
            <li> (Although I am particular about left over product on my hands, I even dont like leftover lotion on my hands)</li>
            <li> I live in central FL</li>
            <li> so much I often use it just by itself for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> so my girls skin is pretty ashy due to the beach and all the chlorine in pools and water parks.</li>
            <li> This SAO is worth every penny, I&#x27;ve been reading and researching oils, I&#x27;m a newbie, so I read the good, bad, the best and worst.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands and arms because I wash my hands frequently, working in the medical field.</li>
            <li> I soaks right in and leaves little to no oily residue on my hands.</li>
            <li> so now I have to work extra hard to fight those wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> but since using this oil every night for the past few weeks my skin has become very moisturized, smooth, and glowy without feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> I was starting to feel old and I am only 38.  </li>
            <li> It is rare that I write a review and shame on me because they usually influence my decision to purchase, but I have to share the wonders of this product.</li>
            <li> This SAO got my attention very quickly, 100% pure, cold pressed, and they tell you who, what, when and where on the origin of this SAO.</li>
            <li> have very dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so it should last a pretty long my time.</li>
            <li> Not clear from the label why it is called organic</li>
            <li> I have tried every cream, lotion, oil that has promised to be the cure for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin  everywhere except my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 3 using SAO, and this has literally healed every dry, chapped area on me</li>
            <li> My skin is.... not itchy, or dry, not chapped or cracked.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have now is that when I purchased the product I paid $34.88 and in a period of less than two weeks the price has gone up to $45.99&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands as it&#x27;s winter now.</li>
            <li> this oil will not heal over night, it will take at least 2 weeks of daily constant use.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am a type 1 extremely brittle diabetic, I also have a trach.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing, because I did want some more but not for 34$.</li>
            <li> It has even helped with the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this oil non stop all over my body for the past few weeks &amp; it has been nothing short of a miracle.  </li>
            <li> this SAO has won hands down over everything else</li>
            <li> and I take a wet baby wipe (sensative skin) and takes waterproof makeup off, and no sting!!  </li>
            <li> You cannot have a price increase of over $10 in less than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> less than one month</li>
            <li> No more dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> The plastic bag that FedEx put the oily box in was also a mess.</li>
            <li> After applying you will have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in</li>
            <li> but it was heavy</li>
            <li> I also am using it on my hair as a conditioner to tame the flyaways.</li>
            <li> It has a faint fragrance, but is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to try it on my hair, as well.</li>
            <li> I have felt refreshed and my skin isn&#x27;t so dull and flakey looking.  </li>
            <li> I have had extremely dry skin for years due to several ailments and winter is always the worst.</li>
            <li> I use it just after showering and it keeps my skin moisturized for at least 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> It is now late June/15 and my girls</li>
            <li> Not many SAO listing do!</li>
            <li> My body shines subtly.</li>
            <li> The continer was broken and the box was submerged in oil.</li>
            <li> plus it would get hard if it got to cold.  </li>
            <li> am sorry but you need to look at your pricing of your product and try to keep it at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> also when it does get cold their skin chaps.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Received it in great time and am satisfied with the quality. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I received it so fast, with no leaking. I love that it&#x27;s 100% organic, the price is right, and dang are they spartan when it comes to packaging! A pump! How perfect. I look forward to using this item as a carrier oil for essential oils. I also love how quickly it absorbs right into my skin!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> So far, I like this oil. I&#x27;m a Rainbath user and have really found a comfort in its scent but it sometimes combats my perfume scent.. and who wants that ? Anyway, this product is more luxurious and thicker than Rainboth. Takes longer to absorb and has zero scent.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell it was a smart purchase, but it did spill a bit in transit. Surprised there wasn&#x27;t more thought put into that, but otherwise awesome!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it, so it will be a perfect carrier for my essential oils. Also love the pump because it is not messy. The oil feels really nice on my skin and makes my hair nice and shiny. My skin feels soft and does not look greasy after i apply it. I also use it on my lips instead of chapstick,  and it feels amazing. Withstands eating and drinking better than any chapstick I&#x27;ve used.  This oil was shipped quickly and securely.  I will be reording this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This product arrived right on time and I am very happy with it. It comes in a convenient pump bottle and is a good product for its cost!</li>
            <li> I purchased this almond oil on February 2nd 2015 after using L&#x27;Occitane supple almond oil. By far the lux almond oil is far superior than the one I previously used. The only problem I have now is that when I purchased the product I paid $34.88 and in a period of less than two weeks the price has gone up to $45.99&lt;br /&gt;I even introduced my friend from st. .Lucia who purchased  two bottles that same week.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry but you need to look at your pricing of your product and try to keep it at an affordable price. You cannot have a price increase of over $10 in less than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;But in all fairness, the product is amazing and I would recommend it 150%.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is not greasy and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> An excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;In less than one month I saw definite increase in hair growth&lt;br /&gt;as well as an improved quality in both my hair &amp; skin.&lt;br /&gt;You have sold me.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this product indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You so much :-).</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this body oil for a week now.  It leaves my skin very soft and silky while not adding an oily feeling.  I have used it daily and love the way my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> I had been using different oils such as grapeseed oil or coconut oil as carrier oils for my essential oils. After purchasing and using the Lux almond oil, it has become my new favorite! The texture is perfect and its so light. I like it so much I often use it just by itself for my dry skin. I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I really like putting something natural on my skin. I am 58 and have not always been good about taking care of my skin so now I have to work extra hard to fight those wrinkles and fine lines. This almond moisturizer is great.</li>
            <li> I have had extremely dry skin for years due to several ailments and winter is always the worst. I have tried every cream, lotion, oil that has promised to be the cure for dry skin. Some worked better than others but none lived up to all their claims. There was also all the chemicals etc.  added to these. This Luxe almond oil is AMAZING. My skin just sucks it up and the change in texture and appearance is wonderful. I use it on my body, face and hair. You will be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower to shave and for all-over extra moisture.It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I use right after bath, soaks right in, no oily residue to get on clothes and the light smell is great. I would purchase again</li>
            <li> Nice oil that was delivered very fast. Not clear from the label why it is called organic (what kind of certification?).</li>
            <li> Truly, that is the best skin oil I have ever used. My body shines subtly. YOLANDE</li>
            <li> Lux oil is awesome!  It dries fast on skin and is never sticky, also works great on hair.</li>
            <li> Like butter....... Just add a little bit of essential oils and have the best feeling skin you have ever had</li>
            <li> It is rare that I write a review and shame on me because they usually influence my decision to purchase, but I have to share the wonders of this product. I have an autoimmune disorder that affects the moisture levels in my skin. Search as I may I never found a moisturizer that would stay with me, I constantly re-applied the lotion and I tried almost every lotion on the drugstore shelf. Recently, I purchased Lux Skin Sweet Almond Oil and to my amazement it does everything it claims to do. It took a few days of applications before I noticed that my skin was remained soft for most of the day, I started using it after my shower and found that I didn&#x27;t need to re-apply it until the next day. I use it as a moisturizer, cuticle oil, even sparingly on my face.  It has a faint fragrance, but is barely noticeable.  After applying you will have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in and then you&#x27;re good to go.  I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair yet, but I did buy a second bottle to leave next to the kitchen sink. If you are a user of argan oil you&#x27;ll find this much better....it truly soaks right into your skin .....how novel, a true skin &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> OMG, my skin is so happy I bought this! LOVE the pump...so much easier than trying to figure out how much and wasting when I poured too much!</li>
            <li> What a great product! I received it very quickly and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. It feels wonderful on my dry, cracked hands that have not done well this winter. I&#x27;m anxious to try it on my hair, as well.</li>
            <li> I love the way Lux oil makes my skin feel soft. It has even helped with the dark circles under my eyes.  I can&#x27;t wait for my next bottle to arrive.</li>
            <li> I am excited about this product. I use this as a carrier oil for my essential oils and so far I love the blends that I create. This oil leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without the greasy feeling I&#x27;ve had with other products. I have a normal to oily complexion and have not broken out with this oil. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I have received this product in exchange for my honest review. I really like how this oil has no scent. It&#x27;s enjoyable.  I have very dry hands as it&#x27;s winter now. As I applied to my hands I was hoping it would soak in more, but with it being oil it felt oily even after trying to rub it in. (Although I am particular about left over product on my hands, I even dont like leftover lotion on my hands) I did however notice and enjoy how the oil did not burn any tiny cuts and scrapes that are on my hands. No burning or stinging what so ever. I think instead of using this as a hydration product for my skin I might use it for massages instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bottle I think its very well made. No leaking from the cap and when you use the pump it does not leak from the spout either. No mess what so ever! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is the best body oil I have ever used!  I use it just after showering and it keeps my skin moisturized for at least 24 hours.  I also started using it on my face before bed and it makes my skin so soft, but no break outs.  It&#x27;s great that is has no odor and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores.  Well worth the price.  A little goes a long way so it should last a pretty long my time.</li>
            <li> The almond oil is helping my skin plus the soft scent is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Very nice product good for kids and adults equally.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about a week. I love it. It is not greasy and absorbs into my skin very quickly. I use it every morning under my lotion. I recommend this oil to anyone looking for smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I use it on my face every day! Makes my skin glow and feel fantastic!</li>
            <li> first let me start I bought this because they were having a $10 off promotion. I am glad I did. I have used this oil in many ways.  1. make up remover, just a dab over my eyes and I take a wet baby wipe (sensative skin) and takes waterproof makeup off, and no sting!!  2. facial moisturizer, after i use it on my body whatever is left on my hands I pat on my face. it is not heavy so it absorbs fast.I also put it on my lips.  3. shaving oil, as soon as i get out the shower put some almond oil and I shave, like I said this is not a heavy oil so it glides light on skin makes shaving a breeze and leaves my skin soft.  4. body oil. I leave it in she shower so as soon as I get out I put it all over. It really absorbs quick and leaves your skin soft.my girls have ashy skin because of all the sun and chlorine ( we live in FL so it is pretty much summer all year round.) also when it does get cold their skin chaps. this has softened their skin considerably. the best method of application is when your skin is humid.  I was a coconut oil user and this is better. I love coconut oil but it was heavy and it did take a while for my skin to absorb and plus it would get hard if it got to cold.  i love the pump smooth consistent output. definetly getting more, especially since it has helped my girls  It has been about 2 weeks since this review. I received a email for 15% off. I was happy until  I saw they raised the price from 24.99 to 34.99. Very disappointing, because I did want some more but not for 34$. Hopefully they will lower the price &#x27;    I re-ordered when I saw they lowered the price. It is now late June/15 and my girls and I are still using the oil.  I live in central FL so my girls skin is pretty ashy due to the beach and all the chlorine in pools and water parks. this oil will not heal over night, it will take at least 2 weeks of daily constant use. I apply straight out the shower on damp skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil non stop all over my body for the past few weeks &amp; it has been nothing short of a miracle.  I suffer from dry skin  everywhere except my face but since using this oil every night for the past few weeks my skin has become very moisturized, smooth, and glowy without feeling oily.  My face has actually not been so oily which is definitely proven to me that the &amp;#34;fight oil with oil&amp;#34; method works.  I have also been using this on my daughters dry skin &amp; it has been amazing for her.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for my stretch marks!!  A little goes a long way.  I will definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> Amazing, no scent, I used it for a massage as well as a lotion after a shower - leaves skin wonderful and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Changed my skin to use in the shower. No more dry winter skin! I love it for shaving too!</li>
            <li> Very light, no scent. Seems to absorb into the skin nicely. The oil came packaged in a padded envelope so I am glad it didn&#x27;t break. The bottle leaked a little when I turned the pump the first time I used it but has been fine since then. I was able to purchase this product at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> My LUX Skin oil arrived!!  I have been using it for the past week and love it! I put it on my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry sensitive skin.  This oil is amazing.  I put it on my face right after I wash my face and then I put my face cream on, as well.&lt;br /&gt;This has made my skin on my face look and feel great in just the past week I have felt refreshed and my skin isn&#x27;t so dull and flakey looking.  I was starting to feel old and I am only 38.  I will be using this moving forward and the price is affordable for me.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The continer was broken and the box was submerged in oil. The plastic bag that FedEx put the oily box in was also a mess.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!! This SAO is worth every penny, I&#x27;ve been reading and researching oils, I&#x27;m a newbie, so I read the good, bad, the best and worst. This SAO got my attention very quickly, 100% pure, cold pressed, and they tell you who, what, when and where on the origin of this SAO. Not many SAO listing do! And I  consider this to be a major selling point for me, then I see a very detailed section, on skin, scalp, massage, carrier... etc. That did it for me! And I  am so very impressed with this SAO. I have chronic health issues, medicine, and  stuck in the winter that won&#x27;t end. My skin was a wreck! This arrived neatly packaged and protected with bubble wrap. When i opened the box, it was the first thing I reached for. It comes in a clear plastic pump bottle, a very nicely made bottle, the very first thing I did, was unscrewed the pump lid to dip a finger in This stuff is light and airy, not heavy or oily feeling. Actually feels very pleasant and soothing to my super dry skin. And it doesn&#x27;t  make me smell like a food prep, waiting to go in the fryer! I&#x27;m on day 3 using SAO, and this has literally healed every dry, chapped area on me, I put a few.drops of vitamin C serum in a bit of SAO (as suggested in this listing), WOW!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has asked, what magic moisturizer I&#x27;ve been using?  My skin is.... not itchy, or dry, not chapped or cracked. My skin hasn&#x27;t felt, or looked this nice for years. I will most definitely recommend this SAO, to anyone and everyone.  I will be a happily satisfied repeat customer.  Speaking from a chronic health issues, point of view. I am a type 1 extremely brittle diabetic, I also have a trach.  For those of you who have health issues, or have a.family member, friend, or spouse.  this SAO has won hands down over everything else, it doesn&#x27;t stop working after 6, 12 or 24hrs,  it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used, or been prescribed.</li>
            <li> I love this Almond Oil...it is great for many uses...body..hair..face...The pump bottle is the best..I just purchased some for my son as a birthday gift.....one of my new favorite products.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this light and lovely skin oil. It absorbs quickly into my skin. I also am using it on my hair as a conditioner to tame the flyaways. I am very happy with this product, it is first class quality and afordable. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Got this oil as a special and must say, I love it! I soaks right in and leaves little to no oily residue on my hands. I use it on my hands and arms because I wash my hands frequently, working in the medical field. My hands feel fabulous and look great! Considering how dry they have been, this is awesome!! Would buy again and put some in smaller bottles to carry with me. I look forward to adding some essential oils to it, to give it a special scent and also to use in some blends, for therapeutic use! My dogs seem to like it too, as they were wanting to lick everywhere I applied!!!</li>
