            <li>Love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Feels cheap, but works great.</li>
            <li>I had to order another real ORIGINAL hair bean.</li>
            <li>It is so easy, she even does her own hair now.  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes for my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I was glad that I bought two</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen knock-offs at the supermarket for way cheaper and made with better quality than these.</li>
            <li>They are flimsy though and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>They came so fast!!!</li>
            <li>Not the original I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, but the packages were bent in order the fit in the box.</li>
            <li>Awesome for African American hair!!!!!</li>
            <li>The only problem we had was removing it from the plastic bubble it was packed in, but it did protect the product from any kind of damage.  </li>
            <li>It easily detangles my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li>Wish that I would have read the reviews First before ordering these.</li>
            <li>overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li>Much stiffer bristles.  </li>
            <li>Also, this doesn&#x27;t matter as much, but goes to my point that this is a knock off, the back of the actual brush on the original is no slip grip and the knock off is smooth plastic...</li>
            <li>My daughter won&#x27;t use the damn things because the bristles are much stiffer than a real hair bean and are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>The reverse is true though, when our hair is wet these brushes work like a dream.</li>
            <li>Buy a large wide tooth comb instead.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, got it sooner than expected.  </li>

            <li> Not the original I wanted.  Much stiffer bristles.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> No No No.  I have 4C hair.  Tangles like crazy after shampooing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Buy a large wide tooth comb instead.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, but the packages were bent in order the fit in the box. The brushes were not damaged though.</li>
            <li> It does what it says for some people I guess!!  My daughter loves it.  No fights over doing the hair what so ever.  It is so easy, she even does her own hair now.  But it didn&#x27;t work for me!  My hair a bit curlier and thicker.  My hair still falls when I brush with this.</li>
            <li> Order two but didn&#x27;t receive but one</li>
            <li> Great company to do business.  Love these brushes for my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  Gets all of the tangles out of her hair.</li>
            <li> This 2 for ~ $21/$22 is not the \\&quot;original\\&quot; but a knock off hair bean that ships from China. My daughter won&#x27;t use the damn things because the bristles are much stiffer than a real hair bean and are pretty sharp. Also, this doesn&#x27;t matter as much, but goes to my point that this is a knock off, the back of the actual brush on the original is no slip grip and the knock off is smooth plastic...I had to order another real ORIGINAL hair bean. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for my dog...</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine, so it is a challenge brushing my long hair.  I bought this for my grand-daughter, and I kept one.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every day but I do like it.  My grand-daughter carries it in her purse.  She loves hers.</li>
            <li> They came so fast!!! The hair brushes untangled my hair with ease.  I was glad that I bought two so I could pass them along.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  It easily detangles my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li> They are a great product. Don&#x27;t pull kids hair. This is 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought this product. Got one for me and one for grandchild.</li>
            <li> great product and works just like promised.</li>
            <li> I got these because all the reviews I read were good. I have two girls. One with long thick hair. One with medium length thin hair. My hair is medium thick and long. It does not work on any of our hair when dry. The reverse is true though, when our hair is wet these brushes work like a dream. They are flimsy though and cheaply made. If I would have known how flimsy I don&#x27;t think I would have bought them. I&#x27;ve seen knock-offs at the supermarket for way cheaper and made with better quality than these.</li>
            <li> This is not the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; hair bean. It has stiffer bristles &amp; pulls hair instead of gliding through.  It does not have &amp;#34;hair bean&amp;#34; written on the brush itself. Wish that I would have read the reviews First before ordering these. Lesson Learned!!!</li>
            <li> This eliminates a long, tedious hassle of removing the tangles from my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  A couple of brushes through her hair and the tangles are gone.  The only problem we had was removing it from the plastic bubble it was packed in, but it did protect the product from any kind of damage.  I would and will recommend this item to friends.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, got it sooner than expected.  One hair bean was def. new, the other hair bean however was dirty when we opened it.  I guess it was just re-packaged?  overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li> Awesome for African American hair!!!!! Feels cheap, but works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand daughters and it has worked great. My only wish is they would make a handle on it. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love these! My second purchase</li>
            <li> these are great for kids.</li>
    </ol>
