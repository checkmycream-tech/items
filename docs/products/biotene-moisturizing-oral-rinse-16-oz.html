            <li>This mouth rinse was pleasant tasting.</li>
            <li>Also pleasant to taste, and non-alcoholic.</li>
            <li>and I always get told I do a good job brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li>Good price and service</li>
            <li>AND IT HAS HELPED TREMENDOUSLY!!!</li>
            <li>A must for a healthy mouth and great check-ups.</li>
            <li>I believe this is an effective pre-swish before brushing.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant sweet taste.</li>
            <li>I had tried all the popular mouth washes and was fine with it</li>
            <li>and I like it better.  </li>
            <li>but I find it to refreshing.</li>
            <li>I buy it from Amazon because of a better price.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years with great success: Few or no cavities.</li>
            <li>The taste is not bad either.</li>
            <li>All of these products have improved my mouth so much I am able to now eat normally.</li>
            <li>my whole family (2 young children) uses this mouthwash and it keeps our teeth nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>It taste good, freshens breath, kills germs and cuts down on tartar and plaque on ones teeth.</li>
            <li>mouthwash is not harsh like many others and feels gentle and soothing.  </li>
            <li>Was really struggling with eating and drinking anything but water.</li>
            <li>Even the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; washes were too much.  </li>
            <li>Dentist recommended it for us, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper getting it here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>For my whole life I have been plagued by abnormally fast plaque build-up.  </li>
            <li>I find this one to be better than the original Biotene based on a few added key ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for about a year and a half and love it.</li>
            <li>When I visited a dentist who had not seen me for several years, he remarked that my gums looked surprisingly healthy compared to when he last saw me.</li>
            <li>All Biotene products came highly recommended to me by my dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended Biotene a few years ago and I love it.  </li>
            <li>As an older person who frequently has a lack of saliva, this works reall well in cleaning the teeth the way natural saliva is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I have dry mouth from medications that I take and their products help the better than any other that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>If used at least twice a day, it helps prevent dryness and seems to magically make plaque build up fall off.</li>
            <li>USE THIS WITH COLGATE SENSITIVE</li>
            <li>so far go wait to go to my dentist app.</li>
            <li>I have severe dry mouth and this Biotene mouth wash has aided relieving somewhat of the dry mouth along with making sure I take several glasses of water during the day.</li>
            <li>Now the accepted indication for Biotene is only for &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; but I believe the formula does inhibit the the main mouth bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On my most recent visit, the Dental Hygienist said &amp;#34;you only have excess plaque in 2 small spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentiust;  been using biotene for years, this new product is really different, better;  stale taste in my mouth is gone;  highly recommended</li>
            <li>I suffer from periodontal disease which in my case was marked by recurrent low grade gum infections.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry mouth due to two very drying medications I cannot live without.</li>
            <li>Everybody&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so I can&#x27;t guarantee that you would enjoy the same results as me, but I would encourage you to at least give it a try if you face the same problem that I did.</li>
            <li>This has helped so much with my dry mouth, was using the blue bottle, but dentist recommended it because of my CPAP machine was causing the dry mouth and a build up of plaque.  </li>
            <li>Very dry mouth and highly sensitive.</li>

            <li> Very dry mouth and highly sensitive.</li>
            <li> : Biotene for dry mouth is so palatable, why don&#x27;t you use the same formula for your plaque-reducing product?</li>
            <li> I have been using Biotene products for dry mouth for years.  </li>
            <li> It takes away the pasty taste that you can get from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have also purchased and used Ora moist dry mouth patch.</li>
            <li> Supposed to help reduce the plaque that is caused from the dry mouth</li>
            <li> Helped heal damage caused by dry mouth.</li>

            <li> so I do have a dry mouth problem so this product helps me.  </li>

            <li> I did not buy this product here as I found it for half the price at my local Costco Pharmacy but thought I should share my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very dry mouth and it helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Now I have hardly any plaque build-up, and am back to cleaning twice each year.  </li>
            <li> I needed to have my teeth cleaned as least 3 times every year, and that still was not enough.  </li>
            <li> and then you have a cleaner mouth, cleaner teeth and less cavities,  and</li>

            <li> MY DENTIST SUGGESTED I USE IT AND IT WORKS...  ALSO DOES NOT CONTAIN ALCOHOL</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentiust;  been using biotene for years, this new product is really different, better;  stale taste in my mouth is gone;  highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth and this Biotene mouth wash has aided relieving somewhat of the dry mouth along with making sure I take several glasses of water during the day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years as advised by my dentist. I go for a cleaning and I always get told I do a good job brushing and flossing. Without Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash I&#x27;d be lost!</li>
            <li> I have been using Biotene products for dry mouth for years.  I have dry mouth from medications that I take and their products help the better than any other that I have tried.  I tried the plaque dissolving mouthwash for a change and I like it better.  It takes away the pasty taste that you can get from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product here as I found it for half the price at my local Costco Pharmacy but thought I should share my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash is not harsh like many others and feels gentle and soothing.  Some have complained about the taste but I find it to refreshing. If used at least twice a day, it helps prevent dryness and seems to magically make plaque build up fall off. I find this one to be better than the original Biotene based on a few added key ingredients.  Also, no saccharin is a plus. Give it a test for two weeks and you will see.</li>
            <li> As a bone marrow transplant patient I have chronic graft versus host disease of the mouth. Very dry mouth and highly sensitive. Was really struggling with eating and drinking anything but water. And then there is concern of how it will effect the health of your teeth and gums. This product along with their toothpaste and mouth gel have worked immensely well. I have also purchased and used Ora moist dry mouth patch. These I use to keep my mouth moist all night while I sleep. All of these products have improved my mouth so much I am able to now eat normally. Do not hesitate to buy because they do work. Just wish someone would have told me months ago.</li>
            <li> I rinse out my mouth with this stuff before brushing because the enzymes in this stuff loosen all that dirt on your teeth before you brush and then you have a cleaner mouth, cleaner teeth and less cavities,  and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s it&#x27;s all about!</li>
            <li> I had tried all the popular mouth washes and was fine with it but as I got older, I noticed these washes were a little too harsh.  Even the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; washes were too much.  I mentioned this to my dental tech who told me about Biotene mouthwash.  I had never heard of Biotene but it&#x27;s all I use now.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended it for us, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper getting it here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> As an older person who frequently has a lack of saliva, this works reall well in cleaning the teeth the way natural saliva is supposed to. My dentist says it prevents gum problems; it has no alcohol; it is definitely a necessary product for me.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HORRIBLE TEETH THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO COLD OR HOT.&lt;br /&gt;I USE THIS WITH COLGATE SENSITIVE AND IT HAS HELPED TREMENDOUSLY!!! THE BEST PART IS THERES NO ALCOHOL TASTE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only mouthwash and tooth paste I can use.  Everything else burns my mouth.  I buy it from Amazon because of a better price.</li>
            <li> What can I say, the stuff works.  It taste good, freshens breath, kills germs and cuts down on tartar and plaque on ones teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Biotene a few years ago and I love it.  I have a very dry mouth and it helps a lot. This was also the best price I could find for purchasing it.</li>
            <li> This has helped so much with my dry mouth, was using the blue bottle, but dentist recommended it because of my CPAP machine was causing the dry mouth and a build up of plaque.  Supposed to help reduce the plaque that is caused from the dry mouth, I know it works to open my mouth in the morning.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Works, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> A must for a healthy mouth and great check-ups. The taste is not bad either.</li>
            <li> Every 6 months my teeth say &amp;#34;CLEAN ME&amp;#34;. My dentist introduced me to this product 2 yrs ago. I started using faithfully 2X a day. On my most recent visit, the Dental Hygienist said &amp;#34;you only have excess plaque in 2 small spots&amp;#34;. Whoopie!</li>
            <li> Oral health:  this is especially for people on multiple meds, including prednisone, to prevent dental problems. Would recommend daily use, as directed, to improve and maintain oral health. Make your dentist&#x27;s day - show him you care enough to make dental hygiene as part of your daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Helped heal damage caused by dry mouth. Contains Xylitol which helps fight bacteria that dry mouth causes. I use it when I get up in the morning, several times during the day, and before bed. Do not rinse your mouth after each use, that way it will keep working. Has a pleasant sweet taste.</li>
            <li> I suffer from periodontal disease which in my case was marked by recurrent low grade gum infections. A few years ago my hygienist suggested Biotene mouth rinses after thorough brushing and flossing. This mouth rinse was pleasant tasting. Within a short time I noticed that the gum infections were not returning. I have used Biotene faithfully ever since and noted definite improvement in the color of the gums. I also had no further cavities. When I visited a dentist who had not seen me for several years, he remarked that my gums looked surprisingly healthy compared to when he last saw me. Now the accepted indication for Biotene is only for &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; but I believe the formula does inhibit the the main mouth bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using Biotene and recommend it heartily.</li>
            <li> I really hated the taste of this stuff. Enough to not even finish using what I had purchased. &amp;#34;Repellent&amp;#34; is the best word to describe the taste.</li>
            <li> my whole family (2 young children) uses this mouthwash and it keeps our teeth nice and clean.  Works really well.</li>
            <li> an excellent product, helpful in minimizing plaque.  Also pleasant to taste, and non-alcoholic.</li>
            <li> For my whole life I have been plagued by abnormally fast plaque build-up.  I needed to have my teeth cleaned as least 3 times every year, and that still was not enough.  Then I discovered Biotene PBF.  What a difference!  I use it twice a day, after brushing.  Now I have hardly any plaque build-up, and am back to cleaning twice each year.  Everybody&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so I can&#x27;t guarantee that you would enjoy the same results as me, but I would encourage you to at least give it a try if you face the same problem that I did.</li>
            <li> I believe this is an effective pre-swish before brushing.  Have used it for about a year and a half and love it.</li>
            <li> Slimy and weirdly plastic taste that lingers. And lingers. And lingers. Even after three scrubs and rinses with water. Note to manufacturer: Biotene for dry mouth is so palatable, why don&#x27;t you use the same formula for your plaque-reducing product? Or is the slimy plastic necessary to coat and kill the microscopic critters? I mean, don&#x27;t kill taste buds in the process.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth due to two very drying medications I cannot live without. All Biotene products came highly recommended to me by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chew the gum, use the mouthwash and toothpaste and also use the mouth spray and gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry mouth, you are a serious risk for increased cavities, bad breath and as you know, sometimes embarrassment when speaking to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water intake is key as well as cutting down on caffeine, and using products like these. After 4 weeks I can tell you that as an RN, it delivers on its promises.</li>
            <li> Good price and service</li>
            <li> I take a lot of medicine so I do have a dry mouth problem so this product helps me.  I have difficulty in transportation so I like to buy in bulk if possible.  So this arrangement is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> so far go wait to go to my dentist app.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years with great success: Few or no cavities. Few or no tartar build up on my teeth.</li>
    </ol>
