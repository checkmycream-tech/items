            <li>To be honest</li>
            <li>To be overly honest - I cant believe it.  </li>
            <li>I wouldnt have believe it if someone else wrote it, but I see it with my own eyes.  </li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t honestly say I noticed any improvement after taking one bottle.</li>
            <li>and I measured 1 full inch of growth!!</li>
            <li>This product is full of the good nutrients I need anyway, so I will continue to use this product until it&#x27;s gone, if for anything,</li>
            <li>The smell is perfect, the pills are sort of large but its cool.</li>
            <li>Hair looks great, honestly haven&#x27;t seen my hair this good in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic hair vitamins!</li>
            <li>I am also satisfied with these.  </li>
            <li>In about 2 weeks in, I noticed thicker , fuller and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>They work great, but it took 2 or 3 months for them to really see a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>I will recommend this, but make sure you continually take it, dont give up.</li>
            <li>received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I have allergy issues off the charts ,I wanted to make sure I could take three a day.</li>
            <li>I can say I do have more eyelashes .</li>
            <li>I ordered some more , so I will give a follow up review .</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that would help my hair grow, so I took it with food hoping it would be okay.</li>
            <li>hair looks better, healthier for sure.  </li>
            <li>this is a good vitamin, would tell someone with not so great looking hair to definitely take it since it works.  </li>
            <li>I went back and bought 2 more bottles!!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that I would highly recommend to anybody that might need to improve the quality of their hair.</li>
            <li>I already take a very good multiple vitamin, and a vitamin for my vision.</li>
            <li>So far he has been happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>i dont know why or if its because i am drinking more water, but i feel great overall.  </li>
            <li>My hair is the type that would break off easily.  </li>
            <li>If you look at the label, there isn&#x27;t any magical ingredient that would cause the hair to grow super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much!!</li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>In short it&#x27;s absolutely one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I used for 1 month and my hair is super healthy and growth so fast I will buy another bottle :)</li>
            <li>I have to pluck my eye brows more, and have to shave my legs more frequently as well.</li>
            <li>General Super Hair Growth vitamins are a really good multi-vitamin product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe, however, that there is anything special in here to make your hair grow faster.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are very easy to take, about the size of a normal vitamin pill.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend, my hair hasnt looked this good in 20 years.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the reviews were real and truthful.</li>
            <li>and when it gets to a certain length it just gets slower, however this product was an answer to my prayers!!</li>
            <li>After taking 2 bottles of these vitamins, I will have to report that there was not a bit of SUPER hair growth obtained by taking this supplement.  </li>
            <li>If you are healthy it shows on the outside, and you have to get healthy on the inside.</li>
            <li>My stomach didn&#x27;t feel good after taking the tablets, but I didn&#x27;t care as long as they will work...</li>
            <li>First, let me just say yes it does work!</li>
            <li>Had fast growth, the name is no joke - super hair growth is correct!  </li>
            <li>i will continue to use it for the rest of the bottle&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple just take 3 tablets a day with food and watch for your own improvements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Make sure you take the right dosage every day for complete results.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend that anyone suffering a similar kind of problem try it really has worked for me!</li>
            <li>I have seen new fine growth coming out of where i part my hair.  </li>
            <li>However if you can just get them down and swallow them, you are good to go.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product that claims to grow your hair super fast, look elsewhere......</li>
            <li>Mostly, they are just a multiple vitamin.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I started out for my first 2 weeks using it in every day</li>
            <li>after taking these my hair is definitely looking better.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it growing better, but it looks shinier and healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first bottle</li>
            <li>So just be aware that this does target hair growth...</li>
            <li>I bought these wanting to see how long my hair could go without breaking so easily and seeing hair shedding all over my floor and shirt, almost like I had a dog!  </li>
            <li>I wish the results were as experienced by others, but so far I see little difference.  </li>
            <li>incase I ever run out of the affordable, good quality daily multiple, but I won&#x27;t be adding to my vitamin pile in the mornings anymore.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I checked before I took them too long.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m super excited about the long term</li>
            <li>As of right now, just normal growth has occurred.  </li>
            <li>The tablets are kinda large, but hey you have to have room to pack all the goodness in them.</li>
            <li>I have no objection to taking these, and there is really nothing in here that will hurt you.</li>
            <li>As someone who suffers from Hypothyroidism, hair loss is a daily frustration, so when I had the opportunity to receive this product at no cost in exchange for an honest review, I was extremely happy to give them a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this I notice I am not shedding as much</li>
            <li>I stopped losing as much and the part that was thinning was growing in.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really lengthen my hair, but added SOME thickness.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m adding to the 5 stars because this product really works.  </li>
            <li>This is a real review.  </li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>am still currently taking these, and I am enjoying the results that so far I have been given!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been taking Will&#x27;s General Super Hair Growth for about 2 weeks now and have really seen a change in my hair.</li>
            <li>His hair is thinning a little on the top and he wanted to find something that would help with that before it was really noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Highly anticipating what the lo9ng term results will be.</li>
            <li>Any multiple vitamin can help it look better, that&#x27;s why there is so much of that normal stuff in here, and only an undisclosed amount of the &#x27;special hair growth formula&#x27; barely listed under the regular vitamins.</li>
            <li>Need a little more time to review.</li>
            <li>She has fine blonde hair that is very damaged from all the styling she does to it daily.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the tablets had a very vanilla smell to them when I opened them.</li>
            <li>Hair looks nice, thick and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been massaging different oils onto my hair a few times a week which alleviated the dry scalp and probably allowed better hair growth.</li>
            <li>As an active review blogger, many companies ask me to review their products, just as Will&#x27;s General Store&lt;br /&gt;Vicki - Dragonfly Tales</li>
            <li>Take them and you will see new hair growth, and nail growth as well.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed lots and lots of new fuzzy hair that is has coming in also.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth .</li>
            <li>i have used this product on my scalp when going natural!</li>
            <li>I was shopping on Amazon and saw the positive reviews and thought this would be my last shot before I would go to a doctor.</li>
            <li>amazing, this along Kelp have done wonders to my thin curly hair</li>
            <li>It surprised me but its there.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s still to early to say if it&#x27;s making my hair grow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I believe that having them that close together really took a big toll on my body.</li>
            <li>it looks longer naturally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m content so far</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term effects are of this product i&#x27;d love it if it was longer than just passed the center of my back</li>
            <li>After becoming pregnant my hair was worse than ever, i didnt expect to get results but as a last ditch effort i decided to try wills general.</li>
            <li>I should have taken the warning about acid reflux more seriously, but I read it after I broke the seal.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with thinning / falling hair on and off for the last ten years, over those years i have tried almost every lotion, potion and magic pill thats ever been brought to market with little to no results.</li>
            <li>I recieved the item the exact expected time</li>
            <li>They were the only new thing that I added to my vitamins, so I decided to take a closer look.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I only paid the &#x27;promotional price&amp;#34; and not the whole giant price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to go down easier with a large glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also noticed other body hair growing quite faster than normal.</li>
            <li>It is a little large, about the size of a regular multi-vitamin.  </li>
            <li>I am always skeptical of products like this, but I noticed that my hair grew more this month that it has in previous months, and I also noticed that my nails are much longer and stronger than before.</li>
            <li>These pills have not given me any problems ,stomach issues , they don&#x27;t have a flavor to them good or bad.</li>

            <li> after taking these my hair is definitely looking better.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it growing better, but it looks shinier and healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first bottle</li>
            <li> So just be aware that this does target hair growth...</li>
            <li> I bought these wanting to see how long my hair could go without breaking so easily and seeing hair shedding all over my floor and shirt, almost like I had a dog!  </li>
            <li> I wish the results were as experienced by others, but so far I see little difference.  </li>
            <li> incase I ever run out of the affordable, good quality daily multiple, but I won&#x27;t be adding to my vitamin pile in the mornings anymore.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I checked before I took them too long.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m super excited about the long term</li>
            <li> As of right now, just normal growth has occurred.  </li>
            <li> The tablets are kinda large, but hey you have to have room to pack all the goodness in them.</li>
            <li> I have no objection to taking these, and there is really nothing in here that will hurt you.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from Hypothyroidism, hair loss is a daily frustration, so when I had the opportunity to receive this product at no cost in exchange for an honest review, I was extremely happy to give them a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this I notice I am not shedding as much</li>
            <li> I stopped losing as much and the part that was thinning was growing in.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really lengthen my hair, but added SOME thickness.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m adding to the 5 stars because this product really works.  </li>
            <li> This is a real review.  </li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> am still currently taking these, and I am enjoying the results that so far I have been given!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been taking Will&#x27;s General Super Hair Growth for about 2 weeks now and have really seen a change in my hair.</li>
            <li> His hair is thinning a little on the top and he wanted to find something that would help with that before it was really noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Highly anticipating what the lo9ng term results will be.</li>
            <li> Any multiple vitamin can help it look better, that&#x27;s why there is so much of that normal stuff in here, and only an undisclosed amount of the &#x27;special hair growth formula&#x27; barely listed under the regular vitamins.</li>
            <li> Need a little more time to review.</li>
            <li> She has fine blonde hair that is very damaged from all the styling she does to it daily.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the tablets had a very vanilla smell to them when I opened them.</li>
            <li> Hair looks nice, thick and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been massaging different oils onto my hair a few times a week which alleviated the dry scalp and probably allowed better hair growth.</li>
            <li> As an active review blogger, many companies ask me to review their products, just as Will&#x27;s General Store&lt;br /&gt;Vicki - Dragonfly Tales</li>
            <li> Take them and you will see new hair growth, and nail growth as well.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed lots and lots of new fuzzy hair that is has coming in also.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth .</li>
            <li> i have used this product on my scalp when going natural!</li>
            <li> I was shopping on Amazon and saw the positive reviews and thought this would be my last shot before I would go to a doctor.</li>
            <li> amazing, this along Kelp have done wonders to my thin curly hair</li>
            <li> It surprised me but its there.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s still to early to say if it&#x27;s making my hair grow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I believe that having them that close together really took a big toll on my body.</li>
            <li> it looks longer naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m content so far</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term effects are of this product i&#x27;d love it if it was longer than just passed the center of my back</li>
            <li> After becoming pregnant my hair was worse than ever, i didnt expect to get results but as a last ditch effort i decided to try wills general.</li>
            <li> I should have taken the warning about acid reflux more seriously, but I read it after I broke the seal.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with thinning / falling hair on and off for the last ten years, over those years i have tried almost every lotion, potion and magic pill thats ever been brought to market with little to no results.</li>
            <li> I recieved the item the exact expected time</li>
            <li> They were the only new thing that I added to my vitamins, so I decided to take a closer look.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I only paid the &#x27;promotional price&amp;#34; and not the whole giant price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to go down easier with a large glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also noticed other body hair growing quite faster than normal.</li>
            <li> It is a little large, about the size of a regular multi-vitamin.  </li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of products like this, but I noticed that my hair grew more this month that it has in previous months, and I also noticed that my nails are much longer and stronger than before.</li>
            <li> These pills have not given me any problems ,stomach issues , they don&#x27;t have a flavor to them good or bad.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been on them long enough yet to notice,a difference yet.</li>
            <li> If anyone is at their wits end about their hair thinning, especially at my age, I recommend trying scalp massage for dry scalp, meditation/yoga for stress, and this product!</li>
            <li> I have really been wanting to grow my bangs out, and in the time period since taking these, My bangs went from hitting at the bridge of my nose and now as I write this, they are down to the tip of my nose, a little over an inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few days now and my hair seems so much healthier shiny and never before have i had fly away hair until today it was shocking people were commenting on my hair already!</li>
            <li> got extremely jittery not long after taking these  in the morning .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t belive my hair has grown 2.5 inches in one month and nails are long too</li>
            <li> its the only thing that worked for me as I have tried other products.  </li>
            <li> But be very careful if you already take daily vitamins.</li>
            <li> this product does not live up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> Seriously if you want to experience steady hair growth month to month</li>
            <li> After a month of daily use im noticing there are only a few hairs falling out during bathing / styling and im feeling much less self concious about my hair.</li>
            <li> , Please dnt waste Ur money, they are like regular vitamins...</li>
            <li> The hair partings especially the middle was widening and over the years it only got worse.</li>
            <li> Needless to say after my first bottle going on my second, I can definitely see less hair shedding and little tuffs of hair growing in my hair partings!</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are working for hair growth or not I&#x27;ve only been talking them for almost two weeks will continue taking and see if I start to see any results</li>
            <li> There are a few ingredients in minor quantities that are for hair health.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other people.</li>
            <li> i tried some other products that did not work as well as this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other vitamins, Rogaine, shampoos, and hair growth products on the market but couldn&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not too bad and the pills are easy to swallow in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> i have always had problems with thinning hair and just not very full looking.  </li>
            <li> i wish it was as long as it used to be, this product does work half an inch growth in a few days is a lot in a product</li>
            <li> I have used simialr products in the past which have left my roots looking heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these abut a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Helped my hair grow over an inch and a half in about a month.  </li>
            <li> No side effects and my hair even falls out less now.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed I have less hair in my shower drain.</li>
            <li> After using these vitamins ive found that my hair does seem fuller and a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Hair seems to be growing and a little healthier.</li>
            <li> so it might be a little to soon for result.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, I just wish the pills were a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> , I wanted a ointment, waste of money, I wish for a refund</li>
            <li> and I have been using it now for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It did not work even when I was taking them religiously everyday for three weeks, as directed.</li>
            <li> Well like most ppl, I was very skeptical about buying this product because the reviews just seemed fake because they were all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues growing my hair for a long time, for some reason its a very slow growth.</li>
            <li> Smell is so bad, I couldnt continue to take it, at first I didnt know it was capsule</li>
            <li> It may have been due to dandruff, stress, genetics, I don&#x27;t know, but it was far too devastating for a young woman to experience this.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if they work</li>
            <li> usually after shampooing and conditioning (or cowash)</li>
            <li> When you are putting mascara everyday , you notice!</li>
            <li> My hair started to fall more and the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> I have a slight thinning spot on the front area that is filling in and am shocked with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Pill was EXTREMELY hard for me to swallow.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be improving or at least that is what my hairdresser says.</li>
            <li> Want to get my hair thick</li>
            <li> I like how it is slow releases.  </li>
            <li> My hair always seems to grow a very slow pace</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any after tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Crap and waste of money..</li>
            <li> I have 4b/c hair and this didn&#x27;t work for me, the smell was horrible and the pills were quite big</li>
            <li> I like this vitamin because it doesn&#x27;t have artificial sweeteners.  </li>
            <li> During my evaluation of this product, I did not experience any bad side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate to feel like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>

            <li> I have suffered with thinning / falling hair on and off for the last ten years, over those years i have tried almost every lotion, potion and magic pill thats ever been brought to market with little to no results. After becoming pregnant my hair was worse than ever, i didnt expect to get results but as a last ditch effort i decided to try wills general. I have used simialr products in the past which have left my roots looking heavy and greasy. After a month of daily use im noticing there are only a few hairs falling out during bathing / styling and im feeling much less self concious about my hair. I would reccomend that anyone suffering a similar kind of problem try it really has worked for me!</li>
            <li> Fantastic hair vitamins! I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are working for hair growth or not I&#x27;ve only been talking them for almost two weeks will continue taking and see if I start to see any results</li>
            <li> I have been taking these abut a week and a half. I looked at the label today, because I thought they had caffeine in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got extremely jittery not long after taking these  in the morning . They were the only new thing that I added to my vitamins, so I decided to take a closer look. Mostly, they are just a multiple vitamin. There are a few ingredients in minor quantities that are for hair health. (If you were to read up on that on Google, you&#x27;d find just what you needed to take.)  After looking at the ingredients, I understood why I am so jittery. I am overdosing on vitamins!!!!!  I already take a very good multiple vitamin, and a vitamin for my vision. Add these, and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m taking three once daily multiple vitamins at a time. Oh my gosh...I hate to feel like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned! I have no objection to taking these, and there is really nothing in here that will hurt you. But be very careful if you already take daily vitamins. It IS very possible to overdose on vitamins. I&#x27;m just glad I checked before I took them too long. I don&#x27;t believe, however, that there is anything special in here to make your hair grow faster. Any multiple vitamin can help it look better, that&#x27;s why there is so much of that normal stuff in here, and only an undisclosed amount of the &#x27;special hair growth formula&#x27; barely listed under the regular vitamins. Luckily, I only paid the &#x27;promotional price&amp;#34; and not the whole giant price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will go to the back of the cupboard incase I ever run out of the affordable, good quality daily multiple, but I won&#x27;t be adding to my vitamin pile in the mornings anymore.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Really works!</li>
            <li> I just received my pills today! The smell is perfect, the pills are sort of large but its cool. 1 month from now il post a pic of my results. 90 Pills came in a bottle , I&#x27;ll take two a day and we&#x27;ll see what happens next! 💖💇</li>
            <li> After using these vitamins ive found that my hair does seem fuller and a little thicker. I have a slight thinning spot on the front area that is filling in and am shocked with the results so far. Highly anticipating what the lo9ng term results will be. I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want thicker, fuller hair?  I know I do!  As someone who suffers from Hypothyroidism, hair loss is a daily frustration, so when I had the opportunity to receive this product at no cost in exchange for an honest review, I was extremely happy to give them a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....what did I think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, Will’s General Super Hair Growth vitamins are a really good multi-vitamin product. If you look at the label, there isn&#x27;t any magical ingredient that would cause the hair to grow super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too bad and the pills are easy to swallow in my opinion.  During my evaluation of this product, I did not experience any bad side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these vitamins until my supply runs out in order to see if hair growth is noticeable.  As of right now, just normal growth has occurred.  This product is full of the good nutrients I need anyway, so I will continue to use this product until it&#x27;s gone, if for anything, my daily multi-vitamin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 6/11/15*  After taking 2 bottles of these vitamins, I will have to report that there was not a bit of SUPER hair growth obtained by taking this supplement.  If you are looking for a good multi-vitamin, then this is a good choice.  If you are looking for a product that claims to grow your hair super fast, look elsewhere......this product does not live up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will buy again once I run out! I have been taking this supplement for a week now and have found this product . I will keep you up to date as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if they work but I hope they do iof my hair  reaches my back then I might just reach my peak</li>
            <li> My hair would grow and then break off, so I wanted to buy something to see if it would help.  I also had a lot of shedding, I could tell on my floor and in the bathroom, pillow, etc.  After using this I notice I am not shedding as much so my scalp must be a lot healtheir.  Very happy with these vitamins.</li>
            <li> Crap and waste of money.. I started loosing all my hair.. I dnt want to buy again, Please dnt waste Ur money, they are like regular vitamins...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I dnt want to give even One star to this product..</li>
            <li> Got a surprise when my nails started to grow faster also.  Hair looks nice, thick and shiny.  A plus plus plus</li>
            <li> I had very good results.  Hair came in thicker as I was having problem with thinning.  Happy I made the purchase and will buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> i dont know why or if its because i am drinking more water, but i feel great overall.  i started these because i was experiencing hair loss and thinning , and THEY WORK.  after over a month I saw thickness, shine and growth in my hair.  I stopped losing as much and the part that was thinning was growing in.  I am ending my three month supply and will reorder for another 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am also satisfied with these.  I saw an improvement and will continue to buy.  To be honest its the only thing that worked for me as I have tried other products.  With this my hair looks thicker and healthier.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> To be overly honest - I cant believe it.  I have seen new fine growth coming out of where i part my hair.  It surprised me but its there.  I wouldnt have believe it if someone else wrote it, but I see it with my own eyes.  I plan on continuing with these indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Taste so gross can&#x27;t even swallow them</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I have to say.  Good vitamin, saw a good improvement, happy with this and will buy another bottle.  Want to get my hair thick like I was in my 20s.  I think it&#x27;s possible if I keep taking this!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really lengthen my hair, but added SOME thickness. Pill was EXTREMELY hard for me to swallow. Maybe it works for other people. i will continue to use it for the rest of the bottle&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> No side affects to speak of. Hair seems to be growing and a little healthier.</li>
            <li> I i have used this product on my scalp when going natural! usually after shampooing and conditioning (or cowash) my hair looks !!!  Using this product, I saw a difference in my hair. So happy with that .</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;m using it with beard farmers beard growth to grow out my beard. In about 2 weeks in, I noticed thicker , fuller and healthy hair. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!! I&#x27;ve used it for a month and I measured 1 full inch of growth!! My hair always seems to grow a very slow pace and when it gets to a certain length it just gets slower, however this product was an answer to my prayers!! I started out for my first 2 weeks using it in every day, when I started noticing growth I cut back to using it twice a week. I went back and bought 2 more bottles!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet, but it has definitely made my nails grow longer.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.I like them.give them a try. Haven&#x27;t been on them long enough yet to notice,a difference yet.</li>
            <li> i have always had problems with thinning hair and just not very full looking.  after taking these my hair is definitely looking better.  i tried some other products that did not work as well as this so i can recommend someone to take these.</li>
            <li> My hair is the type that would break off easily.  I bought these wanting to see how long my hair could go without breaking so easily and seeing hair shedding all over my floor and shirt, almost like I had a dog!  Since I bought these I DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM ANYMORE.  My hair has grown an inch since I started taking these and I am very happy that I bought these vitamins.  Not only is it growing better, but it looks shinier and healthier.OH YES</li>
            <li> Who knows if this works. Daughter couldn&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Non-Profit Product Tester)Contact for your product review</li>
            <li> Does not work. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Hair looks great, honestly haven&#x27;t seen my hair this good in a long time.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  In short it&#x27;s absolutely one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  Had fast growth, the name is no joke - super hair growth is correct!  Definitely recommend.  If your hair is thinning, buy it, it works.</li>
            <li> This is not my 1st hair supplement but it just maybe my last. Seriously if you want to experience steady hair growth month to month this is it! Enough said!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Hair fall.</li>
            <li> amazing, this along Kelp have done wonders to my thin curly hair</li>
            <li> i am have been taking the hair vitamin for two weeks so it might be a little to soon for result.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few days now and my hair seems so much healthier shiny and never before have i had fly away hair until today it was shocking people were commenting on my hair already! i can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term effects are of this product i&#x27;d love it if it was longer than just passed the center of my back i wish it was as long as it used to be, this product does work half an inch growth in a few days is a lot in a product i&#x27;m super excited about the long term effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smell is so bad, I couldnt continue to take it, at first I didnt know it was capsule , I wanted a ointment, waste of money, I wish for a refund</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I was sent this to test for my GlamRiver blog and I have been using it now for a few weeks. I think it&#x27;s still to early to say if it&#x27;s making my hair grow but I am looking forward to the results with my continued use!  Even my daughter has been using it!  It&#x27;s all natural so it&#x27;s a great supplement to add to our morning vitamin list!</li>
            <li> Need a little more time to review.</li>
            <li> Ordered these after looking around a lot, a lot of research.  They work great, but it took 2 or 3 months for them to really see a noticeable difference.  Here I am 6 months later and have tons of hair growth.  My barber literally asked me if I was taking anything.  I will recommend this, but make sure you continually take it, dont give up.</li>
            <li> Well like most ppl, I was very skeptical about buying this product because the reviews just seemed fake because they were all 5 stars. Well, I&#x27;m adding to the 5 stars because this product really works.  I&#x27;m on my first bottle and oh my god did my hair grew with fuller texture. This product does ext it says it suppose to do, which is hair growth.</li>
            <li> These pills actually work. I am always skeptical of products like this, but I noticed that my hair grew more this month that it has in previous months, and I also noticed that my nails are much longer and stronger than before. My nails are not breaking at all like they used to. This is a quality product, I just wish the pills were a little stronger. I did receive this for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> Good quality hair support.</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker after 1 month</li>
            <li> The pills work.  Thats all there is to it.  Take them and you will see new hair growth, and nail growth as well.  It kicks start whatever it is in thats in your body that needs these nutrients to grow hair and nails.  Would definitely recommend, my hair hasnt looked this good in 20 years.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve had issues growing my hair for a long time, for some reason its a very slow growth. This product has made my hair grow faster than it ever has grown in just a matter of months than years.</li>
            <li> I have been in the process of growing out my hair, and have been taking this for a couple weeks now to see just how it would work for me. First, let me just say yes it does work! I have really been wanting to grow my bangs out, and in the time period since taking these, My bangs went from hitting at the bridge of my nose and now as I write this, they are down to the tip of my nose, a little over an inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this does grow hair, it truly grows it everywhere. I have also noticed other body hair growing quite faster than normal. I have to pluck my eye brows more, and have to shave my legs more frequently as well. So just be aware that this does target hair growth... all hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very easy to take, about the size of a normal vitamin pill. However the only thing that might be a bit off putting is the smell. I won&#x27;t sugar coat it, they stink! If you are someone who is affected by the taste of a pill, then you might have some difficulty with this. However if you can just get them down and swallow them, you are good to go. I have not experienced any after tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still currently taking these, and I am enjoying the results that so far I have been given!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product approx. 3 weeks, I have had a 1 inch hair growth.  I have experienced no side effects from this product.  I feel it has been beneficial.  I recommend trying it.  As an active review blogger, many companies ask me to review their products, just as Will&#x27;s General Store&lt;br /&gt;Vicki - Dragonfly Tales</li>
            <li> My husband began taking these a couple of weeks ago.  His hair is thinning a little on the top and he wanted to find something that would help with that before it was really noticeable.  So far he has been happy with the results.  He has not seen a drastic change but he has noticed that his hair is starting to look thicker.  He also has noticed that his scalp is not as oily as it was before.  He is very happy with this vitamin and plans to continue using it.  It is a little large, about the size of a regular multi-vitamin.  It seems to go down easier with a large glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Great buy, will buy another bottle.  Helped my hair grow over an inch and a half in about a month.  No side effects and my hair even falls out less now.  This is a real review.  My hair is thicker too.  Great.</li>
            <li> Thank u I recieved the item the exact expected time and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> If you are healthy it shows on the outside, and you have to get healthy on the inside. I have 3 children and 2 of my children are just 18 months apart in age. I believe that having them that close together really took a big toll on my body. I have been taking Will&#x27;s General Super Hair Growth for about 2 weeks now and have really seen a change in my hair. Not only my hair but my nails also, they are no longer splitting and peeling. I was pleasantly surprised that the tablets had a very vanilla smell to them when I opened them. The tablets are kinda large, but hey you have to have room to pack all the goodness in them. My daughter has also started taking them. She has fine blonde hair that is very damaged from all the styling she does to it daily. I have noticed lots and lots of new fuzzy hair that is has coming in also. She is very impressed because she has always wanted thicker hair. This is a great product that I would highly recommend to anybody that might need to improve the quality of their hair. It&#x27;s simple just take 3 tablets a day with food and watch for your own improvements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest opinion. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Did not like I this product didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> I have been taking two a day for almost a month now . I have noticed I have less hair in my shower drain. The recommended dosage is three a day , which I will be starting. I have allergy issues off the charts ,I wanted to make sure I could take three a day. I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth . How,? by seeing or feeling ? I can say I do have more eyelashes . When you are putting mascara everyday , you notice! These pills have not given me any problems ,stomach issues , they don&#x27;t have a flavor to them good or bad. I ordered some more , so I will give a follow up review .</li>
            <li> I should have taken the warning about acid reflux more seriously, but I read it after I broke the seal.  I wanted a product that would help my hair grow, so I took it with food hoping it would be okay. It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t! If you get indigestion don&#x27;t take this product.</li>
            <li> hair looks better, healthier for sure.  this is a good vitamin, would tell someone with not so great looking hair to definitely take it since it works.  good job.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very good product! I used for 1 month and my hair is super healthy and growth so fast I will buy another bottle :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been like 6 days. I feel like my hair is growing. it looks longer naturally. I&#x27;m content so far and it has been since last Thursday</li>
            <li> I have 4b/c hair and this didn&#x27;t work for me, the smell was horrible and the pills were quite big</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t honestly say I noticed any improvement after taking one bottle.</li>
            <li> I wish the results were as experienced by others, but so far I see little difference.  I will continue to take them, however and amend this review at that time.</li>
            <li> It did not work even when I was taking them religiously everyday for three weeks, as directed. My hair started to fall more and the smell is awful. My stomach didn&#x27;t feel good after taking the tablets, but I didn&#x27;t care as long as they will work... but, they didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy it, but when I saw the review and how it worked for others, I decided to purchase it. Big mistake... maybe, it&#x27;s not for me cause it didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker or healthier (no improvement whatsoever)... very disappointed and I don&#x27;t think the reviews were real and truthful.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be improving or at least that is what my hairdresser says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female college student and since freshman year for some reason my hair was thinning...a lot. It may have been due to dandruff, stress, genetics, I don&#x27;t know, but it was far too devastating for a young woman to experience this. The hair partings especially the middle was widening and over the years it only got worse. I&#x27;ve tried other vitamins, Rogaine, shampoos, and hair growth products on the market but couldn&#x27;t see the difference. I was shopping on Amazon and saw the positive reviews and thought this would be my last shot before I would go to a doctor. Needless to say after my first bottle going on my second, I can definitely see less hair shedding and little tuffs of hair growing in my hair partings! I&#x27;ve also been massaging different oils onto my hair a few times a week which alleviated the dry scalp and probably allowed better hair growth. If anyone is at their wits end about their hair thinning, especially at my age, I recommend trying scalp massage for dry scalp, meditation/yoga for stress, and this product!</li>
            <li> I like this vitamin because it doesn&#x27;t have artificial sweeteners.  The vitamins and minerals are just what I am looking for in a multivitamin.  What happened to it?  For awhile I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon.  Really works.  I like how it is slow releases.  Please please don&#x27;t discontinue this.  I wish it was a subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Yes it works. Make sure you take the right dosage every day for complete results.</li>
            <li> I hope this will work .Hair seems to be thicker than before starting use.</li>
            <li> works!!!! Can&#x27;t belive my hair has grown 2.5 inches in one month and nails are long too</li>
