            <li>This item was the perfect replacement foil for my husband&#x27;s Panasonic wet/dry razor - which he says is the BEST razor he has ever owned, but it does NOT include the two inner blades.  </li>
            <li>very much satisfied, great product, although I thought a bit pricy.</li>
            <li>I love my shaver!</li>
            <li>My son said it was amazing how much better the razor worked.</li>
            <li>Having written that, this product worked just fine and the service, shipping and delivery time were exceptional.</li>
            <li>Works better than the rest.  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon</li>

            <li>It works well and fits fine.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement...perfect fit...</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>The first was third party OEM and not as good as the original foil.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, all good.</li>
            <li>He feels that is a terrific value on a fantastic electric shaver!</li>
            <li>The original foil was silver but the black does look better.</li>
            <li>The black color looks very nice with the blue body of the shaver.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>Really like it,</li>
            <li>Works like a new razor!</li>
            <li>The shave is much smoother and closer with the new foil.  </li>
            <li>I like it in the black color better than the original grey color.  </li>
            <li>The suggestion is to replace this foil at least once in 12 month, then you will have the continuous feel of smooth and clean shaving.</li>
            <li>My husband replaced both the original foil and the inner blades after 14 months of daily use!  </li>
            <li>Sort of like the old color printer/color replacement cartridge dilemma...  </li>
            <li>I got this to replace my hubby&#x27;s old shaver foil.</li>
            <li>My old one is over 2 years old.</li>
            <li>New foil and blade combination represents some 40/50% of a new purchase of similar type.</li>
            <li>No only shaves faster, but also almost does no iritate my skin as did the previous different brands that I&#x27;ve been using for many years.  </li>
            <li>If I shave with it daily, I can get 2 complete shaves out of it!</li>
            <li>and 30% of the original cost seems excessive.</li>
            <li>Not a lot to say here, other than it works as advertised, but is too much money for such a simple item.</li>
            <li>I use this Panasonic razor head every with no problem as it is just like a new razor  now which I expected.</li>

            <li> I have no idea why the REPLACEMENT foil and blades are so expensive considering the overall cost of a complete razor...Sort of like the old color printer/color replacement cartridge dilemma...  Having written that, this product worked just fine and the service, shipping and delivery time were exceptional.</li>
            <li> This item was the perfect replacement foil for my husband&#x27;s Panasonic wet/dry razor - which he says is the BEST razor he has ever owned, but it does NOT include the two inner blades.  We ordered them separately.  My husband replaced both the original foil and the inner blades after 14 months of daily use!  He feels that is a terrific value on a fantastic electric shaver!</li>
            <li> Works better than the rest.  Too bad it is discontinued product.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this shaving machine.  No only shaves faster, but also almost does no iritate my skin as did the previous different brands that I&#x27;ve been using for many years.  Maybe the charge on the battery should last longer. I supose it&#x27;s because this motor runs faster than other shaving machines.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Color looks good. Gives a very nice close shave.  Well worth the money.  Fast delivery. No problems. I love Amazon</li>
            <li> Works like a new razor!</li>
            <li> Not a lot to say here, other than it works as advertised, but is too much money for such a simple item.</li>
            <li> I use this Panasonic razor head every with no problem as it is just like a new razor  now which I expected.</li>
            <li> Had the shaver for years but wore out this head.&lt;br /&gt;Got this new one trying to economize and it worked and fit great.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase along with the replacement blades a while ago.  Excellent replacement.  Performing flawlessly.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly and worked like it should. This still is the best razor I have ever owned. Will buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> Just as described. This was a replacement...perfect fit...no complaints. I had no reason to not order from them again..happy customer</li>
            <li> The suggestion is to replace this foil at least once in 12 month, then you will have the continuous feel of smooth and clean shaving.</li>
            <li> My Panisonic razor is still working great after more than 10 years with regular replacement of the foil and cutter. Battery lasts for about a week even with my thick beard.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my hubby&#x27;s old shaver foil. It works well and fits fine. He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, driving to work, on vacations. It has enough charge to do my face and head with time to spare. If I shave with it daily, I can get 2 complete shaves out of it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replasce the origional for my sons razor. The instillation was easy and the product worked perfectly. My son said it was amazing how much better the razor worked.</li>
            <li> I like it in the black color better than the original grey color.  lt retro fitted perfectly on my Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li> Continues to work well</li>
            <li> Product is good. Came quickly. Works great with my shaver Panasonic ES8901. Wish the price was less though. But other than that, all good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced cutters on my razor before but never the foil.  Well it appears that you should do this together ie cutter and foil replaced at same time.  The shave is much smoother and closer with the new foil.  Should be sold together...</li>
            <li> Great replacement foil, it fits perfect and shaves as its intended too.  I love my shaver!</li>
            <li> In relation to buying a new razor the parts are expensive. New foil and blade combination represents some 40/50% of a new purchase of similar type.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement. Really like it, very much satisfied, great product, although I thought a bit pricy. do recommend this product</li>
            <li> Unbelievable it works like new again. I waited to long to make a change. My old one is over 2 years old.</li>
            <li> Received item in perfect condition,the foil assembly fit perfectly on to my shaver with no problems. The black color looks very nice with the blue body of the shaver. The original foil was silver but the black does look better.</li>
            <li> This is the second replacement foil I have gotten for this razor.  The first was third party OEM and not as good as the original foil.  This replacement seems nearly as good.  Hard to tell at this stage.  Pricey though and 30% of the original cost seems excessive.</li>
