            <li>This clip is great.</li>
            <li>I have never have a problem with them breaking on their own, it&#x27;s always been my fault!</li>
            <li>I just opened the package which arrived on time and in good condition</li>
            <li>So when I read the Product Description describe it as 7.1 x 5 x 3 inches, I was delighted.</li>
            <li>I guess those are there for good reason.</li>
            <li>Great transaction, will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>This is a great add-on product and I am so glad you offer it.  </li>
            <li>(not that this is the most attractive option either, but..)</li>
            <li>Love these clip!</li>
            <li>Love them and would recommend them!</li>
            <li>I had one of these prevoiusly and sat on it...was so glad to find the replacement!.  </li>
            <li>Nice design, the wings tuck in when wearing for a sleaker look.</li>
            <li>Nice product, so I thought.  </li>
            <li>This also make this clip work nicely under the hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Strong and the finger ridges fold in!</li>
            <li>I Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li>This is a very comfortable hair clip.</li>
            <li>Love my product.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for hiding a tiny ponytail (to look as if I have an undo underneath it).</li>
            <li>Love the \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; handles.</li>
            <li>I would love it if they were better made ... hence, 4 stars instead of 5.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite hair clips.  </li>
            <li>Could be better for permed or thicker hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love how it isn&#x27;t bulky and you are able to \\&quot;hide\\&quot; it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>the clip has to wrap around the hair tail as opposed to gripping through OR around the hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found one.</li>
            <li>Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>, so I was glad to b able to order them here.</li>
            <li>The invisigrip is my favorite style and brand.  </li>
            <li>So, I went online, found it, and promptly, purchased three (3) more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They aren&#x27;t the most durable, however.</li>
            <li>I have bought many.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these but the clips are flimsy.</li>
            <li>Love the Invisigrip hair clip.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE).</li>
            <li>This wingless hair clip is perfect for up do&#x27;s and is extremely comfortable to wear since it accommodates leaning back while sitting.  </li>
            <li>Very cool, just wish my baby-like hair could hold the claws in.</li>
            <li>These incredible wings are the \\&quot;open uppers\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>They disappeared into the contraption, becoming part of the design.  </li>
            <li>Feels like they&#x27;ll easily break.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull your hair!</li>
            <li>However, I do expect the website description to be accurate.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>innovative &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; design for the &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; is unique and very smart.  </li>
            <li>very easy to use and holds the hair very well, and did not slip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it breaking, nor with it catching my hair.  </li>
            <li>So far it has held up, but again, it&#x27;s for thicker hair than mine, so my daughters got a nice treat.</li>
            <li>(An occasional break, but overall excellent.)</li>
            <li>I love how compact this clip is after it is in my hair; it is also very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li>and this is one clip that really works!!</li>
            <li>I heard the first chords of the Hallelujah Chorus!  </li>
            <li>This really holds your hair tight, and it&#x27;s kind of amazing how it is just &amp;#34;there&amp;#34;, then you click the sides up and off it comes,</li>
            <li>Trying to figure out a way to make it work and get my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The plastic is the cheaper kind they use now, not the sturdy stuff they used several years ago.</li>
            <li>I loved it before it broke--the hidden \\&quot;invisigrip\\&quot; part is really cool</li>
            <li>Love this hair clip and really like how it lays more flat then others !</li>
            <li>I can see how this can snap apart more readily than my older one (that I can&#x27;t find anymore</li>
            <li>and it does great holding my hair up or down!!</li>
            <li>It Is, by far, better looking than most traditional clips.</li>
            <li>One wing came right off first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Nice thick claw not flimsy like most clips.</li>
            <li>I quickly hooked my hair up using this amazing device, and pressed the wings down.  </li>
            <li>It is far from accurate as it stated the size is 7.1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, they do have that design flaw in that the part of the clip that experiences the most stress has just a tiny bit of plastic against the wire.  </li>
            <li>This bigger size is much better and the looks to be sturdier.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local drug stores anymore</li>
            <li>And yes, this is exactly it.</li>
            <li>It broke on the first use.</li>
            <li>I really love that these don&#x27;t stab me in the back of my head if I happen to fall asleep with it in.</li>
            <li>First, let me stress, I am in love with this clip...with the following advice.  </li>
            <li>when I purchased my first clip, I drove home and in my excitement to try it, I ripped it out of the packaging and threw the cardboard away.  </li>
            <li>I love these clips because of the low profile.</li>
            <li>GREAT for thick longer hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that once they&#x27;re in place you can fold down the pinch clips and have a smooth silhouette.  </li>
            <li>I really like the &#x27;invisigrip&#x27;, which looks nicer and neater than most claw clips (a big plus for wearing to the office).  </li>
            <li>Loved the way it worked/looked but this clip broke the 2nd or 3rd time I used it.</li>
            <li>They also hold better than many other claws; I&#x27;ve had no problems with it slipping out of my straight, fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to find them in my local drug store and the fact that the arms fold down is great for when you put your head back on a couch or headrest.</li>
            <li>I received the dark brown clip (the one pictured) and liked the concept of the clip.</li>
            <li>Broke after just 2 months - the plastic holding in the spring isn&#x27;t strong enough...</li>
            <li>Not as large as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>great for bundling my hair without the larger grips that just look a little to much.  </li>
            <li>But I have to admit after I discovered how much I like it</li>
            <li>A clip this size is meant to hold all of your hair up so the spring needs to be much stronger.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Scuunci wingless clip, two per pack and much stronger spring.  </li>
            <li>, I have to double wrap to fit.</li>
            <li>You need as much hair as a horses tail for this thing.</li>
            <li>Plastic is really flimsy and they don&#x27;t hold my hair.</li>
            <li>It looks really neat and compact in your hair.</li>
            <li>Really did not like this clip.</li>
            <li>Good for thick pony</li>
            <li>I would be very excited if they came in any other colors, brown, for instance.  </li>
            <li>My clips last for many months, even with daily use.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give up, though, and worked on it many times over the next several days.  </li>
            <li>I do use them almost every day, but since I have a bunch of them, none gets particularly abused.</li>
            <li>Clearly it will not stand too much use.  </li>
            <li>I had a smaller version of this from a different vendor that I split trying to fit too much hair.</li>
            <li>Even though they were only $3-something,  I don&#x27;t think they were worth it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re prolly fine, but i have medium length curly thin hair and it falls out easily.</li>
            <li>It even works well for only clipping up a portion of my hair and the fold down wings help to appear more stylish than the other brands that dont.</li>
            <li>this clip was way too big to grasp my slippery smooth hair properly...</li>
            <li>This clip is terrific, but please be aware...</li>
            <li>I, also, would not be adverse to bright colors like red, blue, green, etc.  </li>
            <li>Out of the last batch of 4, one broke the first week, and another within a month of purchase.</li>
            <li>I thought this might be a nice clip because it looks so compact, without the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; that are usually sticking out to help you grip it and pinch it open.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34;  to open and close the clip folds down and blends with the rest of the clip.  </li>
            <li>Not suitable for me as I have straight and smooth hair texture.</li>
            <li>It stays tight throughout my busy &amp;#34;mom days.&amp;#34; It does not cause breakage, as the edges are smoothly polished.</li>
            <li>I went to my car where I had been carrying around my old one that broke.</li>
            <li>i still use it, so its not a waste, but i woudnt buy it again for me, anyway.</li>
            <li>Nice clip, hasn&#x27;t broken yet,</li>
            <li>kinda cool because the clip wings spread out to open, then snap into the curve of the clip when closed.  </li>
            <li>but the Scuunci feels like it gets the better grip because it also has some fingers that go into the center of the hair area (see picture with one wing up and one down on each).  </li>
            <li>Because the grips fold down it looks smooth in the back.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this out of curiosity as to how it worked after seeing it when looking up my usual clip.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a clip that was Extra Large to replace one that I have had for a long time.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t really expect one 7&amp;#34; long I was expecting one of larger size.</li>
            <li>Over time, regular use will stress the plastic encasing the thick spring, which will more than likely lead to breakage.</li>
            <li>Then the clips fold back down into the jaws and look like they are part of the whole mechanism, seamlessly.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something at least 3 inches long, preferably 2 or more inches wide.</li>
            <li>Also the teeth are not as well spaced/oriented as most of my clips and it slides right out :(</li>
            <li>For those of us with fine thin hair that hardly need more than a barrette, you may have trouble getting this claw to stay in your hair.  </li>
            <li>But it certainly needs to last longer than a few wearings.</li>

            <li> and it does great holding my hair up or down!!</li>
            <li> It Is, by far, better looking than most traditional clips.</li>
            <li> One wing came right off first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Nice thick claw not flimsy like most clips.</li>
            <li> I quickly hooked my hair up using this amazing device, and pressed the wings down.  </li>
            <li> It is far from accurate as it stated the size is 7.1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, they do have that design flaw in that the part of the clip that experiences the most stress has just a tiny bit of plastic against the wire.  </li>
            <li> This bigger size is much better and the looks to be sturdier.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local drug stores anymore</li>
            <li> And yes, this is exactly it.</li>
            <li> It broke on the first use.</li>
            <li> I really love that these don&#x27;t stab me in the back of my head if I happen to fall asleep with it in.</li>
            <li> First, let me stress, I am in love with this clip...with the following advice.  </li>
            <li> when I purchased my first clip, I drove home and in my excitement to try it, I ripped it out of the packaging and threw the cardboard away.  </li>
            <li> I love these clips because of the low profile.</li>
            <li> GREAT for thick longer hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that once they&#x27;re in place you can fold down the pinch clips and have a smooth silhouette.  </li>
            <li> I really like the &#x27;invisigrip&#x27;, which looks nicer and neater than most claw clips (a big plus for wearing to the office).  </li>
            <li> Loved the way it worked/looked but this clip broke the 2nd or 3rd time I used it.</li>
            <li> They also hold better than many other claws; I&#x27;ve had no problems with it slipping out of my straight, fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to find them in my local drug store and the fact that the arms fold down is great for when you put your head back on a couch or headrest.</li>
            <li> I received the dark brown clip (the one pictured) and liked the concept of the clip.</li>
            <li> Broke after just 2 months - the plastic holding in the spring isn&#x27;t strong enough...</li>
            <li> Not as large as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> great for bundling my hair without the larger grips that just look a little to much.  </li>
            <li> But I have to admit after I discovered how much I like it</li>
            <li> A clip this size is meant to hold all of your hair up so the spring needs to be much stronger.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Scuunci wingless clip, two per pack and much stronger spring.  </li>
            <li> , I have to double wrap to fit.</li>
            <li> You need as much hair as a horses tail for this thing.</li>
            <li> Plastic is really flimsy and they don&#x27;t hold my hair.</li>
            <li> It looks really neat and compact in your hair.</li>
            <li> Really did not like this clip.</li>
            <li> Good for thick pony</li>
            <li> I would be very excited if they came in any other colors, brown, for instance.  </li>
            <li> My clips last for many months, even with daily use.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give up, though, and worked on it many times over the next several days.  </li>
            <li> I do use them almost every day, but since I have a bunch of them, none gets particularly abused.</li>
            <li> Clearly it will not stand too much use.  </li>
            <li> I had a smaller version of this from a different vendor that I split trying to fit too much hair.</li>
            <li> Even though they were only $3-something,  I don&#x27;t think they were worth it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re prolly fine, but i have medium length curly thin hair and it falls out easily.</li>
            <li> It even works well for only clipping up a portion of my hair and the fold down wings help to appear more stylish than the other brands that dont.</li>
            <li> this clip was way too big to grasp my slippery smooth hair properly...</li>
            <li> This clip is terrific, but please be aware...</li>
            <li> I, also, would not be adverse to bright colors like red, blue, green, etc.  </li>
            <li> Out of the last batch of 4, one broke the first week, and another within a month of purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a nice clip because it looks so compact, without the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; that are usually sticking out to help you grip it and pinch it open.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34;  to open and close the clip folds down and blends with the rest of the clip.  </li>
            <li> Not suitable for me as I have straight and smooth hair texture.</li>
            <li> It stays tight throughout my busy &amp;#34;mom days.&amp;#34; It does not cause breakage, as the edges are smoothly polished.</li>
            <li> I went to my car where I had been carrying around my old one that broke.</li>
            <li> i still use it, so its not a waste, but i woudnt buy it again for me, anyway.</li>
            <li> Nice clip, hasn&#x27;t broken yet,</li>
            <li> kinda cool because the clip wings spread out to open, then snap into the curve of the clip when closed.  </li>
            <li> but the Scuunci feels like it gets the better grip because it also has some fingers that go into the center of the hair area (see picture with one wing up and one down on each).  </li>
            <li> Because the grips fold down it looks smooth in the back.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this out of curiosity as to how it worked after seeing it when looking up my usual clip.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a clip that was Extra Large to replace one that I have had for a long time.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t really expect one 7&amp;#34; long I was expecting one of larger size.</li>
            <li> Over time, regular use will stress the plastic encasing the thick spring, which will more than likely lead to breakage.</li>
            <li> Then the clips fold back down into the jaws and look like they are part of the whole mechanism, seamlessly.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something at least 3 inches long, preferably 2 or more inches wide.</li>
            <li> Also the teeth are not as well spaced/oriented as most of my clips and it slides right out :(</li>
            <li> For those of us with fine thin hair that hardly need more than a barrette, you may have trouble getting this claw to stay in your hair.  </li>
            <li> But it certainly needs to last longer than a few wearings.</li>
            <li> The large ones are just too  cumbersome and stick out, and, the small ones are not enough.  </li>
            <li> I find them new clips to be slightly rougher along the prongs</li>
            <li> Gave up on it after the first few tries.</li>
            <li> the few millimeter thick plastic holding each end of the strong spring in place.  </li>
            <li> Really heavy and harsh feeling in my hair...not as comfortable as other brands of clips I have purchased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for new hair accessories and I picked up a pair of hair clips similar to this one but slightly smaller.  </li>
            <li> I think this as the clasps used to open the clip close in and don&#x27;t stick out like other clips, which make it not as obvious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clips for as long as I&#x27;ve seen them on the market.  </li>
            <li> The jaws open really wide and can hold a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have worn these clips for a long time.</li>
            <li> This clip really holds thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> but I have thick hair and this clip does not slip that much.</li>
            <li> However, since I have a lot of thick hair (not curly, between wavy and straight) the clip can&#x27;t hold it up well.</li>
            <li> In case you are wondering, it has wings in the middle on each side that lift up so you can grasp it and open the clip and then once placed the wings drop down forming the side of the clip.  </li>
            <li> It falls loose after an hour.</li>
            <li> The spring is a bit loose.  </li>
            <li> my complaints are that the arms are kinda stiff and dont fold up and down easily, (not sure if this is because it&#x27;s new or if it will never ease up) and that there&#x27;s no little teeth inside to help hold your hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this clip for a very very long time!  </li>
            <li> For some reason the brown one continues to work well, but as soon as I pressed the wings open on the black one, the clip flew apart and was unusable.</li>
            <li> I have only found the clip in black, however.  </li>
            <li> I tried the sleek little clip, but could not open it!  </li>
            <li> I expected them to last a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is because of the stronger spring the folding arms on the Scuunci break after a few months</li>
            <li> Their customer service did give me a partial return on my cost.</li>
            <li> While it did hold a partial section of my hair, it only stayed in place a few minutes before falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have waist length, thick, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Not very large at all!</li>
            <li> Despite what is listed as &amp;#34;item size&amp;#34; and the fact it is a single clip on the card board this clip is only small to medium sized, 1.5 inch by just over 2 inch.</li>
            <li> Today, one of the springs&#x27; ends popped through the plastic, as other reviewers described.  </li>
            <li> I should have heeded the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I like to pin my hair up after I shower and dry my hair, and the larger clips often hit the back of the seat in the car, making them uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and thought they were the same size as the other claw type hair clips.</li>
            <li> This is really big and will hold a thick hank of hair.  </li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought, you need thick hair.</li>
            <li> The way they designed the grip was a little awkward to use at the beginning, but nothing you can not pick up quickly.</li>
            <li> I have hair that almost goes down to my knees...</li>
            <li> It cant even hold half.</li>
            <li> but I read the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 and got 2 black and a brown.  </li>
            <li> The black one I got, one of the flippy handles is loosy goosy.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and these hold without pulling on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend it for long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> During one of these athletic events, my thumbnail caught the side and a graceful little \\&quot;wing\\</li>
            <li> However, I recently have gotten a short haircut, and it does not work for short hair :( .</li>
            <li> I told my daughter I would buy another, but wonder if I should by a few of them since the design is prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clip for a few months</li>
            <li> One of the handle was missing and it cannot be used.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hair that I wear in a bun; I use 3 of these to hold my hair up.  </li>
            <li> Not sure which I prefer just yet</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how these will do.</li>
            <li> These are small.</li>
            <li> Well, not sure if it was the product itself or the way it was shipped, but it broke the FIRST time I tried to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money :(</li>
            <li> Not sure if that will affect its performance.</li>
            <li> I like using clips to pull back my hair, but I hate looking like I have a plastic butterfly on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> This is for thin hair or little girls.</li>
            <li> I gave it to a friend with thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, textured, longer hair (about 3&amp;#34; below my shoulders).</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair or thick hair</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair (mine has been layered), this should work for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like putting my hair in a rubber band as it pulls hair out, and I don&#x27;t like using a scrunchi as they are not very attractive</li>
            <li> This clip is very difficult to open and put on.</li>
            <li> They r very hard to find in a drugstore, considering what a common item they r</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward to use, but that is why it hold thick hair well.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find!</li>
            <li> The hinged side pieces were very hard to move.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I think it may have been a fluke because I wouldn&#x27;t expect this problem clipping my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> I believe this clip would work well on thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and need a sturdy clip with lots of room!</li>
            <li> Too difficult to use with one hand.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the clip, it&#x27;s my hair (or lack thereof)</li>
            <li> But one out of 8 isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I took it out of the box and tried to put it in my hair! :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very annoying</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I WOULD put 5 *****&#x27;s because my teenage daughter LOVES this clip and used it for four months.  Today, one of the springs&#x27; ends popped through the plastic, as other reviewers described.  So, &amp;#34;yes, it breaks.&amp;#34;  And, &amp;#34;yes, it&#x27;s a great clip for medium-thick ponytail.&amp;#34;  I told my daughter I would buy another, but wonder if I should by a few of them since the design is prone to breakage.  There is a lot of stress that is put on the few millimeter thick plastic holding each end of the strong spring in place.  Over time, regular use will stress the plastic encasing the thick spring, which will more than likely lead to breakage.</li>
            <li> Love my product. Great transaction, will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Its a hair clip and wife says it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Bought several for growing out hair transition.  Perfect for hiding a tiny ponytail (to look as if I have an undo underneath it).</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in this purchase.  The clip I received was tortoise in color.  Out of the package you could see the ends of the spring were almost through the plastic on the one I received.  Clearly it will not stand too much use.  The hinged side pieces were very hard to move.  While it did hold a partial section of my hair, it only stayed in place a few minutes before falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you cannot expect a lot of quality for the price  nd it was an add on item so shipping was not an issue.  However, I do expect the website description to be accurate.  It is far from accurate as it stated the size is 7.1&amp;#34; x 5.3&amp;#34;.  The one I received falls short of 2.5&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34;.  While I didn&#x27;t really expect one 7&amp;#34; long I was expecting one of larger size.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair but a lot of it. Gathered together I would say maybe an inch in diameter. This clip can not hold all of it. It cant even hold half. It falls loose after an hour. Very disappointing. Love the \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; handles. Trying to figure out a way to make it work and get my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Not as large as I had hoped. Well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for new hair accessories and I picked up a pair of hair clips similar to this one but slightly smaller.  They were two to a card.  I love the fact that once they&#x27;re in place you can fold down the pinch clips and have a smooth silhouette.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with breakage of the clip but the item lost a star because after I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a prolonged period it will occasionally tangle as I&#x27;m removing it.  But I have to admit after I discovered how much I like it I went back and bought another card of clips.  They have become my favorites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clips for as long as I&#x27;ve seen them on the market.  I have very long, very thick hair that I wear in a bun; I use 3 of these to hold my hair up.  (Nothing else will hold my hair, not spiral pins, not bobby pins, nuthin&#x27;.)  My clips last for many months, even with daily use.  However, they do have that design flaw in that the part of the clip that experiences the most stress has just a tiny bit of plastic against the wire.  I would love it if they were better made ... hence, 4 stars instead of 5.  Given my experience, I&#x27;m wondering how the 1-star people are handling the clips.</li>
            <li> Nice design, the wings tuck in when wearing for a sleaker look.</li>
            <li> Came without locking center but like when its complete</li>
            <li> Best clip ever! Strong and the finger ridges fold in!</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I took it out of the box and tried to put it in my hair! :(</li>
            <li> This wingless hair clip is perfect for up do&#x27;s and is extremely comfortable to wear since it accommodates leaning back while sitting.  This is one of my favorite hair clips.  For some reason the brown one continues to work well, but as soon as I pressed the wings open on the black one, the clip flew apart and was unusable.</li>
            <li> Despite what is listed as &amp;#34;item size&amp;#34; and the fact it is a single clip on the card board this clip is only small to medium sized, 1.5 inch by just over 2 inch. I wanted something at least 3 inches long, preferably 2 or more inches wide. Also the teeth are not as well spaced/oriented as most of my clips and it slides right out :(</li>
            <li> It loosen out after 30 mins of wear. Not suitable for me as I have straight and smooth hair texture. Could be better for permed or thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Nice product, so I thought.  It broke within one week...second use I think.  It may be the design which is ideal, but not if it breaks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clip for a few months and I love it.  I really like the &#x27;invisigrip&#x27;, which looks nicer and neater than most claw clips (a big plus for wearing to the office).  I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it breaking, nor with it catching my hair.  The jaws open really wide and can hold a lot of hair.  They also hold better than many other claws; I&#x27;ve had no problems with it slipping out of my straight, fine textured hair.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with the product and am sad to hear that others have had quality issues.</li>
            <li> I think I used this clip a handful of times over a month when it broke. I loved it before it broke--the hidden \\&quot;invisigrip\\&quot; part is really cool so you don&#x27;t have those big clip wings sticking out of your head. But it certainly needs to last longer than a few wearings.</li>
            <li> this clip was way too big to grasp my slippery smooth hair properly... I gave it to a friend with thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have worn these clips for a long time. I have never have a problem with them breaking on their own, it&#x27;s always been my fault! I love how it isn&#x27;t bulky and you are able to \\&quot;hide\\&quot; it. It&#x27;s also super comfortable and doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull your hair! Without a doubt the best hair clip ever!</li>
            <li> I just opened the package which arrived on time and in good condition and I love it. I had a smaller version of this from a different vendor that I split trying to fit too much hair. This bigger size is much better and the looks to be sturdier. I have thick curly hair so the trick will be to not overload it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update in about 6 months to see how it&#x27;s holding up.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I find them new clips to be slightly rougher along the prongs and I even got a hair stuck in the spring. Still, I like tucking the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; away for a cleaner look. I probably won&#x27;t be back to buy them a third time.   Hard to find! I&#x27;ve had two of these clips for about 2yrs. One finally broke, as they all do. I rinse my clips every night and the metal spring finally rusted through. I have thick, textured, longer hair (about 3&amp;#34; below my shoulders). This clip holds my hair in an upside-down ponytail and won&#x27;t slide out. It stays tight throughout my busy &amp;#34;mom days.&amp;#34; It does not cause breakage, as the edges are smoothly polished. I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local drug stores anymore but thankfully they are here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The spring is a bit loose.  A clip this size is meant to hold all of your hair up so the spring needs to be much stronger.  I prefer the Scuunci wingless clip, two per pack and much stronger spring.  The only problem is because of the stronger spring the folding arms on the Scuunci break after a few months but by then you&#x27;ve lost them so who cares!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the fingers on this clip are very short the clip has to wrap around the hair tail as opposed to gripping through OR around the hair.  Not sure which I prefer just yet but the Scuunci feels like it gets the better grip because it also has some fingers that go into the center of the hair area (see picture with one wing up and one down on each).  Again the fingers break off after some months on the Scuunci.  Just got this one so I&#x27;m not sure how these will do.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this clip.  I had it three days and the clip broke in my hand. It is awesome otherwise, but I can&#x27;t keep purchasing a clip every three days. Vidal needs to work on the durability of this clip and he would have a dynamite hair clip.</li>
            <li> It could be a challenge to figure out how to use the product but I read the previous reviews. I thought I was receiving one clip and there were 7 so for me this was a great deal! Nice clip, hasn&#x27;t broken yet,</li>
            <li> I have been looking for one of these clips for a couple of years. I&#x27;m so glad to have found one. I went to my car where I had been carrying around my old one that broke. And yes, this is exactly it. I need to order.more.</li>
            <li> I have hair that almost goes down to my knees... this is the only clip that works for me. I Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is not what the Product Description said it would be. I have been trying to find a clip that was Extra Large to replace one that I have had for a long time. So when I read the Product Description describe it as 7.1 x 5 x 3 inches, I was delighted. When it arrived, it was only 2 1/4 x 1 7/8 x 1 1/4 inches! Not very large at all! Their customer service did give me a partial return on my cost.</li>
            <li> kinda cool because the clip wings spread out to open, then snap into the curve of the clip when closed.  Good for thick pony, I have to double wrap to fit.</li>
            <li> Love these clip! This is second purchase for different shade</li>
            <li> great for bundling my hair without the larger grips that just look a little to much.  very easy to use and holds the hair very well, and did not slip.  The way they designed the grip was a little awkward to use at the beginning, but nothing you can not pick up quickly.</li>
            <li> These hair clips could probably hold a 1-inch diameter pony-tail with no problem.  For those of us with fine thin hair that hardly need more than a barrette, you may have trouble getting this claw to stay in your hair.  It kept falling out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The innovative &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; design for the &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; is unique and very smart.  You unfold the clips to open the jaws, and place it in your hair. Then the clips fold back down into the jaws and look like they are part of the whole mechanism, seamlessly.  Very cool, just wish my baby-like hair could hold the claws in.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a nice clip because it looks so compact, without the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; that are usually sticking out to help you grip it and pinch it open. I guess those are there for good reason. This clip is very difficult to open and put on. Gave up on it after the first few tries.</li>
            <li> This is a very comfortable hair clip. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> One wing came right off first time I used it. You need as much hair as a horses tail for this thing.</li>
            <li> I like using clips to pull back my hair, but I hate looking like I have a plastic butterfly on the back of my head.  This is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it worked/looked but this clip broke the 2nd or 3rd time I used it. Pieces came apart. My money was refunded so I was happy. I think it may have been a fluke because I wouldn&#x27;t expect this problem clipping my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I never even got to use this product. It broke upon attempting to open it to put it in my hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and need a sturdy clip with lots of room! This does the trick!</li>
            <li> I discovered these wingless clips by another brand name, but couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  I found this Vidal Sassoon brand and figures I would give it a go.  They are just as awesome.  I ordered 3 and got 2 black and a brown.  I have long thick hair and these hold without pulling on my hair.  Love them and would recommend them!</li>
            <li> Love this hair clip and really like how it lays more flat then others !</li>
            <li> It broke on the first use. Poorly made.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Bought as an add-on. Even though they were only $3-something,  I don&#x27;t think they were worth it. Plastic is really flimsy and they don&#x27;t hold my hair. Feels like they&#x27;ll easily break.</li>
            <li> These are small. I have thick hair and thought they were the same size as the other claw type hair clips. Not so. This is for thin hair or little girls.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this out of curiosity as to how it worked after seeing it when looking up my usual clip. In case you are wondering, it has wings in the middle on each side that lift up so you can grasp it and open the clip and then once placed the wings drop down forming the side of the clip.  It looks really neat and compact in your hair.</li>
            <li> I used this clip the day I received it and it worked perfectly. I went to use it the following morning, and the plastic bit holding the spring in placed snapped. I should have heeded the other reviews.</li>
            <li> These clips r great. They r very hard to find in a drugstore, considering what a common item they r, so I was glad to b able to order them here. There is a lot of clips out there but I have thick hair and this clip does not slip that much. It even works well for only clipping up a portion of my hair and the fold down wings help to appear more stylish than the other brands that dont.</li>
            <li> Broke after just 2 months - the plastic holding in the spring isn&#x27;t strong enough...</li>
            <li> Holds my hair great! I have very thick hair and this is one clip that really works!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product...!!!!!</li>
            <li> This clip really holds thick, long hair. Wish it came in more colors!!!! Nice thick claw not flimsy like most clips. Good buy!!!</li>
            <li> Well, not sure if it was the product itself or the way it was shipped, but it broke the FIRST time I tried to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I had one of these prevoiusly and sat on it...was so glad to find the replacement!.  I love the fact that the &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34;  to open and close the clip folds down and blends with the rest of the clip.  This also make this clip work nicely under the hair. I put mine in a pony tail, clip the clip just above the rubber band, and it looks like a fancy up do without the work. Because the grips fold down it looks smooth in the back.</li>
            <li> I really love that these don&#x27;t stab me in the back of my head if I happen to fall asleep with it in. Only problem I have is keeping them away from my daughters.</li>
            <li> Really did not like this clip. I didn&#x27;t realize it was an invisigrip before I purchased it, but thought it would still work out. My hair kept falling out... Very annoying</li>
            <li> The *style* of this clip is great. I used to be able to find them in my local drug store and the fact that the arms fold down is great for when you put your head back on a couch or headrest. that being said, this clip does the job. my complaints are that the arms are kinda stiff and dont fold up and down easily, (not sure if this is because it&#x27;s new or if it will never ease up) and that there&#x27;s no little teeth inside to help hold your hair. If you have a lot of hair or thick hair you&#x27;re prolly fine, but i have medium length curly thin hair and it falls out easily. i still use it, so its not a waste, but i woudnt buy it again for me, anyway.</li>
            <li> It Is, by far, better looking than most traditional clips. The invisigrip is my favorite style and brand.  (An occasional break, but overall excellent.)</li>
            <li> First, let me stress, I am in love with this clip...with the following advice.  I have been hunting for a mid-size hair clip for some time.  The large ones are just too  cumbersome and stick out, and, the small ones are not enough.  And, don&#x27;t get me started on the tiny ones.  This clip is terrific, but please be aware...when I purchased my first clip, I drove home and in my excitement to try it, I ripped it out of the packaging and threw the cardboard away.  I tried the sleek little clip, but could not open it!  No matter how I tried, I couldn&#x27;t keep my hair up and navigate the clip at the same time.  I didn&#x27;t give up, though, and worked on it many times over the next several days.  During one of these athletic events, my thumbnail caught the side and a graceful little \\&quot;wing\\&quot; popped up.  I swear, I heard the first chords of the Hallelujah Chorus!  A lightbulb popped up over my head, and I had an epiphany.  These incredible wings are the \\&quot;open uppers\\&quot;.  I quickly hooked my hair up using this amazing device, and pressed the wings down.  They disappeared into the contraption, becoming part of the design.  Walgreens, where I purchased it, no longer had any stock.  So, I went online, found it, and promptly, purchased three (3) more.  I have only found the clip in black, however.  I would be very excited if they came in any other colors, brown, for instance.  I, also, would not be adverse to bright colors like red, blue, green, etc.  Here&#x27;s my advice...buy this product, but by all means, read the directions, BEFORE you throw them away!</li>
            <li> This is really big and will hold a thick hank of hair.  It is a little awkward to use, but that is why it hold thick hair well.  I gave it to my daughter - too big for me.  If you have thick hair (mine has been layered), this should work for you.</li>
            <li> I love these clips because of the low profile. I like to pin my hair up after I shower and dry my hair, and the larger clips often hit the back of the seat in the car, making them uncomfortable. This one doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t the most durable, however. Out of the last batch of 4, one broke the first week, and another within a month of purchase. I do use them almost every day, but since I have a bunch of them, none gets particularly abused. I expected them to last a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, good product!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a larger clip and this ad seems to make that claim - without actually stating it! Would not recommend it for long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> GREAT for thick longer hair. Stays put, and looks sleek. However, I recently have gotten a short haircut, and it does not work for short hair :( . GREAT clip though! I reccommend!</li>
            <li> Broke after two days.</li>
            <li> This really holds your hair tight, and it&#x27;s kind of amazing how it is just &amp;#34;there&amp;#34;, then you click the sides up and off it comes,</li>
            <li> One of the handle was missing and it cannot be used. Since it was well protected in the mailing box, I think it is the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I have had this clip for a very very long time!  it is my go to clip!!  i have very thick hair and it does great holding my hair up or down!!</li>
            <li> This is a great add-on product and I am so glad you offer it.  I love how compact this clip is after it is in my hair; it is also very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  BTW- I have waist length, thick, naturally curly hair and it works great.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received the dark brown clip (the one pictured) and liked the concept of the clip. However, since I have a lot of thick hair (not curly, between wavy and straight) the clip can&#x27;t hold it up well. I believe this clip would work well on thin hair.</li>
            <li> This clip is great. I have bought many. Yes one of them broke after I used it once. But one out of 8 isn&#x27;t bad. Especially for this price. I will continue to buy this pr</li>
            <li> I LOVE these but the clips are flimsy.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to use with one hand.</li>
            <li> Really heavy and harsh feeling in my hair...not as comfortable as other brands of clips I have purchased</li>
            <li> Love the Invisigrip hair clip. Works great, look awesome. Easy to use, and keeps hair in place. Great price, works awesome.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the clip, it&#x27;s my hair (or lack thereof) that&#x27;s the problem.:(</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought, you need thick hair. The black one I got, one of the flippy handles is loosy goosy. Not sure if that will affect its performance. The brown one was fine.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is the cheaper kind they use now, not the sturdy stuff they used several years ago. I can see how this can snap apart more readily than my older one (that I can&#x27;t find anymore and I LOVE). So far it has held up, but again, it&#x27;s for thicker hair than mine, so my daughters got a nice treat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like putting my hair in a rubber band as it pulls hair out, and I don&#x27;t like using a scrunchi as they are not very attractive (not that this is the most attractive option either, but..) I think this as the clasps used to open the clip close in and don&#x27;t stick out like other clips, which make it not as obvious. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different types of clips, but def. like this one the best. I&#x27;ve used it for 5 months now with no issues. I even carry it in my bag at work for when I decide to pull my hair back, and I use it in my hair when working out.</li>
