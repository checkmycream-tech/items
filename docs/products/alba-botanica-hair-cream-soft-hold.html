            <li>This product works great!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Great item!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Putting on damp hair seemed to work the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>But its great if you wash your hair once in 2 days or sooner!</li>
            <li>Biggest, best features:</li>
            <li>Works great for my curly hair, even though it&#x27;s not advertised for curly hair specifically.  </li>
            <li>theres also a great smell.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>and it works great too.  </li>
            <li>It works great as a styling cream and to refresh my hair when it becomes wind blown or frizzy.</li>
            <li>Works great for that.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>and I get great curls.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, so glad I found this, very happy.</li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance free hair cream!</li>
            <li>and i love the smell!</li>
            <li>/&gt;FWIW, the best product for my hair type was Alterna Hemp Texturizing Glaze; it has been discontinued, but if you&#x27;re interested, the company could recommend a newer product that is comparable.</li>
            <li>This style cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>his is a fantastic product at a great price.</li>
            <li>So happy to have found something that&#x27;s a better fit!</li>
            <li>Nice texture.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, it held nicely.</li>
            <li>Excellent for soft, defined and bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Soft Hold,&amp;#34; if you use a bit more, it creates a nice, long-lasting hold.  </li>
            <li>I was still able to style my hair.</li>
            <li>Some are ok, some don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Works as well or better than Aveda Be Curly line, but without the obnoxious scent.  </li>
            <li>in on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I also love that I can get it on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair company is Devacurl</li>
            <li>pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love that.  </li>
            <li>if I want a stronger hold, I can just use more cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this is the first Alba Botanica product that I wasn&#x27;t pleased with.</li>
            <li>Great product for natural cury hair.</li>
            <li>Looked great and even better the second day.</li>
            <li>Strong Hold Style Gel, 7-Ounce</li>
            <li>It was amazing, it really made a difference on how my hair looked.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>and it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>(If you look at the curl-typing chart I&#x27;ve linked to, my under-layers are most like 3A, the two images to the right.)</li>
            <li>Also great for when you blow dry your hair as it leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li>I figured if it&#x27;s good for my hair, it&#x27;s not really going to have holding power, and that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I actually use it for my son&#x27;s hair and it is perfect for creating a nice part or smoothing fly-aways without giving a crispy gelled down look.</li>
            <li>I pretty much gave up on ever finding a good product until a friend suggested I try Alba, so I purchased one on Amazon and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li>Super-</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using this instead of a mousse. :)</li>
            <li>It never lets me down, and always gives me great hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the soft hold on this product.</li>
            <li>I got this to use on safari as it is unscented, I liked it enough to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Alba Botanica products I&#x27;ve tried, and I decided to give this one a shot since several gals over at the Naturally Curly hair forums really liked it as a curl cream.  </li>
            <li>This product really is a \\&quot;soft hold\\&quot; so you may need to add more when the frizz happens.</li>
            <li>I got this curl cream because I&#x27;ve been trying to replace my chemical laden products with more natural products.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is naturally wavy/curly/frizzy and this product was amazing at taming my hair, making it soft and more manageable, more so than any other product.  </li>
            <li>Since I live in a very humid climate, I use both cream &amp; a gel for more curl definition.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>Where the product loses a star is that for me it&#x27;s best not to put this directly on my scalp.</li>
            <li>It also works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Did nothing for the 30%-40% of my hair that is gray/graying -- somewhat coarse, and more frizzy than curly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it did nothing for the coarse hair on the top of my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this as a styling cream before putting the hot curling iron to it.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to all fragrance and am switching all of my hair products to more natural versions of themselves.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, eco-friendly, and works much better than some more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Use a very little amount (pea sized) on wet hair for best results.</li>
            <li>but it was only found on amazon, so I bought several more tubes to stock up!</li>
            <li>Works really really well</li>
            <li>Works very well...</li>
            <li>It absolutely rocked and you don&#x27;t even need to use that</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it really is fragrance-free, and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because it appeared to be more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; than any other product like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like my hairs are able to connect and bond with each other.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine, curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe when summer is over and it&#x27;s cool enough to heat style my hair again, I&#x27;ll try it and see if air drying is the issue.</li>
            <li>it worked reasonably well on the under-layers of my hair, which is fine in texture, with loose, soft curls.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t weigh down my fine curly hair and kept frizz away very well.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m no longer using products that have potentially harmful chemicals, and while I don&#x27;t know how Alterna products rate in that regard, I know that Alba products are free from many, if not all, toxins common to beauty products --</li>
            <li>Can get a little greasy near your roots so may want to make sure you focus the product on the ends.</li>
            <li>Unless you have fine hair that gets weighed down by product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and somewhat shiny too.  </li>
            <li>Apparently some people are really intolerant to that chemical.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair shiny and frizz free and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>The first day, my left eye socket and eye started to hurt, and the entire left side of my head and face hurt tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy on my fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Found this at Whole Foods years ago and it works so well yet staying natural looking that I&#x27;ve never looked back and never tried anything else again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t crunchy, no heavy smell, and held throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This doesnt make hair crunchy, but it&#x27;s soft and silky with my frizzy curls.</li>
            <li>The hold is soft and natural; lasts for days even through humid weather.  </li>
            <li>and when I let my hair air dry, it looks like I have a too much hair gel helmet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this three ways: letting my hair air dry; using a dryer with a diffuser; and drying my hair reasonably straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve banished my older and more expensive products including AIG, Aveda Curl products and Texturizing Cream, etc.  </li>
            <li>Then I follow it with Alba&#x27;s soft hold style cream (I wrote a similar review for Alba&#x27;s leave in</li>
            <li>I reduced the amount to just a bare half-drop, and it still was  heavier than I like.</li>
            <li>I never expected this to work so well.  </li>
            <li>But it really doesn&#x27;t do anything in terms of holding a style, especially when i use it for blow dry.</li>
            <li>Can get a little waxy if you use too much, but I see that as a positive because the product will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I just put a little in my palm and wet my hands and work it through continuing to wet my hands more as needed.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair, and sometimes products can weigh my hair down a bit too much, but this one does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do find that the scent quickly dissipates though, &amp; I can use less than with other creams.</li>

            <li> I do find that the scent quickly dissipates though, &amp; I can use less than with other creams.</li>
            <li> On dry hair, I put a tiny bit on my fingers, add some water to thin it out, and then coat my frizz with it to try to manage the frizz and calm it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far too heavy</li>
            <li> I have long curly, frizz-prone hair.</li>
            <li> It also works well on 2nd day hair, with mixed with a little water.</li>
            <li> Or, I can put it on, dry my hair</li>
            <li> I sometimes blow-dry or air dry while twisting my hair</li>
            <li> Makes my curly hair soft and tames the frizz without that crispy gel feeling or sticky hairspray feeling you usually get from products.</li>
            <li> I used the pineapple method over night and woke up with tons of volume and barely any frizz just needed to define a few sections</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product works great!!!!!  I was having some problems with my scalp being red and flakey.This product didn&#x27;t irrate the scalp.  I was still able to style my hair.</li>
            <li> This style cream is amazing. I have tried all kinds of hair style hold products to keep my permed curls intact and prevent frizz and my perm straightening out. I&#x27;ve tried a number of over the counter hair products. Some are ok, some don&#x27;t work. I pretty much gave up on ever finding a good product until a friend suggested I try Alba, so I purchased one on Amazon and the first time I used it, it held my curls for the entire day and my hair didn&#x27;t frizz! It was amazing, it really made a difference on how my hair looked. It kept my perm without making it look oily or stiff, and there was no fragrance as other hair creams tend to have. I tried looking for this product in stores but it was only found on amazon, so I bought several more tubes to stock up! Great item!</li>
            <li> Found this at Whole Foods years ago and it works so well yet staying natural looking that I&#x27;ve never looked back and never tried anything else again.  A little bit goes a long way and it lacks any scents or smells too.</li>
            <li> Works great for my curly hair, even though it&#x27;s not advertised for curly hair specifically.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a shot.  I&#x27;ve banished my older and more expensive products including AIG, Aveda Curl products and Texturizing Cream, etc.  So happy to have found something that&#x27;s a better fit!</li>
            <li> Works really really well and i love the smell!</li>
            <li> Excellent for soft, defined and bouncy curls. Works as well or better than Aveda Be Curly line, but without the obnoxious scent.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love the soft hold on this product. I actually use it for my son&#x27;s hair and it is perfect for creating a nice part or smoothing fly-aways without giving a crispy gelled down look.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on safari as it is unscented, I liked it enough to purchase it again. It does leave the hair wiry feeling, but all &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; products do.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Alba Botanica products I&#x27;ve tried, and I decided to give this one a shot since several gals over at the Naturally Curly hair forums really liked it as a curl cream.  Although it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Soft Hold,&amp;#34; if you use a bit more, it creates a nice, long-lasting hold.  I have wavy hair, and sometimes products can weigh my hair down a bit too much, but this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates or silicones, so it&#x27;s Curly Girl-friendly if you&#x27;re following the CG model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on both wet and dry hair.  On wet hair, I apply it in the shower to soaking wet hair, and then scrunch some  [[ASIN:B001ET7ACW Alba Botanica Strong Hold Style Gel, 7-Ounce Tube(Pack of 2)]] in on top of it.  On dry hair, I put a tiny bit on my fingers, add some water to thin it out, and then coat my frizz with it to try to manage the frizz and calm it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also fragrance-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product if you have curls or waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 4-9-15:  I&#x27;ve been using this product now for almost three years, and have to say that it&#x27;s one of my Holy Grail products.  It never lets me down, and always gives me great hair.  I tend to stray from it because I&#x27;m a product junkie, but always come back to this.  It&#x27;s cheap, eco-friendly, and works much better than some more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.  I also love that I can get it on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> Works very well...another 5-star Alba Botanical product!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free. theres also a great smell. But it really doesn&#x27;t do anything in terms of holding a style, especially when i use it for blow dry.</li>
            <li> The only product I will use when air drying my curly hair. It leaves your hair shiny and frizz free and does not weigh it down. I have been using this for 4 years. Also great for when you blow dry your hair as it leaves it shiny. Use a very little amount (pea sized) on wet hair for best results.</li>
            <li> I had heard of this product on some curly hair forums and decided to give it a go.  It absolutely rocked and you don&#x27;t even need to use that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t crunchy, no heavy smell, and held throughout the day.  Putting on damp hair seemed to work the best.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It&#x27;s perfect for fine or thin hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down whatsoever. I would highly recommend using this instead of a mousse. :)</li>
            <li> Makes my curly hair soft and tames the frizz without that crispy gel feeling or sticky hairspray feeling you usually get from products. It conditions and has no fragrance which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that frizzes easily. I have been using this product for the past three years. It helps my hair not to frizz. I can put it on wet, leave it and it works great. Or, I can put it on, dry my hair and it works great too.  I won&#x27;t use any other style cream, gel,... This is it for me. As well, my hair is longer, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of the cream to work. A squirt about the size of a dime is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> Nice texture. Not too heavy on my fine wavy hair. Can get a little greasy near your roots so may want to make sure you focus the product on the ends.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this is the first Alba Botanica product that I wasn&#x27;t pleased with. I have short but very thick hair so typically, I like products that are on the heavier side. This is not one of them. It&#x27;s far too heavy and when I let my hair air dry, it looks like I have a too much hair gel helmet. Maybe when summer is over and it&#x27;s cool enough to heat style my hair again, I&#x27;ll try it and see if air drying is the issue.</li>
            <li> Love it. Can get a little waxy if you use too much, but I see that as a positive because the product will last a long time. I mix a pea size amount with a bit of alba leave in conditioner. I like that it is unscented.</li>
            <li> his is a fantastic product at a great price. My favorite hair company is Devacurl and I feel this compares to their B&#x27;leave In gel. I give Devacurl a 5 and this is probably a 4.5 at less than half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you need to use just a tiny, tiny dab of this. I have curly hair. After I&#x27;ve rinsed or washed my hair, I use a small dab of Alba&#x27;s leave-in conditioner. Then I follow it with Alba&#x27;s soft hold style cream (I wrote a similar review for Alba&#x27;s leave in conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase. I think I paid a little less at Vitacost because I had a coupon.</li>
            <li> This product was both the best and worst hair cream I ever used.  I have fine hair that is naturally wavy/curly/frizzy and this product was amazing at taming my hair, making it soft and more manageable, more so than any other product.  BUT, there is something in this product that gave me the worst headache/migraine of my life.  I am sensitive to all fragrance and am switching all of my hair products to more natural versions of themselves.  I chose this product because it appeared to be more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; than any other product like it and it is fragrance free.  I used this product for two days.  The first day, my left eye socket and eye started to hurt, and the entire left side of my head and face hurt tremendously.  I didn&#x27;t think it was this cream, because I am prone to headaches, I thought I was just having a bad episode and because I usually react to fragrance, and this had none.  However, the next morning the pain was gone when I woke up... and then it came back almost immediately after I applied the cream... but still, I thought I was just having one of my headaches.  Then in the afternoon I realized that it must be the hair cream.  I washed it out of my hair and within 30 minutes the pain was gone (the headache &amp;#34;hangover&amp;#34; stayed around for a few hours) and the pain has been gone since.  I am not positive, but I think that it must be the PHENOXYETHANOL that is in it.  Apparently some people are really intolerant to that chemical. I must be one of them.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;soft hold&amp;#34; was a little heavy for me. I reduced the amount to just a bare half-drop, and it still was  heavier than I like. Rinsing my hands off took extra effort. Aside from that, it held nicely.</li>
            <li> 99% of the hair products out there make me sneeze. This one doesn&#x27;t. This is a great fragrance free hair cream! My only complaint is that the hold is a little too firm for my taste. Other than that I hope they keep making it.</li>
            <li> Super- pro of this style cream is that it is unscented. Love that.  It leaves my hair very soft and somewhat shiny too.  My hair does get fly-aways, etc. later in the day. This product really is a \\&quot;soft hold\\&quot; so you may need to add more when the frizz happens. Unless you have fine hair that gets weighed down by product. Where the product loses a star is that for me it&#x27;s best not to put this directly on my scalp. I found it left a funky residue when I comb or put it on that close.</li>
            <li> I have long curly, frizz-prone hair. Since I live in a very humid climate, I use both cream &amp; a gel for more curl definition. This definitely gives that: larger, rounder curls, as opposed to stringy, thin ringlets. It also works well on 2nd day hair, with mixed with a little water. The only reasons it&#x27;s not a 5* product: it&#x27;s in fragranced, but actually smells like glue; and, the tube is relatively small. I do find that the scent quickly dissipates though, &amp; I can use less than with other creams.</li>
            <li> I got this curl cream because I&#x27;ve been trying to replace my chemical laden products with more natural products.  This hair cream has a very low toxicity rating on the EWG website.  It also works pretty well.  I have long, fine, curly/wavy hair.  It gives the curls a lite hold without being sticky, gunky, or heavy.  I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for the 30%-40% of my hair that is gray/graying -- somewhat coarse, and more frizzy than curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it worked reasonably well on the under-layers of my hair, which is fine in texture, with loose, soft curls. (If you look at the curl-typing chart I&#x27;ve linked to, my under-layers are most like 3A, the two images to the right.) If my hair were still predominantly 3A, I would probably give this 4 stars, maybe even 4.5 (if Amazon allowed half-stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this three ways: letting my hair air dry; using a dryer with a diffuser; and drying my hair reasonably straight. My results were always the same (it did nothing for the coarse hair on the top of my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, the best product for my hair type was Alterna Hemp Texturizing Glaze; it has been discontinued, but if you&#x27;re interested, the company could recommend a newer product that is comparable. However, I&#x27;m no longer using products that have potentially harmful chemicals, and while I don&#x27;t know how Alterna products rate in that regard, I know that Alba products are free from many, if not all, toxins common to beauty products -- that was the big selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.naturallycurly.com/pages/hairtypes/type3#type-3a</li>
            <li> Holds as well as stylist quality styling cream without all of the unnecessary chemicals. No flakes left in the hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It works great as a styling cream and to refresh my hair when it becomes wind blown or frizzy. I just put a little in my palm and wet my hands and work it through continuing to wet my hands more as needed. It does not weigh down my curls or make my hair look oily like other products. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This doesnt make hair crunchy, but it&#x27;s soft and silky with my frizzy curls. The only downside is that I dont think you can refresh it by spritzing water and scrunching. But its great if you wash your hair once in 2 days or sooner!</li>
            <li> I use this as a styling cream before putting the hot curling iron to it.  Works great for that.  The hold is soft and natural; lasts for days even through humid weather.  if I want a stronger hold, I can just use more cream.  Biggest, best features: it really is fragrance-free, and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> Great product for natural cury hair. Used after a co wash and with Shea moistures coconut and hibiscus curl and style milk and moisture spray.  Looked great and even better the second day. Didn&#x27;t weigh down my fine curly hair and kept frizz away very well. I used the pineapple method over night and woke up with tons of volume and barely any frizz just needed to define a few sections and then I was done. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I never expected this to work so well.  I gave up silicones and sulfates, thank goodness, and looked into organic products. I figured if it&#x27;s good for my hair, it&#x27;s not really going to have holding power, and that&#x27;s okay.  But it does have holding power.  I use the Alba leave-in conditioner and then this and it&#x27;s been great.  I sometimes blow-dry or air dry while twisting my hair and I get great curls.  I skipped using this one morning as an experiment and there was a big difference, my hair was flyaway.  With this, if my hair starts to frizz or poof, I can use my hand to smoosh or twist those sections and my hair actually takes the direction.  Avocado butter is helping as a product, too.  It&#x27;s like my hairs are able to connect and bond with each other.  Silicone products had the opposite effect for me. Anyway, so glad I found this, very happy. No scent.</li>
