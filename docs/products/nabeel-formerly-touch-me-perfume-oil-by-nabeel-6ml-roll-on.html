            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I put this on and after 30 minutes gave up and gave it to my grandmother.</li>
            <li>and it was so nice.</li>
            <li>this is a nice inexpensive addition.</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>More like a powdery, clean, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>but what it smells like on you most of the day may be somewhat of an acquired taste.</li>
            <li>Thank you, a satisfied customer, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li>I am so Pleased with this Company I am going to buy more from them.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>and I can smell them, which I love.</li>
            <li>It was ok...</li>
            <li>there incense are better</li>
            <li>I can take it with me every day and just take the top off and inhale.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>However, I thought this one was more unisex</li>
            <li>love the bukhoor and had to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I had heard about this and thought it was all hype, then I smelled it in my home and had to have more</li>
            <li>All these oils are nice, clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>The most beautiful Exotic Weird ( in the best way ) oil Ever.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It starts off smelling like nail polish, cough syrup, and cheap incense.</li>
            <li>I like how there is a detailed description of the ingredients</li>
            <li>It smells great and last for a while without having to reapply every hour!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to bathe and then put some on my wrists and smooth that over the warmer parts of my body.</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with bak&#x27;hor</li>
            <li>I suggest putting this on 2 hours before leaving the house because your coworkers and significant other will probably not be happy with you before it</li>
            <li>you want something very different and surprising, this is your perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly as I hoped!</li>
            <li>This is a different scent - kind of spicy over floral, but I did get a compliment the 1st day I wore it.</li>
            <li>( soft and lovely )</li>
            <li>give it a moment to set in, it may be all worth it.</li>
            <li>and I find if I put it on right after I get out the shower</li>
            <li>It took about an hour and a half for this stuff to smell good on me.</li>
            <li>like what does it smell like now.&lt;br /&gt;After a few hours the scent has faded drastically and smells nothing like it did upon first application...which is a GOOD thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I smell and feel like an extremely wealthy Saudi or Fulani African Princess.</li>
            <li>I love the oils, they stay on longer that regular perfumes</li>
            <li>Smooth and sweet at the same time.</li>
            <li>People will walk by you several times, to enjoy the way you smell!</li>
            <li>a soft mature caramel vanilla, not too sweet and doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.</li>
            <li>If you want something exotic but not overly strange and still girly enough Nasaem may be a better choice.</li>
            <li>I own 2 other oils that I&#x27;ll try out.</li>
            <li>You you just want something that smells pretty and nice and has the same smell from the time you put it on til your next shower, I suggest Empress or Thrill by Nabeel.</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments and my family now wants me to order them some also.</li>
            <li>Very aromatic out of the box, on the skin otherworldly and very sultry.</li>
            <li>Soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>It smelled stinky like old roses for about 5 minutes then began changing into a pretty, soft mature perfume.</li>
            <li>Depending on the body chemistry and how long you wear it it can smell like pretty much anything.  </li>
            <li>When it fades it turns into a clean lemony smell with slight spice, then it ends up ultimately smelling like a sweet and floral girly smell until the next time I take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these perfume oils by Nabeel and this is my third bottle.</li>
            <li>Smells like an 85 yr old woman.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something more definitely feminine, even though I usually choose slightly masculine fragrances.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a complicated perfume and kind of a wild card.</li>
            <li>The scent is  strong so only requires a small amount and last all day!  </li>

            <li> They claim to not have alcohol in the product, but it smells like rank alcohol!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great when you put it on but it does not last.</li>
            <li> They claim to not have alcohol in the product, but it smells like rank alcohol! I would never order this again!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I put this on and after 30 minutes gave up and gave it to my grandmother. It took about an hour and a half for this stuff to smell good on me. It starts off smelling like nail polish, cough syrup, and cheap incense.

            <li> not what i tought it would be</li>
            <li> I guess I kinda understand what people are saying That it takes a little bit to settle. But for me not much really and I find if I put it on right after I get out the shower it is there no waiting period. It smells so good and smells just like the insence. I love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really like these perfume oils by Nabeel and this is my third bottle. I get lots of compliments and my family now wants me to order them some also. I like how there is a detailed description of the ingredients so I can not buy one that is too simular to another! That is why I will be ordering lots more! Thank you, a satisfied customer, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  It smells great and last for a while without having to reapply every hour! Awesome buy!!!!</li>
            <li> The sent is glorious I think! Soft and gentle. I had it on this afternoon and it was so nice. The way it was sent was in a nice box and another beautiful like box just like the picture. I am so Pleased with this Company I am going to buy more from them. So I advise others to buy these perfumes oils. I love them.</li>
            <li> This is a different scent - kind of spicy over floral, but I did get a compliment the 1st day I wore it. I still have a scent @ the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle it smelled horrible...however I followed the advice of previous purchasers and put a dab on my skin. It smelled stinky like old roses for about 5 minutes then began changing into a pretty, soft mature perfume. It smells soft and expensive but not old ladyish. More like a powdery, clean, pleasant scent. I can&#x27;t explain it but it keeps unfolding into different layers as the day goes on. I can&#x27;t help but to sniff my arm...like what does it smell like now.&lt;br /&gt;After a few hours the scent has faded drastically and smells nothing like it did upon first application...which is a GOOD thing.&lt;br /&gt;I compare this scent to Vera Wang princess...a soft mature caramel vanilla, not too sweet and doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. I&#x27;d suggest this for women, day or night and all seasons. I&#x27;m a perfume collector...this is a nice inexpensive addition. I own 2 other oils that I&#x27;ll try out. ( soft and lovely )</li>
            <li> I will carry this in my purses and use it 2x a day.  It smells just like the incense which is what I used for 1 year and that&#x27;s what I was looking forward to.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic out of the box, on the skin otherworldly and very sultry. I smell and feel like an extremely wealthy Saudi or Fulani African Princess. I can&#x27;t wait to bathe and then put some on my wrists and smooth that over the warmer parts of my body.</li>
            <li> The most beautiful Exotic Weird ( in the best way ) oil Ever. I&#x27;m hooked! I can&#x27;t explain the notes but to me it smells Like Arabian Nights. Sexy! Plus this came in like three four days. I&#x27;ve just got to try all the oils now</li>
            <li> smells just like the oudh scented chips!!!! GOOD STUFF!!!!</li>
            <li> possibly the worst smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my entire life. it smelled like bug repellent an old lady.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but, still very nice.  I love the oils, they stay on longer that regular perfumes and I can smell them, which I love.</li>
            <li> It was ok...there incense are better</li>
            <li> This is the BEST scent I own! I can&#x27;t get enough of it. I can take it with me every day and just take the top off and inhale. I also have the insense that I can burn on charcoal all over my house, whenever...</li>
            <li> Smells exactly as I hoped! I love it. The scent is  strong so only requires a small amount and last all day!  If you are familiar with bak&#x27;hor it smells just like it!</li>
            <li> I have all the products of nabeel&#x27;s touch me</li>
            <li> The oil is good - very potent. Arrived fast and in good condition. However the scent is awful! Smells like an 85 yr old woman. Also, I contacted  seller about my distaste for this smell and have gotten NO RESPONSE after several days (about a week).</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Its the only perfume I wear.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I was a bit disappointed when I smelled it in the bottle, but from experience, I knew to test it in me before I make any conclusions. And OMG!!! Was I in for a surprise! It smells AWESOME!!! give it a moment to set in, it may be all worth it. If  you like musky woodsy scents then this would go well with your body chemistry. It may smell More floral on others.it&#x27;s a perfume that smells expressive! I am definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> All these oils are nice, clean smelling.  However, I thought this one was more unisex and I wanted something more definitely feminine, even though I usually choose slightly masculine fragrances.  These oils bloom on the skin over an extended period so you must wait some time to decide whether you like it.</li>
            <li> Smooth and sweet at the same time. People will walk by you several times, to enjoy the way you smell!</li>
            <li> love the bukhoor and had to give this a try.  addictive scent that I adore. I had heard about this and thought it was all hype, then I smelled it in my home and had to have more...awesome!</li>
