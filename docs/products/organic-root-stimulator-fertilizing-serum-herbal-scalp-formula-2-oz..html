            <li> It really really grew my hair back.</li>
            <li> Such as high protein foods.</li>
            <li> After the second month hair I had not seen since i was a young adult started growing...</li>
            <li> The other times (because I clean my scalp once a week), I will use ORS dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used the Hair Serum frequently as directed on my edges because I wanted to grow them back.</li>
            <li> So after going natural for the past couple of months I looked for Organic Root Stimulator&#x27;s products that specializes in natural African American hair care.</li>
            <li> I also told the store owner in Dallas were I purchased it to share it with black females that come in as the population is mostly African American customers and we have damaged our hair with wigs, and glue not being removed properly.</li>
            <li> If the stuff does not make a difference, I may still use anyway because I wear crochet braids that are not tight and will at least continue to use the scalp scrub 1x to 2x&#x27;s a month for a deep cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Its grown down on my back</li>
            <li> I am using the entire line due to thinning in the crown area that I want to wake up!  </li>
            <li> Now My edges are growing back, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this product By itself or the combination of products Because i brought and started using them at the same time.</li>
            <li> Each time I used this product and my hair started visibly growing back in less than 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> it is not worth the scalp hurt it gave me.</li>
            <li> At first I was sceptic but after my hair starting growing i was shocked</li>
            <li> After applying on my edges, it tends to drip down my face causing my pores to clog.    </li>
            <li> The regrowth has been a little bit slower than I hoped</li>
            <li> I brought the temple-balm AND serum and it turned out to be a waste of money....</li>
            <li> what a waste...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and I felt that I&#x27;ve wasted my money and my time.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that the hair in my thin spot is growing back thicker and stronger.  </li>
            <li> Using for a few weeks (10) now but no drastic change.</li>
            <li> As an avid fan of Organic Root Stimulator&#x27;s products, I&#x27;m highly disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> The natural color I put in my hair grew out like crazy, but for some reason this stuff made my head hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is because it is for thinning hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this product is diluted with water or what,</li>
            <li> The brand I usually purchase from SALLY&#x27;S BEAUTY SUPPLY.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will help, but I do not want to try Rogaine because once I use that, I have to continue using it forever (from what I read anyway).    </li>
            <li> this day I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding why this product didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> B complex</li>
            <li> Been using for about 2 months on my edges and they were veryyyyy thin and broken off due to the olive oil edge ccontrol</li>
            <li> My hair was short, edges damaged badly.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product, It does not work at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick in spots that were weak.</li>
            <li> This product and its moisturing fertilizing cream is worse $15 an $8 that I pay for these products.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
            <li> The directions on the bottle were vague.</li>
            <li> save your money!!:-[</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It really works good, love it.</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised. Instead of making my fine hair on edges grow, it caused irritation and my hair fell out. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair has fallen out around the edges after childbirth 3 times!  Each time I used this product and my hair started visibly growing back in less than 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it as directed.  I brought the temple-balm AND serum and it turned out to be a waste of money....my hair NEVER grew...what a waste...I gave it one star because I use organic root stimulator products, and I thought this would work also....save your money!!:-[</li>
            <li> I used two bottles of this stuff and it didn&#x27;t do a thing.  I also used a jar of the temple balm (which is supposed to do the same thing) and that didn&#x27;t work either.    This stuff is snake oil.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  If you want to regrow your hair, you better get some Rogaine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate this product. I have only been using it since June 21st. I honestly don&#x27;t think enough time has gone by to really rate it. I have seen a little growth but need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Organic Root Stimulator&#x27;s products for years now. I live by their Creamy Olive Oil Shampoo, Olive Oil Replenishing Conditioner, and Hair Mayonnaise.     So after going natural for the past couple of months I looked for Organic Root Stimulator&#x27;s products that specializes in natural African American hair care. When I discovered their line, I purchased the Scalp Scrub, Hair Serum, Uplifting Shampoo, Hair Mayonnaise, Shea Butter Softener, and Hair Fertilizer. Combined the products were more than $50.    I used the Hair Serum frequently as directed on my edges because I wanted to grow them back. After about a month, I noticed no change in my edge growth. For $13 I would like to think that this product would work, but I feel ripped off!    Another thing I&#x27;m not fond of is the liquid-y substance. After applying on my edges, it tends to drip down my face causing my pores to clog.    As an avid fan of Organic Root Stimulator&#x27;s products, I&#x27;m highly disappointed in this one. It doesn&#x27;t work and I felt that I&#x27;ve wasted my money and my time.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the front part of my head because my hair was thinning.  My daughter turned me on to this product.  She is a hairdresser and she recommended this to one of her customers and the results were amazing. Hair began to grow within two weeks.  I use it because it works.  I just reordered.  One tip to remember is that you have to keep using it, but the hair grows out quicker and you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money.  The price Amazon.com has was cheaper than at the beauty supply.  I will be reordering each time I need to.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this stuff for me since it is for natural hair. I don&#x27;t have any thinning hair but I thought this stuff may help with the overall health of my scalp and increase hair growth, so I tried it out. I used for about a week and it felt like my scalp was on steroids. The natural color I put in my hair grew out like crazy, but for some reason this stuff made my head hurt. I&#x27;m not sure if it is because it is for thinning hair and I used it anyway or if my scalp is just sensitive (maybe I am allergic to something in it). So, yes, it did work buuut it is not worth the scalp hurt it gave me.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing don&#x27;t know about the growth yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells wonderful, and works wonderfully. I can feel it opening up my hair follicles. I thank God and you all for this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I can tell it&#x27;s penetrating my scalp good. I love it. It&#x27;s really tingly and you can feel it working. After 30 days; I&#x27;ll do another review. I&#x27;m thinking its gonna be good because I can feel the difference in my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now. My daughter had a bald spot that wouldn&#x27;t grow in for almost 2 years. I tried everything,  until my stylist told me to try organic stimulants and it grew right in in no time</li>
            <li> The product is very good.I recommend it to my friends.No complaints at all</li>
            <li> this product is for women who had a weave and the glue took out their hair,it smell great and your hair will grow back using this product.</li>
            <li> The regrowth has been a little bit slower than I hoped but I have noticed that the hair in my thin spot is growing back thicker and stronger.  I&#x27;m going to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> In theory this product should work, in practice: it&#x27;s absolute crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this day I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding why this product didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a fan of organic products, I&#x27;m utterly amazed that a product that contains 12 herbal extracts and vitamins not only 1) made no difference on my hair growth but 2) didn&#x27;t improve the quality of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this product is diluted with water or what, but it&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working..my hair has stopped shedding..we&#x27;ll see in a couple more weeks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.</li>
            <li> I wanted *ORGANIC&#x27;S* ROOT STIMULATOR...The kind they DEPICT IN THE ADVERTISEMENT! The brand I usually purchase from SALLY&#x27;S BEAUTY SUPPLY. These people sent me some off brand..ORC I have NO IDEA of who ORC is, NEVER HEARD OF THEM, and I be double d*mned if I put this in my hair. Its grown down on my back I&#x27;m all natural and I&#x27;m not risking it falling out because of some company that haven&#x27;t proven themselves...JUST GO TO SALLY&#x27;S! ALL THE WAY DISSAPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I think this product is excellent. I used it along with rosemary oil, peppermint oil, and lavender oil. I was totally Balding on my edges. Now My edges are growing back, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this product By itself or the combination of products Because i brought and started using them at the same time.</li>
            <li> Its just herbs mixed with a solution.  Its what you put in your body that makes the hair grow.  Such as high protein foods.</li>
            <li> I used and entire bottle....within 1 month....I ran out of the supply in the second month....bought more during the third month with the moisturizer..... After the second month hair I had not seen since i was a young adult started growing...it was gray but it was hair......I was completely bald on the sides and top of my head.... not any more.....I am in my 4 month and my daughter and granddaughter are surprised at the new hair I am growing.....I don&#x27;t have to use as much any more.....but I do because I love the products...I considered Bosley in the pass but I don&#x27;t need them now and I am saving so much money by not going to them. This product and its moisturing fertilizing cream is worse $15 an $8 that I pay for these products. I am so glad that I heard a friend talking about it. At first I was sceptic but after my hair starting growing i was shocked and I rub my head every morning before getting out of bed because I am so amazed at the affect of these products on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have used the entire regimen, ie, scalp scrub, the shampoo, hair mayo, and this.  I am using the entire line due to thinning in the crown area that I want to wake up!  I am 43, that age when hair thinning can occur.  Not sure if it will help, but I do not want to try Rogaine because once I use that, I have to continue using it forever (from what I read anyway).    I love this product.  I have used the entire regimen yesterday, the serum once yesterday, and twice today.  I felt it working, but cannot give a thorough review just yet.  If I can remember, I will post results by the end of March 2015 when I do my length check.  I am also exercising, drinking lots of water, taking vitamins (MSM, zinc, B complex, saw palmetto etc), and I am protective styling, so it may be a combination of things that contribute to hair growth, but we shall see.  If the stuff does not make a difference, I may still use anyway because I wear crochet braids that are not tight and will at least continue to use the scalp scrub 1x to 2x&#x27;s a month for a deep cleansing.  The other times (because I clean my scalp once a week), I will use ORS dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product, It does not work at all I&#x27;ve been using it since I got it about three weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement</li>
            <li> It works good THANK-YOU!</li>
            <li> Using for a few weeks (10) now but no drastic change. Will continue to work with it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality item that does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 2 months on my edges and they were veryyyyy thin and broken off due to the olive oil edge ccontrol and this grew all my hair back in . Great stuff and great smell!</li>
            <li> Did not work for alapecia.</li>
            <li> Good product, it help hair growth and stop excessive loss of hair. I love it</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement and will continue to monitor the problem area.  The directions on the bottle were vague.</li>
            <li> I had hair  thinning above the temples and I can see the new growth already after using this product. I recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> Great product so far , arrived on time</li>
            <li> I have used product for 30 days, I highly recommend it. My hair was short, edges damaged badly. It really really grew my hair back. It&#x27;s very thick in spots that were weak. I continue to use it now, and bought a bottle for my daughters, grand daughters. I also told the store owner in Dallas were I purchased it to share it with black females that come in as the population is mostly African American customers and we have damaged our hair with wigs, and glue not being removed properly. Thanks so much!</li>
