            <li> Package arrived in perfect condition, timely manner, and exactly the product I was looking for...Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping, great scent!  Thanks!  I will purchase again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Perfume was not in its original box when I received it. I was giving it as a gift and felt as if I was giving a used or returned item.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. I get compliments on it all the time. It&#x27;s probably supposed to be a summer scent, but I wear it all year.</li>
            <li> The Tommy Bahama for women is a super product, super price, and I received it in just a short time.  I got this for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Last year I bought Tommy Bahama for my grandson and he was very pleased too.</li>
            <li> wife&#x27;s favorite, not overpowering,</li>
            <li> Its okay, but I have to be in the mood to wear something sweet, which is hardly ever. I would not buy again. It takes up space in the cabinet...</li>
            <li> I always get so many compliments on this perfume and this is the lowest price ever it is a great bargain</li>
            <li> I have been using this spray since it came out. I love it because of its a nice fresh smell. It doesn&#x27;t shout out at you but just has a nice lingering smell. Tommy Bahama has discontinue this and replace it with a new and much strong smell. I was told I could go on Amazon and find the remaining bottles for sale. So happy to have found it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Jill</li>
            <li> Bought as gift. Was greatly appreciated</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Even my teen lives it and we have very different tastes in cologne</li>
            <li> Tommy Bahama is a great scent. The bottle that I received was a \\&quot;tester\\&quot;. It did not have the cap and had a sticker on the back stating \\&quot;tester\\&quot;. It was not mentioned in the product description that it is a tester. It seems to be a good price even for a tester. I don&#x27;t think it is strong enough to be \\&quot;eau du PARFUME\\&quot; as advertised, but I think it will do. Shipping was a little slower than my normal orders from Amazon, but shipping was free, so I should not complain about that.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Satisfied .  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nice product and fast delivery.  A+</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance!</li>
            <li> I like this spray. It smells refreshing and light.  Stays all day without having to keep reapplying. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was so sad the day they discontinued this scent from store.  Love the light floral scent, feminine but not too girly.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance that lasts.  Does not resemble New West, as I had hoped.</li>
