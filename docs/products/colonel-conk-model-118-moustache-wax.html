    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Smells wonderful though, a spicy cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li>Excellent wax for taming and controlling your mustache and or beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The honey scent is excellent, and the product amount is generous.</li>
            <li>When you commit to styling your moustache, it takes a while to discover the best products.  </li>
            <li>but it smells incredible.</li>
            <li>And it works great for shine.</li>
            <li>He just buys Clubman Pinaud and it works great.</li>
            <li>It works great for that</li>
            <li>In that context, Conks fits very nicely into my grooming arsenal.</li>
            <li>stuff is essentially pleasant smelling petroleum jelly that allows you to twist your whiskers up into points that immediately come apart, looking greasy and unseemly.  </li>
            <li>I am still looking for a good moustache wax.</li>
            <li>This product is not as good as Mountaineer Brand Wax, but usable.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows of a good product recommendation I am looking for a quality wax, but not this one...</li>
            <li>Good for maintaining though a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>Good for grooming and softening mustache.  </li>
            <li>IT really is good stuff.</li>
            <li>The price point is good too.</li>
            <li>I am growing a handlebar and needed a good wax for it.  </li>
            <li>It did smell good though.</li>
            <li>Well, first off, it smells great, very pleasant aroma to adorn your &#x27;stache, however, it is more of a moustache oil than it is a wax.</li>
            <li>If you just want an oily and shiny mustache that smells nice</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have this information before wasting my money on this purchase.</li>
            <li>- Smells nice, cinnamon or ginger    </li>
            <li>Colonel Conk will leave you with a nice shiny well-scented moustache, but it&#x27;s not going to help if you need it to hold your stache together.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice smelling vaseline.</li>
            <li>Well packaged, excellent consistency are attributes that make this product superior to other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>Sure it smells good, but it leaves you super greasy and shiny, and your fingers/hands covered in the slime.</li>
            <li>Conk&#x27;s is more like a pomade than a wax and it will stay somewhat moist throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>If you want more hold</li>
            <li>When he does and uses this product I must say that it looks much better and is softer than without.</li>
            <li>While the scent is nice, a light cinnamon and vanilla</li>
            <li>This wax is more like vaseline.</li>
            <li>so he could shape it a bit better.</li>
            <li>Fuller mustaches require something with better hold.</li>
            <li>Lasts most of the day, and can be re-wetted to reshape mustache.</li>
            <li>I have used Colonel Conk for years but had a problem finding it locally, most times if I found it here</li>
            <li>and I figured anything had to be better than Clubman&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have had a large moustache for more than 30 years and Colonel Conk&#x27;s Moustache Wax is consistently the best product I have found.</li>
            <li>It was the best priced wax I could find on Amazon, but it is not really a wax at all, but more like an oily/greasy texture.</li>
            <li>Colonel Conk did not do a good job with the styling of the handle bar, but it does do a good job of keeping my facial hair in order.</li>
            <li>A good product if you don&#x27;t need much holding power from your mustache wax.</li>
            <li>I am lucky, I think my guy is good looking whether clean shaven, mustached, or with a full beard.</li>
            <li>Item was as described, transaction was easy &amp; shipping was prompt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wax works easily and my stache responds well with it.</li>
            <li>Again, good for light hair or hair that doesn&#x27;t need much sculpting.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, but doesn&#x27;t offer very much hold.</li>
            <li>more a conditioner than a true wax</li>
            <li>I wanted a wax for my eyebrows after i shaped and filled them in.</li>
            <li>This stuff however not only works GREAT</li>
            <li>It works well and smells great, keeps my moustache shaped the way I like it and last all day no matter what I am doing.</li>
            <li>enough  - Has kind of a greasy feel, kind of like vaseline.    </li>
            <li>it works the best for me, and it&#x27;s handy enough to carry in a back pocket for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li>I think the scent is a light cinammon; it&#x27;s pleasant enough, but remember that it will be under your nose all day.</li>
            <li>I have a rather unique &amp;#34;stash&amp;#34</li>
            <li>So just know its great as long as you dont want to twist it up!</li>
            <li>good stuff, not to stiff and a nice smell.</li>
            <li>nothing special here.  </li>
            <li>His use of products keeps whatever facial hair mood he is in looking good.</li>
            <li>to work with and as a fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li>This wax goes on pretty smoothly-</li>
            <li>This wax was too greasy and not as effective as most other waxes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>She liked the smell of it better than the other wax I&#x27;ve used, so I figured for $6 I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li>It smells nice enough but it is not wax!  </li>
            <li>It reads right on the container \\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Fine if you just need to smooth out some wild hairs but doesn&#x27;t work very well on my kinky mustache.</li>
            <li>He had tried many different products which were too greasy,dried out too quickly or flakey.  </li>
            <li>Works great and this is my second order and will not be my last.</li>
            <li>it is super greasy and doesn&#x27;t hold very well at all; as my title says, it&#x27;s vaseline with a cinnamon/christmas-y scent.</li>
            <li>After using that for many months with varied success, I ran out of Clubman&#x27;s and tried to find a substitute locally, rather than continue to purchase Clubman&#x27;s online.  </li>
            <li>If you need to shape your mustache at all, you need something else first.</li>
            <li>Because if you even posses the requisite testosterone to extrude facial follicles, you&#x27;ve already exceeded the manliness tolerances that this product is able to handle.</li>
            <li>Bought this as my first wax to groom my mustache.</li>
            <li>A nice aroma but not really a wax.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is the first wax I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This is the first moustache wax I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>Pros: Smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I ordered Colonel Conk after seeing it at Mast General Store in Boone,NC alongside some other great looking shaving kits &amp; hair tonics.</li>
            <li>Works best if you start with wet hair and work it in a little at a time.</li>
            <li>But other then that it&#x27;s as good as any of the soft high dollar sallon waxes.</li>
            <li>It doesnt give you much control</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been much happier with Clubman&#x27;s wax, though I am still searching for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; wax.</li>
            <li>Its very greasey and does not stiffen as you would expect a wax to do.</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of waxes; this one gets used but not as much as the others.    </li>
            <li>If my mustache is really unruly after a night&#x27;s sleep, CC just doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li>You can get far better waxes for the same price.</li>
            <li>Of course, the two big downsides to this are that my moustache can more easily lose form and it feels slightly greasy to the touch.    </li>
            <li>Wax is specially formulated to be the final touch</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;ll probably hold your whiskers in place if they&#x27;re  made of wispy baby hair, but if you happen to be a man (which, with a few notable exceptions are typically the only people who grow mustaches), your whiskers will be too strong to be held by this perfumed petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>i love most of col conks products, but this one is an all time fail.</li>
            <li>If you are cultivating a decent mustache, shun this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product works well for a beard gloss but does not provide much hold for wild hairs!</li>
            <li>Stick with something that has a high beeswax concentration if you want any shape to your stache.</li>
            <li>Smells ok with little perfume.  </li>
            <li>This product is mostly petroleum jelly with a little perfume.</li>
            <li>you hardly need to warm it up like some waxes.</li>
            <li>This is good, but not great.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews nail the consistency of the product, which is a little different from many of the other &#x27;stache waxes on the market.  </li>
            <li>Like most reviewers have said it is more of a pomade to keep your beard and moustache from frizzing out like crazy.  </li>
            <li>He has pretty curly facial hair, and I Colonel Conk just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>Tried many other but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, a little sofy for my personal preferences.</li>
            <li>and/or a more rigid product that dries hard</li>
            <li>- Goes on clear (unlike clubman), adds a shine that brings out color.</li>
            <li>When I found it here on amazon at such a reasonable price I was stoked to try it.</li>
            <li>has zero holding power and melts into near liquid just from breathing on it.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly impressive full beard and wanted a \\&quot;fuller\\&quot; mustache to complete the look, but frankly I hate sharing half my meal with my lip hair.</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s on the wet side (unlike the other reviewer), so it is more of a &#x27;soft shaping&#x27; that doesn&#x27;t cement your &#x27;stache.  </li>
            <li>My main issue is that it is a VERY low temp wax.</li>
            <li>very subtle scent, but nice.  </li>
            <li>The scent alone merits at least a star - it is subtle and pleasant, unlike other waxes which have strong, medicinal scents.  </li>
            <li>I live in the south and as soon as I step outside in the summer, my mustache has immediately fallen</li>
            <li>I am a Clubman user, but I try new things occasionally.</li>
            <li>I am new to using such products, but do not like the greasy face that comes with application...</li>
            <li>Good luck to all of you who seek to shape your handlebars, but you&#x27;ve wandered onto the wrong page, turn back NOW!</li>
            <li>not very good  to light</li>
            <li>The Mast General Store in Knoxville, Tennessee carried Colonel Conk&#x27;s Moustache Wax</li>
            <li>my moustache feels soft, yet it generally stays in place and a simple run through with a comb keeps it in form throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I found that this product really didn&#x27;t have the hold that I expected or wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>Initially, like many of us handlebar wearers, I tried Clubman&#x27;s tube wax, which made my moustache very hard and irritated my skin due to its intense chemical composition.  </li>
            <li>I tried a few times with different amounts but to no avail, the Colonel&#x27;s was not cutting it.</li>
            <li>It does not dry over time to provide any additional hold like Clubman does.</li>
            <li>but if you plan to do the handle bar thing, do yourself a favor and get real wax like [[ASIN:B004W4PRAI Firehouse Moustache Wax :-: Dark]] and let the Colonel keep his wax for motor part lubrication.</li>

            <li> Sure, it&#x27;ll probably hold your whiskers in place if they&#x27;re  made of wispy baby hair, but if you happen to be a man (which, with a few notable exceptions are typically the only people who grow mustaches), your whiskers will be too strong to be held by this perfumed petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> i love most of col conks products, but this one is an all time fail.</li>
            <li> If you are cultivating a decent mustache, shun this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product works well for a beard gloss but does not provide much hold for wild hairs!</li>
            <li> Stick with something that has a high beeswax concentration if you want any shape to your stache.</li>
            <li> Smells ok with little perfume.  </li>
            <li> This product is mostly petroleum jelly with a little perfume.</li>
            <li> you hardly need to warm it up like some waxes.</li>
            <li> This is good, but not great.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews nail the consistency of the product, which is a little different from many of the other &#x27;stache waxes on the market.  </li>
            <li> Like most reviewers have said it is more of a pomade to keep your beard and moustache from frizzing out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> He has pretty curly facial hair, and I Colonel Conk just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> Tried many other but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, a little sofy for my personal preferences.</li>
            <li> and/or a more rigid product that dries hard</li>
            <li> - Goes on clear (unlike clubman), adds a shine that brings out color.</li>
            <li> When I found it here on amazon at such a reasonable price I was stoked to try it.</li>
            <li> has zero holding power and melts into near liquid just from breathing on it.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly impressive full beard and wanted a \\&quot;fuller\\&quot; mustache to complete the look, but frankly I hate sharing half my meal with my lip hair.</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s on the wet side (unlike the other reviewer), so it is more of a &#x27;soft shaping&#x27; that doesn&#x27;t cement your &#x27;stache.  </li>
            <li> My main issue is that it is a VERY low temp wax.</li>
            <li> very subtle scent, but nice.  </li>
            <li> The scent alone merits at least a star - it is subtle and pleasant, unlike other waxes which have strong, medicinal scents.  </li>
            <li> I live in the south and as soon as I step outside in the summer, my mustache has immediately fallen</li>
            <li> I am a Clubman user, but I try new things occasionally.</li>
            <li> I am new to using such products, but do not like the greasy face that comes with application...</li>
            <li> Good luck to all of you who seek to shape your handlebars, but you&#x27;ve wandered onto the wrong page, turn back NOW!</li>
            <li> not very good  to light</li>
            <li> The Mast General Store in Knoxville, Tennessee carried Colonel Conk&#x27;s Moustache Wax</li>
            <li> my moustache feels soft, yet it generally stays in place and a simple run through with a comb keeps it in form throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I found that this product really didn&#x27;t have the hold that I expected or wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> Initially, like many of us handlebar wearers, I tried Clubman&#x27;s tube wax, which made my moustache very hard and irritated my skin due to its intense chemical composition.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few times with different amounts but to no avail, the Colonel&#x27;s was not cutting it.</li>
            <li> It does not dry over time to provide any additional hold like Clubman does.</li>
            <li> but if you plan to do the handle bar thing, do yourself a favor and get real wax like [[ASIN:B004W4PRAI Firehouse Moustache Wax :-: Dark]] and let the Colonel keep his wax for motor part lubrication.</li>
            <li> This is a sad product that is little more than cleverly packaged petroleum jelly with a bit of added fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Use it as an alternative to lip balm I guess, it&#x27;ll make your moustache shiny, but no more so than regular old Vaseline, I could rant on and on about the inefficacy of this ripoff, but I grow weary of typing on a tablet.</li>
            <li> and it left my mustache looking greasy and wet,</li>
            <li> and you can not beat the price for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> In other words, use a regular stiffening wax for shaping and use Colonel Conk&#x27;s for shine.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t t hold very long</li>
            <li> it never dries or solidifies and leaves the moustache wet all day long which means it doesn&#x27;t hold up if the moustache is touched.</li>
            <li> they were out or down to their last one.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but they don&#x27;t last and make a mess on me and anything my moustache touches.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> but that was as expected.  </li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t work well with coarse hair that needs a heavy wax.</li>
            <li> Cons:  - Really not strong enough to bring everything into line.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The other upside is that while my moustache retains shape, it doesn&#x27;t get that crusty, rigid feeling one gets with say, Clubman Wax.   </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews that this is not a mustache wax as it is called.</li>
            <li> the biggest upside is that one can just break out a comb and fix any damage that occurs without having to wet down the beard/moustache and reapply product.  </li>
            <li> stays wet looking and wipes off to make a mess.  </li>
            <li> This began my searching (but not yet finding)for a solid mustache wax without the dried stiff look.</li>
            <li> I had to move away from wax and actually use Gorilla Snot, which is a thick gel that&#x27;s almost like glue.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes in a little tube unkine other tube wax i have used before.</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers have stated it has the texture and hold of petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> In short it was not a good look.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t hold too tightly.</li>
            <li> The product has the consistency of petroleum jelly, and a little thinner than that.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I apply it with a small amount on my fingertips followed by combing through; it works well if you don&#x27;t mind a Vaseline-like film on your fingers that does not wash off.</li>
            <li> Obviously I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> at least he hasn&#x27;t said anything negative about it.</li>
            <li> Rubbing greasy Colonel Sanders&#x27; chicken on your moustache probably has about the same effect as using Colonel Conk&#x27;s wax.  </li>
            <li> This is one I seriously regret.</li>
            <li> I recentley decided to grow out my beard and get serious about it.  </li>
            <li> Wax has a fairly weak hold.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but has weak hold.</li>
            <li> (in fact, it makes it look worse than if I just comb the moustache without any wax - Hungarian style).</li>
            <li> I bought this and some Amish made products to try to tame my beard and the Amish stuff was just plain horrible smelling.</li>
            <li> ; that requires a quality wax, and unfortunately this wax did not fulfill my requirements.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> like I forgot to wash my face after eating a plate of chicken wings.</li>
            <li> Colonel Conk&#x27;s Moustache Wax is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> If you wish to curl the tips of your stache or do anything beyond just making it shine, STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!</li>

            <li> If you need to shape your mustache at all, you need something else first. This is only to put on at the end to make your mustache shiny (not something I&#x27;m looking for). It is about as productive as putting vaseline on your mustache.</li>
            <li> The drug stores in my area do not carry moustach wax or onlyone brand thatis not to my liking.  I am still looking for a good moustache wax.</li>
            <li> Col Conk Model 118 wax leaves a shine on my moustache all day. It stays quite greasy without drying and firming up (maybe the 110+ degree weather has something to do with that). I apply it with a small amount on my fingertips followed by combing through; it works well if you don&#x27;t mind a Vaseline-like film on your fingers that does not wash off. I think the scent is a light cinammon; it&#x27;s pleasant enough, but remember that it will be under your nose all day. If you&#x27;re styling a handlebar with points like I am, this wax does not offer any reliable hold (in fact, it makes it look worse than if I just comb the moustache without any wax - Hungarian style). I&#x27;ll stick with Clubman Pinaud.</li>
            <li> Well, first off, it smells great, very pleasant aroma to adorn your &#x27;stache, however, it is more of a moustache oil than it is a wax. Sure, it&#x27;ll probably hold your whiskers in place if they&#x27;re  made of wispy baby hair, but if you happen to be a man (which, with a few notable exceptions are typically the only people who grow mustaches), your whiskers will be too strong to be held by this perfumed petroleum jelly. How do I know it won&#x27;t hold your &#x27;stache without even meeting you, you ask? Because if you even posses the requisite testosterone to extrude facial follicles, you&#x27;ve already exceeded the manliness tolerances that this product is able to handle. Use it as an alternative to lip balm I guess, it&#x27;ll make your moustache shiny, but no more so than regular old Vaseline, I could rant on and on about the inefficacy of this ripoff, but I grow weary of typing on a tablet. Good luck to all of you who seek to shape your handlebars, but you&#x27;ve wandered onto the wrong page, turn back NOW!</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as Mountaineer Brand Wax, but usable.</li>
            <li> This is not mustache wax, period!  It is petroleum jelly with a fragrance.  It smells nice enough but it is not wax!  If you just want an oily and shiny mustache that smells nice this is for you.  If you wish to curl the tips of your stache or do anything beyond just making it shine, STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews nail the consistency of the product, which is a little different from many of the other &#x27;stache waxes on the market.  Conk&#x27;s is more like a pomade than a wax and it will stay somewhat moist throughout the day.  This has both upsides and downsides, but the biggest upside is that one can just break out a comb and fix any damage that occurs without having to wet down the beard/moustache and reapply product.  The other upside is that while my moustache retains shape, it doesn&#x27;t get that crusty, rigid feeling one gets with say, Clubman Wax.   Of course, the two big downsides to this are that my moustache can more easily lose form and it feels slightly greasy to the touch.    Overall the upsides outweigh the drawbacks for me.  With Conks my moustache feels soft, yet it generally stays in place and a simple run through with a comb keeps it in form throughout the day.  The scent alone merits at least a star - it is subtle and pleasant, unlike other waxes which have strong, medicinal scents.  If you want more hold and/or a more rigid product that dries hard - this is definitely not your wax.    Every moustache wax has strengths and weaknesses and I personally keep multiple brands around to cover my needs on a given day.  In that context, Conks fits very nicely into my grooming arsenal.</li>
            <li> This is a sad product that is little more than cleverly packaged petroleum jelly with a bit of added fragrance.  I suggest you try  Clubman which I never should have doubted.    [[ASIN:B001XURHBG Colonel Conk Model 118 Moustache Wax]]</li>
            <li> Every now and then my Hubby likes to grow a mustache. When he does and uses this product I must say that it looks much better and is softer than without. He seems to like the product....at least he hasn&#x27;t said anything negative about it. I am lucky, I think my guy is good looking whether clean shaven, mustached, or with a full beard. His use of products keeps whatever facial hair mood he is in looking good.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes in a little tube unkine other tube wax i have used before. it never dries or solidifies and leaves the moustache wet all day long which means it doesn&#x27;t hold up if the moustache is touched.</li>
            <li> good stuff, not to stiff and a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is the first mustache wax I ever tried so I was not sure what to expect. While the scent is nice, a light cinnamon and vanilla I think, it does nothing to hold my mustache. It&#x27;s just like putting scented vaseline on the mustache.</li>
            <li> In the words of U2, \\&quot;But I still haven&#x27;t found what I&#x27;m looking for\\&quot;. Colonel Conk Model 118 is what I thought would cure my mustache ills. I ordered Colonel Conk after seeing it at Mast General Store in Boone,NC alongside some other great looking shaving kits &amp; hair tonics. When I found it here on amazon at such a reasonable price I was stoked to try it. I have a fairly impressive full beard and wanted a \\&quot;fuller\\&quot; mustache to complete the look, but frankly I hate sharing half my meal with my lip hair. This began my searching (but not yet finding)for a solid mustache wax without the dried stiff look. Colonel Conk&#x27;s is not it. As previous reviewers have stated it has the texture and hold of petroleum jelly and it left my mustache looking greasy and wet, like I forgot to wash my face after eating a plate of chicken wings. In short it was not a good look. I tried a few times with different amounts but to no avail, the Colonel&#x27;s was not cutting it. If anyone knows of a good product recommendation I am looking for a quality wax, but not this one...</li>
            <li> I bought this moustache wax in hopes to control my &#x27;stache. It doesnt give you much control but it smells incredible. It tames the &#x27;stache but it doesnt Stop the &#x27;stache. So just know its great as long as you dont want to twist it up!</li>
            <li> This product works well for a beard gloss but does not provide much hold for wild hairs!</li>
            <li> This is just scented Vaseline. This is marketed as a wax but appears to be a water based pomade. Not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This wax goes on pretty smoothly- you hardly need to warm it up like some waxes. However, it doesn&#x27;t hold too tightly. I&#x27;d be looking for something stronger if I want to continue with my moustachioed look.</li>
            <li> i love most of col conks products, but this one is an all time fail. its basically a tiny jar of scented vasoline. has zero holding power and melts into near liquid just from breathing on it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as my first wax to groom my mustache. It goes on nicely, but doesn&#x27;t offer very much hold. It leaves my face feeling greasy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wax to anyone. I&#x27;ve been much happier with Clubman&#x27;s wax, though I am still searching for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; wax.</li>
            <li> This wax is more like vaseline. Its very greasey and does not stiffen as you would expect a wax to do. It would have been nice to have this information before wasting my money on this purchase. Obviously I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has a big mustache which he curls on the end. I bought this for him so he could shape it a bit better. It was the best priced wax I could find on Amazon, but it is not really a wax at all, but more like an oily/greasy texture. Smells wonderful though, a spicy cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li> It reads right on the container \\&quot;...Wax is specially formulated to be the final touch...\\&quot;  In other words, use a regular stiffening wax for shaping and use Colonel Conk&#x27;s for shine.  And it works great for shine.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for hubby who sports a handlebar moustache.  He had tried many different products which were too greasy,dried out too quickly or flakey.  He loves this.</li>
            <li> Got this for my fiance, and it has no hold. Total waste of money. Stick with something that has a high beeswax concentration if you want any shape to your stache. He just buys Clubman Pinaud and it works great. He has pretty curly facial hair, and I Colonel Conk just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent wax for taming and controlling your mustache and or beard. I used this product for months shaping my goatee.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to work with and as a fresh clean scent. Item was as described, transaction was easy &amp; shipping was prompt.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do recommend this seller and I would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> I have a blonde, curly handlebar mustache. This is good, but not great. I have a bunch of waxes; this one gets used but not as much as the others.    Pros:   - Goes on clear (unlike clubman), adds a shine that brings out color. Never seen that before.  - It&#x27;s on the wet side (unlike the other reviewer), so it is more of a &#x27;soft shaping&#x27; that doesn&#x27;t cement your &#x27;stache.  - Smells nice, cinnamon or ginger    Cons:  - Really not strong enough to bring everything into line. If my mustache is really unruly after a night&#x27;s sleep, CC just doesn&#x27;t do enough  - Has kind of a greasy feel, kind of like vaseline.    I would go for Father&#x27;s - it works the best for me, and it&#x27;s handy enough to carry in a back pocket for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out too much and it didn&#x27;t hold at all. I had to move away from wax and actually use Gorilla Snot, which is a thick gel that&#x27;s almost like glue.</li>
            <li> Buy one jar and use it for the rest of your life. I bought two, and after a year, I&#x27;ve not even used the entire surface area of the jar. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but occasionally.</li>
            <li> This wax works easily and my stache responds well with it. My main issue is that it is a VERY low temp wax. I live in the south and as soon as I step outside in the summer, my mustache has immediately fallen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, a little sofy for my personal preferences. But other then that it&#x27;s as good as any of the soft high dollar sallon waxes.</li>
            <li> Wax has a fairly weak hold.  Fine if you just need to smooth out some wild hairs but doesn&#x27;t work very well on my kinky mustache.</li>
            <li> Smells ok with little perfume.  Not for training the mustache, you will need a stiffer mix for that. Good for maintaining though a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for 25 years Plus. Tried many other but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> This wax was too greasy and not as effective as most other waxes I&#x27;ve used.  I have a rather unique &amp;#34;stash&amp;#34; that requires a quality wax, and unfortunately this wax did not fulfill my requirements.</li>
            <li> Works great and this is my second order and will not be my last. It&#x27;s best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> nothing special here.  just a tub of wax.  but that was as expected.  very subtle scent, but nice.  medium holding power.</li>
            <li> more a conditioner than a true wax</li>
            <li> A nice aroma but not really a wax.  Good for grooming and softening mustache.  If you have difficulty keeping the desired shape this item may not work for you.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but has weak hold. If you have a lighter mustache, this might work. Fuller mustaches require something with better hold.</li>
            <li> If you are cultivating a decent mustache, shun this stuff. No hold at all. I am a Clubman user, but I try new things occasionally. This is one I seriously regret.</li>
            <li> I am new to using such products, but do not like the greasy face that comes with application... It could just be my ignorance...</li>
            <li> IT really is good stuff. Doesn&#x27;t leave your mustache shiny or whitened at all. Works best if you start with wet hair and work it in a little at a time. Lasts most of the day, and can be re-wetted to reshape mustache.</li>
            <li> Colonel Conk&#x27;s Moustache Wax is a disappointment. The honey scent is excellent, and the product amount is generous. But it&#x27;s not \\&quot;wax\\&quot; as you would expect. The product has the consistency of petroleum jelly, and a little thinner than that. It does not dry over time to provide any additional hold like Clubman does. Colonel Conk will leave you with a nice shiny well-scented moustache, but it&#x27;s not going to help if you need it to hold your stache together. I would only recommend it for men with handlebars or a moustache that is already trained, and only if you want some shine.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews that this is not a mustache wax as it is called. But I use it on my beard to keep it maintained and from not fuzzing out. It works great for that and you can not beat the price for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> No hold for a handlebar... its like putting minty Vaseline on your mustache... get some clubman or stache bomb</li>
            <li> A good product if you don&#x27;t need much holding power from your mustache wax. But doesn&#x27;t work well with coarse hair that needs a heavy wax. Nice texture and scent. Again, good for light hair or hair that doesn&#x27;t need much sculpting.</li>
            <li> I was out and about with the lady one day and stumbled upon a shop with this stuff. She liked the smell of it better than the other wax I&#x27;ve used, so I figured for $6 I&#x27;d give it a shot. So I get around to using it one morning it is super greasy and doesn&#x27;t hold very well at all; as my title says, it&#x27;s vaseline with a cinnamon/christmas-y scent. Sure it smells good, but it leaves you super greasy and shiny, and your fingers/hands covered in the slime. Upon closer inspection of the package, the only ingredients are &amp;#34;petroleum jelly and scent&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone for use with what it advertises itself as. You can get far better waxes for the same price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This product is mostly petroleum jelly with a little perfume. It doesnt have any holding power and does not work for for a handle bar mustache at all. I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I have had a large moustache for more than 30 years and Colonel Conk&#x27;s Moustache Wax is consistently the best product I have found. I have tried others but I always come back the \\&quot;The Colonel\\&quot;. Well packaged, excellent consistency are attributes that make this product superior to other brands I have tried. The price point is good too.</li>
            <li> I recentley decided to grow out my beard and get serious about it.  This is the first wax I have tried.  I like the way it smells (kinda like apples) A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> allright but did not work for me</li>
            <li> not what i wanted.  won&#x27;t purchase again.  it is like vaseline...not like a wax.  I wanted a wax for my eyebrows after i shaped and filled them in. but if looking for a wax, this is not it.  stays wet looking and wipes off to make a mess.  i guess since i use vaseline to take my waterproof mascara off....this might work for this....or if i had a mustache!</li>
            <li> I bought this and some Amish made products to try to tame my beard and the Amish stuff was just plain horrible smelling. This stuff however not only works GREAT it smells like Christmas cookies to me!</li>
            <li> Coty yanked the &amp;#34;New York Color Browser Brush On Brow Kit&amp;#34; from retail stores.  Disappointing.  The powder outlasts the wax.  So now I have enough to last years and years.</li>
            <li> not very good  to light doesn&#x27;t t hold very long</li>
            <li> This is the first moustache wax I have ever bought.  I am growing a handlebar and needed a good wax for it.  Colonel Conk did not do a good job with the styling of the handle bar, but it does do a good job of keeping my facial hair in order. Like most reviewers have said it is more of a pomade to keep your beard and moustache from frizzing out like crazy.  I will still keep it around to control my beard and moustache on days when they seem to be out of control, but will be looking for a different wax to shape my handlebar.</li>
            <li> I have used Colonel Conk for years but had a problem finding it locally, most times if I found it here they were out or down to their last one. Now that I have found it on Amazon I have it on hand all of the time. It works well and smells great, keeps my moustache shaped the way I like it and last all day no matter what I am doing. I have tried other brands but they don&#x27;t last and make a mess on me and anything my moustache touches.</li>
            <li> I found that this product really didn&#x27;t have the hold that I expected or wanted it to.  I ended up tossing it.  It did smell good though.</li>
            <li> When you commit to styling your moustache, it takes a while to discover the best products.  Initially, like many of us handlebar wearers, I tried Clubman&#x27;s tube wax, which made my moustache very hard and irritated my skin due to its intense chemical composition.  After using that for many months with varied success, I ran out of Clubman&#x27;s and tried to find a substitute locally, rather than continue to purchase Clubman&#x27;s online.  The Mast General Store in Knoxville, Tennessee carried Colonel Conk&#x27;s Moustache Wax and I figured anything had to be better than Clubman&#x27;s.  Well, I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is essentially pleasant smelling petroleum jelly that allows you to twist your whiskers up into points that immediately come apart, looking greasy and unseemly.  Rubbing greasy Colonel Sanders&#x27; chicken on your moustache probably has about the same effect as using Colonel Conk&#x27;s wax.  I still keep it around in my medicine cabinet (as I still have 7/8ths of a jar left) but if you plan to do the handle bar thing, do yourself a favor and get real wax like [[ASIN:B004W4PRAI Firehouse Moustache Wax :-: Dark]] and let the Colonel keep his wax for motor part lubrication.</li>
            <li> Pros: Smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It has ZERO hold. It&#x27;s nice smelling vaseline. If you are trying to do a handlebar or curl then stay away. Absolutely useless. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> You may as well wipe vegetable oil all over your face.</li>
