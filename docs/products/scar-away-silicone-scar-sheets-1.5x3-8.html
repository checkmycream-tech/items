            <li>however my surgeon said these were the best so going on that, and</li>
            <li>This idea is perfect for scar!!</li>
            <li>but i can tell this work incredibly.</li>

            <li>Great that you can wash and reuse.</li>
            <li>Did not work as advertised but the company was courteous and delightful to deal with.  </li>
            <li>I like that they give you case to carry the sheets, but I didn&#x27;t find this product very effective.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>:) LOL</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get one of these to stay on for more than 30 hours!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also trying the Kelo-Cote gel and that dries up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Good price for an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the idea</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m super happy with this.  </li>
            <li>they were very easy to take off without any pain...</li>
            <li>This product is amazing it stays on all day, can be washed and re-used, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed so far.</li>
            <li>I rate it MUCH better, easier to apply, stays in place.  </li>
            <li>and you get a lot more for your money.</li>
            <li>maybe I would have even better results.</li>
            <li>Most people scar to some extent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why so many people complain about it not sticking, unless they are exercising or working up a sweat with them on.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is much better out there either.</li>
            <li>Most fell off &amp; the rest were tossed.</li>
            <li>As son as the surgeon said it was okay</li>
            <li>The sooner you begin using it after surgery the better</li>
            <li>most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I go almost all 24 most days.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; great product</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Quickly sent -- very pleased.</li>
            <li>I found they started working very quickly, but they peeled off easily.</li>
            <li>it came off easy</li>
            <li>It &#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>The adhesive isnt too strong.</li>
            <li>I used these strips and my scar is looking fine...</li>
            <li>Results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Cheap fix.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that they are washable, but sometimes after hours of wear they would roll and bunch up, and you just can&#x27;t get much use out of them after that.  </li>
            <li>but overall it a good product will continue to use for a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>I noticed within 2 weeks my raised scar had flattened significantly.</li>
            <li>I have heard these work great, but they arent sticking very long?</li>
            <li>but overall, I think it is going to be more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I will be able to give you a better evaluation in the future.</li>
            <li>Absolutely tremendous difference in scar coloration and smoothness.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any soap to clean these, just the hot water on the silicon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the product a couple weeks, but already there has been an amazing change in the three hypertrophic scars I have used it on.</li>
            <li>It is good product as we expected.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t completely do the job for me, or not as much I wanted to, but it does in fact diminish like advertised to a point where you would be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Will post more later.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they advertise.  </li>
            <li>exactly how</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I actually have confidence that it will work to diminish the color of a scar I have but need to make sure</li>
            <li>Of the 8 strips only one stayed on for more than a day.</li>
            <li>After a 2nd scar revision for a neck surgery I wanted to be sure it healed well.  </li>
            <li>you get for the money, Also instead of getting the (8) scar sheet pack that i had ordered they sent the (4) long Cesarean tape box..</li>
            <li>Believe it or not I spilled a whole bowl of scalding hot soup on my stomach and the scar was still visible after four weeks.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using the strips consistently, but I&#x27;m very curious to see how much more the scars will improve over time.</li>
            <li>Too much movement</li>
            <li>Even trying to put a bandaid on it doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The strips stuck very well, except for the one on my leg.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>But if you have problems with too much scar tissue, this is the ticket.</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.</li>
            <li>I did use the whole box</li>
            <li>This price was far better than what the local CVS offered.</li>
            <li>This is not a &amp;#34;magic scar eraser.&amp;#34;  You will probably end up with a &#x27;normal&#x27; looking white scar, even a fine one.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used yet but bit confident based on other reviews</li>
            <li>but it does stick better than other silicone sheets I have tried.</li>
            <li>Have only been using the product  for about a week, but so far it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li>but I do have an older scar</li>
            <li>I have been able to cut down my sheets into 4 smaller sheets because my scar is smaller making it possible for me to make the product last longer which I am happy about.</li>
            <li>do use these a little more than recommended and that could be helping the speedy treatment.  </li>
            <li>The color of the two older scars has faded some (hypertrophic scars tend to be a dark red), but according to the manufacturer&#x27;s claims, the color of the scars should fade even more with 6-8 weeks consistent use.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works I&#x27;ve been using this on a old scar from a year ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a package today to help heal a new injury.  </li>
            <li>I actually noticed a definite change right from the first day I used this product.</li>
            <li>In all fairness to this product, I haven&#x27;t used it enough nor consistently as the directions explain.</li>
            <li>I have a very old scar on my cheek and old scars act up.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stick very well (even when I use medical tape over them to hold in place).</li>
            <li>The scars shrank in diameter and flattened considerably.</li>
            <li>My scar was about six months old.</li>
            <li>I have also used for an old scar i had for years-</li>
            <li>I did notice they have a hard time sticking to sweaty skin, but stayed in place fine with my bra on.  </li>
            <li>Those two scars are several years old.</li>
            <li>But there has definitely been a very noticeable change in the other two as well.</li>

            <li> The scars shrank in diameter and flattened considerably.</li>

            <li> Those two scars are several years old.</li>
            <li> But there has definitely been a very noticeable change in the other two as well.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the sheet doesn&#x27;t stay in place long especially not while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The constant need to wash and reapply or putting a band aid over the sheet can get on your nerves( it&#x27;s getting on mine&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> It has been five weeks and the scar is now thin, flat, and light and looks like a long scratch instead of a surgical scar.</li>
            <li> I think I will go back to plain but more expensive silicone sheets and medical tape.</li>
            <li> has caused a little skin irritation near my scar</li>
            <li> Each strip lasted a long time, and I found I didn&#x27;t need to use them all before the redness</li>
            <li> y have a keloid scar just next to my belly button from a rejected piercing, this keloid was realy raised, i&#x27;ve been using the strips for the last 3 weeks day and night and the scar is 50% less raised tha</li>
            <li> I purchased &#x27;Mepitac&#x27; &amp; the &#x27;scar away sheets&#x27; for a small chemical burn on my face...when the wound was new and still in the &#x27;ouchy&#x27; phase i used the &#x27;scar away sheets&#x27; because they are thicker and since they don&#x27;t stick as well</li>
            <li> so I can cut these in half, and I usually use one during the day and then I run it under hot water and place it in the open container sticky side down and let it dry while I wear the other one.  </li>
            <li> I have a scar that is at least 5 years old on my chest</li>
            <li> a bit expensive but hoping its worth it.</li>
            <li> and I usually supplement with medical tape.  </li>
            <li> The box says you should wear them for at least 12 hours and it won&#x27;t even last an hour before falling off.</li>
            <li> Recently I had shoulder replacement surgery which left al diagonal ugly scar beginning just above the armpit and ending just below the collar bone.  </li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> The scar which is about the size of a dime is slightly darker in some areas than my skin tone I noticed while using ScarAway it has gotten a little lighter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons- prepare to keep the pad on as long as possible, which is difficult to do.</li>
            <li> They have maybe flattened them a little bit, but the size and color have not changed at all.</li>
            <li> But a little cloth tape solves that problem.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I could see it start to fade after a few days.</li>
            <li> If I forget to wear them I regret it after a few hours when the scar starts to itch again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i like them because they stay in place and are you can wash them and use again no more messy lotion during the day will buy again</li>
            <li> The sheets are a little hard to stick to the skin well.  </li>
            <li> I used these to fade some very red/purple scars on my knees that I got from a bad biking accident.</li>
            <li> I am not sure</li>
            <li> Not sure of results yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually ever post reviews if I like a product</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would purchase again, but</li>
            <li> My scar is also small</li>
            <li> This is uber expensive stuff for the actual performance.</li>
            <li> One of the scars was new and not as bad as the others, and it has now almost disappeared.</li>
            <li> The directions say to use them at least 12 hours</li>
            <li> Scars are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> Unless I am missing something, this is a waste of money and hugely disappointing.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this stuff i purchased mine last week its bad and does not work</li>
            <li> my body scars differently in different places and its impossible to say if things would have been worse if i did not do anything ti help them.</li>
            <li> It was about the size of a quarter and very hard.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality &amp; don&#x27;t stay on skin.</li>
            <li> knowing they didn&#x27;t get worse, i have to believe they maybe did something.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these for anyone dealing with a painful or ugly scar.</li>
            <li> i cant say i see dramatic results</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the amount of &#x27;scar away</li>
            <li> Sucks!!</li>
            <li> it impossible to say if these things work.</li>
            <li> It would get painful and itchy</li>
    </ol>

            <li> good. just as advertised. on time. Great quality. a bit expensive but hoping its worth it. Would recommend it. Thats all.</li>
            <li> Scar Away is working well in my 5th week of use.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but bit confident based on other reviews</li>
            <li> Somewhat happy with this product.  The sheets are a little hard to stick to the skin well.  Too much movement and they can fall off. Since buying this product I have found and use Mederma cream.  I rate it MUCH better, easier to apply, stays in place.  Go for the Mederma cream.</li>
            <li> These do not stick and will peel off if you sweat at all. The box says you should wear them for at least 12 hours and it won&#x27;t even last an hour before falling off.</li>
            <li> Even trying to put a bandaid on it doesn&#x27;t really work well. I think I will go back to plain but more expensive silicone sheets and medical tape.</li>
            <li> I used these to fade some very red/purple scars on my knees that I got from a bad biking accident. I found they started working very quickly, but they peeled off easily. I solved the problem by fixing them in place with cloth tape, so it wasn&#x27;t a big issue for me. Each strip lasted a long time, and I found I didn&#x27;t need to use them all before the redness was almost gone. I probably went through 3-4 to get the desired result.</li>
            <li> Just started using recently after a laproscopy surgery. Scars are slowly disappearing. I will be able to give you a better evaluation in the future.</li>
            <li> Used on incision site about two weeks after surgery. Flattens scar and reduces reddness. Results are fantastic. After 8 weeks, cant even tell where incisions were made. Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife used these for several months after breast augmentation.  Absolutely tremendous difference in scar coloration and smoothness.  Can&#x27;t see them any longer!</li>
            <li> Have only been using the product  for about a week, but so far it&#x27;s working fine. Will post more later. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I purchased &#x27;Mepitac&#x27; &amp; the &#x27;scar away sheets&#x27; for a small chemical burn on my face...when the wound was new and still in the &#x27;ouchy&#x27; phase i used the &#x27;scar away sheets&#x27; because they are thicker and since they don&#x27;t stick as well they were very easy to take off without any pain... I was a little disappointed in the amount of &#x27;scar away tape&#x27; you get for the money, Also instead of getting the (8) scar sheet pack that i had ordered they sent the (4) long Cesarean tape box..not that big of a deal, i just cut them to size.... I prefer the Mepitac tape, its the same thing (silicone washable reusable tape) and you get a lot more for your money. The &#x27;Scar Away&#x27; does help with healing though. If i need to purchase silicone tape in the future i will stick with mepitac tape.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they advertise.  I am not sure exactly how but they do work.  Great that you can wash and reuse.</li>
            <li> Not sure of results yet but it does stick better than other silicone sheets I have tried.</li>
            <li> I used to use Curad scar sheets, and those would make my scars almost disappear in 2 weeks! But I think they stopped making them because I couldn&#x27;t find any for sale anywhere. I bought these instead thinking they&#x27;d be the same, but they&#x27;re not. They don&#x27;t stick very well (even when I use medical tape over them to hold in place). They don&#x27;t seem to do anything for my scars either. They have maybe flattened them a little bit, but the size and color have not changed at all. I like that they give you case to carry the sheets, but I didn&#x27;t find this product very effective.</li>
            <li> they will not stay on like there suppose to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product a couple weeks, but already there has been an amazing change in the three hypertrophic scars I have used it on. I actually noticed a definite change right from the first day I used this product. I had left the Scar Away strips in place for 24 hours. The scars shrank in diameter and flattened considerably. One of the scars was new and not as bad as the others, and it has now almost disappeared. But there has definitely been a very noticeable change in the other two as well. Those two scars are several years old. I haven&#x27;t been using the strips consistently, but I&#x27;m very curious to see how much more the scars will improve over time. The color of the two older scars has faded some (hypertrophic scars tend to be a dark red), but according to the manufacturer&#x27;s claims, the color of the scars should fade even more with 6-8 weeks consistent use. I&#x27;m very impressed so far. The strips stuck very well, except for the one on my leg. But a little cloth tape solves that problem.</li>
            <li> My scar was about six months old. I&#x27;ve been wearing it religiously for 8 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t made the slightest of difference.  I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with treating post surgery scars with creams because of my latex sensitivity (couldn&#x27;t cover it with band-aids). This product is amazing it stays on all day, can be washed and re-used, and is very comfortable. I have noticable results after 5 days of use!</li>
            <li> I had a breast augmentation and my surgeon suggested using these strips on the scar.  After a month of wearing 12+ hours per day my scar is definitely lighter and softer.  The strips also help with itchiness.  I did notice they have a hard time sticking to sweaty skin, but stayed in place fine with my bra on.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it works well. This price was far better than what the local CVS offered.</li>
            <li> I have a scar that is at least 5 years old on my chest so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I noticed within 2 weeks my raised scar had flattened significantly. The scar which is about the size of a dime is slightly darker in some areas than my skin tone I noticed while using ScarAway it has gotten a little lighter. I have been able to cut down my sheets into 4 smaller sheets because my scar is smaller making it possible for me to make the product last longer which I am happy about. I am 5 weeks in now I feel the changes in my scar are slower but I do have an older scar so I take that into account. The reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the sheet doesn&#x27;t stay in place long especially not while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The constant need to wash and reapply or putting a band aid over the sheet can get on your nerves( it&#x27;s getting on mine&#x27;s) and I noticed constantly using band aids has caused a little skin irritation near my scar but overall it a good product will continue to use for a couple more weeks. Just wish I had found this product sooner maybe I would have even better results.</li>
            <li> In all fairness to this product, I haven&#x27;t used it enough nor consistently as the directions explain. I gave it 4 stars because I actually have confidence that it will work to diminish the color of a scar I have but need to make sure (hence, I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars). My dermatologist swears by it!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not I spilled a whole bowl of scalding hot soup on my stomach and the scar was still visible after four weeks. I started using Scar Away and I could see it start to fade after a few days. I don&#x27;t usually ever post reviews if I like a product but I&#x27;m super happy with this.  Now, if only they came in botox flavored and I could erase the lines on my head. :) LOL</li>
            <li> Of the 8 strips only one stayed on for more than a day. I guess it depends on where in your body you use it but I won&#x27;t be buying again considering the price.  I&#x27;m also trying the Kelo-Cote gel and that dries up nicely.  You have to apply twice a day but overall, I think it is going to be more cost effective.  I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of either product yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for the lady month with no results.</li>
            <li> I have used Scar Away Silicone Scar Sheets for years.  I tend to get raised (keloid) scars after injuries or surgeries. I have used these strips on all of my keloid scars, and they soften and diminish dramatically every time. This is not a &amp;#34;magic scar eraser.&amp;#34;  You will probably end up with a &#x27;normal&#x27; looking white scar, even a fine one. Most people scar to some extent.  But if you have problems with too much scar tissue, this is the ticket. I don&#x27;t know why so many people complain about it not sticking, unless they are exercising or working up a sweat with them on.  I have never had a problem with them sticking, and even have washed and reused pieces before.  If there is a sticking issue, I&#x27;d recommend covering with some paper tape. Cheap fix.  I&#x27;m ordering a package today to help heal a new injury.  Sigh...</li>
            <li> After a 2nd scar revision for a neck surgery I wanted to be sure it healed well.  I used these strips and my scar is looking fine...</li>
            <li> It helps, but didn&#x27;t remove my scar entirely.  It&#x27;s nice that they are washable, but sometimes after hours of wear they would roll and bunch up, and you just can&#x27;t get much use out of them after that.  Not sure if I would purchase again, but I don&#x27;t know if there is much better out there either.</li>
            <li> i like them because they stay in place and are you can wash them and use again no more messy lotion during the day will buy again</li>
            <li> Poor quality &amp; don&#x27;t stay on skin. Most fell off &amp; the rest were tossed. Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Closest thing to laser even though ive never had laser haha.&lt;br /&gt;I use for blemishes on face- reduces healing time!! I have also used for an old scar i had for years- it did lighten the scar by a shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- prepare to keep the pad on as long as possible, which is difficult to do. Use them at night when you come home from work and while you sleep. Sometimes you wake up and it has moved off your skin. Sucks!! Keep at it and this will prove to work</li>
            <li> I have been using ScarAway since 2012 when I had plastic surgery and the doctor recommended it.  Recently I had shoulder replacement surgery which left al diagonal ugly scar beginning just above the armpit and ending just below the collar bone.  As son as the surgeon said it was okay I began using ScarAway. It has been five weeks and the scar is now thin, flat, and light and looks like a long scratch instead of a surgical scar. So, I don&#x27;t hesitate recommending this product. The sooner you begin using it after surgery the better it works to remove scars.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised but the company was courteous and delightful to deal with.  Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I have a scar on my arm from a Smallpox vaccination that I got a year ago.  It was about the size of a quarter and very hard.  It would get painful and itchy most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for about 6 weeks now and they have already shrunk the scar a bit and made it softer.  If I forget to wear them I regret it after a few hours when the scar starts to itch again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use these a little more than recommended and that could be helping the speedy treatment.  I only take them off to shower.  The directions say to use them at least 12 hours but I go almost all 24 most days.  By the 7th day they don&#x27;t want to stick well and I usually supplement with medical tape.  My scar is on my shoulder though so that is skin that stretches and moves a lot.  My scar is also small so I can cut these in half, and I usually use one during the day and then I run it under hot water and place it in the open container sticky side down and let it dry while I wear the other one.  I don&#x27;t use any soap to clean these, just the hot water on the silicon side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for anyone dealing with a painful or ugly scar.</li>
            <li> Good price for an outstanding product.  Quickly sent -- very pleased.</li>
            <li> I did use the whole box and I like it.  I have a very old scar on my cheek and old scars act up.I  recently bought their roll&lt;br /&gt;on scar relief and I like this for daytime.</li>
            <li> i use them regulary ...i cant say i see dramatic results</li>
            <li> I have heard these work great, but they arent sticking very long? They are rolling up and falling off. The adhesive isnt too strong.</li>
            <li> it impossible to say if these things work. my body scars differently in different places and its impossible to say if things would have been worse if i did not do anything ti help them. however my surgeon said these were the best so going on that, and knowing they didn&#x27;t get worse, i have to believe they maybe did something.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this stuff i purchased mine last week its bad and does not work it came off easy</li>
            <li> This is uber expensive stuff for the actual performance. I can&#x27;t get one of these to stay on for more than 30 hours! It says that each patch lasts a week! Not true. Unless I am missing something, this is a waste of money and hugely disappointing. Rename the product &amp;#34;patchaway&amp;#34; or &amp;#34; moneyaway.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had to return mine - it just didn&#x27;t stay on. Perhaps it depends on the location of the scar. I really liked the idea and I wish it worked.</li>
            <li> It is good product as we expected. It &#x27;s easy to use. Now we&#x27;ll see how it will work on the scars.</li>
            <li> This idea is perfect for scar!! Especially with Cancer patients!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t completely do the job for me, or not as much I wanted to, but it does in fact diminish like advertised to a point where you would be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; great product</li>
            <li> This stuff really works I&#x27;ve been using this on a old scar from a year ago and it&#x27;s basically disappearing!</li>
            <li> i wasnt expecting that mucho but i can tell this work incredibly. y have a keloid scar just next to my belly button from a rejected piercing, this keloid was realy raised, i&#x27;ve been using the strips for the last 3 weeks day and night and the scar is 50% less raised tha it was before. i love it.</li>
