    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>It meets my needs very nicely!  </li>
            <li>I am using this with the G-U-M Perioshield and having very good results.</li>
            <li>these are great probiotics for the gum I have been taking these since july</li>
            <li>After 1 week I noticed better breath, and after 3 weeks the best dental check up ever for my husband.  </li>
            <li>I am more impressed than ever</li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t rely on good bacteria alone.  </li>
            <li>A Good probiotic, but do not take at night, as they can give lead to gastrointestinal reflux, maybe from the mint component.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of good comments posted by others.</li>
            <li>am very pleased because it seems that I have halted my gum disease.</li>
            <li>My gums feel so much better and have improved every dental visit!</li>
            <li>Good price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my dentist; just started using the product, but so far so good; pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>In combination with a planar cleansing, my gums have never felt better.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the company mfr, did not even respond to my query via their web site &#x27;contact</li>
            <li>I am into my third month now, and I am happy as a Lark, I hope that you never, ever stop making this product!  </li>
            <li>I just started it, I was expecting more of a minty taste</li>
            <li>and I just love the minty taste of them ...</li>
            <li>I was able to switch to a Rx</li>
            <li>There was also better numbers than I have had since measuring started.  </li>
            <li>I am sixty five years old and my doctor said my teeth are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>However, I am not willing to ingest hydrogenated fats of any kind to achieve that result!!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the greatest tasting at first, but now i like it, and i take one in the morning after I brush, and it seems to help my breath for several hours.</li>
            <li>I just returned from my regular hygiene appointment, where I was told that my gums look great.</li>
            <li>I just reordered it and I am hoping you continue making it available to me</li>
            <li>I have been using Periobalance for several months and my dentist and hygienist have noted a remarkable improvement in my gums.</li>
            <li>You have to eat and drink healthy every day for years to see any real effect.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it and works fabulously.</li>
            <li>In the past few years I&#x27;ve experienced deepening pockets -- not the good kind, but in my gums.  </li>
            <li>I will update later but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>But you also have to remember that you have to use good bacteria for a very long time, perhaps even years.  </li>
            <li>You have to have way way more good bacteria in your system than bad to have any good results.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>You also have to eat right, avoid sugar and lots of protein.  </li>
            <li>I do not have dry mouth anymore and my teeth and gums from using PerioBalance is astonishing, I never feel tartar or plaque on my teeth and gums in the mornings anymore!</li>
            <li>The interesting part is not only did the morning breath dramatically improve, but my reflux is much improved--after 6 years of fighting it!  </li>
            <li>these work really well for me!  </li>
            <li>I grind my teeth at night and it can make my gums pretty sore and irritated.</li>
            <li>These supplements make a big difference in keeping my gums healthy and fortified to deal with my grinding.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consumer Labs tested it, and evidently it does work to improve gum health, which is why I bought it in the first instance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since I first heard about it on the Evening News, Health Watch.</li>
            <li>Despite following appropriate dental hygienem, gum inflammation continued to be a problem.  </li>
            <li>These lozenges are so delicious if you love mint and really help with bad breath.</li>
            <li>I will be passing the information along to everyone that wants to listen!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced that this product really does what is says it will</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference from this, but when I tried taking the OralBiotic just by chance one night because my kids had forgotten their dose, I did notice a difference, so I&#x27;ll be switching to that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>This product really works wonders.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I buy this for my periodontal disease and it really seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Th true test will be my next dentist appointment in April</li>
            <li>The inflammation subsided quickly when I stopped using the product and overall the condition of my gums was improved.  </li>
            <li>So for me it seems like a high cost that could be used on floss,&lt;br /&gt;tooth brushes, and paste.  </li>
            <li>Finally something that really works for gum health!</li>
            <li>This product is fairly expensive everywhere due to lack of competition but Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I saw that Dr Mercola and an old dentist of mine recommended an oral probiotic with a sugar alcohol.  </li>
            <li>After using these lozenges, my periodontist and my regular dentist say &amp;#34;your gums look very healthy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Probiotics appear to be very helpful with regards to oral health and there are several out there to choose from.</li>
            <li>Different probiotics may work for different people, so it may be worth trying, but I don&#x27;t think this one is for me.</li>
            <li>With periodontal disease and frequent cleaning 4 times a year, we thought it was time to try something new since flossing and brushing were not apparently enough.  </li>
            <li>With the new Rx and use of GUM periobalance, now I only need dental cleaning every six months, instead of every 3 months.</li>
            <li>When he ran out, his teeth were worse so now he makes sure he has it on hand.</li>
            <li>Given that this is a health-improvement product, it is very disappointing that it contains HYDROGENATED PALM OIL as the fourth most significant ingredient!</li>

            <li> This gum may help over a long time use, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after I used several packages of these.  </li>
            <li> I was using Biotene Dry Mouth Mouthwash before you surfaced on the market, now the double duty of the two has almost blown my mind.</li>
            <li> I have been doing nothing differently in terms of caring for my mouth since my last appointment other than these probiotics.  </li>
            <li> The are expensive, but I feel they are worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do anything  for me, I think it is fake, the first time I bought</li>
            <li> as expected the  package looked like someone opened it, it also looked old and dusty..</li>
            <li> This fear proved to be unfounded as the expiration date on the lot I received was July 2015, which was about a year and a half from my purchase date.  </li>
            <li> (I know it can be impossible), and exercise the right amount.  </li>
            <li> I have used these for a few years.  </li>
            <li> and there was very little plaque compared to before.  </li>
            <li> I have never had comments like that; they usually say nothing or question me about my flossing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would buy the product again from the seller; but expect to wait about 10 days for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using the product for about 8 months, it began to negatively impact my gums.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes forget one has been placed in my cheek to slowly dissolve.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical and I was wrong to be.</li>
            <li> Anyone, who has not given it a try, the time is now and you will not be sorry... &amp;#34;Guaranteed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I always had a coated tongue in the morning with accompanying bad breath that I attributed to night reflux.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Finally something that really works for gum health! I am not saying it cures gum disease but it has stopped my chronic bleeding gums and infections after just one month. This product has now become part of my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I always had a coated tongue in the morning with accompanying bad breath that I attributed to night reflux.  I saw that Dr Mercola and an old dentist of mine recommended an oral probiotic with a sugar alcohol.  The interesting part is not only did the morning breath dramatically improve, but my reflux is much improved--after 6 years of fighting it!  Don&#x27;t know if it is related, but I&#x27;m not stopping this evening routine anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do anything  for me, I think it is fake, the first time I bought it was from cvs  and the package  said 28 lozenges. The package was smaller compare to this one, ..</li>
            <li> As advertised. Good price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Just started using them and within 3 weeks have noticed a difference in the reduction of plaque buil-up. Th true test will be my next dentist appointment in April</li>
            <li> This gum may help over a long time use, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after I used several packages of these.  But you also have to remember that you have to use good bacteria for a very long time, perhaps even years.  You also have to eat right, avoid sugar and lots of protein.  You have to reduce stress (I know it can be impossible), and exercise the right amount.  You just can&#x27;t rely on good bacteria alone.  You have to eat and drink healthy every day for years to see any real effect.  You have to have way way more good bacteria in your system than bad to have any good results.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the greatest tasting at first, but now i like it, and i take one in the morning after I brush, and it seems to help my breath for several hours. I am a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> This product is fairly expensive everywhere due to lack of competition but Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m not convinced that this product really does what is says it will but my dentist is encouraged after 3 months of use. We&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> In the past few years I&#x27;ve experienced deepening pockets -- not the good kind, but in my gums.  About a month ago I purchased a box of PerioBalance and began using it according to label instructions.  I just returned from my regular hygiene appointment, where I was told that my gums look great. I have been doing nothing differently in terms of caring for my mouth since my last appointment other than these probiotics.  My conclusion:  these work really well for me!  I can&#x27;t speak to others&#x27; experience, but I will definitely be telling my friends and family about mine.</li>
            <li> Last time o bought it was from cvs but for some reason they don&#x27;t have this product anymore so I decided to order it from amazon..the product came and I took it as directed but didn&#x27;t work  as expected the  package looked like someone opened it, it also looked old and dusty..</li>
            <li> A Good probiotic, but do not take at night, as they can give lead to gastrointestinal reflux, maybe from the mint component.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for myself as well as OralBiotic by Now Foods for my kids. I was hoping this would help me with gingivitis. I was feeling like my gums were literally under attack despite brushing with Sonicare, rinsing with a water pick and using Listerine. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference from this, but when I tried taking the OralBiotic just by chance one night because my kids had forgotten their dose, I did notice a difference, so I&#x27;ll be switching to that. Different probiotics may work for different people, so it may be worth trying, but I don&#x27;t think this one is for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It meets my needs very nicely!  I just reordered it and I am hoping you continue making it available to me so I can continue ordering on Prime terms.  Thank you for always being my go-to for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have had gum disease for several years and go to a periodontist in addition to my regular dentist.  After using these lozenges, my periodontist and my regular dentist say &amp;#34;your gums look very healthy&amp;#34;.  I have never had comments like that; they usually say nothing or question me about my flossing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased because it seems that I have halted my gum disease.</li>
            <li> I have been using Periobalance for several months and my dentist and hygienist have noted a remarkable improvement in my gums.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of good comments posted by others. After I tried continuously for over 50 days, I believe that I was cheated. The product dosnt improve at all my gum health, gingivitis, or any periodental disease. It&#x27;s just a wast of money to buy the product.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night and it can make my gums pretty sore and irritated. These supplements make a big difference in keeping my gums healthy and fortified to deal with my grinding. Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> The research supports the use of probiotics for oral health.  I am sixty five years old and my doctor said my teeth are beautiful.  These do not burn your mouth.  I sometimes forget one has been placed in my cheek to slowly dissolve.  I have used these for a few years.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my gums.</li>
            <li> I am using this with the G-U-M Perioshield and having very good results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and I was wrong to be. In combination with a planar cleansing, my gums have never felt better.</li>
            <li> Given that this is a health-improvement product, it is very disappointing that it contains HYDROGENATED PALM OIL as the fourth most significant ingredient! This was not visible in the product label on-line at Amazon, nor in the product description, nor could I find it on the product web-site. On top of that, the company mfr, did not even respond to my query via their web site &#x27;contact us&#x27; submission box on the product formulation in four weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consumer Labs tested it, and evidently it does work to improve gum health, which is why I bought it in the first instance. However, I am not willing to ingest hydrogenated fats of any kind to achieve that result!!! Sticking with Barberry extract and PerioBrite toothpaste from Nature&#x27;s Answer, Ubiquinol and Vitamin C to support my gum-related matters.</li>
            <li> Not helping a lot yet, hope it soon kicks in and does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it and works fabulously.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be helping to control my bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> I was using Biotene Dry Mouth Mouthwash before you surfaced on the market, now the double duty of the two has almost blown my mind. I do not have dry mouth anymore and my teeth and gums from using PerioBalance is astonishing, I never feel tartar or plaque on my teeth and gums in the mornings anymore! I&#x27;ve been using it since I first heard about it on the Evening News, Health Watch. I am into my third month now, and I am happy as a Lark, I hope that you never, ever stop making this product!  Anyone, who has not given it a try, the time is now and you will not be sorry... &amp;#34;Guaranteed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product has helped me immensly!  My gums feel so much better and have improved every dental visit!</li>
            <li> My partner and I have been using these for almost 4 months and with our recent dentist appointment both of our different dentists,&lt;br /&gt;and hygienist said they seen no difference in our gums or teeth. So for me it seems like a high cost that could be used on floss,&lt;br /&gt;tooth brushes, and paste.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Despite following appropriate dental hygienem, gum inflammation continued to be a problem.  This product has worked well to eliminate the inflammation and I have been using it for about 6 months.  I was hesitant to buy the product online because it has an expiration date, which you could not see before purchasing the product.  This fear proved to be unfounded as the expiration date on the lot I received was July 2015, which was about a year and a half from my purchase date.  I would buy the product again from the seller; but expect to wait about 10 days for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using the product for about 8 months, it began to negatively impact my gums.  The inflammation subsided quickly when I stopped using the product and overall the condition of my gums was improved.  It appears that there is a point of diminshing return and I would be cautious when using the product longer than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Contains hydrogenated palm oil. For me, that&#x27;s a deal breaker.  Probiotics appear to be very helpful with regards to oral health and there are several out there to choose from.</li>
            <li> These lozenges are so delicious if you love mint and really help with bad breath. The are expensive, but I feel they are worth it.</li>
            <li> I have advance periodontal disease and my hygenist suggested this for me.  I just started it, I was expecting more of a minty taste but they aren&#x27;t horrible.  We will see!!!  I will update later but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> these are great probiotics for the gum I have been taking these since july and I must say that my gums look a lot healthier and I just love the minty taste of them ...</li>
            <li> I use this every bedtime after brushing and flossing.  It is easy to use.  A medication that I MUST take encourages the development of plaque.  I was able to switch to a Rx that doer&#x27;t cause plaque so severely. With the new Rx and use of GUM periobalance, now I only need dental cleaning every six months, instead of every 3 months.</li>
            <li> This product really works wonders.  I will continue to use it every night.</li>
            <li> With periodontal disease and frequent cleaning 4 times a year, we thought it was time to try something new since flossing and brushing were not apparently enough.  After 1 week I noticed better breath, and after 3 weeks the best dental check up ever for my husband.  An update!  I just had my teeth cleaned and there was very little plaque compared to before.  There was also better numbers than I have had since measuring started.  Now all my numbers are 0,1,or 2 with a couple of threes.  WOW!  I am more impressed than ever and my hygienist was unaware of this product.  I will be passing the information along to everyone that wants to listen!</li>
            <li> This product saved my husband&#x27;s gums. When he ran out, his teeth were worse so now he makes sure he has it on hand. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my dentist; just started using the product, but so far so good; pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my periodontal disease and it really seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I could use my $5.00 coupon with the purchase!!!!</li>
