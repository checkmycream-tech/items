            <li>He also uses it to shave his head and it works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an awesome beard trimmer!  </li>
            <li>think this Styleshaver would be an excellent complement to any electric razor.</li>
            <li>Awesome product !!! .</li>
            <li>is that it is a very good trimming tool for my scruffy beard</li>
            <li>This is a very good beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like but it shaves, trims beards and body hair all with one razor, which is ideal.</li>
            <li>all work well for a beautiful finish</li>
            <li>charging cradle is exceptionally convenient, the best I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a couple of design issues that Norelco could address that would improve the Styleshaver greatly.  </li>
            <li>The Styleshaver works well and is a great design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it gave me a great and close shave even after two days growth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it looks and works great.</li>
            <li>For the 80 dollar price tag this is a great styler.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great and i use it to shape up my beard all the time.</li>
            <li>Amazing works perfect</li>
            <li>I am happy with how compact this unit is compared to others I have had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for trimming, but doesn&#x27;t accomplish a shaving job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>All all around great product.</li>
            <li>, what would make this a great produce is the razor.  </li>
            <li>great features  </li>
            <li>Very nice shaver and style razor.</li>
            <li>It is very handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Philips Norelco StyleRazor for a couple of months now, and it makes for a great trimmer, but as a good utility shaving tool, it&#x27;s not quite there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bright orange attachment/guard is a bit flimsy, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>Does not excel at any department but performs good at (about 75%) at all.</li>
            <li>It does a fairly good job as a combo device.</li>
            <li>good charging station should be sturdy, permanent, and not trickle charge, someplace to rest your shaver when not in use, without wasting power or battery</li>
            <li>I liked the trimmer part of the unit and thought it cut just great.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is good, its gets the job done and is good for when im in a rush.</li>
            <li>good luck finding this model on Philips site if you are not a member of ClubPhilips, or in Europe).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summation, I consider the QS6140 a good styler but middling shaver.</li>
            <li>He even uses the trimming end to fix up his sideburns to keep them looking good between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good unit, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, when I spied the Philips Norelco Stylershaver, I thought it might be a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>but I still looked good.</li>
            <li>I suppose this shaver would be good if you needed to trim in a car on the way to a meeting or something and didn&#x27;t mind getting stubble on your shirt.  </li>
            <li>So I am going to continue to use it as a trimmer for my grandson, but it does not make a good shaver at all.</li>
            <li>good combo unit</li>
            <li>good product both shaver and trimmer are excellent and the charging of this product is very fast, i like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>The beard comb (beard and stubble) adapter would work great if one had 10 hairs per square inch, anything more forgetaboutit.</li>
            <li>Sure the stuff was great</li>
            <li>Now that is to say you will look good as the styling par does an amazing job making lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, its a well built and innovative product -- kudos for that Norelco!  </li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver end works pretty well, but the foil isn&#x27;t the best design.</li>
            <li>It does a phenomenal job of making pre-existing beards and mustaches tidy!</li>
            <li>again, not as close as a blade, but if i ever need a quick shave (i think it&#x27;d be ideal for camping trips), it would do well in pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall a really great product with really great features for a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I also found the detail trimmer handy for trimming around my moustache.  </li>
            <li>I liked that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s cordless</li>
            <li>Honestly, though, it performs as well as anything in the $40-80 shaver crowd.  </li>
            <li>A nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor works well and it looks nice</li>
            <li>There probably are cheaper trimmers that are just as effective, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this excellent Philips item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good， I love this one，its appearance looks so beautiful.</li>
            <li>Design:  3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:  5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:  4</li>
            <li>have been using a standalone trimmer from Norelco along with a manual razor for many years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;having said that, the phillips norelco sytle shaver is a competent shaver.  </li>
            <li>the foil razor end does a great job and gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>and I love having it all in one product.  </li>
            <li>They may have eliminated the charger input on the shaver to make the shaver more water resistant, but it&#x27;s not waterPROOF regardless, and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m planning to toss this thing in the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At age 63 I have now owned way too many razors of every type.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the trimmer for beard/mustache trimming.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver is MUCH better than the Remington I have been using.</li>
            <li>Maybe mechanical controls are more appropriate for a beard trimmer...</li>
            <li>like so many</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to spend over $100 to get a noticeably better shaver.  </li>
            <li>Which isn&#x27;t to say it was magic.  </li>
            <li>I love about this \\&quot;Styleshaver\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the way It works.</li>
            <li>Have not bought this product, but unless you are 100% sure you will like it</li>
            <li>For the price i thought it would perform better than the $25 trimmer it was replacing.</li>
            <li>Applying way more pressure than was comfortable;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I chose this for my husband who has close shaved hair on top of his head and prefers to have me do it at home rather than a barber.  </li>
            <li>all, we are pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have had better shavers but for it being both a trimmer and shaver</li>
            <li>So when you remove the guard you can rotate the head 180 degrees and gain more precision for sideburn trimming and shaping.</li>
            <li>This shaver/trimmer is just ok all the way around.</li>
            <li>I used it once and found it to be just ok.</li>
            <li>a styler - where I really hoped it was great -</li>
            <li>I love the idea that it has functionality on both ends and that the beard trimming can be adjusted with a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think toy razors cut better.  </li>
            <li>So at this point this shaver is nothing more than a glorified trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love the trimmer, but the rest of the unit is lacking, and I can&#x27;t recommend it as a multi-purpose shaving tool.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>but then it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This more than meets the need for timing hair and beard.</li>
            <li>and I had to make many many passes to get the ones I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps others had a better experience.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is really cool and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>To be more precise on my rating</li>
            <li>charging stand is stylish, if that is important to you.</li>
            <li>The StyleRazor itself is light to use but had a respectable heft to tell me it&#x27;s got some guts in there and isn&#x27;t all plastic shell.  </li>
            <li>since tipping it over is so darn easy.</li>
            <li>is positioned to easily control the shaving end.</li>
            <li>It has a futuristic, slim and curved design though the body and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>And it is so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li>It is also a flimsy dock, easily falls over when upright, and the shaver slips off the charging contacts when the item is lying</li>
            <li>Not so easy to work with it.</li>
            <li>It holds it&#x27;s charge well and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK shaver if you just want to quickly clean up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
            <li>The problem with this razor rests mostly on the drawbacks of this cool design.  </li>
            <li>My first  razor of the kind</li>
            <li>All in all, the trimmer is very nice and functional, but I have one major gripe with this product, and that is the charging functionality.</li>
            <li>The fully accessible head is easy to clean, unlike many trimmers which have all sorts of nooks and crannies for hair to accumulate in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fine hair trimmings get everywhere.  </li>
            <li>As a trimmer, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>have used the trimmer and it works fine for sideburns.</li>
            <li>However, there are better shavers out there if you are looking for a super close shave.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions that I have not addressed, please feel free to ask in the comments below.t.  </li>
            <li>If you have any questions that I have not addressed, please feel free to ask in the comments below.</li>
            <li>It is extremely comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>maybe someone else&#x27;s review will be able to tell you if that part of the device is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Remove the shaver cover for easy clean up when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the comb off the two heads are great for trimming around ears, sideburns, and the back along the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the best part of the device and possibly the redeeming feature that can convince you to by it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>There is no way I could fit in both an electric shaver and an electric beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Overall i am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>hey I have a 45 day risk free warrantee</li>
            <li>Is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>The styler has a front indicator light that will light up continuously when shaver is fully charged (50 min of shaving/styling time).  </li>
            <li>When the lithium ion battery dissipates to 10 min charge time remaining the indicator light will flash orange.  </li>
            <li>StyleShaver has been a welcome addition to my husband&#x27;s personal grooming product line-up.  </li>
            <li>He liked it so much i brought him one again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-LED light shows battery status</li>
            <li>the charge stand is attractive, the overall design of the style shaver could be improved&lt;br /&gt;-Takes</li>
            <li>/&gt;This, however, is a fantastic beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use it to shave my body and personal grooming.</li>
            <li>This works great as a trimmer, and I can even get around his ears with such perfection.</li>
            <li>When I saw this Model I liked very When buying him I did not regret it</li>
            <li>I found this unit to be very handy: It feels very sturdy in your hand and feels very well-made.  </li>
            <li>All in one with a charge that lasts a long time, I found this is a great product for travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure for those looking for perfection it would be all that impressive.</li>
            <li>even if the charging time is much longer; this would encourage me to travel with a shaver and really get used to relying on a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a razor, I would sadly give this a 2 star rating at BEST (1 star to be brutally honest)....</li>
            <li>It works quietly, cleanly, and gets the job done well.</li>
            <li>The battery life has been excellent so far, with several weeks of use between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing particularly special, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also great for side burns, however it&#x27;s not capable of doing a close shave.</li>
            <li>I use setting 5 which creates a neatly trimmed yet still full beard.  </li>
            <li>It never quite gets blade close, but it looks passable which is good enough for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>It never quite gets blade close, but it looks passable which is good enough for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer seems to work well, and overall the product does have a good quality feel to it.  </li>
            <li>The beard trimmer on the flip side of this device is every bit as good as the Remington trimmer, though the controls are not digital.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is a solidly constructed, substantial feeling unit and feels good in your hand.  </li>
            <li>even at the highest speed true shaving is tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As someone who attempts to keep a well trimmed yet fairly full beard, I&#x27;ve gone through my share of beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a good piece of personal hygiene equipment.  </li>
            <li>It takes several passes to get a good trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fit right on the counter, and having a charger means I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries like I do with my nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>The downside which has been mentioned in other reveiws is the shaver is not all that great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a blade guy but for a quick shave or trim I do like the convenience of an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the Norelco is a snap using the included mini-brush and a quick rinse under tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning the Norelco is a snap using the included mini-brush and a quick rinse under tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges quickly too.</li>
            <li>, the QS6140 does not feature a quick charge option.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the included brush works well for this.</li>
            <li>While I have tried electric razors in the past, I have never found that they give me a very good shave.  </li>
            <li>first and shaver last because like many multi-purposed devices, some functions are less impressive than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very neat looking and also with easy handling and maneuverability.</li>
            <li>My old unit was a corded one, and it&#x27;s awesome to not be tied down or get tangled up in that cord</li>
            <li>My fairly inexpensive, three round head shaver does a much better job at a clean shave and the trimmer isn&#x27;t working for me very well at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That alone is worth a lot to me.</li>
            <li>It also had a primitive trimmer attachment that would be ok to completely remove a beard, but not to trim it.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The rubber grips on the outside are a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li>In fairness (?) I&#x27;ve never had success with foil razors, but I hadn&#x27;t tried one for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li>The shaver end of the device left me with a very patchy shave as well as fairly sore</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a great deal of success with any foil models I&#x27;ve tried as in each case they tended to pale in comparison to rotary head models  for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most important to me with this product is the in MY life, Norelco products have outlasted all the other brands by a huge margin.</li>
            <li>There are some grips on the side of the cover to release it easily, but a quick grab and pull ends up with the blades exposed and old clippings falling out when you may not expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never use right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the attachment removed, it creates a clean straight edge at the bottom of the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to switch between the ten length settings.</li>
            <li>But I really feel it&#x27;s true value is with beard</li>
            <li>It was VERY VERY misleading.</li>
            <li>can use from it very fast and without ache</li>
            <li>As a shaver, there are many other alternatives available to attain a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>handled it pretty well.  </li>
            <li>First thing first:  </li>
            <li>I had a simple shaver from philips, and this ones does the job even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the Norelco QS6140/41 is an appropriately priced shaver/styler that meets the appropriated priced expectations for facial hair maintenance.</li>

            <li>My wife was joking that, first the first time in our marriage, my face was smoother than hers is.  </li>
            <li>This was my first electric shaver and trimmer.</li>
            <li>The instruction booklet suggests strands longer than 10mm should be trimmed first</li>
            <li>/&gt;Subsequent daily use after the first attempt was better but it still took longer than I customarily take with a multi-blade or safety razor.  </li>
            <li>The back end of trimming head has a precision detail trimmer for areas where greater concern must be devoted like, under nose, around mouth, sideburns.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what he had been hoping to find for trimming his beard and mustache, so he wouldn&#x27;t have to shave it off as often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In comparison to a host of electronic shavers, it is not all that remarkable, meeting rudimentary needs but failing to provide the level of efficiency I have found with numerable competitive models and for my preferences, not nearly as effective as most double edge razors.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer worked extremely well and the dial settings were a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Manual shaving irritates my face so much that I can only do it twice a week at most.  </li>
            <li>As days went by I was missing more and more hairs making it more difficult to effectively shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the shave does not work on my beard, my hair much just grow funny.  </li>
            <li>And I loved the rotating head that gave you a fine-tuner along with a big flat shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had good luck in the past with adjustable guard trimmers, but this one works quite well.</li>
            <li>shaver seems good, but I don&#x27;t use it very much so it ends up being pretty much dead weight as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Styleshaver is an average shaver with smooth looks that get in the way of delivering a smooth shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall this device is a superior option to buying multiple devices AND it does each task better than other single-function devices I have used before.</li>
            <li>For styling and trimming a beard to certain shapes and angles is where this works.</li>
            <li>But he kept shaving it off when it got to a certain point, because the tools he had didn&#x27;t allow him to groom it evenly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, and if you are finicky you might want to stick with the regular razor, but as a day to day maintenance advice it lets me be just a little bit more lazy.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, and if you are finicky you might want to stick with the regular razor, but as a day to day maintenance advice it lets me be just a little bit more lazy.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased several razors in the past and this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>With a little practice, I can lay it right in the charging cradle sweet spot in one smooth motion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little less impressed that it needed a four-hour charge for a 30 minutes of shaving, but it came charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I must have been in need of new blades on my old one for quite a while because the Styleshaver trimmed significantly better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>It is rather flimsy, and it would take much of a bump to knock it over while</li>
            <li>The results were much cleaner than what I was used to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i also have a goatee and sideburns and the opposite end of the sytleshaver is for advanced grooming.</li>
            <li>It really does shine there (for me anyway).</li>
            <li>I get very close shaves that are almost comparable to a razor shave.</li>
            <li>The motor also was very inconsistent...</li>
            <li>If one desires to compromise to limit the number of appliances lined up in the bathroom, it&#x27;s a reasonable choice</li>
            <li>but I will continue to use another grooming set with a wider selection of attachments and either a manual razor or under some conditions, one of my assortment of rotary head shavers.d up in the bathroom, it&#x27;s a reasonable choice</li>
            <li>The picture that represent&#x27;s a man styling his beard is very MISLEADING.</li>
            <li>really likes that there is just one guard on the trimming end, with adjustments in desired hair length being made by a dial.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>Be detailed and specific what would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product&lt;</li>
            <li>As my beard grows very rapidly and this helps me contain it quite well.</li>
            <li>handle is very hand-friendly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to like this razor.</li>
            <li>The item feels nice in your hands and is a bit on the heavy side.</li>
            <li>Not very expensive either.</li>
            <li>I only trim my beard once a week, and I ensure that I charge right before and right after.  </li>
            <li>I only trim my beard once a week, and I ensure that I charge right before and right after.  </li>
            <li>I do still find it difficult to get a good clean edge along my beard on one side.  </li>
            <li>I do still find it difficult to get a good clean edge along my beard on one side.  </li>
            <li>This is an interesting concept -- shaver on one end, trimmer on the other.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a gillette manual razor but really liked the idea for this razor.  </li>
            <li>The same is true with this piece of JUNK,</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s easy for the styleshaver to slip out), you have to rest it carefully against something.  </li>
            <li>I previously switched from shaving full-time with a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo to shaving most of the time with a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>If you wish this to be a beard trimmer it will make you have less a beard and more of a lot of scruf.</li>
            <li>Even when I fully adjusted, there were problem areas such as my lower neck that I could not shave adequately.</li>
            <li>in particular is that it is a multi-tasker.  </li>
            <li>A quick hit with a disposable razor was needed to get back to ground zero.</li>
            <li>have what many people would call a goatee, though the proper term for it is actually a van dyke (goatee with connecting moustache).  </li>
            <li>The four hour charge time makes this highly impractical, and I would recommend users change it after every use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a need for both a trimmer and a razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a need for both a trimmer and a razor.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.mend this shaver.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Id highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it</li>
            <li>a nice, tight, clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the orange \\&quot;frontal guard\\&quot; is bulky and not particularly useful.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was a way to lengthen the trimmer a little bit more though.</li>
            <li>The guard is so finicky and badly designed that you have to get a perfect angle to make any cut.</li>
            <li>I have a $20 Remington that works just as well and has a normal charging option.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have with it, is that if you let your beard grow a bit between trims, the trimmings build up quite fast in the guard and have to be swept out fairly often for it to continue trimming.</li>
            <li>I normally use a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;He has found that not only is the trimmed facial hair looking even and clean, but he&#x27;s also not having the itchiness that comes at a certain point when the hair is growing out.  </li>
            <li>Overall as a trimmer the Styleshaver is a nice improvement over previous Norelco products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you are going to use it to completely shave your beard off you might want to get a different razor, but if you want to keep your beard trimmed at a certain length, I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>This led to an obvious challenge on my first shave with the Styleshaver since it is designed to work with stubble not hair.  </li>
            <li>This led to an obvious challenge on my first shave with the Styleshaver since it is designed to work with stubble not hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that the concept makes sense, but it is interesting and it&#x27;s well executed.</li>
            <li>This one surprised me!  </li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s big.</li>
            <li>Since I shaved first, and then turned the device upside-down, I made a big mess as the fine hair shavings fell out of the shaver foils while trimming my goatee.  </li>
            <li>I would go over my head 5 or 6 times for a smooth cut, and under my neck was a mess...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately a full charge for this model takes 4 hours Unlike some other models</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trim side is much better, easily to adjust and dual sided with a wide trim with the guard as well as a thin trim for use with the guard removed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have epic amounts of storage space in my bathroom, which is already chock full of electric toothbrushes, contact supplies, glasses cases, and other day-to-day maintenance items.  </li>
            <li>The little light on the front comes on to tell me that I&#x27;ve got it on the contacts, and off I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pretty minor, and I am probably the only one who really notices anyway.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty minor, and I am probably the only one who really notices anyway.  </li>
            <li>, that means I have THREE shaving products - The Remington foil shaver for day-to-day, the Gillette Mach 3 to shave problem areas or for days when I need a really close shave, and finally the Remington trimmer for, well, trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>therefore if this unit is allowed to completely drain you&#x27;ll just have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a close hair cut (and evening out the back of the hair), this works very well.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco Professional Bodygrooming System, Black/Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for me, I can only use the beard trim on the Styleshaver, and I like it because the \\&quot;1\\&quot; on this shaver is much much much closer that the \\&quot;1\\&quot; on the bodygrooming system.</li>
            <li>it allows him to shape his facial hair the way he wants.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve gone electric, I&#x27;ve used the type with three rotating heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying to shave with this thing, I had to pull out my real electric razor and actually shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a professional quality trimmer for years</li>
            <li>I have no such patience; give me a real razor and shave to the skin.  </li>
            <li>old grandson&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>old son asked if he could use the shaver, and he said that he didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>I did notice that it was difficult to get a good edge with my beard.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that it was difficult to get a good edge with my beard.  </li>
            <li>With the comb on, the depth is adjustable by simply turning the dial right above the on/off switch.</li>
            <li>This is one of those clever ideas I am surprised isn&#x27;t universal.  </li>
            <li>He said he uses this side occasionally when he&#x27;s in a real hurry and doesn&#x27;t have time for a blade, but generally he still prefers using a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-priced a bit high for its current quality</li>
            <li>Very useful with long battery life, it was hard on skin at first</li>
            <li>the shaver is not active and when using the shaver, the clipper is not active.</li>
            <li>and I went back to use my old (20+ years old)</li>
            <li>but I did have a major amount of chafing.  </li>
            <li>It has two trimmers (one for general use and one for finer detail) in addition to the razor.  </li>
            <li>I generally go low-tech.  </li>
            <li>The AC adapter plugs into the back of the cradle, but it cannot directly plug into the shaver.  </li>
            <li>However, after shaving with the QS6140 for about two weeks, I am switching back to the old rotary one I had.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the &#x27;beard trimmer&#x27; and it barely got any of the hairs</li>
            <li>When I changed the guard to the lowest one they had it still barely managed to get any of the hairs.</li>
            <li>To be honest it failed about every test I gave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting while I consider it excessively over -packaged, at least the clam shell case is easily opened without scissors or knife.  </li>
            <li>I love this tool because the trimmer is small enough to really negotiate the tight spots under my lip and, actually, all around the perimeter for the beard.  </li>
            <li>I typically keep a neatly trimmed circle goatee, but I prefer to shave my face first every morning, and then trim around the goatee area.  </li>
            <li>QS6140 foil shaver seems adequate for removal of stubble growth of not more than three days.</li>
            <li>i suppose there&#x27;s a universal code for setting/lengths as the styleshaver set to \\&quot;4\\&quot; give me the same length as my old groomer set to level</li>
            <li>(I think it is measured in horsepower) and the guides that go with it are thin, and provide enough of an opening to do an effective job; the StyleRazor&#x27;s guide is thick, clumsy, and doesn&#x27;t give you effective</li>
            <li>It is a regular foil razor but at the other end is a large and medium size groomer.  </li>
            <li>It does an adequate job, but, frankly, not better than the razor I mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>The head of the trimmer is double sided and much narrower on the other side.</li>
            <li>If that weren&#x27;t enough, the other end of the trimmer is a very serviceable foil razor.</li>
            <li>i have a fairly full, thick beard and the styleshaver</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very sharp and cuts very well.  </li>
            <li>This is so much easier than keeping up with various guards that are all spilling around in a drawer with a bunch of his other personal stuff.  </li>
            <li>Main reason I bought was due to the adjustable height to trim the beard only.</li>
            <li>Additionally, while performance factors appear to be identical, there is a more expensive model QS6160 with a more convenient one hour charging cycle, storage pouch and a few other convenience features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped with a partial charge, it is recommended to fully charge before initial use.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start by making it clear my rating of this product is based on how I feel it performs compared to single purposed personal grooming devices.</li>
            <li>For more than 40 years I&#x27;ve been using the rotary technology from the Philips shaver to shave and thought that this &#x27;new&#x27; system would make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The disappointment is big</li>
            <li>I have a very thick beard; there was no way that this cheap piece of junk could style my beard.</li>
            <li>There is little that can&#x27;t be accomplished with a regular razor and a pair of scissors.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;This is an awesome beard trimmer!  </li>
            <li> think this Styleshaver would be an excellent complement to any electric razor.</li>
            <li> Awesome product !!! .</li>
            <li> is that it is a very good trimming tool for my scruffy beard</li>
            <li> This is a very good beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like but it shaves, trims beards and body hair all with one razor, which is ideal.</li>
            <li> all work well for a beautiful finish</li>
            <li> charging cradle is exceptionally convenient, the best I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a couple of design issues that Norelco could address that would improve the Styleshaver greatly.  </li>
            <li> The Styleshaver works well and is a great design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it gave me a great and close shave even after two days growth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it looks and works great.</li>
            <li> For the 80 dollar price tag this is a great styler.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great and i use it to shape up my beard all the time.</li>
            <li> Amazing works perfect</li>
            <li> I am happy with how compact this unit is compared to others I have had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming, but doesn&#x27;t accomplish a shaving job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> All all around great product.</li>
            <li> , what would make this a great produce is the razor.  </li>
            <li> great features  </li>
            <li> Very nice shaver and style razor.</li>
            <li> It is very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Philips Norelco StyleRazor for a couple of months now, and it makes for a great trimmer, but as a good utility shaving tool, it&#x27;s not quite there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bright orange attachment/guard is a bit flimsy, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Does not excel at any department but performs good at (about 75%) at all.</li>
            <li> It does a fairly good job as a combo device.</li>
            <li> good charging station should be sturdy, permanent, and not trickle charge, someplace to rest your shaver when not in use, without wasting power or battery</li>
            <li> I liked the trimmer part of the unit and thought it cut just great.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is good, its gets the job done and is good for when im in a rush.</li>
            <li> good luck finding this model on Philips site if you are not a member of ClubPhilips, or in Europe).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summation, I consider the QS6140 a good styler but middling shaver.</li>
            <li> He even uses the trimming end to fix up his sideburns to keep them looking good between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good unit, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, when I spied the Philips Norelco Stylershaver, I thought it might be a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> but I still looked good.</li>
            <li> I suppose this shaver would be good if you needed to trim in a car on the way to a meeting or something and didn&#x27;t mind getting stubble on your shirt.  </li>
            <li> So I am going to continue to use it as a trimmer for my grandson, but it does not make a good shaver at all.</li>
            <li> good combo unit</li>
            <li> good product both shaver and trimmer are excellent and the charging of this product is very fast, i like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> The beard comb (beard and stubble) adapter would work great if one had 10 hairs per square inch, anything more forgetaboutit.</li>
            <li> Sure the stuff was great</li>
            <li> Now that is to say you will look good as the styling par does an amazing job making lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, its a well built and innovative product -- kudos for that Norelco!  </li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver end works pretty well, but the foil isn&#x27;t the best design.</li>
            <li> It does a phenomenal job of making pre-existing beards and mustaches tidy!</li>
            <li> again, not as close as a blade, but if i ever need a quick shave (i think it&#x27;d be ideal for camping trips), it would do well in pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall a really great product with really great features for a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I also found the detail trimmer handy for trimming around my moustache.  </li>
            <li> I liked that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s cordless</li>
            <li> Honestly, though, it performs as well as anything in the $40-80 shaver crowd.  </li>
            <li> A nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor works well and it looks nice</li>
            <li> There probably are cheaper trimmers that are just as effective, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this excellent Philips item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good， I love this one，its appearance looks so beautiful.</li>
            <li> Design:  3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:  5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:  4</li>
            <li> have been using a standalone trimmer from Norelco along with a manual razor for many years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;having said that, the phillips norelco sytle shaver is a competent shaver.  </li>
            <li> the foil razor end does a great job and gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> and I love having it all in one product.  </li>
            <li> They may have eliminated the charger input on the shaver to make the shaver more water resistant, but it&#x27;s not waterPROOF regardless, and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m planning to toss this thing in the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At age 63 I have now owned way too many razors of every type.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the trimmer for beard/mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver is MUCH better than the Remington I have been using.</li>
            <li> Maybe mechanical controls are more appropriate for a beard trimmer...</li>
            <li> like so many</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to spend over $100 to get a noticeably better shaver.  </li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t to say it was magic.  </li>
            <li> I love about this \\&quot;Styleshaver\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the way It works.</li>
            <li> Have not bought this product, but unless you are 100% sure you will like it</li>
            <li> For the price i thought it would perform better than the $25 trimmer it was replacing.</li>
            <li> Applying way more pressure than was comfortable;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I chose this for my husband who has close shaved hair on top of his head and prefers to have me do it at home rather than a barber.  </li>
            <li> all, we are pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have had better shavers but for it being both a trimmer and shaver</li>
            <li> So when you remove the guard you can rotate the head 180 degrees and gain more precision for sideburn trimming and shaping.</li>
            <li> This shaver/trimmer is just ok all the way around.</li>
            <li> I used it once and found it to be just ok.</li>
            <li> a styler - where I really hoped it was great -</li>
            <li> I love the idea that it has functionality on both ends and that the beard trimming can be adjusted with a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think toy razors cut better.  </li>
            <li> So at this point this shaver is nothing more than a glorified trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer, but the rest of the unit is lacking, and I can&#x27;t recommend it as a multi-purpose shaving tool.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> but then it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This more than meets the need for timing hair and beard.</li>
            <li> and I had to make many many passes to get the ones I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps others had a better experience.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is really cool and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> To be more precise on my rating</li>
            <li> charging stand is stylish, if that is important to you.</li>
            <li> The StyleRazor itself is light to use but had a respectable heft to tell me it&#x27;s got some guts in there and isn&#x27;t all plastic shell.  </li>
            <li> since tipping it over is so darn easy.</li>
            <li> is positioned to easily control the shaving end.</li>
            <li> It has a futuristic, slim and curved design though the body and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> And it is so easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>
            <li> It is also a flimsy dock, easily falls over when upright, and the shaver slips off the charging contacts when the item is lying</li>
            <li> Not so easy to work with it.</li>
            <li> It holds it&#x27;s charge well and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK shaver if you just want to quickly clean up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
            <li> The problem with this razor rests mostly on the drawbacks of this cool design.  </li>
            <li> My first  razor of the kind</li>
            <li> All in all, the trimmer is very nice and functional, but I have one major gripe with this product, and that is the charging functionality.</li>
            <li> The fully accessible head is easy to clean, unlike many trimmers which have all sorts of nooks and crannies for hair to accumulate in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fine hair trimmings get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> As a trimmer, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> have used the trimmer and it works fine for sideburns.</li>
            <li> However, there are better shavers out there if you are looking for a super close shave.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions that I have not addressed, please feel free to ask in the comments below.t.  </li>
            <li> If you have any questions that I have not addressed, please feel free to ask in the comments below.</li>
            <li> It is extremely comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> maybe someone else&#x27;s review will be able to tell you if that part of the device is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Remove the shaver cover for easy clean up when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the comb off the two heads are great for trimming around ears, sideburns, and the back along the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the best part of the device and possibly the redeeming feature that can convince you to by it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> There is no way I could fit in both an electric shaver and an electric beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Overall i am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> hey I have a 45 day risk free warrantee</li>
            <li> Is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> The styler has a front indicator light that will light up continuously when shaver is fully charged (50 min of shaving/styling time).  </li>
            <li> When the lithium ion battery dissipates to 10 min charge time remaining the indicator light will flash orange.  </li>
            <li> StyleShaver has been a welcome addition to my husband&#x27;s personal grooming product line-up.  </li>
            <li> He liked it so much i brought him one again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-LED light shows battery status</li>
            <li> the charge stand is attractive, the overall design of the style shaver could be improved&lt;br /&gt;-Takes</li>
            <li> /&gt;This, however, is a fantastic beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it to shave my body and personal grooming.</li>
            <li> This works great as a trimmer, and I can even get around his ears with such perfection.</li>
            <li> When I saw this Model I liked very When buying him I did not regret it</li>
            <li> I found this unit to be very handy: It feels very sturdy in your hand and feels very well-made.  </li>
            <li> All in one with a charge that lasts a long time, I found this is a great product for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure for those looking for perfection it would be all that impressive.</li>
            <li> even if the charging time is much longer; this would encourage me to travel with a shaver and really get used to relying on a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a razor, I would sadly give this a 2 star rating at BEST (1 star to be brutally honest)....</li>
            <li> It works quietly, cleanly, and gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> The battery life has been excellent so far, with several weeks of use between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing particularly special, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also great for side burns, however it&#x27;s not capable of doing a close shave.</li>
            <li> I use setting 5 which creates a neatly trimmed yet still full beard.  </li>
            <li> It never quite gets blade close, but it looks passable which is good enough for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> It never quite gets blade close, but it looks passable which is good enough for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer seems to work well, and overall the product does have a good quality feel to it.  </li>
            <li> The beard trimmer on the flip side of this device is every bit as good as the Remington trimmer, though the controls are not digital.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it is a solidly constructed, substantial feeling unit and feels good in your hand.  </li>
            <li> even at the highest speed true shaving is tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone who attempts to keep a well trimmed yet fairly full beard, I&#x27;ve gone through my share of beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a good piece of personal hygiene equipment.  </li>
            <li> It takes several passes to get a good trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fit right on the counter, and having a charger means I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries like I do with my nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> The downside which has been mentioned in other reveiws is the shaver is not all that great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a blade guy but for a quick shave or trim I do like the convenience of an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the Norelco is a snap using the included mini-brush and a quick rinse under tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning the Norelco is a snap using the included mini-brush and a quick rinse under tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges quickly too.</li>
            <li> , the QS6140 does not feature a quick charge option.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the included brush works well for this.</li>
            <li> While I have tried electric razors in the past, I have never found that they give me a very good shave.  </li>
            <li> first and shaver last because like many multi-purposed devices, some functions are less impressive than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very neat looking and also with easy handling and maneuverability.</li>
            <li> My old unit was a corded one, and it&#x27;s awesome to not be tied down or get tangled up in that cord</li>
            <li> My fairly inexpensive, three round head shaver does a much better job at a clean shave and the trimmer isn&#x27;t working for me very well at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That alone is worth a lot to me.</li>
            <li> It also had a primitive trimmer attachment that would be ok to completely remove a beard, but not to trim it.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The rubber grips on the outside are a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li> In fairness (?) I&#x27;ve never had success with foil razors, but I hadn&#x27;t tried one for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li> The shaver end of the device left me with a very patchy shave as well as fairly sore</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a great deal of success with any foil models I&#x27;ve tried as in each case they tended to pale in comparison to rotary head models  for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most important to me with this product is the in MY life, Norelco products have outlasted all the other brands by a huge margin.</li>
            <li> There are some grips on the side of the cover to release it easily, but a quick grab and pull ends up with the blades exposed and old clippings falling out when you may not expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the attachment removed, it creates a clean straight edge at the bottom of the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very easy to switch between the ten length settings.</li>
            <li> But I really feel it&#x27;s true value is with beard</li>
            <li> It was VERY VERY misleading.</li>
            <li> can use from it very fast and without ache</li>
            <li> As a shaver, there are many other alternatives available to attain a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> handled it pretty well.  </li>
            <li> First thing first:  </li>
            <li> I had a simple shaver from philips, and this ones does the job even better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Norelco QS6140/41 is an appropriately priced shaver/styler that meets the appropriated priced expectations for facial hair maintenance.</li>

            <li> My wife was joking that, first the first time in our marriage, my face was smoother than hers is.  </li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver and trimmer.</li>
            <li> The instruction booklet suggests strands longer than 10mm should be trimmed first</li>
            <li> /&gt;Subsequent daily use after the first attempt was better but it still took longer than I customarily take with a multi-blade or safety razor.  </li>
            <li> The back end of trimming head has a precision detail trimmer for areas where greater concern must be devoted like, under nose, around mouth, sideburns.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what he had been hoping to find for trimming his beard and mustache, so he wouldn&#x27;t have to shave it off as often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In comparison to a host of electronic shavers, it is not all that remarkable, meeting rudimentary needs but failing to provide the level of efficiency I have found with numerable competitive models and for my preferences, not nearly as effective as most double edge razors.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer worked extremely well and the dial settings were a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Manual shaving irritates my face so much that I can only do it twice a week at most.  </li>
            <li> As days went by I was missing more and more hairs making it more difficult to effectively shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the shave does not work on my beard, my hair much just grow funny.  </li>
            <li> And I loved the rotating head that gave you a fine-tuner along with a big flat shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had good luck in the past with adjustable guard trimmers, but this one works quite well.</li>
            <li> shaver seems good, but I don&#x27;t use it very much so it ends up being pretty much dead weight as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Styleshaver is an average shaver with smooth looks that get in the way of delivering a smooth shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall this device is a superior option to buying multiple devices AND it does each task better than other single-function devices I have used before.</li>
            <li> For styling and trimming a beard to certain shapes and angles is where this works.</li>
            <li> But he kept shaving it off when it got to a certain point, because the tools he had didn&#x27;t allow him to groom it evenly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, and if you are finicky you might want to stick with the regular razor, but as a day to day maintenance advice it lets me be just a little bit more lazy.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, and if you are finicky you might want to stick with the regular razor, but as a day to day maintenance advice it lets me be just a little bit more lazy.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased several razors in the past and this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> With a little practice, I can lay it right in the charging cradle sweet spot in one smooth motion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little less impressed that it needed a four-hour charge for a 30 minutes of shaving, but it came charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I must have been in need of new blades on my old one for quite a while because the Styleshaver trimmed significantly better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> It is rather flimsy, and it would take much of a bump to knock it over while</li>
            <li> The results were much cleaner than what I was used to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i also have a goatee and sideburns and the opposite end of the sytleshaver is for advanced grooming.</li>
            <li> It really does shine there (for me anyway).</li>
            <li> I get very close shaves that are almost comparable to a razor shave.</li>
            <li> The motor also was very inconsistent...</li>
            <li> If one desires to compromise to limit the number of appliances lined up in the bathroom, it&#x27;s a reasonable choice</li>
            <li> but I will continue to use another grooming set with a wider selection of attachments and either a manual razor or under some conditions, one of my assortment of rotary head shavers.d up in the bathroom, it&#x27;s a reasonable choice</li>
            <li> The picture that represent&#x27;s a man styling his beard is very MISLEADING.</li>
            <li> really likes that there is just one guard on the trimming end, with adjustments in desired hair length being made by a dial.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> Be detailed and specific what would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product&lt;</li>
            <li> As my beard grows very rapidly and this helps me contain it quite well.</li>
            <li> handle is very hand-friendly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this razor.</li>
            <li> The item feels nice in your hands and is a bit on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> Not very expensive either.</li>
            <li> I only trim my beard once a week, and I ensure that I charge right before and right after.  </li>

            <li> I do still find it difficult to get a good clean edge along my beard on one side.  </li>
            <li> This is an interesting concept -- shaver on one end, trimmer on the other.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a gillette manual razor but really liked the idea for this razor.  </li>
            <li> The same is true with this piece of JUNK,</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s easy for the styleshaver to slip out), you have to rest it carefully against something.  </li>
            <li> I previously switched from shaving full-time with a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo to shaving most of the time with a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> If you wish this to be a beard trimmer it will make you have less a beard and more of a lot of scruf.</li>
            <li> Even when I fully adjusted, there were problem areas such as my lower neck that I could not shave adequately.</li>
            <li> in particular is that it is a multi-tasker.  </li>
            <li> A quick hit with a disposable razor was needed to get back to ground zero.</li>
            <li> have what many people would call a goatee, though the proper term for it is actually a van dyke (goatee with connecting moustache).  </li>
            <li> The four hour charge time makes this highly impractical, and I would recommend users change it after every use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a need for both a trimmer and a razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a need for both a trimmer and a razor.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.mend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Id highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it</li>
            <li> a nice, tight, clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the orange \\&quot;frontal guard\\&quot; is bulky and not particularly useful.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to lengthen the trimmer a little bit more though.</li>
            <li> The guard is so finicky and badly designed that you have to get a perfect angle to make any cut.</li>
            <li> I have a $20 Remington that works just as well and has a normal charging option.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have with it, is that if you let your beard grow a bit between trims, the trimmings build up quite fast in the guard and have to be swept out fairly often for it to continue trimming.</li>
            <li> I normally use a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;He has found that not only is the trimmed facial hair looking even and clean, but he&#x27;s also not having the itchiness that comes at a certain point when the hair is growing out.  </li>
            <li> Overall as a trimmer the Styleshaver is a nice improvement over previous Norelco products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you are going to use it to completely shave your beard off you might want to get a different razor, but if you want to keep your beard trimmed at a certain length, I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This led to an obvious challenge on my first shave with the Styleshaver since it is designed to work with stubble not hair.  </li>
            <li> This led to an obvious challenge on my first shave with the Styleshaver since it is designed to work with stubble not hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the concept makes sense, but it is interesting and it&#x27;s well executed.</li>
            <li> This one surprised me!  </li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s big.</li>
            <li> Since I shaved first, and then turned the device upside-down, I made a big mess as the fine hair shavings fell out of the shaver foils while trimming my goatee.  </li>
            <li> I would go over my head 5 or 6 times for a smooth cut, and under my neck was a mess...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a full charge for this model takes 4 hours Unlike some other models</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trim side is much better, easily to adjust and dual sided with a wide trim with the guard as well as a thin trim for use with the guard removed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have epic amounts of storage space in my bathroom, which is already chock full of electric toothbrushes, contact supplies, glasses cases, and other day-to-day maintenance items.  </li>
            <li> The little light on the front comes on to tell me that I&#x27;ve got it on the contacts, and off I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty minor, and I am probably the only one who really notices anyway.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty minor, and I am probably the only one who really notices anyway.  </li>
            <li> , that means I have THREE shaving products - The Remington foil shaver for day-to-day, the Gillette Mach 3 to shave problem areas or for days when I need a really close shave, and finally the Remington trimmer for, well, trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> therefore if this unit is allowed to completely drain you&#x27;ll just have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a close hair cut (and evening out the back of the hair), this works very well.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Professional Bodygrooming System, Black/Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for me, I can only use the beard trim on the Styleshaver, and I like it because the \\&quot;1\\&quot; on this shaver is much much much closer that the \\&quot;1\\&quot; on the bodygrooming system.</li>
            <li> it allows him to shape his facial hair the way he wants.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve gone electric, I&#x27;ve used the type with three rotating heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying to shave with this thing, I had to pull out my real electric razor and actually shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a professional quality trimmer for years</li>
            <li> I have no such patience; give me a real razor and shave to the skin.  </li>
            <li> old grandson&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> old son asked if he could use the shaver, and he said that he didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it was difficult to get a good edge with my beard.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that it was difficult to get a good edge with my beard.  </li>
            <li> With the comb on, the depth is adjustable by simply turning the dial right above the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> This is one of those clever ideas I am surprised isn&#x27;t universal.  </li>
            <li> He said he uses this side occasionally when he&#x27;s in a real hurry and doesn&#x27;t have time for a blade, but generally he still prefers using a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-priced a bit high for its current quality</li>
            <li> Very useful with long battery life, it was hard on skin at first</li>
            <li> the shaver is not active and when using the shaver, the clipper is not active.</li>
            <li> and I went back to use my old (20+ years old)</li>
            <li> but I did have a major amount of chafing.  </li>
            <li> It has two trimmers (one for general use and one for finer detail) in addition to the razor.  </li>
            <li> I generally go low-tech.  </li>
            <li> The AC adapter plugs into the back of the cradle, but it cannot directly plug into the shaver.  </li>
            <li> However, after shaving with the QS6140 for about two weeks, I am switching back to the old rotary one I had.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the &#x27;beard trimmer&#x27; and it barely got any of the hairs</li>
            <li> When I changed the guard to the lowest one they had it still barely managed to get any of the hairs.</li>
            <li> To be honest it failed about every test I gave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting while I consider it excessively over -packaged, at least the clam shell case is easily opened without scissors or knife.  </li>
            <li> I love this tool because the trimmer is small enough to really negotiate the tight spots under my lip and, actually, all around the perimeter for the beard.  </li>
            <li> I typically keep a neatly trimmed circle goatee, but I prefer to shave my face first every morning, and then trim around the goatee area.  </li>
            <li> QS6140 foil shaver seems adequate for removal of stubble growth of not more than three days.</li>
            <li> i suppose there&#x27;s a universal code for setting/lengths as the styleshaver set to \\&quot;4\\&quot; give me the same length as my old groomer set to level</li>
            <li> (I think it is measured in horsepower) and the guides that go with it are thin, and provide enough of an opening to do an effective job; the StyleRazor&#x27;s guide is thick, clumsy, and doesn&#x27;t give you effective</li>
            <li> It is a regular foil razor but at the other end is a large and medium size groomer.  </li>
            <li> It does an adequate job, but, frankly, not better than the razor I mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> The head of the trimmer is double sided and much narrower on the other side.</li>
            <li> If that weren&#x27;t enough, the other end of the trimmer is a very serviceable foil razor.</li>
            <li> i have a fairly full, thick beard and the styleshaver</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very sharp and cuts very well.  </li>
            <li> This is so much easier than keeping up with various guards that are all spilling around in a drawer with a bunch of his other personal stuff.  </li>
            <li> Main reason I bought was due to the adjustable height to trim the beard only.</li>
            <li> Additionally, while performance factors appear to be identical, there is a more expensive model QS6160 with a more convenient one hour charging cycle, storage pouch and a few other convenience features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped with a partial charge, it is recommended to fully charge before initial use.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by making it clear my rating of this product is based on how I feel it performs compared to single purposed personal grooming devices.</li>
            <li> For more than 40 years I&#x27;ve been using the rotary technology from the Philips shaver to shave and thought that this &#x27;new&#x27; system would make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The disappointment is big</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard; there was no way that this cheap piece of junk could style my beard.</li>
            <li> There is little that can&#x27;t be accomplished with a regular razor and a pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li> For starters, the charging cradle is more annoying than useful.  </li>
            <li> The charging base isn&#x27;t good for a permanent station because it won&#x27;t easily stay up by itself and it&#x27;s not good for portability because why should I carry it around along with the charger?  </li>
            <li> bought the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to go back to using a traditional flat headed / three blade Norleco, however I am going to keep this as a companion / pre shave device.</li>
            <li> so I can do his hair instead of taking him to a barber until he gets a little older.</li>
            <li> Well I gave it several more tries and either had several splotches that were entirely missed or just got frustrated with how much LONGER it took than using a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The resulting product is a little on the large side which is really the only negative -- hence I give 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be a one stop solution for having a decent close shave and for smartening up if I&#x27;ve not had chance to shave for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> charger is an awkward mess which in itself is enough to ruin an otherwise good</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never had much luck in the past with electric razors.</li>
            <li> I remember when Japan first flooded the US market with their junk late 50s.</li>
            <li> The thin side works great for those small delicate areas such as nose, ear, eyebrow, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; One is too big for me - I have a goatee and stach - the other is still too big for work around the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not an uncomfortable shave, but it never did get me quite as smooth as my triple-head razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hope its battery can be used for long time</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard, but this razor handled the overnight growth on my face just fine, but it had a tough time on my neck, so I had to go over my neck a number of times.  </li>
            <li> The other change I would make is to the aforementioned stand.  </li>
            <li> Really bigger than any other shaver/trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> ; unfortunately, I find that the precision trimmer and the clean shaver head just aren&#x27;t performing to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Then again, I have had to re-boot the Remington trimmer more than a few times and that&#x27;s just wrong.</li>
            <li> then tried to simply shave with it after a few days of letting my hair grow back.</li>
            <li> Shaving the limited areas that I need to on a single charge for the remainder of the week is not a problem as this amounts to about five minutes of use per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving the limited areas that I need to on a single charge for the remainder of the week is not a problem as this amounts to about five minutes of use per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had given up on multi-function trimmers as they never seemed to work as well as single purpose</li>
            <li> have a pure hate relationship with shaving, and that is why I wear a full beard all year long.  </li>
            <li> While this may be somewhat awkward since there is not an open end (with the trimmer on one and the razor on the other), it is really not user friendly to have the device only chargeable in its stand.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the point when he would usually shave it all off, but he hasn&#x27;t done so nearly as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That means if you run out of juice in the middle of using it, you have to stop down and charge it.  </li>
            <li> I have stopped keeping it on the sink and moved it to a shelf over the toilet (with lid CLOSED!)</li>
            <li> Nor was there any mention in the very limited page of instructions on how to make the razor work.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over the same place over and over and use a little pressure to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I actually like the charger for the device, though it seems a little flimsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a single device that seems to do the job of all three of those other devices.</li>
            <li> so I have to stop frequently to empty them out.  </li>
            <li> My husband has taken a liking to growing in his beard and mustache from time to time in the last few years.  </li>
            <li> I fully expected it would, but it did not.  </li>
            <li> It does what it is expected to do.</li>
            <li> Most electronics that have a charging base have both a direct charger input and two metal contacts so that the product can charge via a more permanent base.  </li>
            <li> After three months of use, my razor no longer charged, and I honestly don&#x27;t know if its because the razor stopped working or if the docking base connectors stopped functioning.</li>
            <li> really slowing down and struggling when the going got tough.</li>
            <li> The other end is for grooming beards, gotees, sideburns etc.  </li>
            <li> The other drawback is the two-sided design of the shaver and trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Beard trimmer and sculptor on one end, foil shaver on the other.  </li>
            <li> This is another thing that usually takes up space, but the \\&quot;Styleshaver\\&quot; stand is tiny, yet sturdy.  </li>
            <li> One end of the shaver is a trimmer and the other a shaver.</li>
            <li> While this technique works quite well, it can be a little time-consuming ... and, sometimes, human error (when in a time-crunch) can cause a slightly uneven appearance.</li>
            <li> previous trimmer was also a Norelco, and I expected this perform well.  </li>
            <li> They are usually too expensive, and I have always heard that they don&#x27;t work as well as the tried and true</li>
            <li> Holy cow it takes up a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you can live with the clunky charging and unnecessary mess, the Norelco&#x27;s dial trimmer will not disappoint you.  </li>
            <li> If you can live with the clunky charging and unnecessary mess, the Norelco&#x27;s dial trimmer will not disappoint you.  </li>
            <li> Also the cover holds onto the foil piece better than it holds on to the base.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months and the results were what could be expected of a trimmer of this sort.</li>
            <li> since the charging mechanism is a bit odd</li>
            <li> So to me, there&#x27;s half of this thing</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it means less falling on shoulders and a cleaner area after the haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i brought this from amazon because the one we had previously got damaged and i couldn&#x27;t find one in the country we in they all sold out.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple positions and pressures, but this shaver always fails to properly shave the jaw/neck area.</li>
            <li> You previously purchased Model  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver itself is very average.  </li>
            <li> and the charger is one a huge base.</li>
            <li> But with the shortcomings mentioned above, I just can&#x27;t stand firmly behind this product.</li>
            <li> But as with virtually every item I ever owned in my life that \\&quot;does everything\\&quot;, it makes quite a few sacrifices along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charger base is a cheap feeling surprise to me given the price of this.</li>
            <li> This is no cheap plastic trimmer</li>
            <li> Additionally, while trimming my goatee, the trimmer itself shoots facial hairs out like they were bullets from a Contra game</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for decades now, and although I have worked my way through a few electronic beard trimmers in my time (they always break eventually)</li>
            <li> They shaver was definitely uneven, and I had to look close to go over some spots again, but for ease of use</li>
            <li> Then found out the 45 day risk free warrantee is worthless since they can&#x27;t seem to email, snail mail, or fax a form to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY</li>
            <li> However, I feel that the blade gets blunt after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the fact that I can&#x27;t use it if the battery is dead, since this requires you to place it on a stand for charging.</li>
            <li> not a huge deal, but it would be an improvement.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what all the other people are complaint about</li>
            <li> /&gt;The foil head screen holes are too small to efficiently cut coarser strands.  </li>
            <li> Fourth time I used it the adjustable trimmer side broke leaving it useless.  </li>
            <li> me my small beard trimmer with the double-AA batteries and a manual razor any day over this.</li>
            <li> The neck area issue makes this (relatively expensive) shaver pretty much useless to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total Chinese quality and made pics of crap.</li>
            <li> short:  poorly designed and poorly executed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick and hard to work over your beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric shavers in my life, but I think this Norelco is probably the one that at least looks the coolest.  </li>
            <li> Another negative is that the shaver must be charged in the cradle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The foil razor part is just not effective, at least not for me.  </li>
            <li> But the blue strip was buried underneath where it was almost impossible to reach.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a really tough beard</li>
            <li> It shows a man with a very thick beard.</li>
            <li> Part of this may be from not being used to using the Styleshaver, but I had a difficult time getting up to the edge without getting into my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Part of this may be from not being used to using the Styleshaver, but I had a difficult time getting up to the edge without getting into my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It simply fails as anything but an emergency razor for my face.</li>
            <li> QS6140/41 Styleshaver\\&quot; I was skeptical but wanted to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The trimmer does a terrible job at a moderately short setting.</li>
            <li> It failed again.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a blissfully small charger, but the shaver itself has no charger input except via the charging base.  </li>
            <li> This shaver yields a drastically close trim (but nit shave) without actually cutting too close.</li>
            <li> He is afraid of the barber, so I decided to get this</li>
            <li> Awful hard to rate an item that&#x27;s use it so subjective.</li>
            <li> Impossible to know.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The myth of the electric razor is just a myth, and I was shocked at how close a shave I got with this \\&quot;Styleshaver.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> There is no plug that goes into the razor, instead it is charged via a flimsy docking base that is very difficult to get to stay in one place.</li>
            <li> It mangled my beard, was disappointed by figured</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Design:  3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:  5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:  4 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a standalone trimmer from Norelco along with a manual razor for many years.  While I have tried electric razors in the past, I have never found that they give me a very good shave.  What follows are my impressions after having used the Styleshaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of design issues that Norelco could address that would improve the Styleshaver greatly.  While this may be somewhat awkward since there is not an open end (with the trimmer on one and the razor on the other), it is really not user friendly to have the device only chargeable in its stand.  That means if you run out of juice in the middle of using it, you have to stop down and charge it.  The four hour charge time makes this highly impractical, and I would recommend users change it after every use.  The other change I would make is to the aforementioned stand.  It is rather flimsy, and it would take much of a bump to knock it over while charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for features, Norelco hit it out of the park.  It has two trimmers (one for general use and one for finer detail) in addition to the razor.  When you include the beard comb and 10 settings, the Styleshaver is a versatile grooming tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous trimmer was also a Norelco, and I expected this perform well.  I must have been in need of new blades on my old one for quite a while because the Styleshaver trimmed significantly better than my old one.  I use setting 5 which creates a neatly trimmed yet still full beard.  I also found the detail trimmer handy for trimming around my moustache.  The results were much cleaner than what I was used to.  Overall as a trimmer the Styleshaver is a nice improvement over previous Norelco products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pure hate relationship with shaving, and that is why I wear a full beard all year long.  Manual shaving irritates my face so much that I can only do it twice a week at most.  This led to an obvious challenge on my first shave with the Styleshaver since it is designed to work with stubble not hair.  I finished up with my manual razor because there was no way I was going to get anything satisfactory otherwise.  I did notice that it was difficult to get a good edge with my beard.  Part of this may be from not being used to using the Styleshaver, but I had a difficult time getting up to the edge without getting into my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In subsequent shaves I found the closeness of the shave improved to a satisfactory point.  It never quite gets blade close, but it looks passable which is good enough for my purposes.  I do still find it difficult to get a good clean edge along my beard on one side.  It is pretty minor, and I am probably the only one who really notices anyway.  As for charging I find that twice a week does the trick.  I only trim my beard once a week, and I ensure that I charge right before and right after.  Shaving the limited areas that I need to on a single charge for the remainder of the week is not a problem as this amounts to about five minutes of use per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a need for both a trimmer and a razor.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  If you have any questions that I have not addressed, please feel free to ask in the comments below.t.

            <li> Pretty good， I love this one，its appearance looks so beautiful. I hope its battery can be used for long time</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never had much luck in the past with electric razors. for my money, nothing can beat the closeness of a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;having said that, the phillips norelco sytle shaver is a competent shaver.  i have a fairly full, thick beard and the styleshaver handled it pretty well.  again, not as close as a blade, but if i ever need a quick shave (i think it&#x27;d be ideal for camping trips), it would do well in pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also have a goatee and sideburns and the opposite end of the sytleshaver is for advanced grooming. the bright orange attachment/guard is a bit flimsy, but it does the job.  i suppose there&#x27;s a universal code for setting/lengths as the styleshaver set to \\&quot;4\\&quot; give me the same length as my old groomer set to level \\&quot;4.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the one thing i wish this device had is a wall mount or pedastal.  since the charging mechanism is a bit odd (it&#x27;s easy for the styleshaver to slip out), you have to rest it carefully against something.  not a huge deal, but it would be an improvement.</li>
            <li> I usually use a gillette manual razor but really liked the idea for this razor.  It is a regular foil razor but at the other end is a large and medium size groomer.  the foil razor end does a great job and gives a really close shave.  The other end is for grooming beards, gotees, sideburns etc.  and is a neat addition to the regular foil razor. Both ends do what they are supposed to and I love having it all in one product.  Overall a really great product with really great features for a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Does not excel at any department but performs good at (about 75%) at all. It does a fairly good job as a combo device. You may want to give a second thought though if you are intending to replace a dedicated device.</li>
            <li> First thing first:  I hate the charger setup on this product.  Most electronics that have a charging base have both a direct charger input and two metal contacts so that the product can charge via a more permanent base.  This shaver has a blissfully small charger, but the shaver itself has no charger input except via the charging base.  Why, God, why?  The charging base isn&#x27;t good for a permanent station because it won&#x27;t easily stay up by itself and it&#x27;s not good for portability because why should I carry it around along with the charger?  They may have eliminated the charger input on the shaver to make the shaver more water resistant, but it&#x27;s not waterPROOF regardless, and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m planning to toss this thing in the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is an awkward mess which in itself is enough to ruin an otherwise good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would personally like to see shavers that can charge via micro USB, even if the charging time is much longer; this would encourage me to travel with a shaver and really get used to relying on a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good charging station should be sturdy, permanent, and not trickle charge, someplace to rest your shaver when not in use, without wasting power or battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it a four if it were just the charger; unfortunately, I find that the precision trimmer and the clean shaver head just aren&#x27;t performing to my expectations.  My fairly inexpensive, three round head shaver does a much better job at a clean shave and the trimmer isn&#x27;t working for me very well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer seems to work well, and overall the product does have a good quality feel to it.  But with the shortcomings mentioned above, I just can&#x27;t stand firmly behind this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver and style razor. I had a simple shaver from philips, and this ones does the job even better. Main reason I bought was due to the adjustable height to trim the beard only.</li>
            <li> At age 63 I have now owned way too many razors of every type. But the only type I never owned was any Norelco with a foil head! Well sort of anyway. As a groomer/trimmer/shaver (of sorts on the shaver part), this should get 5 stars by way of being so versatile. But as with virtually every item I ever owned in my life that \\&quot;does everything\\&quot;, it makes quite a few sacrifices along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is extremely comfortable in my hand. I LOVE the trimmer for beard/mustache trimming. It really does shine there (for me anyway). For styling and trimming a beard to certain shapes and angles is where this works. As a razor, I would sadly give this a 2 star rating at BEST (1 star to be brutally honest)....And I definitely recommend you do not skip a day &amp; try this as a shaver or expect to feel like you are using an epilator (please, don&#x27;t ask...). And changing the settings did not help a bit here. It simply fails as anything but an emergency razor for my face. But I really feel it&#x27;s true value is with beard sculpting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The charger base is a cheap feeling surprise to me given the price of this. I have stopped keeping it on the sink and moved it to a shelf over the toilet (with lid CLOSED!) since tipping it over is so darn easy. I somehow just don&#x27;t feel the need to test my GFI breaker given all my life has already thrown at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  To be more precise on my rating I come up with the following:&lt;br /&gt;-Beard Trimming/shaping&#x3D;5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;-Shaver&#x3D;1 Star&lt;br /&gt;-Charger&#x3D;2 Minus&lt;br /&gt;-Overall&#x3D;3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;  I also ask that you remember we all have vastly different beards &amp; faces. It may be a 5 star all around for you or NO stars. Awful hard to rate an item that&#x27;s use it so subjective. Most important to me with this product is the in MY life, Norelco products have outlasted all the other brands by a huge margin. That alone is worth a lot to me.</li>
            <li> I found this unit to be very handy: It feels very sturdy in your hand and feels very well-made.  Well-constructed.  I liked that.  I liked the trimmer part of the unit and thought it cut just great.  It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s cordless so you can move it all around and not get tangled up.  My old unit was a corded one, and it&#x27;s awesome to not be tied down or get tangled up in that cord anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for the shaver part, but I&#x27;ve never been one for electric razors.  I remember trying them on and off when I was younger, but they all just never work as well as a blade.  So to me, there&#x27;s half of this thing I&#x27;ll never use right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any qualms with the charging unit or length of use between charges.  I just stick it on the charging base when I&#x27;m done with it anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a neat idea, I just don&#x27;t like electric razors-  maybe someone else&#x27;s review will be able to tell you if that part of the device is worth it.  I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> Excellent like others phillip&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like but it shaves, trims beards and body hair all with one razor, which is ideal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a blade guy but for a quick shave or trim I do like the convenience of an electric shaver. The Styleshaver works well and is a great design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold it like a shaver and the button is positioned to easily control the shaving end. I don&#x27;t have a really tough beard but it gave me a great and close shave even after two days growth. Remove the shaver cover for easy clean up when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn it around and you now have two different sizes of trimmers simply by rotating the head. The larger trimmer also includes a \\&quot;comb\\&quot; for running the trimmer through your beard. With the comb on, the depth is adjustable by simply turning the dial right above the on/off switch. With the comb off the two heads are great for trimming around ears, sideburns, and the back along the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue is the charging stand isn&#x27;t that sturdy you will want to keep it away from the edge of the counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it looks and works great. For the 80 dollar price tag this is a great styler.</li>
            <li> I previously switched from shaving full-time with a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo to shaving most of the time with a [[ASIN:B001DERRM6 Remington F4790 Pivot &amp; Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Foil Shaver]]. If you see my review for the Remington foil shaver, you will see that it took me a while to get the hang of it. Even when I fully adjusted, there were problem areas such as my lower neck that I could not shave adequately. It also had a primitive trimmer attachment that would be ok to completely remove a beard, but not to trim it. I ended up purchasing a [[ASIN:B005GIS3A0 Remington MB4550T Rechargeable Men&#x27;s Mustache and Beard Trimmer with Exclusive Touch Control]] to take care of trimming sideburns, and for those cases where I wanted the stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, that means I have THREE shaving products - The Remington foil shaver for day-to-day, the Gillette Mach 3 to shave problem areas or for days when I need a really close shave, and finally the Remington trimmer for, well, trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have the Philips Norelco QS6140 I have a single device that seems to do the job of all three of those other devices. The foil shaver is MUCH better than the Remington I have been using. I get very close shaves that are almost comparable to a razor shave. Interestingly enough the neck is no longer a problem area for me as this shaver cuts the hairs there. The beard trimmer on the flip side of this device is every bit as good as the Remington trimmer, though the controls are not digital. Then again, I have had to re-boot the Remington trimmer more than a few times and that&#x27;s just wrong. Maybe mechanical controls are more appropriate for a beard trimmer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand is stylish, if that is important to you. I have been using it daily for a week and have not yet had to recharge it yet. Overall this device is a superior option to buying multiple devices AND it does each task better than other single-function devices I have used before. I highly recommend this shaver.mend this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting concept -- shaver on one end, trimmer on the other.  The resulting product is a little on the large side which is really the only negative -- hence I give 4 stars.  On the plus side, it is a solidly constructed, substantial feeling unit and feels good in your hand.  This is no cheap plastic trimmer like so many I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this is that it is a very good trimming tool for my scruffy beard, it&#x27;s very sharp and cuts very well.  The fully accessible head is easy to clean, unlike many trimmers which have all sorts of nooks and crannies for hair to accumulate in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging cradle is exceptionally convenient, the best I&#x27;ve seen.  With a little practice, I can lay it right in the charging cradle sweet spot in one smooth motion.  The little light on the front comes on to tell me that I&#x27;ve got it on the contacts, and off I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver seems good, but I don&#x27;t use it very much so it ends up being pretty much dead weight as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a well built and innovative product -- kudos for that Norelco!  I&#x27;m not sure that the concept makes sense, but it is interesting and it&#x27;s well executed.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QS6140/41 Styleshaver is an average shaver with smooth looks that get in the way of delivering a smooth shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric shavers in my life, but I think this Norelco is probably the one that at least looks the coolest.  It has a futuristic, slim and curved design though the body and is easy to hold.  The problem with this razor rests mostly on the drawbacks of this cool design.  For starters, the charging cradle is more annoying than useful.  It folds out in a flimsy way and when it&#x27;s holding the shaver the entire unit is rather wobbly.  Another negative is that the shaver must be charged in the cradle.  The AC adapter plugs into the back of the cradle, but it cannot directly plug into the shaver.  Having to carry the extra cradle piece around during travel is a nuisance.  The other drawback is the two-sided design of the shaver and trimmer.  I typically keep a neatly trimmed circle goatee, but I prefer to shave my face first every morning, and then trim around the goatee area.  Well, I used this same routine with the Norelco.  Since I shaved first, and then turned the device upside-down, I made a big mess as the fine hair shavings fell out of the shaver foils while trimming my goatee.  The shaver can be rinsed with tap water, but you cannot shave in the shower with the device.  The fine hair trimmings get everywhere.  Additionally, while trimming my goatee, the trimmer itself shoots facial hairs out like they were bullets from a Contra game spread gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is very average.  Honestly, though, it performs as well as anything in the $40-80 shaver crowd.  You&#x27;ll have to spend over $100 to get a noticeably better shaver.  I am, however, a big fan of the \\&quot;dial-a-length\\&quot; trimmer.  This is by far the best part of the device and possibly the redeeming feature that can convince you to by it.  The dial sets up the trimmer with 1-3 mm lengths in 0.5 mm increments, and then 4-10 mm in 1 mm increments.  Cleaning the Norelco is a snap using the included mini-brush and a quick rinse under tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Norelco QS6140/41 is an appropriately priced shaver/styler that meets the appropriated priced expectations for facial hair maintenance. If you can live with the clunky charging and unnecessary mess, the Norelco&#x27;s dial trimmer will not disappoint you.  But if those facets bother you, and you don&#x27;t care about the dial mechanism, then I might suggest checking out the braun cruzer line instead.crements.

            <li> good product both shaver and trimmer are excellent and the charging of this product is very fast, i like&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco All-in-one styler QS 6140</li>
            <li> Yes, it is really cool and very easy to use. And my roommate want  to  buy one！Aha，My beard，sentence to death！</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for decades now, and although I have worked my way through a few electronic beard trimmers in my time (they always break eventually) I generally go low-tech.  There is little that can&#x27;t be accomplished with a regular razor and a pair of scissors.  I have never even tried an electric razor before.  They are usually too expensive, and I have always heard that they don&#x27;t work as well as the tried and true razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I got this \\&quot;Philips Norelco QS6140/41 Styleshaver\\&quot; I was skeptical but wanted to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic.  The myth of the electric razor is just a myth, and I was shocked at how close a shave I got with this \\&quot;Styleshaver.\\&quot;  My wife was joking that, first the first time in our marriage, my face was smoother than hers is.  And it is so easy. Which isn&#x27;t to say it was magic.  They shaver was definitely uneven, and I had to look close to go over some spots again, but for ease of use it is worth it. Consider me sold on the electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this \\&quot;Styleshaver\\&quot; in particular is that it is a multi-tasker.  I don&#x27;t have epic amounts of storage space in my bathroom, which is already chock full of electric toothbrushes, contact supplies, glasses cases, and other day-to-day maintenance items.  There is no way I could fit in both an electric shaver and an electric beard trimmer. Having this combo device is perfect.  This is one of those clever ideas I am surprised isn&#x27;t universal.  Beard trimmer and sculptor on one end, foil shaver on the other.  Just flip it around.  And I loved the rotating head that gave you a fine-tuner along with a big flat shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the charging stand.  This is another thing that usually takes up space, but the \\&quot;Styleshaver\\&quot; stand is tiny, yet sturdy.  It fit right on the counter, and having a charger means I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries like I do with my nose hair trimmer. A nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I give big thumbs up to the \\&quot;Styleshaver.\\&quot;  It isn&#x27;t perfect, and if you are finicky you might want to stick with the regular razor, but as a day to day maintenance advice it lets me be just a little bit more lazy.  And isn&#x27;t that what electronics are for?he \\&quot;Styleshaver.\\&quot;  It isn&#x27;t perfect, and if you are finicky you might want to stick with the regular razor, but as a day to day maintenance advice it lets me be just a little bit more lazy.

            <li> This is a very good beard trimmer. If you are going to use it to completely shave your beard off you might want to get a different razor, but if you want to keep your beard trimmed at a certain length, I would highly recommend this!</li>

            <li> This was my first electric shaver and trimmer. The trimmer is great and i use it to shape up my beard all the time. The shaver is good, its gets the job done and is good for when im in a rush. However, there are better shavers out there if you are looking for a super close shave. Overall i am happy with this product. I wish there was a way to lengthen the trimmer a little bit more though. The max setting is 10, sometimes i like a longer beard.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, and excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> I have been used it for 2 years and I&#x27;m pleased with the way It works.</li>
            <li> Have not bought this product, but unless you are 100% sure you will like it I would not recommend buying it since Phillips Norelco return service is non existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro.  It mangled my beard, was disappointed by figured hey I have a 45 day risk free warrantee I will just return it.  Then found out the 45 day risk free warrantee is worthless since they can&#x27;t seem to email, snail mail, or fax a form to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
            <li> After trying numerous razors for a stubble beard and shaved head I was exited to try this razor. For the price i thought it would perform better than the $25 trimmer it was replacing. My mistake. The guard is so finicky and badly designed that you have to get a perfect angle to make any cut. I would go over my head 5 or 6 times for a smooth cut, and under my neck was a mess... The motor also was very inconsistent... really slowing down and struggling when the going got tough. The foil razor is an uncomfortable afterthought that looks nifty but is bitey and useless. I advise to stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> Buy for my father and he like it</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor. It is very handy. Shaves well. Is easy to clean and maintain. It charges quickly too.</li>
            <li> Amazing works perfect</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by making it clear my rating of this product is based on how I feel it performs compared to single purposed personal grooming devices. It&#x27;s not an accident this product is referred to as a styler first and shaver last because like many multi-purposed devices, some functions are less impressive than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to a host of electronic shavers, it is not all that remarkable, meeting rudimentary needs but failing to provide the level of efficiency I have found with numerable competitive models and for my preferences, not nearly as effective as most double edge razors.  Conversely, the trimming head end with precision styling blade works well. If researching viable options for beard and moustache trimming alone, this model would be a consideration.  Additionally, while performance factors appear to be identical, there is a more expensive model QS6160 with a more convenient one hour charging cycle, storage pouch and a few other convenience features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped with a partial charge, it is recommended to fully charge before initial use. It&#x27;s worth noting while I consider it excessively over -packaged, at least the clam shell case is easily opened without scissors or knife.  The styler has a front indicator light that will light up continuously when shaver is fully charged (50 min of shaving/styling time).  When the lithium ion battery dissipates to 10 min charge time remaining the indicator light will flash orange.  Unfortunately a full charge for this model takes 4 hours Unlike some other models, the QS6140 does not feature a quick charge option. The power cord is attached to the charging stand rather than the styler therefore if this unit is allowed to completely drain you&#x27;ll just have to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other features are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Water resistant heads.  Cleanable by placing under running tap water&lt;br /&gt;-Overload protection if shaving heads become blocked.&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable grip&lt;br /&gt;-Charging Stand&lt;br /&gt;-Two year warranty extendable to by 6 months if registered online (but good luck finding this model on Philips site if you are not a member of ClubPhilips, or in Europe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QS6140 foil shaver seems adequate for removal of stubble growth of not more than three days. So for those who shave on a daily basis it could be a viable alternative. The manufacturer also recommends yearly replacement of the foil head. When I received it, I attempted to shave a five day accumulation and ended up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Applying way more pressure than was comfortable;&lt;br /&gt;2) Going over the same facial areas five or six times;&lt;br /&gt;3) Feeling irritation from the foil scrapping across the skin and finally;&lt;br /&gt;4) Giving up, slapping on some shaving cream and pulling out the Gillette fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil head screen holes are too small to efficiently cut coarser strands.  The instruction booklet suggests strands longer than 10mm should be trimmed first however I have reservations whether any amount of trimming would improve performance of the foil end in that instance. As a shaver, there are many other alternatives available to attain a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent daily use after the first attempt was better but it still took longer than I customarily take with a multi-blade or safety razor.  Pulling is not a problem but I did have a major amount of chafing.  I haven&#x27;t had a great deal of success with any foil models I&#x27;ve tried as in each case they tended to pale in comparison to rotary head models  for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conjunction with the beard comb accessory, the trimming head can be set to 13 separate lengths  from .5mm to 10mm by adjusting a wheel on the shaver body.  The back end of trimming head has a precision detail trimmer for areas where greater concern must be devoted like, under nose, around mouth, sideburns. etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation, I consider the QS6140 a good styler but middling shaver. If one desires to compromise to limit the number of appliances lined up in the bathroom, it&#x27;s a reasonable choice but I will continue to use another grooming set with a wider selection of attachments and either a manual razor or under some conditions, one of my assortment of rotary head shavers.d up in the bathroom, it&#x27;s a reasonable choice but I will continue to use another grooming set with a wider selection of attachments and either a manual razor or under some conditions, one of my assortment of rotary head shavers.</li>
            <li> I chose this for my husband who has close shaved hair on top of his head and prefers to have me do it at home rather than a barber.  He also uses it for his beard but has noted that he still prefers a razor over any electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a close hair cut (and evening out the back of the hair), this works very well. Unlike our last shaver, it is fairly quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate overmuch.  Makes the process a bit easier as a result.  The shaver does hold in the cut hairs so I have to stop frequently to empty them out.  On the plus side, it means less falling on shoulders and a cleaner area after the haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the attachment removed, it creates a clean straight edge at the bottom of the hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, we are pleased with this shaver.  It works quietly, cleanly, and gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> All in one with a charge that lasts a long time, I found this is a great product for travel. Even for extended travel, the charger folds up and can go with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver end works pretty well, but the foil isn&#x27;t the best design. As days went by I was missing more and more hairs making it more difficult to effectively shave. A quick hit with a disposable razor was needed to get back to ground zero. Also the cover holds onto the foil piece better than it holds on to the base. So it seems I am often pulling the foil off of the unit when I just want to remove the cover. There are some grips on the side of the cover to release it easily, but a quick grab and pull ends up with the blades exposed and old clippings falling out when you may not expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trim side is much better, easily to adjust and dual sided with a wide trim with the guard as well as a thin trim for use with the guard removed. The thin side works great for those small delicate areas such as nose, ear, eyebrow, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth mentioning is that the unit has two power buttons, so when using the clipper the shaver is not active and when using the shaver, the clipper is not active. This keeps the unit quieter and safer.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B007VB50VA Philips Norelco QS6140/41 StyleRazor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The picture that represent&#x27;s a man styling his beard is very MISLEADING. It shows a man with a very thick beard. I have a very thick beard; there was no way that this cheap piece of junk could style my beard. How it was rated four stars is beyond belief. The beard comb (beard and stubble) adapter would work great if one had 10 hairs per square inch, anything more forgetaboutit. It was VERY VERY misleading. I tried it and it would not cut one hair while using the beard comb.&lt;br /&gt;  I remember when Japan first flooded the US market with their junk late 50s. Sure the stuff was great it one is 5&#x27;1&#x27;&#x27; and 105 lbs. The same is true with this piece of JUNK, if your oriental, have that type of facial hair, well, yea, it would probably work great.&lt;br /&gt;  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY (you will have to pay shipping to return it) buy something else. It&#x27;s like they say YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months and the results were what could be expected of a trimmer of this sort. I only used the trimmer, so I can only comment on the trimmer functionality. The trimmer worked extremely well and the dial settings were a nice touch. The item feels nice in your hands and is a bit on the heavy side. The rubber grips on the outside are a nice touch as well. All in all, the trimmer is very nice and functional, but I have one major gripe with this product, and that is the charging functionality. There is no plug that goes into the razor, instead it is charged via a flimsy docking base that is very difficult to get to stay in one place. After three months of use, my razor no longer charged, and I honestly don&#x27;t know if its because the razor stopped working or if the docking base connectors stopped functioning. Either way, I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it. I have a $20 Remington that works just as well and has a normal charging option. Philips definitely dropped the ball with this Razor.</li>
            <li> My husband has taken a liking to growing in his beard and mustache from time to time in the last few years.  But he kept shaving it off when it got to a certain point, because the tools he had didn&#x27;t allow him to groom it evenly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter: the Philips Norelco StyleShaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He really likes that there is just one guard on the trimming end, with adjustments in desired hair length being made by a dial.  This is so much easier than keeping up with various guards that are all spilling around in a drawer with a bunch of his other personal stuff.  He even uses the trimming end to fix up his sideburns to keep them looking good between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has found that not only is the trimmed facial hair looking even and clean, but he&#x27;s also not having the itchiness that comes at a certain point when the hair is growing out.  That&#x27;s the point when he would usually shave it all off, but he hasn&#x27;t done so nearly as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the foil shaving side, he has never cared for foil shavers, and this one is no exception.  They all  irritate his skin during use.  He said he uses this side occasionally when he&#x27;s in a real hurry and doesn&#x27;t have time for a blade, but generally he still prefers using a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s had this for almost 4 months.  The battery life has been excellent so far, with several weeks of use between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The StyleShaver has been a welcome addition to my husband&#x27;s personal grooming product line-up.  It was exactly what he had been hoping to find for trimming his beard and mustache, so he wouldn&#x27;t have to shave it off as often.</li>
            <li> I have another Philipps shaver that doesn&#x27;t get as close as this one: [[ASIN:B0062IZ568 Philips Norelco Professional Bodygrooming System, Black/Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bodygrooming kit has all of these attachments and a rather larger charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Styleshaver, the one I am reviewing here has all of the elements attached and it charges in a slender stand that is rather space age and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the shave does not work on my beard, my hair much just grow funny.  The bodygrooming system, that link above, does have a shaving attachment and it works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, I can only use the beard trim on the Styleshaver, and I like it because the \\&quot;1\\&quot; on this shaver is much much much closer that the \\&quot;1\\&quot; on the bodygrooming system.</li>
            <li> Fourth time I used it the adjustable trimmer side broke leaving it useless.  It&#x27;s a total Chinese quality and made pics of crap.</li>
            <li> This StyleRazor shipped in about a week and I like how compact all the parts are. The trimmer is adjustable with only one trimming comb so you don&#x27;t have to worry about having three differnt combs attachments laying around. One end of the shaver is a trimmer and the other a shaver. I have had this over a week and it is sill staying charged. The downside which has been mentioned in other reveiws is the shaver is not all that great. I have to go over the same place over and over and use a little pressure to get a close shave. I have had better shavers but for it being both a trimmer and shaver I am happy with how compact this unit is compared to others I have had.</li>
            <li> After about eight or ten uses (I used it about once a month), the trimmer power clogged up and quit working.  The razor power continued to work, so it was not a recharging issue.  I guess hair or gunk got in there, somehow.  Impossible to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is a dock, so it is not possible to use the shaver while charging.  It is also a flimsy dock, easily falls over when upright, and the shaver slips off the charging contacts when the item is lying flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never did use the razor part because the blades did not reach the protective cover.  I guess one has to snip off the plastic guard that might be meant to hold it in place during shipping.  But the blue strip was buried underneath where it was almost impossible to reach.  Nor was there any mention in the very limited page of instructions on how to make the razor work.  Supposed to be self-evident, I guess, but isn&#x27;t so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short:  poorly designed and poorly executed.  Please don&#x27;t encourage Philips by buying this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product occasionally. However, I feel that the blade gets blunt after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;But altogether the availibility of a styler and shaver on one console is convenient.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does a terrible job at a moderately short setting. You have to literally go over each section 20 times in different directions so it doesn&#x27;t look patchy. The razor works well and it looks nice</li>
            <li> This is a new-age styleshaver. Very neat looking and also with easy handling and maneuverability. Not very expensive either. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This shaver yields a drastically close trim (but nit shave) without actually cutting too close. It&#x27;s great for trimming, but doesn&#x27;t accomplish a shaving job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different settings are quite basic, but there are ten different speeds. even at the highest speed true shaving is tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to keep as an occasional trimmer though.</li>
            <li> I got this for hubby he loves it! he can trim his goatee,beard,stubble with precision having facial hair that doesn&#x27;t all grow one way it allows him to shape his facial hair the way he wants.He also uses it to shave his head and it works great! Id highly recommend this product.Im not sure what all the other people are complaint about i brought this from amazon because the one we had previously got damaged and i couldn&#x27;t find one in the country we in they all sold out.He liked it so much i brought him one again.</li>

            <li> As someone who attempts to keep a well trimmed yet fairly full beard, I&#x27;ve gone through my share of beard trimmers. I had given up on multi-function trimmers as they never seemed to work as well as single purpose trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, however, is a fantastic beard trimmer. I&#x27;ve not had good luck in the past with adjustable guard trimmers, but this one works quite well. It is very easy to switch between the ten length settings. The head of the trimmer is double sided and much narrower on the other side. So when you remove the guard you can rotate the head 180 degrees and gain more precision for sideburn trimming and shaping. If that weren&#x27;t enough, the other end of the trimmer is a very serviceable foil razor. The only complaint I have with it, is that if you let your beard grow a bit between trims, the trimmings build up quite fast in the guard and have to be swept out fairly often for it to continue trimming. Luckily, the included brush works well for this.</li>
            <li> I normally use a [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]].  It&#x27;s nothing particularly special, but it gets the job done.  So when I had a chance to pick up one of these and give it a try I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco Styleshaver is actually two tools in one, well, make that three in one.  On one end is a foil covered razor.  It does an adequate job, but, frankly, not better than the razor I mentioned above.  I do not have a heavy beard, but this razor handled the overnight growth on my face just fine, but it had a tough time on my neck, so I had to go over my neck a number of times.  It was not an uncomfortable shave, but it never did get me quite as smooth as my triple-head razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then switched ends (there is a button that allows you to activate one end at a time).  The sideburn trimmer worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good piece of personal hygiene equipment.  For me though, I&#x27;ll be sticking with my triple-head razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good unit, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars.</li>
            <li> From a male&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome beard trimmer!  I had given up on multi-function shavers with adjustable guards.  This one surprised me!  It does its job and does it well.  It&#x27;s also simple to use.</li>
            <li> Not so easy to work with it.</li>
            <li> When my boyfriend began growing a spiffy (evil) goatee, I bought him a pair of mustache-scissors. A tiny comb accompanied the product and allowed for precision grooming. While this technique works quite well, it can be a little time-consuming ... and, sometimes, human error (when in a time-crunch) can cause a slightly uneven appearance. Therefore, when I spied the Philips Norelco Stylershaver, I thought it might be a perfect fit. Here was our experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-trims facial hair in a snap.&lt;br /&gt;-trims facial hair uniformly.&lt;br /&gt;-the orange accents make it aesthetically \\&quot;fun.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-not intended for a close shave (the shaved areas were left rough)&lt;br /&gt;-priced a bit high for its current quality (maybe the price-point should be around $60.00?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this Styleshaver would be an excellent complement to any electric razor. It does a phenomenal job of making pre-existing beards and mustaches tidy!</li>
            <li> This shaver/trimmer is just ok all the way around. First off, it&#x27;s big. Really bigger than any other shaver/trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. I had high hopes for it but it falls just short on a couple of areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a beard trimmer, the guard is a bit cumbersome. It&#x27;s really thick and hard to work over your beard. It takes several passes to get a good trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shaver, well, it lacks some polish. My son used it and swore he would never use another electric razor. I used it once and found it to be just ok. But I&#x27;ve bought $10 shavers from discount stores that worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a styler - where I really hoped it was great - it was lackluster. There are actually two styling edges you can use and neither of them seems \\&quot;just right.\\&quot; One is too big for me - I have a goatee and stach - the other is still too big for work around the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the charger is one a huge base. Holy cow it takes up a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give me my small beard trimmer with the double-AA batteries and a manual razor any day over this.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it to shave my body and personal grooming. It holds it&#x27;s charge well and cleans up easily. All all around great product.</li>
            <li> And what a cool-looking razor this is!  I love the idea that it has functionality on both ends and that the beard trimming can be adjusted with a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little less impressed that it needed a four-hour charge for a 30 minutes of shaving, but it came charged and ready to go.  I had some beard stubble at the time and tried the styling side.  As a trimmer, it&#x27;s fine.  There probably are cheaper trimmers that are just as effective, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, what would make this a great produce is the razor.  If the razor worked as well at the trimmer, whoo-hoo!  I fully expected it would, but it did not.  The razor is worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think toy razors cut better.  In fairness (?) I&#x27;ve never had success with foil razors, but I hadn&#x27;t tried one for 10+ years.  When I&#x27;ve gone electric, I&#x27;ve used the type with three rotating heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying to shave with this thing, I had to pull out my real electric razor and actually shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a bummer.  I really wanted to like this but I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple positions and pressures, but this shaver always fails to properly shave the jaw/neck area. I have another Philips shaver that has no issues with it (a rotary Norelco 7310). I also don&#x27;t like the fact that I can&#x27;t use it if the battery is dead, since this requires you to place it on a stand for charging. The neck area issue makes this (relatively expensive) shaver pretty much useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the trimmer and it works fine for sideburns. However, after shaving with the QS6140 for about two weeks, I am switching back to the old rotary one I had. So at this point this shaver is nothing more than a glorified trimmer.</li>
            <li> Be detailed and specific what would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product&lt;br /&gt;Tahnk you for this</li>
            <li> As my beard grows very rapidly and this helps me contain it quite well. I think it may be user error as I dont read instructions all that often however, on the longest setting it cuts a bit shorter than I anticipated but I still looked good. If you wish this to be a beard trimmer it will make you have less a beard and more of a lot of scruf. Now that is to say you will look good as the styling par does an amazing job making lines.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this excellent Philips item.&lt;br /&gt;We can use from it very fast and without ache also I offer tu bay it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Philips Norelco StyleRazor for a couple of months now, and it makes for a great trimmer, but as a good utility shaving tool, it&#x27;s not quite there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have what many people would call a goatee, though the proper term for it is actually a van dyke (goatee with connecting moustache).  I love this tool because the trimmer is small enough to really negotiate the tight spots under my lip and, actually, all around the perimeter for the beard.  It provides a nice, tight, clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the orange \\&quot;frontal guard\\&quot; is bulky and not particularly useful.  I&#x27;ve had a professional quality trimmer for years (I think it is measured in horsepower) and the guides that go with it are thin, and provide enough of an opening to do an effective job; the StyleRazor&#x27;s guide is thick, clumsy, and doesn&#x27;t give you effective control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil razor part is just not effective, at least not for me.  I&#x27;ve always thought that if you&#x27;re going to use a foil razor, you need to stick with it and let your skin adjust to it.  I have no such patience; give me a real razor and shave to the skin.  I suppose this shaver would be good if you needed to trim in a car on the way to a meeting or something and didn&#x27;t mind getting stubble on your shirt.  I just don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is very hand-friendly.  The StyleRazor itself is light to use but had a respectable heft to tell me it&#x27;s got some guts in there and isn&#x27;t all plastic shell.  I actually like the charger for the device, though it seems a little flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#x27;t think the product justifies a $65 price tag.  I love the trimmer, but the rest of the unit is lacking, and I can&#x27;t recommend it as a multi-purpose shaving tool.</li>
            <li> For more than 40 years I&#x27;ve been using the rotary technology from the Philips shaver to shave and thought that this &#x27;new&#x27; system would make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The disappointment is big and I went back to use my old (20+ years old) Philips shaver.</li>
            <li> My first  razor of the kind and i&#x27;m completely satisfied. Very useful with long battery life, it was hard on skin at first but then it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be a one stop solution for having a decent close shave and for smartening up if I&#x27;ve not had chance to shave for a few weeks. The bottom line is that it&#x27;s allows you to shave your beard with comfort and ease and it&#x27;s also great for side burns, however it&#x27;s not capable of doing a close shave. The shaver end of the device left me with a very patchy shave as well as fairly sore skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to go back to using a traditional flat headed / three blade Norleco, however I am going to keep this as a companion / pre shave device.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my 3 yr. old grandson&#x27;s hair. He is afraid of the barber, so I decided to get this so I can do his hair instead of taking him to a barber until he gets a little older. This works great as a trimmer, and I can even get around his ears with such perfection. Then my 19 yr. old son asked if he could use the shaver, and he said that he didn&#x27;t like it at all. He said that it left his face still feeling like there was stubble. So I am going to continue to use it as a trimmer for my grandson, but it does not make a good shaver at all.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this razor.  Have purchased several razors in the past and this one is the best by far.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a multipurpose razor with ease of use.  This more than meets the need for timing hair and beard.</li>
            <li> Awesome product !!! .</li>
            <li> It does what it is expected to do.</li>
            <li> good combo unit great features  all work well for a beautiful finish</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this razor. I had let my facial hair grow out a bit while I waited for it so I could test all of its features. To be honest it failed about every test I gave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the &#x27;beard trimmer&#x27; and it barely got any of the hairs and I had to make many many passes to get the ones I did. When I changed the guard to the lowest one they had it still barely managed to get any of the hairs. I ended up using a regular blade to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried to simply shave with it after a few days of letting my hair grow back. It failed again. I had several &#x27;missed&#x27; areas and thought that I just had to get used to it. Well I gave it several more tries and either had several splotches that were entirely missed or just got frustrated with how much LONGER it took than using a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps others had a better experience. Perhaps I am biased to using a blade. In the end I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this and cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK shaver if you just want to quickly clean up. I&#x27;m not sure for those looking for perfection it would be all that impressive. It works for what I need it for, which is to look &amp;#34;less scruffy&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;totally scruffy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You previously purchased Model  Philips Norelco BodyGroom Pro BG2040/34  When I saw this Model I liked very When buying him I did not regret it</li>
