            <li> wow!!!</li>
            <li> Its hard purchasing cosmetics online especially if its a new brand/color.</li>
            <li> Literally my only complaint is that the box is kinda hard to open, and sometimes I have to pull so hard that once it opens, my thumb slips into one of the eye shadows and suddenly I have brown all over the pad of my thumb.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.</li>
            <li> aramix forgot to put it inside the box with my other item :(</li>

            <li> Smooth shadows and love smash box</li>
            <li> These are usually such top quality, but this compact arrives broken in three shade boxes!</li>
            <li> Got this really quick and I love the colors.</li>
            <li> love it for my daughteer</li>
            <li> Love this product so much&amp;#60;3</li>

            <li> In love. I use this daily! Used with a primer it will last all day.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and quality but damn it&#x27;s spendy. It won&#x27;t be an every day eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Kinda looks like a knock off.</li>
            <li> The perfect size, and colors are spot on.</li>
            <li> aramix forgot to put it inside the box with my other item :(</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors and perfectly sparkle-y. Love it.</li>
            <li> Its hard purchasing cosmetics online especially if its a new brand/color. I was so impressed with this palette. Not only did the colors look beautiful but they lasted a very long day. Its like an all-in-one for whatever shadow you&#x27;re in the mood for. Love!</li>
            <li> For the quality name, it has a very cheap mirror.  A reflective metal piece on the inside of the sleek case</li>
            <li> I have been going through so many makeup palettes since Clinique discontinued my favorite one and jut haven&#x27;t been able to find a comparable color that I liked. I saw a review of this one and...wow!!! The colors are beautiful, feel great on my eyes and the price is even better. I love the sparkle top ones but I&#x27;m definitely liking the bottom colors the best. They all blend great together and on my light olive complexion they look great for either a natural or smokey look. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more smash box palettes.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken. Product is great. Condition it arrived in was not.</li>
            <li> Gift for a friend who is a brunette.  Many colors she likes.</li>
            <li> This pallet is one of my favorites and my every day go to eye shadow. The colors are nice and smooth and they stay on all day. The colors are a bit more vibrant in person, which I loved. The whole top row is shimmery and the bottom row is matte, I use a mixture of both every day.</li>
            <li> Really nice colors! And I would say the palette is nicely pigmented, especially the matte colors.</li>
