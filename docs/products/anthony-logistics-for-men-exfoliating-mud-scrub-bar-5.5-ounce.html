            <li>This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best soap I&#x27;ve found for my temperamental skin and is especially great for use on my face.  </li>
            <li>It stimulates your skin while having a great minty smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times and it&#x27;s really great</li>
            <li>All around this is a great soap.</li>
            <li>its honestly the best bar of soap ive ever used.</li>
            <li>while it is a bright mint scent, it has a basil undertone that mellows</li>
            <li>Exfoliating, smells good, moisturizing.</li>
            <li>However it does work really nicely on the skin, and has a great smell to it as well.  </li>
            <li>and I would have been more than happy to give it five stars.  </li>
            <li>more &#x27;guy&#x27; soap / products lol.</li>
            <li>It smells great, very mild, and not perfumey.</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and does seem to clean.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is the best body cleaning thing I&#x27;ve ever used, and I feel good buying this because Anthony Logistics donates a portion of the proceeds to prostate cancer research.</li>
            <li>so I would not use it more then 1-2 times a week.  </li>
            <li>Also the mint scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite line of men&#x27;s products and I have tried all Anthony&#x27;s Logistic products.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the perfect balance with its essential oils and soothing oatmeal.  </li>
            <li>As such, the best I can muster is a 3 star review.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for around 2 months now, and my skin looks noticeably better than it did before I used this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain or anything is just interesting</li>
            <li>but more often than not...</li>
            <li>your favorite product is bound to be pricey.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good</li>
            <li>This soap has a nice, licorice scent and creates a grayish lather that is unusual but leaves my skin feeling nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Other products in AL are way better!!!</li>
            <li>The product leaves a light waxy coating on the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy rubbing it against my skin as I shower.</li>
            <li>The Mint smell is awesome but not to strong and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, the smell is refreshing and it leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to describe to you just how clean this bar of soap makes me feel.</li>
            <li>This men&#x27;s soap is something special.</li>
            <li>It gets you quickly, thoroughly clean without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>so 4 stars,it doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 because it didn&#x27;t do anything to some pigmentation marks I have on my body.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s black and smells so good.</li>
            <li>After you rinse it off your skin feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My Dr. Suggested I use this product, and I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>I mean, there are so many easier to use and more effective body washes out there nowadays</li>
            <li>it is squeaky clean the first time, and no trace of dirt on the cotton ball when I used astringent.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>When I first started buying it on Amazon, the price was $6-7</li>
            <li>This is my first nontraditional soap bar</li>
            <li>This is a little expensive but has a great lather and smells great.</li>
            <li>My skin has a clean feeling like no other bar has given me.</li>
            <li>Anthony line is fantastic, my wife and kids all tell me I look younger.</li>
            <li>I bought the soap primarily to provide a deep cleaning to my skin and it did do that</li>
            <li>It rinses off, but it&#x27;s unusual  to have  smokey gray colored lather.  </li>
            <li>Because of this you really feel the abrasiveness.  </li>
            <li>I really like this bar.</li>
            <li>The scent is natural, amazingly invigorating and refreshing, and I&#x27;ve even gotten occasional compliments on the residual fragrance when not wearing cologne (it&#x27;s not strong and stays very close to the skin --</li>
            <li>this is my other favorite cleansing product for the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely on the pricey side, but speaking from the point of view of someone who is very particular about what I use in the shower, I think it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Personally  I would prefer smaller abrasive particles as I think they abrade more evenly.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really surprising to me is that this product manages to remove all that grease without making your skin half as dry as most other soaps and body washes out there!</li>
            <li>It really does wipe your skin clear of any and all grease that is on your face/body to help you feel like a million bucks every time you shower.</li>
            <li>For a few bucks cheaper I would buy more than one at a time.</li>
            <li>To preserve it, make sure you put it on a soap tray that allows it to dry and it will last for 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing, undoubtedly expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that for any other facial cleansers or soap, I have tried most of them on the market, either you feel some oil off and have to wash your face twice, and when I used astringent I still see dirt on the cotton ball, not with Anthony Logistics Mud scrub</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s marketed for men, my 67 year old mom uses it also.</li>
            <li>It has some natural roughness to it to help scrub the skin.</li>
            <li>However I feel there are other products out there that are better and cost less.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find products for guys in these areas and glad to see some companies are starting to pay attention</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clear to me why a soap that is supposed to exfoliate and clear the pores, would then be designed to apply a coating to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Other soaps, even high quality soaps tend to leave my face either far too oily or dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li>When you feel all dirty and oily and just need to revive your skin a little, this exfoliating bar is great.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The scent lasts all day and the bar last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not a great product, but not a bad one either.</li>
            <li> I occasionally switch back to other soaps, I can notice a definite difference in my showering experience and the quality of my skin.  </li>
            <li> The abrasive elements, designed for deep cleaning, are not the pumice-like, gritty, or sandy particles in other exfoliating soaps.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a little black mud residue wherever you place the bar, but it washes right off with minimal water.</li>
            <li> I often lather soap in my hands for my face since the mud absorbs a lot of excess oil, but not directly bar to face.</li>
            <li> First, you have to get past the weirdness of washing with black soap.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well, it is the only soap that when I wash my oily face it gets all the oil off.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, but so are most quality skin-care products.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t overly dry your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough but not smooth either.</li>
            <li> The bar though a little pricey, does last a long time!</li>
            <li> I would not buy bar soaps anymore after this mess but overall worked well for a while.  </li>
            <li> I only use it twice a week because it costs 12 dollars for this little bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble using other soaps after using it for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Small pieces, enough to shorten the life of the soap, but too small to use.  </li>
            <li> I did give it four stars because it does leave black residue all over the shower.</li>
            <li> It is harsh</li>
            <li> The bar exfoliates the skin, but not too harshly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this as a negative, but it&#x27;s not like any other soap I have used.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, at $12.00 per bar, I find myself using it judiciously to make each bar last longer.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what you were expecting.</li>

            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It gets you quickly, thoroughly clean without drying out your skin. Terrific.</li>

            <li> This soap is amazing, undoubtedly expensive but worth it. I have had a lot of trouble using other soaps after using it for 6 months. Also the mint scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have used every brand of men&#x27;s products for skin. This is my favorite line of men&#x27;s products and I have tried all Anthony&#x27;s Logistic products. Anthony line is fantastic, my wife and kids all tell me I look younger. I am 45 and my skin is tighter no crow&#x27;s feet, looks brighter and healthier. I get complements on my skin conditions all the time from woman asking what I use on my face. Thank you Anthony!</li>
            <li> es un excelente producto y con un rápido entrega  estoy muy contento con la compra  les recomiendo el producto y que lo disfruten</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve found for my temperamental skin and is especially great for use on my face.

Unfortunately, at $12.00 per bar, I find myself using it judiciously to make each bar last longer.  When I first started buying it on Amazon, the price was $6-7 and I would have been more than happy to give it five stars.  At the current price, I have to knock off a star.</li>
            <li> I bought the soap primarily to provide a deep cleaning to my skin and it did do that so 4 stars,it doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 because it didn&#x27;t do anything to some pigmentation marks I have on my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months and have mixed feeling about this product.  First, you have to get past the weirdness of washing with black soap. It rinses off, but it&#x27;s unusual  to have  smokey gray colored lather.  The abrasive elements, designed for deep cleaning, are not the pumice-like, gritty, or sandy particles in other exfoliating soaps.  These are big.  The size of aquarium gravel.  Because of this you really feel the abrasiveness.  Personally  I would prefer smaller abrasive particles as I think they abrade more evenly.  It has a nice minty scent that is not overpowering.  The product leaves a light waxy coating on the skin.  I assume this is supposed to have some benefits or moisturize the skin. I&#x27;m not saying this as a negative, but it&#x27;s not like any other soap I have used. It&#x27;s not clear to me why a soap that is supposed to exfoliate and clear the pores, would then be designed to apply a coating to the skin.  This seems to defeat the purpose. My big gripe is that it is brittle.  I use this in the shower, and if I drop the bar, pieces of it shatter off, every time.  Small pieces, enough to shorten the life of the soap, but too small to use.  Because of this, the bar does not last as long as it probably could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed feelings about this soap.  I like it in some ways.  It smells great and does seem to clean.  However I feel there are other products out there that are better and cost less.  As such, the best I can muster is a 3 star review.  Not a great product, but not a bad one either.</li>
            <li> Wow. Before I tried this product, I thought I was never going to use a bar of soap again. I mean, there are so many easier to use and more effective body washes out there nowadays, right? No.     I can&#x27;t begin to describe to you just how clean this bar of soap makes me feel. It really does wipe your skin clear of any and all grease that is on your face/body to help you feel like a million bucks every time you shower. What&#x27;s really surprising to me is that this product manages to remove all that grease without making your skin half as dry as most other soaps and body washes out there! I have been using this product for around 2 months now, and my skin looks noticeably better than it did before I used this product. It does leave a little black mud residue wherever you place the bar, but it washes right off with minimal water. I&#x27;d say each bar lasts about 2-3 months.    Overall, this is the best body cleaning thing I&#x27;ve ever used, and I feel good buying this because Anthony Logistics donates a portion of the proceeds to prostate cancer research. I&#x27;ll definitely buy another bar.</li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s soap is something special. Exfoliating, smells good, moisturizing. I&#x27;d use it myself if I didn&#x27;t need to give it away</li>
            <li> My skin has a clean feeling like no other bar has given me. I am hooked on this product and cleaning myself with this product is now part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, the smell is refreshing and it leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well, it is the only soap that when I wash my oily face it gets all the oil off. I can&#x27;t say that for any other facial cleansers or soap, I have tried most of them on the market, either you feel some oil off and have to wash your face twice, and when I used astringent I still see dirt on the cotton ball, not with Anthony Logistics Mud scrub it is squeaky clean the first time, and no trace of dirt on the cotton ball when I used astringent. And it doesn&#x27;t overly dry your skin and you should apply a moisturizer after cleaning anyway. Even though it&#x27;s marketed for men, my 67 year old mom uses it also. To preserve it, make sure you put it on a soap tray that allows it to dry and it will last for 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> I only use it twice a week because it costs 12 dollars for this little bar of soap.  However it does work really nicely on the skin, and has a great smell to it as well.  I personally like this brand so I wouldnt buy anything else, but if you are looking to save money I would take a pass.</li>
            <li> LOVE it. Along with Anthony Logistics Sea Salt Body Scrub this is my other favorite cleansing product for the shower. When you feel all dirty and oily and just need to revive your skin a little, this exfoliating bar is great. It stimulates your skin while having a great minty smell. The bar exfoliates the skin, but not too harshly. I often lather soap in my hands for my face since the mud absorbs a lot of excess oil, but not directly bar to face. I feel like i&#x27;ve just buffed myself, and uncovered a softer feeling skin. The bar though a little pricey, does last a long time!</li>
            <li> I really like this bar. It smells pretty good but it cleans your skin without drying out at all. I did give it four stars because it does leave black residue all over the shower. It doesn&#x27;t stain or anything is just interesting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and always looking for soaps that are more &#x27;guy&#x27; soap / products lol. I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times and it&#x27;s really great and I love that it&#x27;s black and smells so good. The Mint smell is awesome but not to strong and not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s not rough but not smooth either. Hope this helps. It&#x27;s hard to find products for guys in these areas and glad to see some companies are starting to pay attention</li>
            <li> Is soap. It cleans. Not sure what you were expecting. It&#x27;s not going to paint your house or do your taxes.</li>
            <li> This is my first nontraditional soap bar and I really enjoy rubbing it against my skin as I shower. The only thing I have against this is the price. For a few bucks cheaper I would buy more than one at a time. I also can&#x27;t immediately tell the difference in my skin yet.</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice, licorice scent and creates a grayish lather that is unusual but leaves my skin feeling nice and clean.  It is a little expensive, but so are most quality skin-care products.</li>
            <li> All around this is a great soap. It smells great, very mild, and not perfumey. It has some natural roughness to it to help scrub the skin. After you rinse it off your skin feels fresh and clean. It&#x27;s definitely on the pricey side, but speaking from the point of view of someone who is very particular about what I use in the shower, I think it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a little expensive but has a great lather and smells great. My Dr. Suggested I use this product, and I enjoy it very much. The scent lasts all day and the bar last for a long time.</li>
            <li> a lil pricey... but more often than not... your favorite product is bound to be pricey. its honestly the best bar of soap ive ever used.</li>
