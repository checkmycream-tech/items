            <li>This dryer is great.  </li>
            <li>because I&#x27;m not quite raving--it didn&#x27;t transform my hair, like some people claimed, or dramatically reduce my drying time, but for the price, this hairdryer is a great value</li>

            <li>My favorite hair dryer ever!!</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is also very handy.  </li>

            <li>The retractible cord is very handy for storing in the drawer.  </li>
            <li>Very nice hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The retractable power cord is a very nice design element.  </li>

            <li>The grip is great, very easy to navigate my glorious mop of nappy hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>The cord is amazing!</li>
            <li>Loving this dryer!</li>
            <li>was the best and after so many years, busted, so I bought this one.</li>
            <li>retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn&#x27;t come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  </li>
            <li>I love the retractable cord - that&#x27;s one of the best features ever for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Great price daughter loved all the attachments</li>
            <li>It is awesome having so many heat and speed settings.  </li>
            <li>Having the power cord being able to retract is an awesome feature.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and you do not have to pay a lot for a good dryer and diffuser.</li>
            <li>The difusor has a good size and it&#x27;s a great option for curly hair.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord along with the excellent reviews made it an easy choice.  </li>
            <li>Speedy shipment, easy ordering, sent just as described, awesome product.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommanded.&lt;br /&gt;I will say this might be the best choice for product in this price range.</li>
            <li>Very good, more than pleasant with the product.</li>
            <li>Works great and love the rewind!</li>
            <li>Very good product with many drying options.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright, shiny, fushia color.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t as bright as the photos show.</li>

            <li>And She says it&#x27;s good</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase and the attachments that come with it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>Looks great also love the color.  </li>

            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>

            <li>The temperature is nice, and the auto cord retractor works good and comes in handy.</li>
            <li>One of the best features are the heat settings - I started drying my 4 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair using the warm setting - which is just the right temp.</li>
            <li>and I love that it came with attachments!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s much better than having all these cords all over the place!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute!</li>

            <li>I love the color, very bright and cheerful.  </li>
            <li>I love how quick this one works and very effective without frizzing my hair!</li>
            <li>but the bottom line is, it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It has amazing power</li>
            <li>Hair dryer itself is amazing as well and does the job in minutes.</li>
            <li>But I got my conair real cheap</li>
            <li>but hey its a great dryer for cheap.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say anytime I use this dryer or my daughter borrows it our hair looks smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>And does a nice job styling hair.</li>
            <li>(i.e. it nicely fits in one&#x27;s hand).  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Looks nice, is shiny, etc.</li>
            <li>I am beyond thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>I regret not taking it with me because it so nice.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I like to hold the dryer from the barrel and it doesn&#x27;t even get slightly warm.</li>
            <li>The cord is the perfect length when it is pulled out all the way and tucks away when not in use making it much easier to store.</li>

            <li>Really nice blowdryer</li>
            <li>And of course, it&#x27;s always nice to have a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>This IS actually a nice dryer...</li>
            <li>I really liked how this dryer worked.  </li>
            <li>Retractable cord is nice.</li>
            <li>I travel quite a bit, so it&#x27;s nice to have the cord retract.</li>
            <li>Nice product with a lot of power.  </li>
            <li>I liked this hair dryer for a lot of reasons.</li>

            <li>Makes putting it up look nice &amp; organized</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see why someone would own this.  </li>

            <li>Daughter borrowed it, and she liked it, also.</li>
            <li>I liked this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Great  hair Dryer, very powerful and durable.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord makes it super easy to travel with this lightweight hair dryer, and the amount of heat, power and airflow you get from it is perfect for coaxing my wavy hair to curls when I use the diffuser.</li>
            <li>The cord keeper is certainly a nice feature and the bright color makes it easy to find under my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>I have owned many of their products through the years and have been very pleased until I bought this product.</li>
            <li>This is a quick drying dryer, which is what we all want, lol.  </li>

            <li>I usually do not write reviews but am very happy to have this product.</li>
            <li>perfect its light and has all the right settings and the cord</li>
            <li>Being able to cool off my hair after it is dry is the best thing about it (except maybe the great color of it!  </li>
            <li>The best part of this hairdryer is, by far, the retractable cord, which makes it very easy to store.  </li>
            <li>the three heat settings are amazing too :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed by the professional quality of this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it dries nicely</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this dryer does what it claims, it reduces static amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this is really a great hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Its amazing and so much more organized than they use to be.</li>
            <li>Daughter loves having her own hairdryer and we feel safe with this one, no problems yet.</li>
            <li>Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair</li>
            <li>I tried someone&#x27;s dryer like this and fell in love with it so had to buy my own.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair dryer and have recommended it to others who also liked it.  </li>
            <li>really looked out for one very good and with very advanced settings.</li>

            <li>I bought it 3 years ago and its still going strong!</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest to anyone looking for one with power!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong!</li>
            <li>Very good, highly rated blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Happy happy, for second time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dryer so far. :)</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, it is powerful, has a great retractable cord and that is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>And the nice bright fuschia color is fun.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Hot&#x27; never got too hot and &#x27;warm&#x27; was perfect for my use.  </li>
            <li>This item was exactly as described and the price was great.  </li>
            <li>It is beautiful and has all the features considered a must have, at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>For the missus, however, well she&#x27;s pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because the winding cord seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>The cord was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>and she has been using it for almost a year every day and still works fine!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>I got this product very cheap just because the box was dented</li>
            <li>Hot air, nice color, good price.</li>
            <li>Very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first, and then untangle it whenever you take it out.</li>
            <li>I have always liked that conair products are fairly inexpensive, they are great quality, and they have a long lifespan.</li>
            <li>Item ok - cord does not always retract as it is suppose to...but dryer works fine!</li>
            <li>Another plus, it is not as large as you would think it would be, so it will be great for traveling.</li>
            <li>This Conair product is my favorite.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>I do love the fact that it has a retractable cord.</li>
            <li>As a hairdryer, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I was just hoping for more.</li>
            <li>I also love the cord that goes into the dryer itself.</li>

            <li>and i can&#x27;t even say how much i love the retractable cord feature...</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Electricity - more than with</li>
            <li>I love the Infininti hairdryer from Conair.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I was surprised this dryer got so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li>She thinks that the product is well-designed and that the variable heat settings are perfect, not too hot or cool, and she also uses the free accessories to adjust the air-flow for a variety of hair style applications.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a favorite hair dryer until now.  </li>

            <li>- Be sure to read the instructions.  </li>
            <li>This works good, but not as good as my old one that I got at Walmart for $15.00.  </li>
            <li>It works OK, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>I love the recoil of cord.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the retractable cord and the diffuser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quieter than most hair dryers.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more anyone could desire from a dryer.</li>

            <li>And I love the color.  </li>
            <li>and I have been pleased with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that the cord is retractable.</li>
            <li>Can ask for anything more.</li>
            <li>I wish the dryer had more blowing power.</li>
            <li>I suggest getting something with more watts.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the cord winds up.</li>
            <li>The dryer itself still works perfectly in regards to heat and power after a year or more of almost daily use.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>There are so many hair dryers to choose from.</li>
            <li>pleased with this item</li>
            <li>Love the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and perfect for taking with on trips instead of packing the big dryer!</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that I love the color, this is a dynamo of a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything else more to add.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m okay with them now.  </li>
            <li>She uses it almost daily and the cord re-tractor is the best because it helps me from stepping on the cord.</li>
            <li>I must say that I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>We absolutely love this hair dryer.</li>

            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer.</li>
            <li>I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   </li>
            <li>This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better.</li>
            <li>: I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>In my area Target &amp; Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  </li>
            <li>Dryer works wonderfully, I love the wind up cord.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I also love the color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more marroon</li>
            <li>and i had to invest in a way better one</li>
            <li>and I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>but then the particulates fall into the motor causing more problems or the lint and stuff</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I love that the cord retracts up.</li>
            <li>I also love the defuser piece it comes with.</li>

            <li>Very genius and am sooo happy with it.</li>
            <li>In fact, most times I have to pull all the way out and hold the cord taught while it retracts in ordernto</li>
            <li>The Andis is more feature packed (see my separate review).</li>
            <li>The Conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned including the Andis model.</li>
            <li>The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love Conair brand&lt;</li>

            <li>Simply put this is THE best hair dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>one of the better conair products i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>said the retractable cord is perfect for storage in a tiny dorm room.</li>
            <li>Love the retractable cord and the ease of storage.</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer, helps me when styling my hair.</li>
            <li>Comes with 2 connectors for styling and love using them both.</li>
            <li>but when I used my sister&#x27;s for the first time, I knew I had to have one of my own!</li>
            <li>and I love the retractable cord.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>6 months now since purchase and most of the cord will not retract.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight, and for the fact that it&#x27;s not so NOISY!</li>
            <li>This is a much better hair dryer that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>i have not been able to use the product since i received</li>
            <li>I would really love to.</li>
            <li>I love the retracting cord.</li>
            <li>I love the settings on this and the attachments although I don&#x27;t know how to use them.</li>
            <li>The color is really stylish.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad to tuck it away and not have to wrap the cord on the dryer every time I use this.  </li>
            <li>Also so sometimes my hair gets stuck in the top of it when it is drawing in air.</li>
            <li>worked flawlessly until it just stopped working last week.</li>
            <li>Works great and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have short hair this iron might be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>I do love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my hair looks better after I blowdry</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about cord.</li>
            <li>I called Amazon customer service and as always they were very friendly and offered to either send me another hair dryer or refund my money.</li>
            <li>I too read the reviews and was very excited to use this product</li>
            <li>I was very excited to see that.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I just got it, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality blow dryer- hot and dries fast.</li>
            <li>It produced a good stream of nicely heated air and seemd to dry my hair fairly well.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have owned about 9 hair dryers in the last 5 years, and this is easily the best of them all.</li>
            <li>The colour is bright and pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this dryer as it is pretty good, though not</li>
            <li>I like the retractable cord feature, and the heating element is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Warm setting should be renamed cool.</li>
            <li>Its so sturdy and nice and a cool metallic color too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had for my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Returned for exchange with Amazon, new unit works well, and wife is happy with it.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t super thrilled.      </li>
            <li>I love the retractable cord, makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s hefty (so you better have a strong grip) and it does NOT fold over.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it&#x27;s well-vented and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quite stylish (and</li>
            <li>I love the retracting cable, which allows for easy uncluttered storage.  </li>
            <li>so I can sit wherever I want when I dry my hair; otherwise it is perfect and I plan on buying it as gifts for some of my family/friends.</li>
            <li>Love the the cord retracts for easy storage, too.</li>
            <li>This is a nice hair dryer and dries my hair really quickly.  </li>
            <li>What attracted me most to this model is the gorgeous, shiny fuchsia color; however, this feature ended up ruining the whole dryer for me</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of a retractable cord, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing about this dryer.  </li>
            <li>The retractable cord is a nice feature, but I think it probably has something to do with the heaviness of the blow dryer and that nice feature doesn&#x27;t compensate for a very sore arm after just 10 minutes of blow drying.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful &amp; the reel cord makes this blow dryer even better!</li>
            <li>I have had this dryer for about a year now and it has held up great, has great power and is hot enough.  </li>
            <li>(By far, the most appealing factor!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this one will be just fine</li>
            <li>It was in stock, listed for a great price and also included free super saver shipping I placed my order right away.</li>
            <li>ok ok not so special.</li>
            <li>and I find that it&#x27;s more accurate in the air flow.</li>
            <li>I love the retractable cord on this hairdryer and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the color</li>
            <li>So if your outlet is above a shelf, for example, as many bathroom outlets are, you need to make sure you have about 5-6 inches clearance to allow room for the reinforced and non-flexible bit of cord at the plug.&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer works great.</li>
            <li>The product offers great features which include a self-retracting cord reel (just push a button and it automatically winds itself), a diffuser, a concentrator, 3 heat settings, and two speed settings.  </li>
            <li>This is the first ionic technology hair dryer that I&#x27;ve used, and I have to say, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I did considerable research, and was drawn to this one by the great reviews and</li>
            <li>So I got this one, its been working great so far.</li>
            <li>I did have to get used to holding it securely while I pressed the button on the side to retract the cable, though, dropping it the first time, because I didn&#x27;t have a good hold on it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great luck with Conair in the past--this dryer was replacing my old 1875 (which I&#x27;ve used for 8+ years).  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it takes a couple tries to get it to go all the way in, but I don&#x27;t expect it to be perfect every time!  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s a placebo affect, but she&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>I do not think it&#x27;s better than the cheap revlon blow dryer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pink &amp; i especially love the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>Forceful air and the cord retractor has worked great so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I found this for sale on Amazon because it&#x27;s quiet-as far as blow dryers go-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful but doesn&#x27;t blast your hair beyond recognition...especially at the lower speed and on warm.</li>
            <li>Really works good.</li>
            <li>good wattage - fast dry&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works really good and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>The reviews were good on the dryer itself, but I really just wanted the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, the three temperatures and speeds give you a good range of options depending on what you intend to do on your hair.</li>
            <li>Has a cool shot button, and strong airflow!</li>
            <li>The airflow is very powerful, and I love how to cord is reeled inside of the dryer</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely fashion, and more or less in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>delivered super fast &amp; great price</li>
            <li>This is a good product, Pros: heats well, powerful, quick, retractable cord.</li>
            <li>It has worked perfectly well until the other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works perfectly like any other blowdryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Retractable Cord - retracts easily (but mine is still new).&lt;br /&gt;Easier</li>
            <li>I would easily give it 5 stars, if it wasn&#x27;t for the weight.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.</li>
            <li>If anyone be able to illuminate me on what happened or has experienced the same thing, please reply and let me know.  </li>
            <li>Easy feature to find</li>
            <li>of power, which you can easily control so you don&#x27;t burn your hair.</li>
            <li>Durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The cord retracts so it is easy to store.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a decent hair dryer at a good price and this was the one I picked.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Still going strong.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still going strong after 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>(This one still works good, but my older hair dryer</li>
            <li>Nice, easy, portable hand dryer that is available in fun colors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for quick, high temp drying, or for bangs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s can get very hot on the high heat setting, but the medium heat setting is a great compromise if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a very stylish dryer and dries my hair really fast leaving it softer because of the Ion.</li>
            <li>She thought it was a pretty color and liked the attachments.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a cool setting and 2 speed settings.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice not to have to leave the cord out around a hot hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still pretty warm).    </li>
            <li>I love the retractable cord, the choice of heat levels and speeds PLUS a cool button.</li>
            <li>Hot setting should be changed to almost warm.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine</li>
            <li>My previous Conair Ion dryer was awesome.</li>
            <li>It worked fine yesterday, and today would not work.</li>
            <li>I wish the cord retracted every time perfectly but it usually works and I love that feature.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine.  </li>
            <li>but it is fine.</li>
            <li>No, I can still push the cord into the blowdryer and everything is working fine.</li>
            <li>The cord retracts fine.  </li>
            <li>I thought all was fine after almost 2 months of using it.</li>
            <li>My curls are slightly straightened when I use this which is great for me!</li>
            <li>Worked fine..</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>The styling of this dryer is SUPER CUTE</li>
            <li>I found the temperature and speed settings to be more than adequate and well-placed on the dryer handle (no accidental bumping).    </li>
            <li>cute color, retractable cord, quick \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button,</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was appropriately packaged.</li>
            <li>The color could be better -- like silver or black -- but a very good performing product.  </li>
            <li>It would get very hot although I would never use it for more than 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Best feature for me is the cool setting not found on other hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it is hard looking for a good diffuser and this is great.</li>
            <li>tried the diffuser one day, but found it to be a huge pain to work with, so I just set it aside...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give an accurate review of those.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer was fantastic while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Ions smooth the cuticle layer... creating</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this in store and found it working great.</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The filter is easy to remove and clean</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just not feather light either)</li>
            <li>It was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day I bought it, until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Conair, and based on its model number, which indicated it was well within warranty, they would replace it for free, sort of.</li>
            <li>That it works well is only part of what makes a product great.</li>
            <li>That it works well is only part of what makes a product great.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that it makes my hair look fabulous too?</li>
            <li>The price is also unbeatable @ $20 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that it makes my hair look fabulous too?</li>
            <li>The price is also unbeatable @ $20 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer has great power and different heat settings.</li>
            <li>This dryer being 1875 would definitely fit into that \\&quot;pro\\&quot; description.  </li>
            <li>Bought this primarily for the retractable cord, which works well.</li>
            <li>but then again, sometimes light means &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;,  </li>
            <li>Enjoy the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer has been great, but it only lasted me for 1 year.</li>
            <li>I like that it has three heat settings which are useful when wanting my hair to be straighter or have more curl.  </li>
            <li>Not like the light plastic feeling dryers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything fantastic for my hair, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much , bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Great,  quiet hair dryer.</li>
            <li>so it fits comfortably in my hand and it is also light weight.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the dryer is fabulous for my hair.</li>
            <li>The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free.</li>
            <li>this was a great christmas present.</li>
            <li>She has heavy hair and she especially liked the cord that coiled.  </li>
            <li>This was okay, but it was not as powerful as my Revlon dryerthat</li>
            <li>I used to have a Conair ionic blow dryer from Costco and it made my hair so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t even that cheap for what you get</li>
            <li>Nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I was correct in my assessment of the cheap switches.</li>
            <li>Really, really great device, and the attachments only add to that.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight which is good but not as good as my old but loud Baby Bliss which I was trying to replace.</li>
            <li>I had been using a traveling blow dryer for almost ten years and did not realize there was a difference in dryers until I asked my therapist/hairstylist why my hair always looks so great there</li>
            <li>This is a great standard size blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>In her opinion, it is a good home dryer, but probably wouldn&#x27;t hold up to the use that a professional dryer gets.  </li>
            <li>The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>What was more surprising is how noisy these things are, not just objectively but subjectively as well.</li>
            <li>If you are to lay the dryer on the side with the button, it will most likely activate causing the cord to retract, and this isn&#x27;t a good thing if the dryer is on.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get too hot and it was a nice cool setting.  </li>
            <li>It looks good as far as blow dryers go</li>
            <li>Overall its been a good dryer though and am glad I have it</li>
            <li>It does dry my hair very fast and the cord keeper works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The temperature settings are also very nice with the hot not being *too* hot, and the cool is actually cool.</li>
            <li>, I also love that the cord winds right up.</li>
            <li>Really!!!  </li>
            <li>It is very fun.</li>
            <li>but it is very powerful.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to handle, dries hair quickly, and stores easily with the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>Ample speed and heat settings, comfortable to use, and best of all, no more tangled cord.</li>
            <li>It also dries hair quickly and is easy to use with your styling brushes.</li>
            <li>This one is heavier, hotter, and the cool shot is really just warm.</li>
            <li>The cord retracts, quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Great for using on low air/hi heat to spiff up my hair instead of doing a full blowout.  </li>
            <li>I have learned to be more cautious as I lay it down and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is SUPER quiet, has plenty of power, has a removable and cleanable inlet filter, and has a great retractable cord feature.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer--maybe even more than the previous model--leaves my hair especially smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is perfect for the limited space of my bathroom, The attachments work really well</li>
            <li>Low airflow on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting, amazing for curly hair!</li>
            <li>It is a great dryer and functions a long time.</li>
            <li>My hair is significantly shinier, softer, and silkier than it&#x27;s ever been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this hairdryer</li>
            <li>I originally bought this hair dryer in a store years ago.</li>
            <li>But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t get hot except at the business end.</li>
            <li>When it came, I was sort of excited because of the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>The color is really fun too!</li>
            <li>I hope to continue buying ... 100% original product ..</li>
            <li>Since my original hair dryer broke, I am in the market for another one.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s significantly heavier than a non-tourmaline.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first hair dryer purchase in many years because I had curly hair, which I am now straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the most &#x27;pretty&#x27; hair dryer that I have ever owned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning - easier to clean filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>diffuser attachment works great to dry the curls without them flying all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here is a tip for cleaning the plastic windowscreen like filter underneath; I used to clean it with tweezers to pull off the accumulated lint about once a month.</li>
            <li>I also like that you can remove and clean the filter.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer has a good weight to it and the motor sounds quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>The cord is retractable and their is a removable filter at the end to clean out all the dust that accumulates in these things.  </li>
            <li>You have many settings available to you and the retractable cord is a real bonus.</li>
            <li>: dries quickly, silky, smooth hair</li>
            <li>Quick free delivery through prime account.</li>
            <li>Usually when I use a blow dryer on her hair it gets to be fly away and static filled.</li>
            <li>The hot setting isn&#x27;t overly hot, and the cool setting does a nice job of setting my style.</li>
            <li>As a woman with long hair, I need a good hair dryer that is easy to move around my head.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the 1 we originally had, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t think it puts out as much air.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special here.  </li>
            <li>It was ok while it lasted, but certainly nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It works well, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It comes with two attachments which i use and find helpful when drying my hair for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is nothing special though.</li>
            <li>was completely right!   </li>
            <li>I probably would, but this blow drier was cheap, cute, and does it&#x27;s main purpose, so I&#x27;ll keep it for a while.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at drying your hair quickly and yet does not seem to dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy until I find something better at a decent price with a retractable cord!</li>
            <li>When this hairdryer came i was super excited.</li>
            <li>I was able to dry my hair quickly and it looked very healthy afterwards.</li>
            <li>very fine, short hair and this dryer fluffed it up nicely and it&#x27;s very fast.</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer for the first four months, then the cord stopped retracting, and then two months later the engine blew.  </li>
            <li>The product is attractive and well-designed, and it comes with a manual, stylish soft case and several air-flow accessories.</li>
            <li>Drying time is 50% shorter and my hair generally seems more healthy.</li>
            <li>I would also be careful of the retractable cord - it can fly all over the place and hit you or something else.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it&#x27;s blowing cool air.</li>
            <li>Styling is a breeze with it&#x27;s setting options and cool</li>
            <li>The make is very sleek and stylish.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good dryer, with some benefits and drawbacks.</li>
            <li>a LOT - of researching online, on amazon, on the websites of all the different brands available, and finally decided this blow dryer is the best for my needs.</li>
            <li>I like the cool setting.</li>
            <li>Early in the morning this is a nice safety feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s plastic, I love the metallic fuchsia finish and the sporty modern detailing.</li>
            <li>* overall a good value&lt;</li>
            <li>I had a really old Conair that I liked</li>
            <li>But I kept smelling a sweet smell coming from the bathroom area and just thought it was my plug in freshener.  </li>
            <li>Powerful in strength, but light in weight.</li>
            <li>Noise data included - good job overall    </li>
            <li>I like the removable filter which is mounted fairly flush with the back of the housing.</li>
            <li>If the price wasn&#x27;t as good as it is on Amazon I might have looked around for a similar one that lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>When I got it though, did that remain true?</li>
            <li>It was a good buy, and I ended up coming back and buying another one of these for a friend.</li>
            <li>the reel cord is very convenient and I&#x27;m glad I bought this blowdryer from conair ha ha</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a cute color that is very close to the picture.  </li>
            <li>This dryer seems to be good enough; I bought it on a recommendation.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s all true, this saves money too.</li>
            <li>Unless you really want a cord-keeper dryer or have already chosen the ~$30 price point, I might look around more before settling on this one.</li>
            <li>I love the reel cord but also the fast drying time.</li>
            <li>Also the Cool button sets hair into place after styling hair.</li>
            <li>cool setting paired with the diffuser on this hair dryer solved my issue.</li>
            <li>and it came on with full power and</li>
            <li>and I was able to get it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Noise level is not bad either.</li>
            <li>at high setting, this blow dryer is way more powerful than i would expect!  </li>
            <li>It is nice and quiet and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>one is suitable, but I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button gets it as heat-free as I&#x27;ve ever experienced (with other dryers</li>
            <li>The cord works as well as I had hoped, and the unit has an added blessing as well: The housing doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot, so I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool before putting it away.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hairdryer about six months ago and it was fine at first.  </li>
            <li>Medium heat/high speed is somewhat adequate, but takes a lot longer.</li>
            <li>It has super power</li>
            <li>When I finally was able to contact someone on the phone I was told that yes, the year was a problem, but the company didn&#x27;t have any answer for fixing it, including not being able to take my information over the phone.</li>
            <li>The cord system is super convenient.</li>
            <li>Its super convenient and helps the bathroom look orderly.</li>
            <li>super quiet..and dries hair quickly....</li>
            <li>It left it looking smooth and with a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly without any frizz.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly with no hassles.</li>
            <li>quick.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought for my wife, it works super well and hiding the cord is awesome - especially when you have kids.</li>
            <li>Drys my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>drys hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This was a worthy purchase</li>
            <li>Wish they&#x27;d make soft, pliable ones that would be more comfortable to lift and twist hair.</li>
            <li>I love the color, but color is not the main feature to consider when buying a hair dryer,</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>But I love being able to set the heat several ways.  </li>
            <li>At least, it works great and has more options than I thought.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer and I use the diffuser mainly.</li>
            <li>The dryer is a bit heavier but heats hotter with more power and is quieter than older hair dryers.</li>
            <li>It drys my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dries your hair quickly</li>
            <li>and my hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I have always been a loyal conair customer.</li>
            <li>Even on high, the noise is dramatically muted (if you shower during your childs naptime as I do, then this is HUGE!).</li>
            <li>Definitly one of the most affordable I have ever purchased, yet has all of the style and effectiveness of a high end salon model.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer, doesn&#x27;t turn your hair into straw, and I love that it has a medium heat setting, instead of the usual hot and cool.  </li>
            <li>(I used to use high on my old one) and it works beautifully and is much quieter.</li>
            <li>My very first was purchased&lt;br /</li>
            <li>First, let me start by saying, I use my blow dryer lightly compared to others, so I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of this dryer.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>this is the very first thing I am returning.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, pretty color, and efficient heat.  </li>
            <li>This thing gets very hot, and has a lot of power, but with that power comes a lot of noise.</li>
            <li>Heat temps are good, and unit stays pretty cool even if used for several minutes.  </li>
            <li>retractable cord is good as long as it works....</li>
            <li>The high speed could even stand to be more powerful than it is.</li>
            <li>Not only is this a great hair dryer with 1870 watts and easy to clean filter and several heat and speed settings, but the cord is retractable.  </li>
            <li>this blow dryer definitely does MORE than what i would expect, and with the diffuser attachment i get fabulous sexy waves or with the concentrator attachment i get sleek straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with new blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Generally I like the results, just wish it was more comfortable to hold and didn&#x27;t blow the breaker.</li>
            <li>The cord retractor is great; at first I expected this to be just a marketing gimmick, but now I wouldn&#x27;t buy a dryer without one.</li>
            <li>Easy to use for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is super powerful too...</li>
            <li>Their quality is excellent and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Powerful hairdryer that does the job quickly.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, dries and styles my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>The retractable cord is very convenient and promotes easy storage.</li>
            <li>It might be nice if it had more oomph on the high setting, but my girlfriend says the same thing</li>
            <li>The first one has held up three plus years so we bought another one!</li>
            <li>It dries my fine, unruly hair quickly and frizz free, leaving it so soft.</li>
            <li>The cord is a little on the shorter side, but the dryer itself works great and dries the hair very fast!</li>
            <li>I only wish there were more color options, but for the quality the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>my wife absolutely loves this!!</li>
            <li>It is actually better than my old $120 blow dryer!</li>
            <li>It is very quiet and dries hair quickly, Love the rewind feature and that the filter can be cleaned easily.  </li>
            <li>It is actually much nicer looking than in the picture, it is quieter than my last dryer, it dries my hair a bit faster than my old dryer, and as for the temperature hot is hot warm is warm and the cool is truly cool!</li>
            <li>This is a great little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>this is a great little hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this dryer is perfect for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great convenience and the main reason I bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t get the fly away messy look from it.</li>
            <li>I bought this well over a year ago but wanted to write a review since I enjoy this hair dryer so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and am still happy with it.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast and leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet compared to the one my wife used to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised more women don&#x27;t have hearing loss from all the noise of these things.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful hair dryer and</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well, the Conair Infiniti is actually worth a second-look (</li>
            <li>My hand is usually up near the top buttons which are the heat settings and ones</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an incredibly convenient feature, especially living in a tiny NYC apartment.</li>
            <li>and I decided for the price, this was worth a go.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $20 I paid.</li>
            <li>My old dryer used to make my hair more knotted and yuck</li>
            <li>I had it for almost 4 years, so it was probably worth the price, but..</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t have a hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t store its own cord.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It has a hot, medium and cool setting (and</li>
            <li>also, when people say the cord is too short - since i researched and could not find the cord length written here anywhere, let me just tell you (now that i actually own the dryer)</li>
            <li>Nice blower for personal use....</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair, like me, it comes with a nice diffuser that is actually usable.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews carefully before purchasing this item, and I am now among the top percentage of 150% satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller, heavier but it does a really nice job.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s rather quiet, which is nice because I use it at 6:00 a.m. when my husband is still sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $.</li>
            <li>nice and quiet, retractable cord....</li>
            <li>This is a really nice mid size hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>and it only took 10 minutes, great because I have a 10 month old who doesn&#x27;t nap</li>
            <li>The reel back cord is a nice feature</li>
            <li>So far I love the dryer.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a nice blow dryer that works well.</li>
            <li>so I like to get a powerful blow dryer that can help speed up the process...</li>
            <li>What is so exciting about a hair dryer?</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it  ...</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is nice, but I had to struggle with it numerous times.</li>
            <li>Clearly I recommend this. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this dryer a couple of times but it is great so far.</li>
            <li>I think I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I also liked that fact that it had various heat settings.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord and red color was a nice feature as well.</li>
            <li>the price was much better than I expected and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>Love the speeds and the ease of use, it&#x27;s not heavy to hold</li>
            <li>The spring loaded wind-up cord works well and has a powerful motor.</li>
            <li>was able to order this and have it shipped directly to her.</li>
            <li>Has 3 setting and hot and cool.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and quiet, too.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it for the price and quality, though.</li>
            <li>Loud like most hair dryers.</li>
            <li>I also liked the different settings on it as well.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased thus far.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that powerful, and nothing worth raving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One quick word of warning about the cord, it retracts VERY fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter and the varied heat controls are very useful.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe I was able to purchase such a nice dryer for such an economical price!</li>
            <li>said it is very powerful and dries her hair fast and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li>she is awesome woman say that it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry there hair.</li>
            <li>The high speed is very powerful, and it dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>second issue is more significant.  </li>
            <li>The cool air option is great for my fine, thin hair.      </li>
            <li>I hold onto to the cord because it does retract pretty quickly</li>
            <li>This hair dryer&#x27;s cord is shorter (yet long enough for it&#x27;s purpose) and I find unplugging the cord, letting it settle, then pushing the retract button is the best way to be sure the cord coils up properly inside.  </li>
            <li>I love the happy hot pink color and especially like the retractible cord</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll learn to live with it, but when I&#x27;m trying to dry the hair of my 7 and 8 year olds, who move around a lot, a longer cord is welcome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone this long without ever using one, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be fine without it.</li>
            <li>Then I found this Conair 223XR in bright pink, and it had all three attributes, ionic, ceramic interior, and tourmaline!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s retractable cord, but it really hasn&#x27;t lived up to the original excitement.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is so nice, it doesn&#x27;t get tangled in with my 3 curling irons and flat iron.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this on Amazon, as it&#x27;s so much cheaper than at Ulta.  </li>
            <li>The heat is nice too, and though I believe it has a slightly lower temperature than my older unit, it&#x27;s more than adequate.</li>
            <li>This is just what we need, right?</li>
            <li>and they were right</li>
            <li>&quot; away at a right angle to the discharge of air.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>and if it is not plugged in just right it will not work.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the retractable cord does not work exactly right</li>
            <li>just the right temp.  </li>
            <li>soft.&lt;br /&gt;Priced right.</li>
            <li>With today&#x27;s technology, they could easily email me a voucher for a new dryer.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is pretty nice, although it is a very short cord.  </li>
            <li>Even without product, it does an excellent job of getting my hair dry, voluminous, and shiny with minimal disturbance and frizz, which as a curly girl is always an issue.</li>
            <li>Even without product, it does an excellent job of getting my hair dry, voluminous, and shiny with minimal disturbance and frizz, which as a curly girl is always an issue.</li>
            <li>Loved the retractable cord and how fast it could dry my overly-thick</li>
            <li>Not the most powerful or hot, but better than the previous ones.  </li>
            <li>My husband (who notices nothing, usually) even asked me what I had done to make my hair look so great.  </li>
            <li>While the retractable cord is a great idea,  it is not long enough.  </li>
            <li>but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>I like how it only takes me 7 minutes to dry my hair when its in on high and hot!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have a second one in my guest bathroom because everyone who stays at my house (I live at the beach) wants to borrow my hair dryer even if they bring their own!  </li>
            <li>The price and quality are great, it is very heavy duty.</li>
            <li>I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  </li>
            <li>I was going to do it, not having a clue what I would do without a hairdryer in the interim, when I checked Amazon again, and saw that I could buy a brand new one for $19.25 with no tax and, of course, free shipping.</li>
            <li>It certainly works!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I want straight hair, so I&#x27;ll brush and dry my hair at the same time for the straight hair, and it works great!</li>
            <li>The price was great and it had all the features of the much more expensive one I&#x27;d just thrown away.</li>
            <li>Although more powerful, lighter in weight and smaller in size.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use a hair dryer on a regular basis, so I asked my niece who is a beautician to use it and tell me how she liked it</li>
            <li>As far as hair dryers for daily bathroom use go, this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a nice working hair dryer that pumps out the heat to dry hair</li>
            <li>I would recommend the dryer, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure it&#x27;s worth the difference in price to the cheaper model (which is lighter and has bigger</li>
            <li>Great for personal use and for one person using daily.</li>
            <li>I have dropped this thing, abused it, broken pieces off of it, and haven&#x27;t really taken care of it, yet it continues to work flawlessly.</li>
            <li>But it dries my hair super fast.</li>
            <li>I love the choices between low, medium and high and also low, warm, hot and cool.  </li>
            <li>it does reduce frizz and makes it very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy how quickly it got my hair dry and loved the cord keeper feature but based on the experience it will be a long time before I purchase another Conair product.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much up until that point that I went and bought another of the exact same hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer, gets your hair dry in no time and the cord  gets store in the same dryer, my daughter loves it, thanks a lot!!</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to hold, not heavy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t change very much, so</li>
            <li>in all, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I like the hair dryer it does my hair very fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything I was looking for in a dryer and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>When I went to buy a new one, I wanted to replace with same model because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>She liked that I was able to use the cooler setting especially when blowing it on her face to dry her bangs.</li>
            <li>Some hairdryers take a long time to cool down afterwards, but I am happy to report that the Infiniti cooled off quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer is very powerful, the cord is longer than my other cord keeper dryer, and I love all the settings.  </li>
            <li>No more digging in my travel bags with its great new color!!</li>
            <li>I have used it a few times, although my hair is short, and I think the product is a great value with its safety features and its many high technology features.</li>
            <li>and I decided the Conair Infiniti Cord Reel was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I always go to Amazon first when making a purchase</li>
            <li>so naturally I checked to see if it was available.</li>
            <li>very does what is claimed alsome!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it a higher review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice having a retractable cord, but be careful that it doesn&#x27;t flip the plug up and pop you.  </li>
            <li>Since most of us only want to use a dryer once or twice a day, this should hold up well.</li>
            <li>My husband looked and said it draws as much power as our microwave!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I stuck it out for several reasons.  </li>
            <li>Plus, this dryer was rated Top 10 on several sites</li>
            <li>The one thing I can see is that if you were used to a hair dryer that \\&quot;just\\&quot; blew hot air, you might think this dryer makes your hair flatter.  </li>
            <li>Anything similar in quality and features cost more money</li>
            <li>Not as hot as the dryer it replaced, but I adapted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty and works well.</li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>The thing that first drew me to this hairdryer?  </li>
            <li>Time so splurge for real quality!</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased lasted almost 2 years before it stopped working.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get hot anywhere</li>
            <li>I think a hair dryer should last more than a year.</li>
            <li>I have fine and long hair and it took me 25 min to dry all my hair which is a pretty good time</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very lightweight!</li>
            <li>I was replacing one that had many of the same features as this one, except it felt like it was piercing my eardrums to use it.</li>
            <li>The cord does retract (snaps FAST -- watch out!)</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>I will come back and update my review after more use.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet compared to many dryers I have had.  </li>
            <li>It performs exactly as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li>Does an exactly job drying</li>
            <li>Love the different settings.  </li>
            <li>The first one I had lasted maybe 1 year then quit, I contacted Conair they opened a ticket, I mailed it to them</li>
            <li>Dryer works well &amp; doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>Love the red.</li>
            <li>my favorite hair dryer finally  gave up:/  </li>
            <li>I especially like being able to reel the cord in for easier storage.</li>
            <li>I love that the cord retracts back into the handle for storing.</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to put away when done using it and also makes it nice while using it that you don&#x27;t have to have a long cord dangling in your way.</li>
            <li>Love the cord; not quite enough power.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer but the last one went on me after one year.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty in color and looks exactly like it does online.  </li>
            <li>If you are considering buying this product I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are a bunch of pro features that it may not have, but it is exactly as described and it has been a solid performer every day for about a year now.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted 5+ years.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing I bought on-line before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered lots of things on Amazon before, but this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so use the low speed setting mostly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the blue button on the top of the handle.  </li>
            <li>and my hair still feels light and soft.</li>
            <li>It stores much better than my last one without the hassle of wrapping the cord.  </li>
            <li>but, still pretty.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing super fancy about it, I just like the color, had decent reviews</li>
            <li>well, for the first 4 months or so anyway.</li>
            <li>If you want to be scientific, order the top ten and try each one out.</li>
            <li>I have medium length thin hair and so far it&#x27;s working great for me :)</li>
            <li>Pretty color</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely digging the retractable cord!</li>
            <li>For the price I was skeptical but holy moly is this thing awesome!  </li>
            <li>So, I got creative and purchased a solid marble drinking cup at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li>But I guess that is more of a personal problem ha ha ha!</li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I am told this hairdryer is really hot in temperature, perhaps to hot for hair drying.  </li>
            <li>My last hair dryer broke because the cord was bet at the entry to the dryer too many times and shorted out.</li>
            <li>I pulled it out the first time I used it</li>
            <li>given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design &amp; feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but</li>
            <li>given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li>Well first it doesnt have a hook to hang it :</li>
            <li>on the highest setting, the temperature does not get that hot.</li>
            <li>I had one just like this for many years and it finally broke.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth, not dried out</li>
            <li>: After 60 days it has started making a grinding noise for about 15-20 seconds when first turned on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for in a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I have no problem with the hot setting being that hot</li>
            <li>It does not get too hot and does not cause my hair does not get frizzy.</li>
            <li>Was really bummed!</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not to hot on hot setting&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not bald, but pretty close.  </li>
            <li>, the weight is fine, and she says she&#x27;s got less static in her hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve burned out hair dryers before, but never had one that was ok one day and not working the next.</li>
            <li>Love that it has different speed and heat settings.</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Positives: Good amount of heat and blow, a few settings to switch it up.</li>
            <li>This is not a cheap throw-away, it is a good value.</li>
            <li>The different heat levels are great with the cool down to set the curl</li>
            <li>This is USEFUL for you stylish gents who are not just looking for a device to merely dry</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this and not a super cheap one.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who needs a fabulous, quiet, affordable, space &amp; time saving hair dryer loaded with features.ang my dryer on the wall using a brass hook, which works just fine.</li>
            <li>It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year.</li>
            <li>works a bit too well and best to hold button with one hand and guide the cords back with the other as it snaps back quickly.</li>
            <li>I also own one and so does my other daughter.</li>
            <li>am surprised to see that in about 11 months time, this dryer has gone up in price by 2.5 times what I originally paid.  </li>
            <li>Having used it now for several weeks, I found that it is light enough not to tire my arms, and it has the three temp settings including cool, along with the cool shot!</li>
            <li>I know this was voted \\&quot;Best Hairdryer!!!\\&quot; by like 5 beauty magazines, and it does seem to dry hair pretty efficiently, but this review applies to guys with short hair that need to use a hair dryer to SHAPE their hair into styles (such as mohawks or fauxhawks).</li>
            <li>One could probably rig some kind of keyring zip tied around the flared fitting that guides the cord into the dryer body if you must have something to hang it from, but I found it unnecessary for my setup.</li>
            <li>One could probably rig some kind of keyring zip tied around the flared fitting that guides the cord into the dryer body if you must have something to hang it from, but I found it unnecessary for my setup.</li>
            <li>wired only good for home use, kinda short.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a more quiet engine but still dries fast</li>
            <li>The cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button (no heat at all).</li>
            <li>This thing pumps out hot air pretty much instantaneously.</li>
            <li>Ordered because of good price, multiple heat settings, and multiple speed settings.  </li>
            <li>I started out using the hot setting and then moved down to the warm setting as her hair was drying.</li>
            <li>I especially like that it has the ceramic heater since it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn my 2 year old great granddaugher when she is in the the bathroom with me.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a powerful hairdryer.</li>
            <li>This was still a little more than I wished to spend, but I found out it was worth it!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that gets frizzy and needs to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Infiniti, by Conair, is light and easy to handle, even when you&#x27;re using a brush with your other hand!  </li>
            <li>For the average person, this dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li>For its size, it&#x27;s not all that heavy and the color is very stylish.</li>
            <li>I did use it pretty much every day</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try it out; I&#x27;ve used cheap hairdryers my entire life, so the prospect of less hair frizz and better product longevity had me stoked.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very powerful; your hair will dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>Choose the best one and send back the other ten.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it took significantly more time to dry.</li>
            <li>The retractible cord is nice because it lets you store the dryer in less space without fighting with the cord.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a picky person since I just tend to dry my hair partially most days.</li>
            <li>Quiet and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is more important to me than the cord retractor, which I don&#x27;t use; those things usually stop working after a while anyway.    </li>
            <li>My teen aged daughter is loving this hair styler!</li>
            <li>It has not dried out my hair and it is quick.</li>
            <li>Hair never looked better with just a brush and dry.  </li>
            <li>I am able to dry my hair in under 4 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It feels solid and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>With heat options &#x27;hot&#x27;, &#x27;warm&#x27;, and &#x27;cool&#x27;, and power levels &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27;, there are plenty of way to dry and style your hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  </li>
            <li>would certainly recommend this dryer and it deserves the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>I plug it in and have to have the cord in a certain position or it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>So be smart:</li>
            <li>As bit large for travel</li>
            <li>This dryer really does dry your hair fast and it made my hair look very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I had to purchase a new one - and it was not this model!!</li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my old dryer, but this may actually be better for my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe i&#x27;m late on this new technology but its great.</li>
            <li>it worked great but it only lasted a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too loud and is super fast at getting the job done.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is not very big which is just fine with me.</li>
            <li>It does have a short cord, but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>(I would have liked to give it 4.75 if I could) is because it takes a little while to heat up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use: not too heavy; 3 temperature settings; easy to put away; buttons don&#x27;t block anything; reasonable price; enough drying power...</li>
            <li>It dries hair quickly, and the concentrator attachment really works well so that you can put the dryer right next to your brush.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise,  take care not to drop it on a hard floor.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m being honest, I expected a little more from this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair &amp; scalp, so USE CAREFULLY</li>
            <li>Light, quiet an works really well.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is great because of a few key features:</li>
            <li>It dries hair fast as well.  </li>
            <li>I have to stand very close to the plug point</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I actually had to send my boyfriend out to CVS to buy a cheap model I&#x27;d used without any problems before.  </li>
            <li>I also love the pink color - it makes it easier to spot in my closet.  </li>
            <li>The retractable AC cord is built- in, works well and is very convenient for storage.</li>
            <li>Before I bought it, I didn&#x27;t care so much about the retractable cord</li>
            <li>I really recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle much.</li>
            <li>I love pink.</li>
            <li>I love that this hairdryer is pink.    </li>
            <li>and I love pink.</li>
            <li>found the Infiniti to be a very usable hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned before, I really do like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It really does work to minimize the frizzies in humid weather.  </li>
            <li>This makes getting it out and putting it away much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  </li>
            <li>And because the cord is retractable, you can&#x27;t really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  </li>
            <li>I have a very finicky daughter.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is very convenient.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t blow my hair so much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the WHOLE reason I wanted this model.</li>
            <li>Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly.</li>
            <li>Eventhough I do not use them very often they are there if I need them.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use too much heat.</li>
            <li>Press the retract button gently until you get an idea of how fast it&#x27;s going to move.    </li>
            <li>It comes with attachments which is a plus but doesn&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li>The defuser makes my hair fuller than it really is.</li>
            <li>It came very soon after ordering it.  </li>
            <li>cord is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I really like the 3 heat settings and how fast my hair dries.</li>
            <li>Not really a problem for most people, unless like me you have arthritic joints.</li>
            <li>airflow is generous and I can&#x27;t say if the ions do anything, but it&#x27;s fast at drying my medium length hair.</li>
            <li>* fast drying</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Does a fast job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li>Really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Its very compact</li>
            <li>I also like the retracting cord, it makes storing so much easier.</li>
            <li>&amp; then there is the benefit of how much faster it dries my hair.  </li>
            <li>it is supposed to really like the dryer</li>
            <li>Really, does something like that happen.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Conair products since my very 1st blow dryer over 30 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It is not advertised as a particularly quiet model, which is important to me, but it is.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I really like how it drys.</li>
            <li>Seems very well made, but I wish I had something lighter.</li>
            <li>Really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The ceramic/ionic features must be doing their jobs because it really lives up to the description.</li>
            <li>So when I went to look for a blowdryer all I really wanted it have was attachments- because I realized that not all blowdryers come with attachments-</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Have had this for about a year and it is not only still going string, but is still in fantastic shape.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if the tourmaline ceramic ionic feature really makes a difference, though.  </li>
            <li>But after using it, I&#x27;ve found a bunch of added bonus, one of which is how fast it dries my hair.</li>
            <li>And the cord doesn&#x27;t retract too fast and hit you in the hand.</li>
            <li>the back grille should be easy to open &amp; clean out lint.</li>
            <li>Very customizable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend!</li>
            <li>The cord can be &amp;#34;sucked in&amp;#34; in 2 secs and then just put the whole thing away.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>This dryer works very well -</li>
            <li>The number one thing I like about this hair dryer is that it is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It really was the reason I purchased this product over others.</li>
            <li>Not as much OOMPH as the one I lost</li>
            <li>This product arrived fast, too.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient for a college student like me and it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is very efficient.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and the reel up cord makes for really neat storage.</li>
            <li>but it works much faster.  </li>
            <li>I used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference, the Conair was only 76db vs. 83db from the Andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Expected more life.</li>
            <li>When it does this it makes me just want to wrap the cord around the dryer negating the whole idea of the reel.  </li>
            <li>We were looking for a hair dryer for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>There are cheaper models, but this one is very well made</li>
            <li>I use it with the diffuser (haven&#x27;t attempted a straight styling with it yet)</li>
            <li>Very sturdily built.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s 30 and knows what she wants.</li>
            <li>Thankfully this one is much quieter and he digs the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it with</li>
            <li>But... The dryer itself has really helped my hair.</li>
            <li>I was going to return it, but it was too much of a hassle</li>
            <li>I hang my blow dryer in a over the door hair product caddy,  and it&#x27;s much easier to close the cabinet door now without a cord getting in the way.</li>
            <li>Retractable cord is very convenient for traveling and storage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really to mention..</li>
            <li>This is nothing to really change how I use the blow dryer, but this should probably not happen.</li>
            <li>It is light, and has several options to use.  </li>
            <li>One of my biggest gripes about hairdryers is when they blow too much air</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t retract the whole way and leaves 6 inches of cord exposed.</li>
            <li>One feature I really like is the retracting cord.</li>
            <li>Why anyone wants one where the cord is all over</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The cord keeper is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Also stores away very neatly.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty cool and the retractable cord is a BIG</li>
            <li>The cold shot button is a nice feature too which I seldom use, but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Not having to deal with wrapping up the cord is such a plus...the retractable cord works beautifully and saves space in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s kind of heavy and 2)</li>
            <li>It dries my thick shoulder length hair in about 12 minutes (on a good day).</li>
            <li>it is very light compared to my other hairdryers and the cord winder works very well</li>
            <li>The dry time is very fast, and the retractable cord is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the reviews were right about the cord being slightly short, but that&#x27;s expected to keep a tidy cord keeper.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is only 4 ft. long, but again that&#x27;s adequate in most situations.</li>
            <li>The pink color is pretty, and makes it easy to find in my pile of hair instruments.</li>
            <li>And its got some nice attachments too like a huge SERIOUS diffuser !</li>
            <li>Its not very heavy or particularly loud and the amazing thing is, it actually reels the cord in!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift right as my old hair dryer crapped out on on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud, the heat settings are just right</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d easily give up a long cord for the convenience of it being retractable.</li>
            <li>I have never used this new dryer for longer than 5 minutes because it dries so quickly without leaving that singed, damaged feel I used to get with my old dryer.</li>
            <li>Hadn&#x27;t bought a new dryer in years because I have short fine hair and don&#x27;t need one much.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a warm setting (not just hot and cold)</li>
            <li>the current cost (T3 (originally cost $300, now $95).&lt;br /&gt;Faster</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the T3 with no problems for 3 years but just got the Infinity.&lt;br /&gt;Claims - neither one gives my hair more sheen or softness than any other hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is much quieter, but not sure it&#x27;s more powerful......</li>
            <li>The jury is still out on the dryer itself as I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to know its durability/reliability, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The color is nice (red, not pink), it is not too loud, there are 2 speeds and 3 temperatures.</li>
            <li>This thing is quiet and powerful!  </li>
            <li>but IMO this hairdryer doesn&#x27;t give off the heat or air pressure of other top blow dryers on the market.</li>
            <li>I love that the cord is retractable, I would just prefer if there were a loop or some other way to hang it and have it out of the way in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who needs a fabulous, quiet, affordable, space &amp; time saving hair dryer loaded with features.</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts a long time because I like it fine.</li>
            <li>Wrapping a cord around the handle every time gets old pretty fast when you&#x27;re using a dryer every day.</li>
            <li>Hair dryer is much heavier than my older model - I believe it&#x27;s because of the reel inside the dryer for the cord.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like is that it is quite loud, but other than that, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>High wattage for fast drying.  </li>
            <li>love this blow dryer - cool with retractable cord and small that fits when you travel!</li>
            <li>They may want to consider push buttons that lock and unlock as well as using some light weight manufacturing materials or new style servo on the next model.</li>
            <li>I got it replaced by Amazon right away who sent me the exact same one.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m asking for too much, but this one seems a little shorter than my last, and I find myself pulling on it fairly</li>
            <li>After a couple months of that silliness, it now won&#x27;t retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  </li>
            <li>many hair dryers get super hot even on meduim heat, this has a very soft medium heat, and is hot enough... and I am not sure what all makes it work so well, but it dries hair FAST.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that.</li>
            <li>This dryer changed my baby fine, thin hair that frizzes in humidity and loses volume in dry climates to lovely, silky brilliantly shiny locks.  </li>
            <li>One thing I have noticed is that my kids now complain the air is too hot, something they didn&#x27;t do with the old dryer (I have to switch to medium heat, and then it takes longer).</li>
            <li>Does not get as hot as my old Conair hair dryer did.</li>
            <li>There was nothing I could do to get it to come back on with full power.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad dryer.</li>
            <li>The solid marble cup is heavy enough to hold down the dryer, it fit perfectly into the interior of the cup, AND eliminated the counter-top clutter of a power cord.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than my older pink Revlon dryer, and it seems only slightly more powerful.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this dryer down to Africa,from the U.S.However,on receiving Infiniti Conair dryer;i</li>
            <li>In hot, humid weather, the cool setting allows me to dry my hair and not overheat while doing so!</li>
            <li>my new hair dryer!</li>
            <li>There are 2 heat settings (low &amp; high) and a cool setting.</li>
            <li>I used the new dryer this morning and my hair dried quick and frizz free.</li>
            <li>and I cannot dry or style my hair comfortably.</li>
            <li>The ionic feature makes my hair dry silky and smooth, believe-it-or-not,</li>
            <li>She likes it better than her previous one, so that was already a plus.</li>
            <li>Works like a decent dryer, but I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in frizz-control.</li>
            <li>The first Conair I ever owned lasted me almost 22 years, so I definitely wanted another Conair and was willing to give the Infinity 223XR a try.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely heavy if you are comparing it to a TRAVEL dryer; in which case i don&#x27;t even know why you&#x27;re purchasing a regular sized dryer and assuming it will be a good travel sized dryer.  </li>
            <li>Works well and particularly like the auto-reel feature.  </li>
            <li>I decided to do a noise comparison of all the dryers we had in the house and sure enough, per minute of drying time, the Infinity was the second quietest.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is fairly heavy and kind of loud.</li>
            <li>Comes with all the extra accessories and has three heat settings and two speed settings, which results in quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted for years, so when it was time to replace it, I wanted the exact same one.  </li>
            <li>The main plus...</li>
            <li>Luckily that is the only con!</li>
            <li>blow as strong as expected for</li>
            <li>I love the retractable cord and the different heat settings, as opposed to just having low and high options.  </li>
            <li>This dryer definitely gets the job done faster, with MUCH less noise on high that is easily tolerated comfortably sans earplugs, which was a high priority.</li>
            <li>After reading several hair dryer reviews, I was very interested in the 213X model in this line:</li>
            <li>I love the retracting cord too - no tangled up mess.  </li>
            <li>I love how I don&#x27;t have to mess around with the cord anymore.  </li>
            <li>Red color is very pretty also.  </li>
            <li>Because I take good care of my appliances and they tend to last a long time, I thought I had simply gotten a lemon.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer was too heavy, and, although it claims 1875 watt, it was neither as strong or hot as the ION I had been using</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It scorched my hair on high heat.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Over all I highly recommend this dryer, you can;t beat the quality and the price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I keep it in High..</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>I have had high end hair dryer&#x27;s and inexpensive like this style.  </li>
            <li>but I always use high anyway &#x27;cause  </li>
            <li>When I turn it on, it feel like I have it on a medium setting, instead of high.  </li>
            <li>girly color, 2) retractable cord, 3) high power.  </li>
            <li>I like the high speed without having to use high heat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy (??!!).</li>
            <li>it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don&#x27;t use it) but my style lasts days longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the weight of it now, and the buttons are more managable--it just took a little time to adjust to the difference.  </li>
            <li>Ok, yes, it is a little bulky, but it&#x27;s because it has tons</li>
            <li>It could use a little more air flow power though.  </li>
            <li>I am convinced there is no perfect hair dryer out there, but this particular one does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My just past the shoulders, curly hair is dry in minutes, the retractable cord is very handy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for teenagers, people who travel a lot, or just anyone who tends to use things more heavily than others.</li>
            <li>but this dryer actually makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>The product is ok, and does the job, but compared to other Infinity hair dryers by Conair, this one isnt as powerful and thus takes longer to dry the hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than my old hair dryer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had it 18 whole months, and it completely quit working.</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;ve just had my hair professionally done (no lie, really).</li>
            <li>And the cord keeper is such a great function, you will never go back to using a messy cord again.</li>
            <li>The biggie though is how much quieter it is than my old dryer</li>
            <li>As another reviewer commented, you have to destroy the packaging to get it out, but I am going to do my best to get it back in there &amp; sealed up to return as this was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo much quieter than my old dryer that my dog doesn&#x27;t need to leave the room now.</li>
            <li>This dries my hair much faster than my old one.</li>
            <li>&gt; some years ago and did not die for many years of everyday use.</li>
            <li>Low speed is not even worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, here&#x27;s my girl next door review for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Its quite powerful, with two different speed settings and the cord-keeper function is so helpful.</li>
            <li>this hairdryer isn&#x27;t as powerful as my last one</li>
            <li>She has a head full of long blond hair</li>
            <li>I just got this hairdryer a few days ago for Christmas, so I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s longevity, but I love it already.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need such a powerful machine, My mistake I guess, but threw away the box before I realized.</li>
            <li>And the red color is fun too.</li>
            <li>Donated those to the gym lockerroom and decided to spend a few dollars more for this one.  </li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair, and this is the first blow dryer I have owned that actually helps to reduce frizz.</li>
            <li>However after 3 months of normal use (used it once a day for about 5/7 days a week).  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I had hoped and the filter keeps falling off the back.  </li>
            <li>but I found it to be more than long enough for me.</li>
            <li>(she normally has a &#x27;frizz&#x27; problem).  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 6 years and then the cord wore out and was exposing bare wires</li>
            <li>I normally do keep receipts for any appliance I purchase</li>
            <li>Low noise, but powerful.</li>
            <li>The different heat/speed settings were useful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and does dry a little faster, but I prefer the Conair, which was quieter and at peak performance</li>
            <li>It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  </li>
            <li>I tried it in other outlets to be certain and sure enough, it will not longer turn on.</li>
            <li>I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren&#x27;t super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life.</li>
            <li>Other than that it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  </li>
            <li>and he said it&#x27;s common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful.</li>
            <li>I am able to dry my hair with my daughter&#x27;s room door open and she does not stir.</li>
            <li>Dries my hairs so much quicker than my previous drier and leaves it feeling smooth and</li>
            <li>It did have a powerful fan and dried my hair quickly</li>
            <li>Very convenient and the retractable cord makes it easy to store without the hassle of dealing with a messy cord.</li>
            <li>With my other hairdryers I would frequently have my hair sucked into the back of the dryer, burning my hair and catching it in the fan.  </li>
            <li>I now use a Q-tip, simply touch the tip against the lint, twirl, and the lint gets tangled in the Q-tip and comes right off.     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to upgrade or replace an old hair dryer!</li>
            <li>The older one is still unpleasantly loud on high though, and I was having to use earplugs while drying my hair just to keep the noise out.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer claims to have all of that, but the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; heat setting is so cool that I have to use &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; if I ever want my hair to actually dry.  </li>
            <li>I usualy get these types of hair dryers, con air or revlon, not too expensive and I prefer the ones with two switches like this one has- off, low, hi and a cool, warm hot switch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty quiet, and the ceramic coil doesn&#x27;t produce the burning smell like older hair driers do.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky smooth with virtually no frizz or extreme dryness.  </li>
            <li>Now I really like it because it has three different heat settings, plus a button for extra cool.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than most other simple hair dryers I&#x27;ve used and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It is also pretty quiet for it&#x27;s high wattage.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new hairdryer - you should give this model a try.</li>
            <li>i think i&#x27;d rather get a new one that lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I had a hairdryer for over 10 years when I decided it was time to let it go and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair&#x27;s headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     </li>
            <li>They could also send me a prepaid shipping label and not charge me shipping and handling for a new dryer.      </li>
            <li>Because I knew was going to purchase a new blowdryer for college</li>
            <li>I have wanted a new dryer for ages, but kept waiting because I couldn&#x27;t decide on what to get.  </li>
            <li>I gave this to my wife as a gift and still its working as new.</li>
            <li>I had just bought a new insert.  </li>
            <li>but we live in a townhome).</li>
            <li>and you have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer</li>
            <li>When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s been a while since you bought a new one, go for it.</li>
            <li>Hence, my new replacement.</li>
            <li>She loves the new one.</li>
            <li>I had to go out and purchase a new dryer I went with the remington again.</li>
            <li>I just got me new blow dryer</li>
            <li>Live the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>Bought it at a chain store, so don&#x27;t know if I still have the receipt to look into the warranty, but I&#x27;ve already ordered a new hair dryer here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It has 3 speed settings (low, med, high), 2 temperature settings (low, high), and a cool button.</li>
            <li>Our fine hair usually shows broken hairs or growing hairs and this dryer makes all that smooth and more polished.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the color, it actually looks more of a reddish purple to me than pink.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and wanted something that can blow dry my hair quickly and this product is what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li>The cord sometimes doesn&#x27;t go in all the way, I have to pull it back out a bit and press the button again, but this really hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me, and my vanity drawer is much neater now.</li>
            <li>My old dryer (my very old dryer!) needed to be replaced</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works fine, but if you don&#x27;t want your counter stained pink, don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product and suggest that you purchase it directly from Amazon, as we did.</li>
            <li>My hair is almost frizz free after I blow dry, so I can just quickly run my flat iron over it rather than having to iron tiny sections to remove the frizz.</li>
            <li>This dries my hair very quickly, and while I&#x27;m not sure how much I believe in the ion and ceramic technology, my hair does seem to have a sheen after drying.  </li>
            <li>I like the multiple heat settings and the high and low and cool shot button.  </li>
            <li>As long as they make this particular model, that will be my first choice if something happens to my new one.</li>
            <li>: This dryer is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>(i.e. I could actually complete drying my hair without shaking/clinching my arm in pain!)  </li>
            <li>The cord is also pretty short.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this dryer EXCEPT the \\&quot;low\\&quot; speed while on \\&quot;hot\\&quot; is NOT hot enough.</li>
            <li>All things considered, and comparing this to various other dryer/stylers that I&#x27;ve used over the years, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>Compared to my last one, this dries so fast!</li>
            <li>I am willing to spend the extra money for a quality dryer.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  </li>
            <li>I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don&#x27;t have faith this one will last.</li>
            <li>This is second time i&#x27;ve bought this dryer, after first one servced me well.  </li>
            <li>but if you use the lower setting it is actually pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>Got my first same hair dryer about 9 years ago, it just died, (however I used it maybe 2-10 times a month)&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is one feature that I totally love - the RETRACTING CORD - no more wrapping the cord around the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This one is significantly quieter than any other I have owned.  </li>
            <li>It suddenly stopped producing hot air.  </li>
            <li>My married daughter has asked for only one thing for her birthday...</li>
            <li>Still, I like this blowdryer more than the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>This begs the question of reliability of the Conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the Conair model, this could cause more heat build up of the motor.</li>
            <li>Finally, in frustration, I decided to look for the exact dryer I used to have</li>
            <li>I had this blowdryer for 2+ years when it blew out and had to be replaced (totally my fault by the way, didnt realize you are suppose to clean out the back of blowdryers.</li>
            <li>the retractable cord doesn&#x27;t have any problems, the air intake never sucks my long hair in and the color is even a nice midway point between red and pink.</li>
            <li>She needed a new one, so I surprised her with this one.</li>
            <li>I am really picky about hair dryers since I have long very think hair.</li>
            <li>The dryer dried my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to put it away everyday in a drawer instead of leaving it out on the counter, still plugged in.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and saves a few seconds each morning.</li>
            <li>Luckily this dryer is pretty light and while it is only slightly painful toward the end of my drying time, it should be just fine for people without wrist</li>
            <li>My old dryer had to have the cord wrapped around it a million times, but overall, it was pretty compact.</li>
            <li>In use the dryer is pretty well balanced, and what surprised me, fairly quiet as well.</li>
            <li>The bearing in my wife&#x27;s blow dryer was getting pretty loud (enough to wake me up in the morning - she gets up before me).  </li>
            <li>My puppy chewed up my first one, and bought another type at Target, but it was SO loud, and I took it back.</li>
            <li>I thought my strong, volleyball playing daughter might want it, but she also said it was too heavy.</li>
            <li>: dries hair quickly (I was using it on high for the first few weeks, but today I set the temperature to medium and my hair still dried fairly quickly),</li>
            <li>This new one is a good dryer, works well, but there are some drawbacks which have resulted in the mediocre score</li>
            <li>Controls - more options, less likely to unintentially</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is very quiet, drys quickly, prevents frizz and includes two attachments all for an extremely low price.</li>
            <li>I turned it on for first time (without attachments), I thought oh this hair dryer is significantly less powerful than my normal one, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s right because it dries my hair much faster.</li>
            <li>My old Conair dryer finally kicked the bucket and I needed a new dryer fast.</li>
            <li>The design is stylish, it&#x27;s very quiet compared to my old dryer, which thrills my roomie, since I typically shower and style at 2 a.m.</li>
            <li>This one is powerful (dries my hair in much less time), lightweight, useful accessories and multiple settings.</li>
            <li>Many other hair dryer manufacture&#x27;s produce a product that lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way</li>
            <li>Out of the box, this dryer certainly comes with all of the \\&quot;essential</li>
            <li>I wanted quiet, cord reel, high power, and high heat.  </li>
            <li>I had really long hair when I first got it, and then I cut my hair super short recently, so I have yet to figure out how the diffuser works.  </li>
            <li>The only \\&quot;complaint&#x27; is that the cord seems a bit short, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s so it can adequately retract into the unit.  </li>
            <li>It does get a little hot, but not too hot.</li>
            <li>but it is extremely quick in wrapping up, so be careful!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get 5 stars as it is a little heavy, but would buy it again it that good.</li>
            <li>Due to this, it takes much more time to dry my hair than I am used to.  </li>
            <li>so it makes it kind of hard to store in a regular sized vanity drawer.</li>
            <li>Dryer works quickly, yes a little noisy, but that&#x27;s on high speed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about 15 times so far, so while I can&#x27;t really comment on how well this dryer holds up over time, I can review on the following features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is faster compared to my old one, the cord doesn&#x27;t use extra space as it rolls inside, which I find very convenient.</li>
            <li>It is much heavier than my old Revlon blow dryer that I finally had to replace.  </li>
            <li>Not to heavy or loud which in my house is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>It is much heavier than my current hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this directly from Amazon.com for my wife.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft and shiny that I have to use a volumizing gel to get any lift.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for frequent travel.</li>
            <li>This dryer is not harsh on my hair....</li>
            <li>so far-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for well over a year so far</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely died, but sometimes you have to smack it to get it to come on.</li>
            <li>purchased this to replace old conair dryer that the cord reel had ceased to work....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I was using a 25 year old, 1200 watt hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The first is minor...</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it was smaller than I expected and by it&#x27;s relatively light weight.</li>
            <li>consider that a professional dries my hair in 45 min</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s time efficient, not unbearably loud, and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my mother to replace her old blow dryer.</li>
            <li>When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  </li>
            <li>The problem is actually that the retractable cord sticks straight out (&amp; won&#x27;t bend at all), about four inches from the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li>I just did 4/5 stars because the cord sticks out so far when fully retracted and that was a bit of a bummer for my expectations.</li>
            <li>cord reel was a must-have option for me, as was the diffuser attachment since I have naturally curly hair and like to style it that way.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>yes it is loud</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this blow dryer for at least 7 or more years.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember how long I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer exactly, but I know I bought it when my daughter was a baby</li>
            <li>Being a man and purchasing this as a gift for my wife I was looking for something that was of professional quality.</li>
            <li>Once the cord is unwound, it&#x27;s really not heavy (and you wouldn&#x27;t use it with the cord retracted).  </li>
            <li>86 dBA is LOUD.</li>
            <li>, so far i have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li>I know, it sounds far fetched, but for me, this dryer delivered what it claimed.  </li>
            <li>and this really does a terrific job.</li>
            <li>Just DON&#x27;T pull the cord too far out else</li>
            <li>Am always surprised when something does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do in the description.  </li>
            <li>but the cord sure sucks in well.</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li>The moment I pulled the dryer out of the box, I thought - wow,</li>
            <li>(realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers)</li>
            <li>loud.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.....</li>
            <li>I like the dryer because of the cord reel feature, I just wish it was not so loud.</li>
            <li>Mind you, my old dryer was almost 6-7 years old</li>
            <li>so I purchased this dryer from my local store because it was reasonably priced and it had the reel style cord.  </li>
            <li>I prefer my old Revlon Ionic Pro Sylist.</li>
            <li>It is languishing in the donations at the moment and I am using the old dryer.</li>
            <li>My least favorite color.</li>
            <li>but it straightens my natural locks</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li>This one is considerably quieter than my old dryer, too.  </li>
            <li>and it dries our hair in 2 or 3 minutes completely.  </li>
            <li>There are many models that have the same number of speed and temperature settings, so the only reason I chose this model over others was the retractable cord,  The instructions tell you to be careful with it and to never over extend the cord.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the last thing I do when I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>My hair is left silky and straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doable but I have to watch that I don&#x27;t turn around or move too far from the outlet.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a while the diffuser has melted and is deformed completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too loud</li>
            <li>I replaced my 13-year old Conair hair dryer with this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The heating settings are very standard and work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and the air is not drying.  </li>
            <li>I now know I need to stay with the professional models.</li>
            <li>I love all the different speed and heat settings and how well dried my hair helping me to avoid the freeze hair I get with humid weather.</li>
            <li>I found this dryer to be pretty heavy and way too hot.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, quiet, dries hair quickly, multiple settings give you options.  </li>
            <li>If you specifically WANT a retractable cord, the extra weight is worth it, otherwise, it&#x27;s just extra weight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my roommate who has thin hair LOVES this hair dryer and is even considering getting her own.</li>
            <li>It does a good enough a job drying hair (not significantly faster or slower than any other 1875 watt dryer).</li>
            <li>Kind of heavy, cord sometimes doesn&#x27;t roll up all the way, not very powerful but my hair is soft when using it.</li>
            <li>The cord is so unbelievably short that I am boxing this thing up and sending it right back.  </li>
            <li>Also I really was surprised at how much power this draws, it blows the breaker if I have lights on in other rooms.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it travels, small!</li>
            <li>Dry your hair on hot.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to then flat iron as much as I did before with my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this dryer for two and a half years, and it just died, but that&#x27;s not bad for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I was also expecting a better dry from an ionic dryer, but my hair didn&#x27;t seem any less frizzy.</li>
            <li>Air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the Conair and 198 degrees on the Andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached, all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory.</li>
            <li>When I saw this one, I was pretty much mesmerized - not only did it come with attachments( including the diffuser), but it was pink and</li>
            <li>The high speed setting is equal to the medium speed on my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li>My favorite blow dryer finally died, so I was forced to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>The cord is shorter than my older dryer by about 8 inches, but for me, it doesn&#x27;t present a problem.  </li>
            <li>My hair is softer and non-fuzzy, a daily occurrence with my older hair</li>
            <li>It has all of the settings (hot, warm &amp; cold) plus the settings are on a slide as opposed to the toggle settings.</li>
            <li>It is not super noisy and dries my hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the first one I had only lasted about 2 years</li>
            <li>I bought it as an extra but now use it as my main dryer.</li>
            <li>Lower heat is less damaging to my hair, so since this dryer still gets it done just as quickly</li>
            <li>Its a little heavy, but works great for such a low price.</li>
            <li>the little mesh screen filter in the back gets easily clogged with dust, lint, and hair....</li>
            <li>The cord is a little short - but this machine is strong sturdy and well built.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy and a little heavier than some, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>this one on low sounded like her&#x27;s on high.  </li>
            <li>It also has high, medium, and low heat seatings and 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>Relatively quiet on the high setting.</li>
            <li>It is fairly quiet unless you turn it on high speed.  </li>
            <li>That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I&#x27;d mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross.</li>
            <li>I looked high and low for this feature.</li>
            <li>I bought to replace the one i had bought back in high school (longer ago than I care to remember).  </li>
            <li>I plugged it in and it was working just fine when all of a sudden it made a weird sound, shut off and caused the outlet to smoke.</li>
            <li>The pink was a little different from what I thought it would be, but still nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful but not super loud (for a hair dryer, at least), I can get my long hair dry and straight in about 8-10 minutes on warm temperature +</li>
            <li>The one strange thing was that even though this picture is clearly the dryer I had, the one I got was exactly the same but orange instead of burgundy.</li>
            <li>However, something plastic inside melted onto the coil and today it shot hot pieces of pink plastic onto my neck.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;d rather have one with a hanging loop.e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I never realized a dryer could actually be quiet &amp; do such a great job on thin, flat</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like them because they are harder to move, but then I realized that if they were the easier, toggle-type of switch, being placed where they are on the handle, I&#x27;d be inadvertently changing the settings and turning it off during use.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed that my mid-back length, thick hair was less frizzy, more manageable and softer.  </li>
            <li>With previous hair dryers I would have needed to flat iron to get it this smooth.</li>
            <li>The power is not very high, which I was really hoping for.</li>
            <li>She feels it dries her hair significantly faster than her prior hairdryer which was allegedly the same wattage.  </li>
            <li>I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  </li>
            <li>just received this new dryer, to replace a Conair model from several years ago.  </li>
            <li>The wife had some specific requests for the new hairdryer she wanted.  </li>
            <li>, otherwise it takes much longer to dry</li>
            <li>Hair dry fast, and shine after blow.</li>
            <li>I have wavy curly somewhat course and frizzy hair which I blow dry straight.</li>
            <li>While I initially thought the retractable cord would be a plus, it makes storing the entire unit very cumbersome.</li>
            <li>But less damage is worth it--you can always adjust your products or hair style.  </li>
            <li>It seemed a little heavy a first compared to my cheap hair dryer, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t have to do this with my old dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple heat/speed settings: One of the reasons I bought this dryer was because it had multiple heat/speed settings, but only high speed</li>
            <li>My hair is usually shiny, so it&#x27;s hard to determine if the dryer is making a difference, or if it&#x27;s just my natural hair and good shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  </li>
            <li>I would say it takes half the amount of time to dry my hair with this dryer - and my hair feels terrific (full of volume and very silky).</li>
            <li>I hope this dryer performs as well in the future as it has so far!</li>
            <li>Major impact on strength of the fan &amp; on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  </li>
            <li>The dryer does not get as hot as my other Ionic Dryer</li>
            <li>Just wish it wasn&#x27;t hot pink!</li>
            <li>The one major downside to this drier is that it vibrates in my hand which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>The bonus is that it actually dries really fast and leaves hair looking much smoother than my previous dryer.  </li>
            <li>find that the \\&quot;high setting\\&quot; air current is not strong enough to really get your hair into staying straight upwards</li>
            <li>They love it and the retractable cord keeps down the mess.  </li>
            <li>This is a powerful little blow drier.  </li>
            <li>Induces less frizz than with my previous hair dryer, which is my favorite quality about the product.  </li>
            <li>at low setting, you actually get a fairly decent amount of power.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  </li>
            <li>If you have short fine hair, you can tolerate the weight, but if your hair is thick, mid length to long requiring longer drying times....holding this heavy dryer up for extended periods will make the job more laborious than it needs to be.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old Conair dryer broke last week</li>
            <li>My whole room used to be painted pink.</li>
            <li>Out of all the hair dryers over the years, I have never had one last this long, and I have never bought the exact same one two times in a row, until now</li>
            <li>Perhaps I expected too much from Conair.</li>
            <li>This item was a lot heavier than I&#x27;d expected, but I really like the retractable cord quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used the defuser attachment so far</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really wanted one with a retractable cord and one that was pink.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see several reviews state</li>
            <li>hair dryer is so quiet, compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li>I have found that I have to retract the retractable cord several times for it to completely retract.</li>
            <li>So far, has withstood the back and forth trips between houses.  </li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually.</li>
            <li>I like that its quiet, yet drys my hair a lot faster than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models.</li>
            <li>My old blow dryer was starting to spark (eek!)</li>
            <li>Seems to take longer to dry my hair compared to my older model.</li>
            <li>I have had the dryer for several months now, and so far no problems mechanically.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The highest setting has about the same amount of power as the lowest setting on my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>(My old dryer had the same amount of watts as this one.)  </li>
            <li>So it actually makes it bigger than my normal hair dryer, so I switched them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dryer that gets the job done, even though storing it can be kinda awkward..</li>
            <li>I looked for a dryer that would not add more damage to my thin, color hair.....</li>
            <li>a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; push button for interrupting a hot flow) and slow and fast speeds.</li>
            <li>Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don&#x27;t just yank it.</li>
            <li>And if you don&#x27;t need a long cord, if your outlet is right next to your mirror for instance, the short cord is no big deal.</li>
            <li>If you blow dry your hair on high then</li>
            <li>The Infiniti went right back to the store, where the salespeople were equally horrified to hear that the thing turned my hands pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly loud (at least compared to the other two I tried), the buttons are such that you don&#x27;t keep accidentally turning them off and on as you grip the handle, and it has good drying power.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and only dry my hair with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This dryer really gets the job done, not only does it dry your hair</li>
            <li>And the color is pretty - very pink!</li>
            <li>so now I will see how long this new one lasts.  </li>
            <li>Why did I put off getting a new hair dryer so long?</li>
            <li>My first one stopped working after about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>my experience, my hair did look straighter and more silky than usual, which might be due to the &#x27;Tourmaline Ceramic technology&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Also, why did it only come in hot pink?!</li>
            <li>I bought this due to the very high reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t get as hot, but dries my hair in about the same amount of time as my old (non-ceramic, non-ionic) hairdryer (if anything, a little faster).</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t want to travel with it, and if you had a big, long, full head of hair that took awhile to dry, your arm would get mighty tired.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done really fast however the only qualm I have is that the cord is only three foot long.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the little extra money!</li>
            <li>the cord makes it alot more convinient a little heavy</li>
            <li>I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn&#x27;t worry too much because it didn&#x27;t take very long to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice hair dryer, but the lower control buttoms -- which I use the most -- are impossible to handle, at least for my fingers.  </li>
            <li>I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  </li>
            <li>I recently repaired a short that was in the cord that developed after years of use.</li>
            <li>Only problem was, the distal opening of this hair dryer was bigger than my old hair dryer holder.</li>
            <li>Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it is a bit heavy, but this is why it is so powerful.  </li>
            <li>Lots of settings, does not dry out hair.  </li>
            <li>Powerful enough but too heavy.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me ten years and passed down to my son still working.</li>
            <li>diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser is slightly smaller than most other diffusers that I have had in the past; however, it works just as well as any that I have used</li>
            <li>It would be fine for someone with short hair, or thin hair that doesn&#x27;t take too much time to dry.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly heavier than my last dryer, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>It normally takes me around 20 minutes total to dry my hair, but with this dryer it takes me around 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>I had a previous Infiniti by Conair model for several years, but was looking to upgrade it to something lighter with a retractable cord, which is exactly what this is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Dries long, thick hair very quickly</li>
            <li>Cool heat/high speed feels nice on a hot summer day, but is worthless if you want to actually dry your hair in less than two hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pink ... not just \\&quot;pink\\&quot; ... but SUPER pink!!</li>
            <li>Blow drying my hair is by far my least favorite activity everyday</li>
            <li>really like how quiet this is compared to some other models I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>My old dryer had a long, bulky cord that was always in the way.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, naturally curly, then keratin, then extensions.</li>
            <li>, that was about ten years old, on a trip somewhere, even though this supposedly has the same power and is the same brand.</li>
            <li>Apparently the diffuser is not made to last through the levels of heat that the dryer produces !!!!</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer last several years but finally died.  </li>
            <li>: it seemed a bit heavy on the first day, but I got over that quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>im black) this did not dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>it makes your hair less frizzy as you blow dry it; well worth the money...</li>
            <li>It does dry my thick african-american hair very quickly and leaves a shine.</li>
            <li>Personally, I wish I hadn&#x27;t been so desperate and had spent a little more time looking, but I&#x27;m also willing to spend a little (or a lot) more money for something I won&#x27;t want to replace later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this hairdryer dries it very quickly.</li>
            <li>* large - this is above average in size, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still works like the first day i had it, but the retractable cord takes a little finagling to get it all the way back in.  </li>
            <li>I found that hard to accomplish because it retracts extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>It keeps it out of the way, but the cord is not very long so you must stay close to the outlet.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair and my old blow dryer</li>
            <li>She uses it to dry the hair of my 7-year old son, and he enjoys it, too.</li>
            <li>I wanted a ceramic dryer because my old dryer was dryng out my hair and making it appear dry and course.  </li>
            <li>I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  </li>
            <li>, my previous hairdryers would make my hair very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Revlon brand hair dryer for my 11 year old daughter to use to learn to blow dry her hair</li>
            <li>Then last night, while drying my daughter&#x27;s hair, it started to smell of something burning and a few hot ceramic embers came shooting out.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this machine is big and heavy.</li>
            <li>This dryer is pretty big and heavy.  </li>
            <li>In my perception, it does not dry any faster than a non-tourmaline at the same wattage.</li>
            <li>The Conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair.</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that with the first one I bought, I retracted the cord everyday after using it.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  </li>
            <li>so it dries super fast) and never use the HIGH mode (only LOW) as I was too afraid to burn my hair again.</li>
            <li>Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button.</li>
            <li>I can throw it under the sink cabinet without having a whole mess of cord.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair that I usually blow dry straight, no problem, but with this one I could not get it straight &amp; ended up just resigning myself to using my flat iron on the still damp but very frizzy fried mess I ended up with.</li>
            <li>The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  </li>
            <li>The cord is not very long, maybe only 3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a light blowdryer with enough heat and blowing power to dry her thick hair.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the cord is super short compared to others I have</li>
            <li>I have a lot of thin, wavy hair, and this dryer dries it quickly!</li>
            <li>Either my old dryer was extremely heavy, or the other reviewers have much higher standards than I do.</li>
            <li>If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  </li>
            <li>My expectations were high for this one and it was just average...</li>
            <li>I have short hair that is thick and on high heat and high fan</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is the best dryer.</li>
            <li> The greatest thing this dryer has is the retractable cord - and, of course the varied choices for temperature and blowing power!</li>
            <li> So awesome and convenient!!</li>
            <li> What swayed me was that it won an award from Allure magazine as being the best.  </li>

            <li> , I appreciate it when I&#x27;m straightening my hair, but the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting is insufficient for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the hair dryer is great, the attachments work well</li>

            <li> I bought this product a year ago and it started as a great dryer.</li>
            <li> Another great product.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great.  </li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m not quite raving--it didn&#x27;t transform my hair, like some people claimed, or dramatically reduce my drying time, but for the price, this hairdryer is a great value</li>

            <li> (I&#x27;ve paid more than triple for a tourmaline dryer!!)   </li>
            <li> And I love the retractable cord!!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer ever!!</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is also very handy.  </li>
            <li> It is a very nice looking dryer though.</li>
            <li> The retractible cord is very handy for storing in the drawer.  </li>
            <li> Very nice hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The retractable power cord is a very nice design element.  </li>
            <li> but i looked on here and found the exact one thankss!!!!!</li>
            <li> The grip is great, very easy to navigate my glorious mop of nappy hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> The cord is amazing!</li>
            <li> Loving this dryer!</li>
            <li> was the best and after so many years, busted, so I bought this one.</li>
            <li> retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn&#x27;t come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  </li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord - that&#x27;s one of the best features ever for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great price daughter loved all the attachments</li>
            <li> It is awesome having so many heat and speed settings.  </li>
            <li> Having the power cord being able to retract is an awesome feature.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and you do not have to pay a lot for a good dryer and diffuser.</li>
            <li> The difusor has a good size and it&#x27;s a great option for curly hair.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord along with the excellent reviews made it an easy choice.  </li>
            <li> Speedy shipment, easy ordering, sent just as described, awesome product.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommanded.&lt;br /&gt;I will say this might be the best choice for product in this price range.</li>
            <li> Very good, more than pleasant with the product.</li>
            <li> Works great and love the rewind!</li>
            <li> Very good product with many drying options.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bright, shiny, fushia color.  </li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as bright as the photos show.</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> It handles well while being a good weight.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I loved the &#x27;Cord-Keeper&#x27; idea and the power provided by this model, but after going through two of them in a three year period, I cannot recommend them.</li>
            <li> using it, it has good power, and it&#x27;s not too noisy.  </li>
            <li> The cord is a good length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also a good feature it</li>
            <li> She loved it.  </li>
            <li> I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic.</li>
            <li> It does a good job drying my hair, has temperature settings</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always been good on my curls.</li>
            <li> and she loved it.</li>
            <li> It is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> * good ranage of settings&lt;br /</li>

            <li> But just out of the box and unmodified, this dryer has proved to be a good purchase for me.</li>

            <li> And She says it&#x27;s good</li>

            <li> Definitely the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever had and at a great price to boot!</li>
            <li> It made my hair look very smooth and the retractable cord is really great.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase and the attachments that come with it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> Looks great also love the color.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but it makes our apartment fuse blow every time I use it more than 10-15 minutes (might just be our place</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied, one note is while pushing the retract cord button, hold the cord as it goes in so it doesnt whip around.</li>
            <li> Nice weight and good balance.</li>

            <li> I got a great deal on this blow dryer and it wasn&#x27;t even worth it at a great price.  </li>
            <li> The temperature is nice, and the auto cord retractor works good and comes in handy.</li>
            <li> One of the best features are the heat settings - I started drying my 4 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair using the warm setting - which is just the right temp.</li>
            <li> and I love that it came with attachments!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it&#x27;s much better than having all these cords all over the place!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute!</li>

            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  </li>

            <li> I cannot express how wonderful this feature in particular is!  </li>
            <li> I love the color, very bright and cheerful.  </li>
            <li> I love how quick this one works and very effective without frizzing my hair!</li>
            <li> but the bottom line is, it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> It has amazing power</li>
            <li> Hair dryer itself is amazing as well and does the job in minutes.</li>
            <li> But I got my conair real cheap</li>
            <li> but hey its a great dryer for cheap.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say anytime I use this dryer or my daughter borrows it our hair looks smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> And does a nice job styling hair.</li>
            <li> (i.e. it nicely fits in one&#x27;s hand).  </li>
            <li> The cord keeper function is nice.</li>
            <li> , I must send it to them, at my own expense and must send them $7 for return shipping</li>
            <li> The dryer has a nice design and color.</li>
            <li> It does have variable temps, which is nice</li>
            <li> I liked the sassy color and the retractable cord feature.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll be stored nicely.  </li>
            <li> retractable cord is nice, as is the defuser.</li>
            <li> dryer is nice, but without understanding specifically the benefits of \\&quot;ionic, tourmaline\\</li>
            <li> In fact, it really is the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks nice, is shiny, etc.</li>
            <li> I am beyond thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> I regret not taking it with me because it so nice.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I like to hold the dryer from the barrel and it doesn&#x27;t even get slightly warm.</li>
            <li> The cord is the perfect length when it is pulled out all the way and tucks away when not in use making it much easier to store.</li>
            <li> I always use the warm setting, and it&#x27;s nice because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning my hair off.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice quite hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> A really nice dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is nice that the cord isn&#x27;t running across the bathroom anymore.  </li>
            <li> * nice retracting cord&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice hair dryer but</li>
            <li> also the force with which it blows air is too nice.</li>
            <li> This dryer works nicely until the buttons fall off.</li>
            <li> Really nice blowdryer</li>
            <li> And of course, it&#x27;s always nice to have a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> This IS actually a nice dryer...</li>
            <li> I really liked how this dryer worked.  </li>
            <li> Retractable cord is nice.</li>
            <li> I travel quite a bit, so it&#x27;s nice to have the cord retract.</li>
            <li> Nice product with a lot of power.  </li>
            <li> I liked this hair dryer for a lot of reasons.</li>
            <li> Nice hairdryer</li>
            <li> Makes putting it up look nice &amp; organized</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see why someone would own this.  </li>
            <li> The retractable cord is nice and measures 5 feet + 3 inches with 5-1/2 inches that does not retract into the handle.</li>
            <li> Love it, good service</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dryer has held up well and the retractable cord is a nice feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> she was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I really liked the the cord on it, I don&#x27;t have to wrap it around the hair dryer just push the button</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tidy person and wires</li>
            <li> I would recommend this dryer to any lady looking for a nice dryer.</li>
            <li> My wife liked the color.</li>
            <li> Daughter borrowed it, and she liked it, also.</li>
            <li> I liked this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Great  hair Dryer, very powerful and durable.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord makes it super easy to travel with this lightweight hair dryer, and the amount of heat, power and airflow you get from it is perfect for coaxing my wavy hair to curls when I use the diffuser.</li>
            <li> The cord keeper is certainly a nice feature and the bright color makes it easy to find under my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have owned many of their products through the years and have been very pleased until I bought this product.</li>
            <li> This is a quick drying dryer, which is what we all want, lol.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to overdry.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and</li>
            <li> The lint trap comes off and can be cleaned very easily.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews but am very happy to have this product.</li>
            <li> perfect its light and has all the right settings and the cord</li>
            <li> Being able to cool off my hair after it is dry is the best thing about it (except maybe the great color of it!  </li>
            <li> The best part of this hairdryer is, by far, the retractable cord, which makes it very easy to store.  </li>
            <li> the three heat settings are amazing too :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by the professional quality of this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it dries nicely</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this dryer does what it claims, it reduces static amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this is really a great hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Its amazing and so much more organized than they use to be.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves having her own hairdryer and we feel safe with this one, no problems yet.</li>
            <li> Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair</li>
            <li> I tried someone&#x27;s dryer like this and fell in love with it so had to buy my own.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer and have recommended it to others who also liked it.  </li>
            <li> really looked out for one very good and with very advanced settings.</li>
            <li> i like the fact i could ship it right to her and that she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Stores easily!</li>
            <li> I bought it 3 years ago and its still going strong!</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest to anyone looking for one with power!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong!</li>
            <li> Very good, highly rated blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Happy happy, for second time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dryer so far. :)</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, it is powerful, has a great retractable cord and that is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> And the nice bright fuschia color is fun.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Hot&#x27; never got too hot and &#x27;warm&#x27; was perfect for my use.  </li>
            <li> This item was exactly as described and the price was great.  </li>
            <li> It is beautiful and has all the features considered a must have, at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> For the missus, however, well she&#x27;s pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because the winding cord seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> The cord was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> and she has been using it for almost a year every day and still works fine!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> I got this product very cheap just because the box was dented</li>
            <li> Hot air, nice color, good price.</li>
            <li> Very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first, and then untangle it whenever you take it out.</li>
            <li> I have always liked that conair products are fairly inexpensive, they are great quality, and they have a long lifespan.</li>
            <li> Item ok - cord does not always retract as it is suppose to...but dryer works fine!</li>
            <li> Another plus, it is not as large as you would think it would be, so it will be great for traveling.</li>
            <li> This Conair product is my favorite.</li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> I do love the fact that it has a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> As a hairdryer, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I was just hoping for more.</li>
            <li> I also love the cord that goes into the dryer itself.</li>
            <li> You must buy this hair dryer, it will change your life! :)</li>

            <li> I love the Infininti hairdryer from Conair.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I was surprised this dryer got so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li> She thinks that the product is well-designed and that the variable heat settings are perfect, not too hot or cool, and she also uses the free accessories to adjust the air-flow for a variety of hair style applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a favorite hair dryer until now.  </li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord and the diffuser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quieter than most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more anyone could desire from a dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the way the cord reels up into the dryer.</li>
            <li> I really, REALLY love the cord.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly with the diffuser that comes with the dryer.  </li>

            <li> and I have been pleased with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I love the fact that the cord is retractable.</li>
            <li> Can ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> I wish the dryer had more blowing power.</li>
            <li> I suggest getting something with more watts.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the cord winds up.</li>
            <li> The dryer itself still works perfectly in regards to heat and power after a year or more of almost daily use.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> There are so many hair dryers to choose from.</li>

            <li> Just what I was looking for and perfect for taking with on trips instead of packing the big dryer!</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that I love the color, this is a dynamo of a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything else more to add.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m okay with them now.  </li>
            <li> She uses it almost daily and the cord re-tractor is the best because it helps me from stepping on the cord.</li>
            <li> I must say that I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> We absolutely love this hair dryer.</li>

            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   </li>
            <li> This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better.</li>
            <li> : I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> In my area Target &amp; Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  </li>
            <li> Dryer works wonderfully, I love the wind up cord.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I also love the color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more marroon</li>
            <li> and i had to invest in a way better one</li>
            <li> and I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> but then the particulates fall into the motor causing more problems or the lint and stuff</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I love that the cord retracts up.</li>

            <li> Very genius and am sooo happy with it.</li>
            <li> In fact, most times I have to pull all the way out and hold the cord taught while it retracts in ordernto</li>
            <li> The Andis is more feature packed (see my separate review).</li>
            <li> The Conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned including the Andis model.</li>
            <li> The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love Conair brand&lt;</li>

            <li> Simply put this is THE best hair dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> one of the better conair products i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> said the retractable cord is perfect for storage in a tiny dorm room.</li>
            <li> Love the retractable cord and the ease of storage.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer, helps me when styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Comes with 2 connectors for styling and love using them both.</li>
            <li> but when I used my sister&#x27;s for the first time, I knew I had to have one of my own!</li>
            <li> and I love the retractable cord.</li>

            <li> 6 months now since purchase and most of the cord will not retract.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light weight, and for the fact that it&#x27;s not so NOISY!</li>
            <li> This is a much better hair dryer that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> i have not been able to use the product since i received</li>
            <li> I would really love to.</li>
            <li> I love the retracting cord.</li>
            <li> I love the settings on this and the attachments although I don&#x27;t know how to use them.</li>
            <li> The color is really stylish.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad to tuck it away and not have to wrap the cord on the dryer every time I use this.  </li>
            <li> Also so sometimes my hair gets stuck in the top of it when it is drawing in air.</li>
            <li> worked flawlessly until it just stopped working last week.</li>
            <li> Works great and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have short hair this iron might be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I do love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my hair looks better after I blowdry</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about cord.</li>
            <li> I called Amazon customer service and as always they were very friendly and offered to either send me another hair dryer or refund my money.</li>
            <li> I too read the reviews and was very excited to use this product</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see that.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> I just got it, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality blow dryer- hot and dries fast.</li>
            <li> It produced a good stream of nicely heated air and seemd to dry my hair fairly well.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have owned about 9 hair dryers in the last 5 years, and this is easily the best of them all.</li>
            <li> The colour is bright and pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this dryer as it is pretty good, though not</li>
            <li> I like the retractable cord feature, and the heating element is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Warm setting should be renamed cool.</li>
            <li> Its so sturdy and nice and a cool metallic color too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had for my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Returned for exchange with Amazon, new unit works well, and wife is happy with it.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t super thrilled.      </li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord, makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hefty (so you better have a strong grip) and it does NOT fold over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it&#x27;s well-vented and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quite stylish (and</li>
            <li> I love the retracting cable, which allows for easy uncluttered storage.  </li>
            <li> so I can sit wherever I want when I dry my hair; otherwise it is perfect and I plan on buying it as gifts for some of my family/friends.</li>
            <li> Love the the cord retracts for easy storage, too.</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair dryer and dries my hair really quickly.  </li>
            <li> What attracted me most to this model is the gorgeous, shiny fuchsia color; however, this feature ended up ruining the whole dryer for me</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of a retractable cord, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing about this dryer.  </li>
            <li> The retractable cord is a nice feature, but I think it probably has something to do with the heaviness of the blow dryer and that nice feature doesn&#x27;t compensate for a very sore arm after just 10 minutes of blow drying.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful &amp; the reel cord makes this blow dryer even better!</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for about a year now and it has held up great, has great power and is hot enough.  </li>
            <li> (By far, the most appealing factor!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this one will be just fine</li>
            <li> It was in stock, listed for a great price and also included free super saver shipping I placed my order right away.</li>
            <li> ok ok not so special.</li>
            <li> and I find that it&#x27;s more accurate in the air flow.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord on this hairdryer and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the color</li>
            <li> So if your outlet is above a shelf, for example, as many bathroom outlets are, you need to make sure you have about 5-6 inches clearance to allow room for the reinforced and non-flexible bit of cord at the plug.&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer works great.</li>
            <li> The product offers great features which include a self-retracting cord reel (just push a button and it automatically winds itself), a diffuser, a concentrator, 3 heat settings, and two speed settings.  </li>
            <li> This is the first ionic technology hair dryer that I&#x27;ve used, and I have to say, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I did considerable research, and was drawn to this one by the great reviews and</li>
            <li> So I got this one, its been working great so far.</li>
            <li> I did have to get used to holding it securely while I pressed the button on the side to retract the cable, though, dropping it the first time, because I didn&#x27;t have a good hold on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great luck with Conair in the past--this dryer was replacing my old 1875 (which I&#x27;ve used for 8+ years).  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a couple tries to get it to go all the way in, but I don&#x27;t expect it to be perfect every time!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a placebo affect, but she&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li> I do not think it&#x27;s better than the cheap revlon blow dryer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pink &amp; i especially love the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> Forceful air and the cord retractor has worked great so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I found this for sale on Amazon because it&#x27;s quiet-as far as blow dryers go-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful but doesn&#x27;t blast your hair beyond recognition...especially at the lower speed and on warm.</li>
            <li> Really works good.</li>
            <li> good wattage - fast dry&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works really good and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> The reviews were good on the dryer itself, but I really just wanted the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, the three temperatures and speeds give you a good range of options depending on what you intend to do on your hair.</li>
            <li> Has a cool shot button, and strong airflow!</li>
            <li> The airflow is very powerful, and I love how to cord is reeled inside of the dryer</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion, and more or less in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> delivered super fast &amp; great price</li>
            <li> This is a good product, Pros: heats well, powerful, quick, retractable cord.</li>
            <li> It has worked perfectly well until the other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works perfectly like any other blowdryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Retractable Cord - retracts easily (but mine is still new).&lt;br /&gt;Easier</li>
            <li> I would easily give it 5 stars, if it wasn&#x27;t for the weight.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate.</li>
            <li> If anyone be able to illuminate me on what happened or has experienced the same thing, please reply and let me know.  </li>
            <li> Easy feature to find</li>
            <li> of power, which you can easily control so you don&#x27;t burn your hair.</li>
            <li> Durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The cord retracts so it is easy to store.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a decent hair dryer at a good price and this was the one I picked.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Still going strong.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still going strong after 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> (This one still works good, but my older hair dryer</li>
            <li> Nice, easy, portable hand dryer that is available in fun colors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for quick, high temp drying, or for bangs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s can get very hot on the high heat setting, but the medium heat setting is a great compromise if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a very stylish dryer and dries my hair really fast leaving it softer because of the Ion.</li>
            <li> She thought it was a pretty color and liked the attachments.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has a cool setting and 2 speed settings.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice not to have to leave the cord out around a hot hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still pretty warm).    </li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord, the choice of heat levels and speeds PLUS a cool button.</li>
            <li> Hot setting should be changed to almost warm.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works just fine.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine</li>
            <li> My previous Conair Ion dryer was awesome.</li>
            <li> It worked fine yesterday, and today would not work.</li>
            <li> I wish the cord retracted every time perfectly but it usually works and I love that feature.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine.  </li>
            <li> but it is fine.</li>
            <li> No, I can still push the cord into the blowdryer and everything is working fine.</li>
            <li> The cord retracts fine.  </li>
            <li> I thought all was fine after almost 2 months of using it.</li>
            <li> My curls are slightly straightened when I use this which is great for me!</li>
            <li> Worked fine..</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> The styling of this dryer is SUPER CUTE</li>
            <li> I found the temperature and speed settings to be more than adequate and well-placed on the dryer handle (no accidental bumping).    </li>
            <li> cute color, retractable cord, quick \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button,</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was appropriately packaged.</li>
            <li> The color could be better -- like silver or black -- but a very good performing product.  </li>
            <li> It would get very hot although I would never use it for more than 2 minutes</li>
            <li> Best feature for me is the cool setting not found on other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard looking for a good diffuser and this is great.</li>
            <li> tried the diffuser one day, but found it to be a huge pain to work with, so I just set it aside...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an accurate review of those.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was fantastic while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Ions smooth the cuticle layer... creating</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this in store and found it working great.</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The filter is easy to remove and clean</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not feather light either)</li>
            <li> It was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day I bought it, until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Conair, and based on its model number, which indicated it was well within warranty, they would replace it for free, sort of.</li>
            <li> That it works well is only part of what makes a product great.</li>
            <li> That it works well is only part of what makes a product great.</li>
            <li> Did I mention that it makes my hair look fabulous too?</li>
            <li> The price is also unbeatable @ $20 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Did I mention that it makes my hair look fabulous too?</li>
            <li> The price is also unbeatable @ $20 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has great power and different heat settings.</li>
            <li> This dryer being 1875 would definitely fit into that \\&quot;pro\\&quot; description.  </li>
            <li> Bought this primarily for the retractable cord, which works well.</li>
            <li> but then again, sometimes light means &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;,  </li>
            <li> Enjoy the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has been great, but it only lasted me for 1 year.</li>
            <li> I like that it has three heat settings which are useful when wanting my hair to be straighter or have more curl.  </li>
            <li> Not like the light plastic feeling dryers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything fantastic for my hair, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much , bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Great,  quiet hair dryer.</li>
            <li> so it fits comfortably in my hand and it is also light weight.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the dryer is fabulous for my hair.</li>
            <li> The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free.</li>
            <li> this was a great christmas present.</li>
            <li> She has heavy hair and she especially liked the cord that coiled.  </li>
            <li> This was okay, but it was not as powerful as my Revlon dryerthat</li>
            <li> I used to have a Conair ionic blow dryer from Costco and it made my hair so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t even that cheap for what you get</li>
            <li> Nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I was correct in my assessment of the cheap switches.</li>
            <li> Really, really great device, and the attachments only add to that.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight which is good but not as good as my old but loud Baby Bliss which I was trying to replace.</li>
            <li> I had been using a traveling blow dryer for almost ten years and did not realize there was a difference in dryers until I asked my therapist/hairstylist why my hair always looks so great there</li>
            <li> This is a great standard size blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> In her opinion, it is a good home dryer, but probably wouldn&#x27;t hold up to the use that a professional dryer gets.  </li>
            <li> The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> What was more surprising is how noisy these things are, not just objectively but subjectively as well.</li>
            <li> If you are to lay the dryer on the side with the button, it will most likely activate causing the cord to retract, and this isn&#x27;t a good thing if the dryer is on.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get too hot and it was a nice cool setting.  </li>
            <li> It looks good as far as blow dryers go</li>
            <li> Overall its been a good dryer though and am glad I have it</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair very fast and the cord keeper works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The temperature settings are also very nice with the hot not being *too* hot, and the cool is actually cool.</li>
            <li> , I also love that the cord winds right up.</li>
            <li> Really!!!  </li>
            <li> It is very fun.</li>
            <li> but it is very powerful.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to handle, dries hair quickly, and stores easily with the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> Ample speed and heat settings, comfortable to use, and best of all, no more tangled cord.</li>
            <li> It also dries hair quickly and is easy to use with your styling brushes.</li>
            <li> This one is heavier, hotter, and the cool shot is really just warm.</li>
            <li> The cord retracts, quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Great for using on low air/hi heat to spiff up my hair instead of doing a full blowout.  </li>
            <li> I have learned to be more cautious as I lay it down and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is SUPER quiet, has plenty of power, has a removable and cleanable inlet filter, and has a great retractable cord feature.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer--maybe even more than the previous model--leaves my hair especially smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is perfect for the limited space of my bathroom, The attachments work really well</li>
            <li> Low airflow on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting, amazing for curly hair!</li>
            <li> It is a great dryer and functions a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is significantly shinier, softer, and silkier than it&#x27;s ever been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this hairdryer</li>
            <li> I originally bought this hair dryer in a store years ago.</li>
            <li> But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t get hot except at the business end.</li>
            <li> When it came, I was sort of excited because of the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> The color is really fun too!</li>
            <li> I hope to continue buying ... 100% original product ..</li>
            <li> Since my original hair dryer broke, I am in the market for another one.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s significantly heavier than a non-tourmaline.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first hair dryer purchase in many years because I had curly hair, which I am now straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the most &#x27;pretty&#x27; hair dryer that I have ever owned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning - easier to clean filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> diffuser attachment works great to dry the curls without them flying all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here is a tip for cleaning the plastic windowscreen like filter underneath; I used to clean it with tweezers to pull off the accumulated lint about once a month.</li>
            <li> I also like that you can remove and clean the filter.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has a good weight to it and the motor sounds quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> The cord is retractable and their is a removable filter at the end to clean out all the dust that accumulates in these things.  </li>
            <li> You have many settings available to you and the retractable cord is a real bonus.</li>
            <li> : dries quickly, silky, smooth hair</li>
            <li> Quick free delivery through prime account.</li>
            <li> Usually when I use a blow dryer on her hair it gets to be fly away and static filled.</li>
            <li> The hot setting isn&#x27;t overly hot, and the cool setting does a nice job of setting my style.</li>
            <li> As a woman with long hair, I need a good hair dryer that is easy to move around my head.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the 1 we originally had, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t think it puts out as much air.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special here.  </li>
            <li> It was ok while it lasted, but certainly nothing special.  </li>
            <li> It works well, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> It comes with two attachments which i use and find helpful when drying my hair for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is nothing special though.</li>
            <li> was completely right!   </li>
            <li> I probably would, but this blow drier was cheap, cute, and does it&#x27;s main purpose, so I&#x27;ll keep it for a while.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at drying your hair quickly and yet does not seem to dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy until I find something better at a decent price with a retractable cord!</li>
            <li> When this hairdryer came i was super excited.</li>
            <li> I was able to dry my hair quickly and it looked very healthy afterwards.</li>
            <li> very fine, short hair and this dryer fluffed it up nicely and it&#x27;s very fast.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for the first four months, then the cord stopped retracting, and then two months later the engine blew.  </li>
            <li> The product is attractive and well-designed, and it comes with a manual, stylish soft case and several air-flow accessories.</li>
            <li> Drying time is 50% shorter and my hair generally seems more healthy.</li>
            <li> I would also be careful of the retractable cord - it can fly all over the place and hit you or something else.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s blowing cool air.</li>
            <li> Styling is a breeze with it&#x27;s setting options and cool</li>
            <li> The make is very sleek and stylish.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good dryer, with some benefits and drawbacks.</li>
            <li> a LOT - of researching online, on amazon, on the websites of all the different brands available, and finally decided this blow dryer is the best for my needs.</li>
            <li> I like the cool setting.</li>
            <li> Early in the morning this is a nice safety feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s plastic, I love the metallic fuchsia finish and the sporty modern detailing.</li>
            <li> * overall a good value&lt;</li>
            <li> I had a really old Conair that I liked</li>
            <li> But I kept smelling a sweet smell coming from the bathroom area and just thought it was my plug in freshener.  </li>
            <li> Powerful in strength, but light in weight.</li>
            <li> Noise data included - good job overall    </li>
            <li> I like the removable filter which is mounted fairly flush with the back of the housing.</li>
            <li> If the price wasn&#x27;t as good as it is on Amazon I might have looked around for a similar one that lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> When I got it though, did that remain true?</li>
            <li> It was a good buy, and I ended up coming back and buying another one of these for a friend.</li>
            <li> the reel cord is very convenient and I&#x27;m glad I bought this blowdryer from conair ha ha</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a cute color that is very close to the picture.  </li>
            <li> This dryer seems to be good enough; I bought it on a recommendation.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s all true, this saves money too.</li>
            <li> Unless you really want a cord-keeper dryer or have already chosen the ~$30 price point, I might look around more before settling on this one.</li>
            <li> I love the reel cord but also the fast drying time.</li>
            <li> Also the Cool button sets hair into place after styling hair.</li>
            <li> cool setting paired with the diffuser on this hair dryer solved my issue.</li>
            <li> and it came on with full power and</li>
            <li> and I was able to get it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Noise level is not bad either.</li>
            <li> at high setting, this blow dryer is way more powerful than i would expect!  </li>
            <li> It is nice and quiet and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> one is suitable, but I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button gets it as heat-free as I&#x27;ve ever experienced (with other dryers</li>
            <li> The cord works as well as I had hoped, and the unit has an added blessing as well: The housing doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot, so I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool before putting it away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer about six months ago and it was fine at first.  </li>
            <li> Medium heat/high speed is somewhat adequate, but takes a lot longer.</li>
            <li> It has super power</li>
            <li> When I finally was able to contact someone on the phone I was told that yes, the year was a problem, but the company didn&#x27;t have any answer for fixing it, including not being able to take my information over the phone.</li>
            <li> The cord system is super convenient.</li>
            <li> Its super convenient and helps the bathroom look orderly.</li>
            <li> super quiet..and dries hair quickly....</li>
            <li> It left it looking smooth and with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly without any frizz.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly with no hassles.</li>
            <li> quick.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought for my wife, it works super well and hiding the cord is awesome - especially when you have kids.</li>
            <li> Drys my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> drys hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This was a worthy purchase</li>
            <li> Wish they&#x27;d make soft, pliable ones that would be more comfortable to lift and twist hair.</li>
            <li> I love the color, but color is not the main feature to consider when buying a hair dryer,</li>
            <li> It dries quickly</li>
            <li> But I love being able to set the heat several ways.  </li>
            <li> At least, it works great and has more options than I thought.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and I use the diffuser mainly.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a bit heavier but heats hotter with more power and is quieter than older hair dryers.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dries your hair quickly</li>
            <li> and my hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I have always been a loyal conair customer.</li>
            <li> Even on high, the noise is dramatically muted (if you shower during your childs naptime as I do, then this is HUGE!).</li>
            <li> Definitly one of the most affordable I have ever purchased, yet has all of the style and effectiveness of a high end salon model.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer, doesn&#x27;t turn your hair into straw, and I love that it has a medium heat setting, instead of the usual hot and cool.  </li>
            <li> (I used to use high on my old one) and it works beautifully and is much quieter.</li>
            <li> My very first was purchased&lt;br /</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying, I use my blow dryer lightly compared to others, so I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of this dryer.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> this is the very first thing I am returning.  </li>
            <li> Light weight, pretty color, and efficient heat.  </li>
            <li> This thing gets very hot, and has a lot of power, but with that power comes a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> Heat temps are good, and unit stays pretty cool even if used for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> retractable cord is good as long as it works....</li>
            <li> The high speed could even stand to be more powerful than it is.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great hair dryer with 1870 watts and easy to clean filter and several heat and speed settings, but the cord is retractable.  </li>
            <li> this blow dryer definitely does MORE than what i would expect, and with the diffuser attachment i get fabulous sexy waves or with the concentrator attachment i get sleek straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with new blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Generally I like the results, just wish it was more comfortable to hold and didn&#x27;t blow the breaker.</li>
            <li> The cord retractor is great; at first I expected this to be just a marketing gimmick, but now I wouldn&#x27;t buy a dryer without one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is super powerful too...</li>
            <li> Their quality is excellent and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Powerful hairdryer that does the job quickly.  </li>
            <li> Powerful, dries and styles my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> The retractable cord is very convenient and promotes easy storage.</li>
            <li> It might be nice if it had more oomph on the high setting, but my girlfriend says the same thing</li>
            <li> The first one has held up three plus years so we bought another one!</li>
            <li> It dries my fine, unruly hair quickly and frizz free, leaving it so soft.</li>
            <li> The cord is a little on the shorter side, but the dryer itself works great and dries the hair very fast!</li>
            <li> I only wish there were more color options, but for the quality the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> my wife absolutely loves this!!</li>
            <li> It is actually better than my old $120 blow dryer!</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and dries hair quickly, Love the rewind feature and that the filter can be cleaned easily.  </li>
            <li> It is actually much nicer looking than in the picture, it is quieter than my last dryer, it dries my hair a bit faster than my old dryer, and as for the temperature hot is hot warm is warm and the cool is truly cool!</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> this is a great little hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this dryer is perfect for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great convenience and the main reason I bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t get the fly away messy look from it.</li>
            <li> I bought this well over a year ago but wanted to write a review since I enjoy this hair dryer so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and am still happy with it.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast and leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet compared to the one my wife used to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised more women don&#x27;t have hearing loss from all the noise of these things.</li>
            <li> It is a powerful hair dryer and</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well, the Conair Infiniti is actually worth a second-look (</li>
            <li> My hand is usually up near the top buttons which are the heat settings and ones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an incredibly convenient feature, especially living in a tiny NYC apartment.</li>
            <li> and I decided for the price, this was worth a go.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the $20 I paid.</li>
            <li> My old dryer used to make my hair more knotted and yuck</li>
            <li> I had it for almost 4 years, so it was probably worth the price, but..</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t have a hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t store its own cord.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It has a hot, medium and cool setting (and</li>
            <li> also, when people say the cord is too short - since i researched and could not find the cord length written here anywhere, let me just tell you (now that i actually own the dryer)</li>
            <li> Nice blower for personal use....</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, like me, it comes with a nice diffuser that is actually usable.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews carefully before purchasing this item, and I am now among the top percentage of 150% satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller, heavier but it does a really nice job.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s rather quiet, which is nice because I use it at 6:00 a.m. when my husband is still sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $.</li>
            <li> nice and quiet, retractable cord....</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mid size hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> and it only took 10 minutes, great because I have a 10 month old who doesn&#x27;t nap</li>
            <li> The reel back cord is a nice feature</li>
            <li> So far I love the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a nice blow dryer that works well.</li>
            <li> so I like to get a powerful blow dryer that can help speed up the process...</li>
            <li> What is so exciting about a hair dryer?</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it  ...</li>
            <li> Fun</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is nice, but I had to struggle with it numerous times.</li>
            <li> Clearly I recommend this. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this dryer a couple of times but it is great so far.</li>
            <li> I think I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I also liked that fact that it had various heat settings.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord and red color was a nice feature as well.</li>
            <li> the price was much better than I expected and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> Love the speeds and the ease of use, it&#x27;s not heavy to hold</li>
            <li> The spring loaded wind-up cord works well and has a powerful motor.</li>
            <li> was able to order this and have it shipped directly to her.</li>
            <li> Has 3 setting and hot and cool.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and quiet, too.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it for the price and quality, though.</li>
            <li> Loud like most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I also liked the different settings on it as well.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased thus far.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that powerful, and nothing worth raving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One quick word of warning about the cord, it retracts VERY fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter and the varied heat controls are very useful.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe I was able to purchase such a nice dryer for such an economical price!</li>
            <li> said it is very powerful and dries her hair fast and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> she is awesome woman say that it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry there hair.</li>
            <li> The high speed is very powerful, and it dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> second issue is more significant.  </li>
            <li> The cool air option is great for my fine, thin hair.      </li>
            <li> I hold onto to the cord because it does retract pretty quickly</li>
            <li> This hair dryer&#x27;s cord is shorter (yet long enough for it&#x27;s purpose) and I find unplugging the cord, letting it settle, then pushing the retract button is the best way to be sure the cord coils up properly inside.  </li>
            <li> I love the happy hot pink color and especially like the retractible cord</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll learn to live with it, but when I&#x27;m trying to dry the hair of my 7 and 8 year olds, who move around a lot, a longer cord is welcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone this long without ever using one, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be fine without it.</li>
            <li> Then I found this Conair 223XR in bright pink, and it had all three attributes, ionic, ceramic interior, and tourmaline!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s retractable cord, but it really hasn&#x27;t lived up to the original excitement.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is so nice, it doesn&#x27;t get tangled in with my 3 curling irons and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this on Amazon, as it&#x27;s so much cheaper than at Ulta.  </li>
            <li> The heat is nice too, and though I believe it has a slightly lower temperature than my older unit, it&#x27;s more than adequate.</li>
            <li> This is just what we need, right?</li>
            <li> and they were right</li>
            <li> &quot; away at a right angle to the discharge of air.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> and if it is not plugged in just right it will not work.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the retractable cord does not work exactly right</li>
            <li> just the right temp.  </li>
            <li> soft.&lt;br /&gt;Priced right.</li>
            <li> With today&#x27;s technology, they could easily email me a voucher for a new dryer.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is pretty nice, although it is a very short cord.  </li>
            <li> Even without product, it does an excellent job of getting my hair dry, voluminous, and shiny with minimal disturbance and frizz, which as a curly girl is always an issue.</li>
            <li> Even without product, it does an excellent job of getting my hair dry, voluminous, and shiny with minimal disturbance and frizz, which as a curly girl is always an issue.</li>
            <li> Loved the retractable cord and how fast it could dry my overly-thick</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful or hot, but better than the previous ones.  </li>
            <li> My husband (who notices nothing, usually) even asked me what I had done to make my hair look so great.  </li>
            <li> While the retractable cord is a great idea,  it is not long enough.  </li>
            <li> but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> I like how it only takes me 7 minutes to dry my hair when its in on high and hot!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a second one in my guest bathroom because everyone who stays at my house (I live at the beach) wants to borrow my hair dryer even if they bring their own!  </li>
            <li> The price and quality are great, it is very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  </li>
            <li> I was going to do it, not having a clue what I would do without a hairdryer in the interim, when I checked Amazon again, and saw that I could buy a brand new one for $19.25 with no tax and, of course, free shipping.</li>
            <li> It certainly works!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I want straight hair, so I&#x27;ll brush and dry my hair at the same time for the straight hair, and it works great!</li>
            <li> The price was great and it had all the features of the much more expensive one I&#x27;d just thrown away.</li>
            <li> Although more powerful, lighter in weight and smaller in size.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use a hair dryer on a regular basis, so I asked my niece who is a beautician to use it and tell me how she liked it</li>
            <li> As far as hair dryers for daily bathroom use go, this is a good one.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a nice working hair dryer that pumps out the heat to dry hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend the dryer, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure it&#x27;s worth the difference in price to the cheaper model (which is lighter and has bigger</li>
            <li> Great for personal use and for one person using daily.</li>
            <li> I have dropped this thing, abused it, broken pieces off of it, and haven&#x27;t really taken care of it, yet it continues to work flawlessly.</li>
            <li> But it dries my hair super fast.</li>
            <li> I love the choices between low, medium and high and also low, warm, hot and cool.  </li>
            <li> it does reduce frizz and makes it very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy how quickly it got my hair dry and loved the cord keeper feature but based on the experience it will be a long time before I purchase another Conair product.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much up until that point that I went and bought another of the exact same hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, gets your hair dry in no time and the cord  gets store in the same dryer, my daughter loves it, thanks a lot!!</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to hold, not heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t change very much, so</li>
            <li> in all, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer it does my hair very fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I was looking for in a dryer and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> When I went to buy a new one, I wanted to replace with same model because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> She liked that I was able to use the cooler setting especially when blowing it on her face to dry her bangs.</li>
            <li> Some hairdryers take a long time to cool down afterwards, but I am happy to report that the Infiniti cooled off quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer is very powerful, the cord is longer than my other cord keeper dryer, and I love all the settings.  </li>
            <li> No more digging in my travel bags with its great new color!!</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times, although my hair is short, and I think the product is a great value with its safety features and its many high technology features.</li>
            <li> and I decided the Conair Infiniti Cord Reel was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I always go to Amazon first when making a purchase</li>
            <li> so naturally I checked to see if it was available.</li>
            <li> very does what is claimed alsome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a higher review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice having a retractable cord, but be careful that it doesn&#x27;t flip the plug up and pop you.  </li>
            <li> Since most of us only want to use a dryer once or twice a day, this should hold up well.</li>
            <li> My husband looked and said it draws as much power as our microwave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I stuck it out for several reasons.  </li>
            <li> Plus, this dryer was rated Top 10 on several sites</li>
            <li> The one thing I can see is that if you were used to a hair dryer that \\&quot;just\\&quot; blew hot air, you might think this dryer makes your hair flatter.  </li>
            <li> Anything similar in quality and features cost more money</li>
            <li> Not as hot as the dryer it replaced, but I adapted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and works well.</li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> The thing that first drew me to this hairdryer?  </li>
            <li> Time so splurge for real quality!</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased lasted almost 2 years before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get hot anywhere</li>
            <li> I think a hair dryer should last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I have fine and long hair and it took me 25 min to dry all my hair which is a pretty good time</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very lightweight!</li>
            <li> I was replacing one that had many of the same features as this one, except it felt like it was piercing my eardrums to use it.</li>
            <li> The cord does retract (snaps FAST -- watch out!)</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> I will come back and update my review after more use.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet compared to many dryers I have had.  </li>
            <li> It performs exactly as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li> Does an exactly job drying</li>
            <li> Love the different settings.  </li>
            <li> The first one I had lasted maybe 1 year then quit, I contacted Conair they opened a ticket, I mailed it to them</li>
            <li> Dryer works well &amp; doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> Love the red.</li>
            <li> my favorite hair dryer finally  gave up:/  </li>
            <li> I especially like being able to reel the cord in for easier storage.</li>
            <li> I love that the cord retracts back into the handle for storing.</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to put away when done using it and also makes it nice while using it that you don&#x27;t have to have a long cord dangling in your way.</li>
            <li> Love the cord; not quite enough power.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer but the last one went on me after one year.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty in color and looks exactly like it does online.  </li>
            <li> If you are considering buying this product I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are a bunch of pro features that it may not have, but it is exactly as described and it has been a solid performer every day for about a year now.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted 5+ years.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing I bought on-line before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered lots of things on Amazon before, but this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so use the low speed setting mostly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the blue button on the top of the handle.  </li>
            <li> and my hair still feels light and soft.</li>
            <li> It stores much better than my last one without the hassle of wrapping the cord.  </li>
            <li> but, still pretty.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing super fancy about it, I just like the color, had decent reviews</li>
            <li> well, for the first 4 months or so anyway.</li>
            <li> If you want to be scientific, order the top ten and try each one out.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thin hair and so far it&#x27;s working great for me :)</li>
            <li> Pretty color</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely digging the retractable cord!</li>
            <li> For the price I was skeptical but holy moly is this thing awesome!  </li>
            <li> So, I got creative and purchased a solid marble drinking cup at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li> But I guess that is more of a personal problem ha ha ha!</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I am told this hairdryer is really hot in temperature, perhaps to hot for hair drying.  </li>
            <li> My last hair dryer broke because the cord was bet at the entry to the dryer too many times and shorted out.</li>
            <li> I pulled it out the first time I used it</li>
            <li> given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design &amp; feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but</li>
            <li> given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> Well first it doesnt have a hook to hang it :</li>
            <li> on the highest setting, the temperature does not get that hot.</li>
            <li> I had one just like this for many years and it finally broke.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth, not dried out</li>
            <li> : After 60 days it has started making a grinding noise for about 15-20 seconds when first turned on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for in a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with the hot setting being that hot</li>
            <li> It does not get too hot and does not cause my hair does not get frizzy.</li>
            <li> Was really bummed!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not to hot on hot setting&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not bald, but pretty close.  </li>
            <li> , the weight is fine, and she says she&#x27;s got less static in her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burned out hair dryers before, but never had one that was ok one day and not working the next.</li>
            <li> Love that it has different speed and heat settings.</li>
            <li> Pretty color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Positives: Good amount of heat and blow, a few settings to switch it up.</li>
            <li> This is not a cheap throw-away, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> The different heat levels are great with the cool down to set the curl</li>
            <li> This is USEFUL for you stylish gents who are not just looking for a device to merely dry</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this and not a super cheap one.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who needs a fabulous, quiet, affordable, space &amp; time saving hair dryer loaded with features.ang my dryer on the wall using a brass hook, which works just fine.</li>
            <li> It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year.</li>
            <li> works a bit too well and best to hold button with one hand and guide the cords back with the other as it snaps back quickly.</li>
            <li> I also own one and so does my other daughter.</li>
            <li> am surprised to see that in about 11 months time, this dryer has gone up in price by 2.5 times what I originally paid.  </li>
            <li> Having used it now for several weeks, I found that it is light enough not to tire my arms, and it has the three temp settings including cool, along with the cool shot!</li>
            <li> I know this was voted \\&quot;Best Hairdryer!!!\\&quot; by like 5 beauty magazines, and it does seem to dry hair pretty efficiently, but this review applies to guys with short hair that need to use a hair dryer to SHAPE their hair into styles (such as mohawks or fauxhawks).</li>
            <li> One could probably rig some kind of keyring zip tied around the flared fitting that guides the cord into the dryer body if you must have something to hang it from, but I found it unnecessary for my setup.</li>
            <li> One could probably rig some kind of keyring zip tied around the flared fitting that guides the cord into the dryer body if you must have something to hang it from, but I found it unnecessary for my setup.</li>
            <li> wired only good for home use, kinda short.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a more quiet engine but still dries fast</li>
            <li> The cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button (no heat at all).</li>
            <li> This thing pumps out hot air pretty much instantaneously.</li>
            <li> Ordered because of good price, multiple heat settings, and multiple speed settings.  </li>
            <li> I started out using the hot setting and then moved down to the warm setting as her hair was drying.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it has the ceramic heater since it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn my 2 year old great granddaugher when she is in the the bathroom with me.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a powerful hairdryer.</li>
            <li> This was still a little more than I wished to spend, but I found out it was worth it!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets frizzy and needs to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Infiniti, by Conair, is light and easy to handle, even when you&#x27;re using a brush with your other hand!  </li>
            <li> For the average person, this dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li> For its size, it&#x27;s not all that heavy and the color is very stylish.</li>
            <li> I did use it pretty much every day</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it out; I&#x27;ve used cheap hairdryers my entire life, so the prospect of less hair frizz and better product longevity had me stoked.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very powerful; your hair will dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> Choose the best one and send back the other ten.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it took significantly more time to dry.</li>
            <li> The retractible cord is nice because it lets you store the dryer in less space without fighting with the cord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a picky person since I just tend to dry my hair partially most days.</li>
            <li> Quiet and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is more important to me than the cord retractor, which I don&#x27;t use; those things usually stop working after a while anyway.    </li>
            <li> My teen aged daughter is loving this hair styler!</li>
            <li> It has not dried out my hair and it is quick.</li>
            <li> Hair never looked better with just a brush and dry.  </li>
            <li> I am able to dry my hair in under 4 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It feels solid and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> With heat options &#x27;hot&#x27;, &#x27;warm&#x27;, and &#x27;cool&#x27;, and power levels &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27;, there are plenty of way to dry and style your hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  </li>
            <li> would certainly recommend this dryer and it deserves the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I plug it in and have to have the cord in a certain position or it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> So be smart:</li>
            <li> As bit large for travel</li>
            <li> This dryer really does dry your hair fast and it made my hair look very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I had to purchase a new one - and it was not this model!!</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my old dryer, but this may actually be better for my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;m late on this new technology but its great.</li>
            <li> it worked great but it only lasted a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too loud and is super fast at getting the job done.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not very big which is just fine with me.</li>
            <li> It does have a short cord, but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> (I would have liked to give it 4.75 if I could) is because it takes a little while to heat up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use: not too heavy; 3 temperature settings; easy to put away; buttons don&#x27;t block anything; reasonable price; enough drying power...</li>
            <li> It dries hair quickly, and the concentrator attachment really works well so that you can put the dryer right next to your brush.</li>
            <li> Word to the wise,  take care not to drop it on a hard floor.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m being honest, I expected a little more from this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair &amp; scalp, so USE CAREFULLY</li>
            <li> Light, quiet an works really well.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great because of a few key features:</li>
            <li> It dries hair fast as well.  </li>
            <li> I have to stand very close to the plug point</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I actually had to send my boyfriend out to CVS to buy a cheap model I&#x27;d used without any problems before.  </li>
            <li> I also love the pink color - it makes it easier to spot in my closet.  </li>
            <li> The retractable AC cord is built- in, works well and is very convenient for storage.</li>
            <li> Before I bought it, I didn&#x27;t care so much about the retractable cord</li>
            <li> I really recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle much.</li>
            <li> I love pink.</li>
            <li> I love that this hairdryer is pink.    </li>
            <li> and I love pink.</li>
            <li> found the Infiniti to be a very usable hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned before, I really do like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> It really does work to minimize the frizzies in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> This makes getting it out and putting it away much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  </li>
            <li> And because the cord is retractable, you can&#x27;t really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  </li>
            <li> I have a very finicky daughter.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t blow my hair so much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the WHOLE reason I wanted this model.</li>
            <li> Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly.</li>
            <li> Eventhough I do not use them very often they are there if I need them.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use too much heat.</li>
            <li> Press the retract button gently until you get an idea of how fast it&#x27;s going to move.    </li>
            <li> It comes with attachments which is a plus but doesn&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li> The defuser makes my hair fuller than it really is.</li>
            <li> It came very soon after ordering it.  </li>
            <li> cord is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I really like the 3 heat settings and how fast my hair dries.</li>
            <li> Not really a problem for most people, unless like me you have arthritic joints.</li>
            <li> airflow is generous and I can&#x27;t say if the ions do anything, but it&#x27;s fast at drying my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> * fast drying</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Does a fast job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Its very compact</li>
            <li> I also like the retracting cord, it makes storing so much easier.</li>
            <li> &amp; then there is the benefit of how much faster it dries my hair.  </li>
            <li> it is supposed to really like the dryer</li>
            <li> Really, does something like that happen.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Conair products since my very 1st blow dryer over 30 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It is not advertised as a particularly quiet model, which is important to me, but it is.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I really like how it drys.</li>
            <li> Seems very well made, but I wish I had something lighter.</li>
            <li> Really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The ceramic/ionic features must be doing their jobs because it really lives up to the description.</li>
            <li> So when I went to look for a blowdryer all I really wanted it have was attachments- because I realized that not all blowdryers come with attachments-</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Have had this for about a year and it is not only still going string, but is still in fantastic shape.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if the tourmaline ceramic ionic feature really makes a difference, though.  </li>
            <li> But after using it, I&#x27;ve found a bunch of added bonus, one of which is how fast it dries my hair.</li>
            <li> And the cord doesn&#x27;t retract too fast and hit you in the hand.</li>
            <li> the back grille should be easy to open &amp; clean out lint.</li>
            <li> Very customizable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomend!</li>
            <li> The cord can be &amp;#34;sucked in&amp;#34; in 2 secs and then just put the whole thing away.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> This dryer works very well -</li>
            <li> The number one thing I like about this hair dryer is that it is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It really was the reason I purchased this product over others.</li>
            <li> Not as much OOMPH as the one I lost</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast, too.  </li>
            <li> It is very convenient for a college student like me and it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is very efficient.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and the reel up cord makes for really neat storage.</li>
            <li> but it works much faster.  </li>
            <li> I used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference, the Conair was only 76db vs. 83db from the Andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Expected more life.</li>
            <li> When it does this it makes me just want to wrap the cord around the dryer negating the whole idea of the reel.  </li>
            <li> We were looking for a hair dryer for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> There are cheaper models, but this one is very well made</li>
            <li> I use it with the diffuser (haven&#x27;t attempted a straight styling with it yet)</li>
            <li> Very sturdily built.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s 30 and knows what she wants.</li>
            <li> Thankfully this one is much quieter and he digs the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it with</li>
            <li> But... The dryer itself has really helped my hair.</li>
            <li> I was going to return it, but it was too much of a hassle</li>
            <li> I hang my blow dryer in a over the door hair product caddy,  and it&#x27;s much easier to close the cabinet door now without a cord getting in the way.</li>
            <li> Retractable cord is very convenient for traveling and storage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really to mention..</li>
            <li> This is nothing to really change how I use the blow dryer, but this should probably not happen.</li>
            <li> It is light, and has several options to use.  </li>
            <li> One of my biggest gripes about hairdryers is when they blow too much air</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t retract the whole way and leaves 6 inches of cord exposed.</li>
            <li> One feature I really like is the retracting cord.</li>
            <li> Why anyone wants one where the cord is all over</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The cord keeper is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Also stores away very neatly.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty cool and the retractable cord is a BIG</li>
            <li> The cold shot button is a nice feature too which I seldom use, but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Not having to deal with wrapping up the cord is such a plus...the retractable cord works beautifully and saves space in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s kind of heavy and 2)</li>
            <li> It dries my thick shoulder length hair in about 12 minutes (on a good day).</li>
            <li> it is very light compared to my other hairdryers and the cord winder works very well</li>
            <li> The dry time is very fast, and the retractable cord is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the reviews were right about the cord being slightly short, but that&#x27;s expected to keep a tidy cord keeper.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is only 4 ft. long, but again that&#x27;s adequate in most situations.</li>
            <li> The pink color is pretty, and makes it easy to find in my pile of hair instruments.</li>
            <li> And its got some nice attachments too like a huge SERIOUS diffuser !</li>
            <li> Its not very heavy or particularly loud and the amazing thing is, it actually reels the cord in!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift right as my old hair dryer crapped out on on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud, the heat settings are just right</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d easily give up a long cord for the convenience of it being retractable.</li>
            <li> I have never used this new dryer for longer than 5 minutes because it dries so quickly without leaving that singed, damaged feel I used to get with my old dryer.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t bought a new dryer in years because I have short fine hair and don&#x27;t need one much.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a warm setting (not just hot and cold)</li>
            <li> the current cost (T3 (originally cost $300, now $95).&lt;br /&gt;Faster</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the T3 with no problems for 3 years but just got the Infinity.&lt;br /&gt;Claims - neither one gives my hair more sheen or softness than any other hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is much quieter, but not sure it&#x27;s more powerful......</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on the dryer itself as I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to know its durability/reliability, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The color is nice (red, not pink), it is not too loud, there are 2 speeds and 3 temperatures.</li>
            <li> This thing is quiet and powerful!  </li>
            <li> but IMO this hairdryer doesn&#x27;t give off the heat or air pressure of other top blow dryers on the market.</li>
            <li> I love that the cord is retractable, I would just prefer if there were a loop or some other way to hang it and have it out of the way in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who needs a fabulous, quiet, affordable, space &amp; time saving hair dryer loaded with features.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a long time because I like it fine.</li>
            <li> Wrapping a cord around the handle every time gets old pretty fast when you&#x27;re using a dryer every day.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer is much heavier than my older model - I believe it&#x27;s because of the reel inside the dryer for the cord.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is that it is quite loud, but other than that, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> High wattage for fast drying.  </li>
            <li> love this blow dryer - cool with retractable cord and small that fits when you travel!</li>
            <li> They may want to consider push buttons that lock and unlock as well as using some light weight manufacturing materials or new style servo on the next model.</li>
            <li> I got it replaced by Amazon right away who sent me the exact same one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m asking for too much, but this one seems a little shorter than my last, and I find myself pulling on it fairly</li>
            <li> After a couple months of that silliness, it now won&#x27;t retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  </li>
            <li> many hair dryers get super hot even on meduim heat, this has a very soft medium heat, and is hot enough... and I am not sure what all makes it work so well, but it dries hair FAST.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that.</li>
            <li> This dryer changed my baby fine, thin hair that frizzes in humidity and loses volume in dry climates to lovely, silky brilliantly shiny locks.  </li>
            <li> One thing I have noticed is that my kids now complain the air is too hot, something they didn&#x27;t do with the old dryer (I have to switch to medium heat, and then it takes longer).</li>
            <li> Does not get as hot as my old Conair hair dryer did.</li>
            <li> There was nothing I could do to get it to come back on with full power.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad dryer.</li>
            <li> The solid marble cup is heavy enough to hold down the dryer, it fit perfectly into the interior of the cup, AND eliminated the counter-top clutter of a power cord.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than my older pink Revlon dryer, and it seems only slightly more powerful.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this dryer down to Africa,from the U.S.However,on receiving Infiniti Conair dryer;i</li>
            <li> In hot, humid weather, the cool setting allows me to dry my hair and not overheat while doing so!</li>
            <li> my new hair dryer!</li>
            <li> There are 2 heat settings (low &amp; high) and a cool setting.</li>
            <li> I used the new dryer this morning and my hair dried quick and frizz free.</li>
            <li> and I cannot dry or style my hair comfortably.</li>
            <li> The ionic feature makes my hair dry silky and smooth, believe-it-or-not,</li>
            <li> She likes it better than her previous one, so that was already a plus.</li>
            <li> Works like a decent dryer, but I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in frizz-control.</li>
            <li> The first Conair I ever owned lasted me almost 22 years, so I definitely wanted another Conair and was willing to give the Infinity 223XR a try.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely heavy if you are comparing it to a TRAVEL dryer; in which case i don&#x27;t even know why you&#x27;re purchasing a regular sized dryer and assuming it will be a good travel sized dryer.  </li>
            <li> Works well and particularly like the auto-reel feature.  </li>
            <li> I decided to do a noise comparison of all the dryers we had in the house and sure enough, per minute of drying time, the Infinity was the second quietest.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is fairly heavy and kind of loud.</li>
            <li> Comes with all the extra accessories and has three heat settings and two speed settings, which results in quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted for years, so when it was time to replace it, I wanted the exact same one.  </li>
            <li> The main plus...</li>
            <li> Luckily that is the only con!</li>
            <li> blow as strong as expected for</li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord and the different heat settings, as opposed to just having low and high options.  </li>
            <li> This dryer definitely gets the job done faster, with MUCH less noise on high that is easily tolerated comfortably sans earplugs, which was a high priority.</li>
            <li> After reading several hair dryer reviews, I was very interested in the 213X model in this line:</li>
            <li> I love the retracting cord too - no tangled up mess.  </li>
            <li> I love how I don&#x27;t have to mess around with the cord anymore.  </li>
            <li> Red color is very pretty also.  </li>
            <li> Because I take good care of my appliances and they tend to last a long time, I thought I had simply gotten a lemon.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was too heavy, and, although it claims 1875 watt, it was neither as strong or hot as the ION I had been using</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It scorched my hair on high heat.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Over all I highly recommend this dryer, you can;t beat the quality and the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I keep it in High..</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> I have had high end hair dryer&#x27;s and inexpensive like this style.  </li>
            <li> but I always use high anyway &#x27;cause  </li>
            <li> When I turn it on, it feel like I have it on a medium setting, instead of high.  </li>
            <li> girly color, 2) retractable cord, 3) high power.  </li>
            <li> I like the high speed without having to use high heat.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy (??!!).</li>
            <li> it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don&#x27;t use it) but my style lasts days longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the weight of it now, and the buttons are more managable--it just took a little time to adjust to the difference.  </li>
            <li> Ok, yes, it is a little bulky, but it&#x27;s because it has tons</li>
            <li> It could use a little more air flow power though.  </li>
            <li> I am convinced there is no perfect hair dryer out there, but this particular one does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My just past the shoulders, curly hair is dry in minutes, the retractable cord is very handy</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for teenagers, people who travel a lot, or just anyone who tends to use things more heavily than others.</li>
            <li> but this dryer actually makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> The product is ok, and does the job, but compared to other Infinity hair dryers by Conair, this one isnt as powerful and thus takes longer to dry the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter than my old hair dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had it 18 whole months, and it completely quit working.</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;ve just had my hair professionally done (no lie, really).</li>
            <li> And the cord keeper is such a great function, you will never go back to using a messy cord again.</li>
            <li> The biggie though is how much quieter it is than my old dryer</li>
            <li> As another reviewer commented, you have to destroy the packaging to get it out, but I am going to do my best to get it back in there &amp; sealed up to return as this was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo much quieter than my old dryer that my dog doesn&#x27;t need to leave the room now.</li>
            <li> This dries my hair much faster than my old one.</li>
            <li> &gt; some years ago and did not die for many years of everyday use.</li>
            <li> Low speed is not even worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, here&#x27;s my girl next door review for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Its quite powerful, with two different speed settings and the cord-keeper function is so helpful.</li>
            <li> this hairdryer isn&#x27;t as powerful as my last one</li>
            <li> She has a head full of long blond hair</li>
            <li> I just got this hairdryer a few days ago for Christmas, so I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s longevity, but I love it already.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need such a powerful machine, My mistake I guess, but threw away the box before I realized.</li>
            <li> And the red color is fun too.</li>
            <li> Donated those to the gym lockerroom and decided to spend a few dollars more for this one.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair, and this is the first blow dryer I have owned that actually helps to reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> However after 3 months of normal use (used it once a day for about 5/7 days a week).  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I had hoped and the filter keeps falling off the back.  </li>
            <li> but I found it to be more than long enough for me.</li>
            <li> (she normally has a &#x27;frizz&#x27; problem).  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 6 years and then the cord wore out and was exposing bare wires</li>
            <li> I normally do keep receipts for any appliance I purchase</li>
            <li> Low noise, but powerful.</li>
            <li> The different heat/speed settings were useful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and does dry a little faster, but I prefer the Conair, which was quieter and at peak performance</li>
            <li> It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  </li>
            <li> I tried it in other outlets to be certain and sure enough, it will not longer turn on.</li>
            <li> I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren&#x27;t super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life.</li>
            <li> Other than that it seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  </li>
            <li> and he said it&#x27;s common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful.</li>
            <li> I am able to dry my hair with my daughter&#x27;s room door open and she does not stir.</li>
            <li> Dries my hairs so much quicker than my previous drier and leaves it feeling smooth and</li>
            <li> It did have a powerful fan and dried my hair quickly</li>
            <li> Very convenient and the retractable cord makes it easy to store without the hassle of dealing with a messy cord.</li>
            <li> With my other hairdryers I would frequently have my hair sucked into the back of the dryer, burning my hair and catching it in the fan.  </li>
            <li> I now use a Q-tip, simply touch the tip against the lint, twirl, and the lint gets tangled in the Q-tip and comes right off.     </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to upgrade or replace an old hair dryer!</li>
            <li> The older one is still unpleasantly loud on high though, and I was having to use earplugs while drying my hair just to keep the noise out.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer claims to have all of that, but the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; heat setting is so cool that I have to use &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; if I ever want my hair to actually dry.  </li>
            <li> I usualy get these types of hair dryers, con air or revlon, not too expensive and I prefer the ones with two switches like this one has- off, low, hi and a cool, warm hot switch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty quiet, and the ceramic coil doesn&#x27;t produce the burning smell like older hair driers do.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth with virtually no frizz or extreme dryness.  </li>
            <li> Now I really like it because it has three different heat settings, plus a button for extra cool.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than most other simple hair dryers I&#x27;ve used and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is also pretty quiet for it&#x27;s high wattage.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a new hairdryer - you should give this model a try.</li>
            <li> i think i&#x27;d rather get a new one that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I had a hairdryer for over 10 years when I decided it was time to let it go and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair&#x27;s headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     </li>
            <li> They could also send me a prepaid shipping label and not charge me shipping and handling for a new dryer.      </li>
            <li> Because I knew was going to purchase a new blowdryer for college</li>
            <li> I have wanted a new dryer for ages, but kept waiting because I couldn&#x27;t decide on what to get.  </li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife as a gift and still its working as new.</li>
            <li> I had just bought a new insert.  </li>
            <li> but we live in a townhome).</li>
            <li> and you have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer</li>
            <li> When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s been a while since you bought a new one, go for it.</li>
            <li> Hence, my new replacement.</li>
            <li> She loves the new one.</li>
            <li> I had to go out and purchase a new dryer I went with the remington again.</li>
            <li> I just got me new blow dryer</li>
            <li> Live the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Bought it at a chain store, so don&#x27;t know if I still have the receipt to look into the warranty, but I&#x27;ve already ordered a new hair dryer here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It has 3 speed settings (low, med, high), 2 temperature settings (low, high), and a cool button.</li>
            <li> Our fine hair usually shows broken hairs or growing hairs and this dryer makes all that smooth and more polished.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the color, it actually looks more of a reddish purple to me than pink.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and wanted something that can blow dry my hair quickly and this product is what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li> The cord sometimes doesn&#x27;t go in all the way, I have to pull it back out a bit and press the button again, but this really hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me, and my vanity drawer is much neater now.</li>
            <li> My old dryer (my very old dryer!) needed to be replaced</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fine, but if you don&#x27;t want your counter stained pink, don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product and suggest that you purchase it directly from Amazon, as we did.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost frizz free after I blow dry, so I can just quickly run my flat iron over it rather than having to iron tiny sections to remove the frizz.</li>
            <li> This dries my hair very quickly, and while I&#x27;m not sure how much I believe in the ion and ceramic technology, my hair does seem to have a sheen after drying.  </li>
            <li> I like the multiple heat settings and the high and low and cool shot button.  </li>
            <li> As long as they make this particular model, that will be my first choice if something happens to my new one.</li>
            <li> : This dryer is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> (i.e. I could actually complete drying my hair without shaking/clinching my arm in pain!)  </li>
            <li> The cord is also pretty short.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this dryer EXCEPT the \\&quot;low\\&quot; speed while on \\&quot;hot\\&quot; is NOT hot enough.</li>
            <li> All things considered, and comparing this to various other dryer/stylers that I&#x27;ve used over the years, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Compared to my last one, this dries so fast!</li>
            <li> I am willing to spend the extra money for a quality dryer.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  </li>
            <li> I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don&#x27;t have faith this one will last.</li>
            <li> This is second time i&#x27;ve bought this dryer, after first one servced me well.  </li>
            <li> but if you use the lower setting it is actually pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> Got my first same hair dryer about 9 years ago, it just died, (however I used it maybe 2-10 times a month)&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is one feature that I totally love - the RETRACTING CORD - no more wrapping the cord around the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This one is significantly quieter than any other I have owned.  </li>
            <li> It suddenly stopped producing hot air.  </li>
            <li> My married daughter has asked for only one thing for her birthday...</li>
            <li> Still, I like this blowdryer more than the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> This begs the question of reliability of the Conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the Conair model, this could cause more heat build up of the motor.</li>
            <li> Finally, in frustration, I decided to look for the exact dryer I used to have</li>
            <li> I had this blowdryer for 2+ years when it blew out and had to be replaced (totally my fault by the way, didnt realize you are suppose to clean out the back of blowdryers.</li>
            <li> the retractable cord doesn&#x27;t have any problems, the air intake never sucks my long hair in and the color is even a nice midway point between red and pink.</li>
            <li> She needed a new one, so I surprised her with this one.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about hair dryers since I have long very think hair.</li>
            <li> The dryer dried my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to put it away everyday in a drawer instead of leaving it out on the counter, still plugged in.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and saves a few seconds each morning.</li>
            <li> Luckily this dryer is pretty light and while it is only slightly painful toward the end of my drying time, it should be just fine for people without wrist</li>
            <li> My old dryer had to have the cord wrapped around it a million times, but overall, it was pretty compact.</li>
            <li> In use the dryer is pretty well balanced, and what surprised me, fairly quiet as well.</li>
            <li> The bearing in my wife&#x27;s blow dryer was getting pretty loud (enough to wake me up in the morning - she gets up before me).  </li>
            <li> My puppy chewed up my first one, and bought another type at Target, but it was SO loud, and I took it back.</li>
            <li> I thought my strong, volleyball playing daughter might want it, but she also said it was too heavy.</li>
            <li> : dries hair quickly (I was using it on high for the first few weeks, but today I set the temperature to medium and my hair still dried fairly quickly),</li>
            <li> This new one is a good dryer, works well, but there are some drawbacks which have resulted in the mediocre score</li>
            <li> Controls - more options, less likely to unintentially</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very quiet, drys quickly, prevents frizz and includes two attachments all for an extremely low price.</li>
            <li> I turned it on for first time (without attachments), I thought oh this hair dryer is significantly less powerful than my normal one, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s right because it dries my hair much faster.</li>
            <li> My old Conair dryer finally kicked the bucket and I needed a new dryer fast.</li>
            <li> The design is stylish, it&#x27;s very quiet compared to my old dryer, which thrills my roomie, since I typically shower and style at 2 a.m.</li>
            <li> This one is powerful (dries my hair in much less time), lightweight, useful accessories and multiple settings.</li>
            <li> Many other hair dryer manufacture&#x27;s produce a product that lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way</li>
            <li> Out of the box, this dryer certainly comes with all of the \\&quot;essential</li>
            <li> I wanted quiet, cord reel, high power, and high heat.  </li>
            <li> I had really long hair when I first got it, and then I cut my hair super short recently, so I have yet to figure out how the diffuser works.  </li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;complaint&#x27; is that the cord seems a bit short, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s so it can adequately retract into the unit.  </li>
            <li> It does get a little hot, but not too hot.</li>
            <li> but it is extremely quick in wrapping up, so be careful!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get 5 stars as it is a little heavy, but would buy it again it that good.</li>
            <li> Due to this, it takes much more time to dry my hair than I am used to.  </li>
            <li> so it makes it kind of hard to store in a regular sized vanity drawer.</li>
            <li> Dryer works quickly, yes a little noisy, but that&#x27;s on high speed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 15 times so far, so while I can&#x27;t really comment on how well this dryer holds up over time, I can review on the following features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is faster compared to my old one, the cord doesn&#x27;t use extra space as it rolls inside, which I find very convenient.</li>
            <li> It is much heavier than my old Revlon blow dryer that I finally had to replace.  </li>
            <li> Not to heavy or loud which in my house is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> It is much heavier than my current hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this directly from Amazon.com for my wife.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft and shiny that I have to use a volumizing gel to get any lift.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for frequent travel.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not harsh on my hair....</li>
            <li> so far-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for well over a year so far</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely died, but sometimes you have to smack it to get it to come on.</li>
            <li> purchased this to replace old conair dryer that the cord reel had ceased to work....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I was using a 25 year old, 1200 watt hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The first is minor...</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was smaller than I expected and by it&#x27;s relatively light weight.</li>
            <li> consider that a professional dries my hair in 45 min</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time efficient, not unbearably loud, and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother to replace her old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  </li>
            <li> The problem is actually that the retractable cord sticks straight out (&amp; won&#x27;t bend at all), about four inches from the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li> I just did 4/5 stars because the cord sticks out so far when fully retracted and that was a bit of a bummer for my expectations.</li>
            <li> cord reel was a must-have option for me, as was the diffuser attachment since I have naturally curly hair and like to style it that way.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> yes it is loud</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this blow dryer for at least 7 or more years.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how long I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer exactly, but I know I bought it when my daughter was a baby</li>
            <li> Being a man and purchasing this as a gift for my wife I was looking for something that was of professional quality.</li>
            <li> Once the cord is unwound, it&#x27;s really not heavy (and you wouldn&#x27;t use it with the cord retracted).  </li>
            <li> 86 dBA is LOUD.</li>
            <li> , so far i have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> I know, it sounds far fetched, but for me, this dryer delivered what it claimed.  </li>
            <li> and this really does a terrific job.</li>
            <li> Just DON&#x27;T pull the cord too far out else</li>
            <li> Am always surprised when something does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do in the description.  </li>
            <li> but the cord sure sucks in well.</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> The moment I pulled the dryer out of the box, I thought - wow,</li>
            <li> (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers)</li>
            <li> loud.</li>
            <li> I was surprised.....</li>
            <li> I like the dryer because of the cord reel feature, I just wish it was not so loud.</li>
            <li> Mind you, my old dryer was almost 6-7 years old</li>
            <li> so I purchased this dryer from my local store because it was reasonably priced and it had the reel style cord.  </li>
            <li> I prefer my old Revlon Ionic Pro Sylist.</li>
            <li> It is languishing in the donations at the moment and I am using the old dryer.</li>
            <li> My least favorite color.</li>
            <li> but it straightens my natural locks</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li> This one is considerably quieter than my old dryer, too.  </li>
            <li> and it dries our hair in 2 or 3 minutes completely.  </li>
            <li> There are many models that have the same number of speed and temperature settings, so the only reason I chose this model over others was the retractable cord,  The instructions tell you to be careful with it and to never over extend the cord.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the last thing I do when I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> My hair is left silky and straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doable but I have to watch that I don&#x27;t turn around or move too far from the outlet.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a while the diffuser has melted and is deformed completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too loud</li>
            <li> I replaced my 13-year old Conair hair dryer with this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The heating settings are very standard and work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft and the air is not drying.  </li>
            <li> I now know I need to stay with the professional models.</li>
            <li> I love all the different speed and heat settings and how well dried my hair helping me to avoid the freeze hair I get with humid weather.</li>
            <li> I found this dryer to be pretty heavy and way too hot.  </li>
            <li> Powerful, quiet, dries hair quickly, multiple settings give you options.  </li>
            <li> If you specifically WANT a retractable cord, the extra weight is worth it, otherwise, it&#x27;s just extra weight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my roommate who has thin hair LOVES this hair dryer and is even considering getting her own.</li>
            <li> It does a good enough a job drying hair (not significantly faster or slower than any other 1875 watt dryer).</li>
            <li> Kind of heavy, cord sometimes doesn&#x27;t roll up all the way, not very powerful but my hair is soft when using it.</li>
            <li> The cord is so unbelievably short that I am boxing this thing up and sending it right back.  </li>
            <li> Also I really was surprised at how much power this draws, it blows the breaker if I have lights on in other rooms.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it travels, small!</li>
            <li> Dry your hair on hot.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to then flat iron as much as I did before with my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for two and a half years, and it just died, but that&#x27;s not bad for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was also expecting a better dry from an ionic dryer, but my hair didn&#x27;t seem any less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the Conair and 198 degrees on the Andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached, all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory.</li>
            <li> When I saw this one, I was pretty much mesmerized - not only did it come with attachments( including the diffuser), but it was pink and</li>
            <li> The high speed setting is equal to the medium speed on my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li> My favorite blow dryer finally died, so I was forced to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The cord is shorter than my older dryer by about 8 inches, but for me, it doesn&#x27;t present a problem.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer and non-fuzzy, a daily occurrence with my older hair</li>
            <li> It has all of the settings (hot, warm &amp; cold) plus the settings are on a slide as opposed to the toggle settings.</li>
            <li> It is not super noisy and dries my hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the first one I had only lasted about 2 years</li>
            <li> I bought it as an extra but now use it as my main dryer.</li>
            <li> Lower heat is less damaging to my hair, so since this dryer still gets it done just as quickly</li>
            <li> Its a little heavy, but works great for such a low price.</li>
            <li> the little mesh screen filter in the back gets easily clogged with dust, lint, and hair....</li>
            <li> The cord is a little short - but this machine is strong sturdy and well built.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy and a little heavier than some, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> this one on low sounded like her&#x27;s on high.  </li>
            <li> It also has high, medium, and low heat seatings and 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet on the high setting.</li>
            <li> It is fairly quiet unless you turn it on high speed.  </li>
            <li> That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I&#x27;d mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross.</li>
            <li> I looked high and low for this feature.</li>
            <li> I bought to replace the one i had bought back in high school (longer ago than I care to remember).  </li>
            <li> I plugged it in and it was working just fine when all of a sudden it made a weird sound, shut off and caused the outlet to smoke.</li>
            <li> The pink was a little different from what I thought it would be, but still nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful but not super loud (for a hair dryer, at least), I can get my long hair dry and straight in about 8-10 minutes on warm temperature +</li>
            <li> The one strange thing was that even though this picture is clearly the dryer I had, the one I got was exactly the same but orange instead of burgundy.</li>
            <li> However, something plastic inside melted onto the coil and today it shot hot pieces of pink plastic onto my neck.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;d rather have one with a hanging loop.e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I never realized a dryer could actually be quiet &amp; do such a great job on thin, flat</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like them because they are harder to move, but then I realized that if they were the easier, toggle-type of switch, being placed where they are on the handle, I&#x27;d be inadvertently changing the settings and turning it off during use.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed that my mid-back length, thick hair was less frizzy, more manageable and softer.  </li>
            <li> With previous hair dryers I would have needed to flat iron to get it this smooth.</li>
            <li> The power is not very high, which I was really hoping for.</li>
            <li> She feels it dries her hair significantly faster than her prior hairdryer which was allegedly the same wattage.  </li>
            <li> I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  </li>
            <li> just received this new dryer, to replace a Conair model from several years ago.  </li>
            <li> The wife had some specific requests for the new hairdryer she wanted.  </li>
            <li> , otherwise it takes much longer to dry</li>
            <li> Hair dry fast, and shine after blow.</li>
            <li> I have wavy curly somewhat course and frizzy hair which I blow dry straight.</li>
            <li> While I initially thought the retractable cord would be a plus, it makes storing the entire unit very cumbersome.</li>
            <li> But less damage is worth it--you can always adjust your products or hair style.  </li>
            <li> It seemed a little heavy a first compared to my cheap hair dryer, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t have to do this with my old dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple heat/speed settings: One of the reasons I bought this dryer was because it had multiple heat/speed settings, but only high speed</li>
            <li> My hair is usually shiny, so it&#x27;s hard to determine if the dryer is making a difference, or if it&#x27;s just my natural hair and good shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  </li>
            <li> I would say it takes half the amount of time to dry my hair with this dryer - and my hair feels terrific (full of volume and very silky).</li>
            <li> I hope this dryer performs as well in the future as it has so far!</li>
            <li> Major impact on strength of the fan &amp; on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  </li>
            <li> The dryer does not get as hot as my other Ionic Dryer</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t hot pink!</li>
            <li> The one major downside to this drier is that it vibrates in my hand which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> The bonus is that it actually dries really fast and leaves hair looking much smoother than my previous dryer.  </li>
            <li> find that the \\&quot;high setting\\&quot; air current is not strong enough to really get your hair into staying straight upwards</li>
            <li> They love it and the retractable cord keeps down the mess.  </li>
            <li> This is a powerful little blow drier.  </li>
            <li> Induces less frizz than with my previous hair dryer, which is my favorite quality about the product.  </li>
            <li> at low setting, you actually get a fairly decent amount of power.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  </li>
            <li> If you have short fine hair, you can tolerate the weight, but if your hair is thick, mid length to long requiring longer drying times....holding this heavy dryer up for extended periods will make the job more laborious than it needs to be.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old Conair dryer broke last week</li>
            <li> My whole room used to be painted pink.</li>
            <li> Out of all the hair dryers over the years, I have never had one last this long, and I have never bought the exact same one two times in a row, until now</li>
            <li> Perhaps I expected too much from Conair.</li>
            <li> This item was a lot heavier than I&#x27;d expected, but I really like the retractable cord quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used the defuser attachment so far</li>
            <li> Anyway, I really wanted one with a retractable cord and one that was pink.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see several reviews state</li>
            <li> hair dryer is so quiet, compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li> I have found that I have to retract the retractable cord several times for it to completely retract.</li>
            <li> So far, has withstood the back and forth trips between houses.  </li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually.</li>
            <li> I like that its quiet, yet drys my hair a lot faster than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models.</li>
            <li> My old blow dryer was starting to spark (eek!)</li>
            <li> Seems to take longer to dry my hair compared to my older model.</li>
            <li> I have had the dryer for several months now, and so far no problems mechanically.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The highest setting has about the same amount of power as the lowest setting on my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> (My old dryer had the same amount of watts as this one.)  </li>
            <li> So it actually makes it bigger than my normal hair dryer, so I switched them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer that gets the job done, even though storing it can be kinda awkward..</li>
            <li> I looked for a dryer that would not add more damage to my thin, color hair.....</li>
            <li> a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; push button for interrupting a hot flow) and slow and fast speeds.</li>
            <li> Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don&#x27;t just yank it.</li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t need a long cord, if your outlet is right next to your mirror for instance, the short cord is no big deal.</li>
            <li> If you blow dry your hair on high then</li>
            <li> The Infiniti went right back to the store, where the salespeople were equally horrified to hear that the thing turned my hands pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly loud (at least compared to the other two I tried), the buttons are such that you don&#x27;t keep accidentally turning them off and on as you grip the handle, and it has good drying power.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and only dry my hair with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This dryer really gets the job done, not only does it dry your hair</li>
            <li> And the color is pretty - very pink!</li>
            <li> so now I will see how long this new one lasts.  </li>
            <li> Why did I put off getting a new hair dryer so long?</li>
            <li> My first one stopped working after about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> my experience, my hair did look straighter and more silky than usual, which might be due to the &#x27;Tourmaline Ceramic technology&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Also, why did it only come in hot pink?!</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the very high reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t get as hot, but dries my hair in about the same amount of time as my old (non-ceramic, non-ionic) hairdryer (if anything, a little faster).</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t want to travel with it, and if you had a big, long, full head of hair that took awhile to dry, your arm would get mighty tired.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done really fast however the only qualm I have is that the cord is only three foot long.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the little extra money!</li>
            <li> the cord makes it alot more convinient a little heavy</li>
            <li> I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn&#x27;t worry too much because it didn&#x27;t take very long to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hair dryer, but the lower control buttoms -- which I use the most -- are impossible to handle, at least for my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  </li>
            <li> I recently repaired a short that was in the cord that developed after years of use.</li>
            <li> Only problem was, the distal opening of this hair dryer was bigger than my old hair dryer holder.</li>
            <li> Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is a bit heavy, but this is why it is so powerful.  </li>
            <li> Lots of settings, does not dry out hair.  </li>
            <li> Powerful enough but too heavy.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me ten years and passed down to my son still working.</li>
            <li> diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser is slightly smaller than most other diffusers that I have had in the past; however, it works just as well as any that I have used</li>
            <li> It would be fine for someone with short hair, or thin hair that doesn&#x27;t take too much time to dry.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly heavier than my last dryer, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It normally takes me around 20 minutes total to dry my hair, but with this dryer it takes me around 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Infiniti by Conair model for several years, but was looking to upgrade it to something lighter with a retractable cord, which is exactly what this is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Dries long, thick hair very quickly</li>
            <li> Cool heat/high speed feels nice on a hot summer day, but is worthless if you want to actually dry your hair in less than two hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink ... not just \\&quot;pink\\&quot; ... but SUPER pink!!</li>
            <li> Blow drying my hair is by far my least favorite activity everyday</li>
            <li> really like how quiet this is compared to some other models I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> My old dryer had a long, bulky cord that was always in the way.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, naturally curly, then keratin, then extensions.</li>
            <li> , that was about ten years old, on a trip somewhere, even though this supposedly has the same power and is the same brand.</li>
            <li> Apparently the diffuser is not made to last through the levels of heat that the dryer produces !!!!</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer last several years but finally died.  </li>
            <li> : it seemed a bit heavy on the first day, but I got over that quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> im black) this did not dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li> it makes your hair less frizzy as you blow dry it; well worth the money...</li>
            <li> It does dry my thick african-american hair very quickly and leaves a shine.</li>
            <li> Personally, I wish I hadn&#x27;t been so desperate and had spent a little more time looking, but I&#x27;m also willing to spend a little (or a lot) more money for something I won&#x27;t want to replace later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this hairdryer dries it very quickly.</li>
            <li> * large - this is above average in size, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still works like the first day i had it, but the retractable cord takes a little finagling to get it all the way back in.  </li>
            <li> I found that hard to accomplish because it retracts extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> It keeps it out of the way, but the cord is not very long so you must stay close to the outlet.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and my old blow dryer</li>
            <li> She uses it to dry the hair of my 7-year old son, and he enjoys it, too.</li>
            <li> I wanted a ceramic dryer because my old dryer was dryng out my hair and making it appear dry and course.  </li>
            <li> I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  </li>
            <li> , my previous hairdryers would make my hair very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Revlon brand hair dryer for my 11 year old daughter to use to learn to blow dry her hair</li>
            <li> Then last night, while drying my daughter&#x27;s hair, it started to smell of something burning and a few hot ceramic embers came shooting out.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this machine is big and heavy.</li>
            <li> This dryer is pretty big and heavy.  </li>
            <li> In my perception, it does not dry any faster than a non-tourmaline at the same wattage.</li>
            <li> The Conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that with the first one I bought, I retracted the cord everyday after using it.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> so it dries super fast) and never use the HIGH mode (only LOW) as I was too afraid to burn my hair again.</li>
            <li> Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button.</li>
            <li> I can throw it under the sink cabinet without having a whole mess of cord.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I usually blow dry straight, no problem, but with this one I could not get it straight &amp; ended up just resigning myself to using my flat iron on the still damp but very frizzy fried mess I ended up with.</li>
            <li> The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  </li>
            <li> The cord is not very long, maybe only 3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light blowdryer with enough heat and blowing power to dry her thick hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cord is super short compared to others I have</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thin, wavy hair, and this dryer dries it quickly!</li>
            <li> Either my old dryer was extremely heavy, or the other reviewers have much higher standards than I do.</li>
            <li> If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  </li>
            <li> My expectations were high for this one and it was just average...</li>
            <li> I have short hair that is thick and on high heat and high fan</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference the first time I dried my long hair with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is a little quieter than other dryers and does a nice job drying my thick hair.</li>
            <li> If I use the high temperature, the drying time is about half.</li>
            <li> Switch for heat control and on and off is supposed to slide up and down, but is hard to operate - does not move easily.</li>
            <li> First time used, cord did not retract, and dryer was very heavy.</li>
            <li> (Yes, it takes that long for my natural hair to air dry with</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it would dry my long hair faster than my old school, non-ceramic blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot pink, black, and silver.  </li>
            <li> No more messy cords to deal with, hence easy storage.</li>
            <li> Before those of you in the market for a new hair dryer plunk down $200 or even $50 for a hair dryer, try this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy dryer, but does the job and with only a moderate level of noise on high.  </li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t write a review, but this is the second Conair Infinity 223XR model I&#x27;ve owned that has exhibited identical problems: the cord stops retracting properly after a few uses and then the dryer one day simply ceases to function.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair dryer that was gentler on my hair since I tend to use a flat iron on it daily.  </li>
            <li> settings are great and when I put it on cool and press the cold button, the air is cold.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I think it does get a little too hot on the highest setting, and not hot enough on the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don&#x27;t have faith this one will last.</li>
            <li> I think the cord is long enough and there is a red mark to indicate when to stop pulling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will last as long as my last one!</li>
            <li> I found that dryers with large diameter air inlets and outlets are usually quieter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for few months and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use high speed and medium temperature and it dries my medium length hair in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> As far as performance is concerned, it takes longer to dry hair than the 5 year old plain ceramic Conair dryer it was replacing.</li>
            <li> I replaced the plug with a new, heavy duty one I bought at Home Depot, figuring the bathroom outlet&#x27;s GFCI feature would provide the same protection.</li>
            <li> I have gotten used to ceramic, ionic technology (dries quickly and leaves hair soft) having used expensive Chi hair dryers for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the cord is like 2\\&quot; too short when I am trying to blow dry my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and in order to dry it without frying it, I like to use a diffuser, a low fan setting and a mid heat setting.  </li>
            <li> I guess it dried my hair quickly, but I don&#x27;t remember noticing that it dried it any faster than my pervious hair dryer.    </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d pull it a tiny bit and hope it&#x27;d release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it&#x27;d pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  </li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars because the retractable cord is much shorter than the cord of all hair dryers that I have had in the past (53 inches).  </li>
            <li> ilove conair in general, so afforble and quality beyond expected everytime</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used hairdryers in the past</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair totally flat.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer dries my hair in 10 min flat, sometimes in 5 minutes depending on the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not loud (compared to my last hair dryer).&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> but it has lasted long enough.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because the cord isn&#x27;t quite long enough.</li>
            <li> Thank God for flat irons.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this hair dryer to last me as long as the others</li>
            <li> Couple of issues I disliked about this product was the weight seems a bit heavy, wish it was a bit quieter, and also doesn&#x27;t seem like the air blows very hot.  </li>
            <li> I loved this blow dryer.. :(</li>
            <li> It seems to run less hot than my previous revlon 1600.</li>
            <li> The switch that turns the dryer/styler on and selects the high or low setting is difficult to use -- the button is somewhat recessed into the handle and does not have much of a protrusion to aid in moving it to a different position.</li>
            <li> The cord is a ridiculous 54&amp;#34; and I cannot dry my hair without first clearing the entire counter of everything on it or risk knocking it over with the short cord.  </li>
            <li> I usually like to use high heat with the low speed</li>
            <li> It had heavy use and just started to get worn, so I decided to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair (straight from shower, very wet) in less than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I have owed several in my life as I have very long hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  </li>
            <li> Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]]</li>
            <li> got the job done in half the time of my old blower.</li>
            <li> This thing gets the job done in half the time of my old dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as this being a tourmaline dryer, it&#x27;s an upgrade from non-tourmaline; the technology used dries the water on your hair and you should see less heat damage.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re like me with tons of dry, course hair (enough for two people)</li>
            <li> I have medium-long hair, and this dries it in about half the time of my old one.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that I&#x27;ve had the thing for a few months, and the diffuser is completely melted.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer dries my super thick, long hair way faster than any other blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It dries her very thick and long hair quickly and with ease.</li>
            <li> For obviously fire hazard reasons, I unplug it after use, but will need to find a new dryer as it&#x27;s simply not safe to keep using.  </li>
            <li> I compared the price to my local general merchandise discout store and this was half the price, so I decided to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it is not very long so not much room to move with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine; it does work well until it fails.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer seriously does make my hair smoother, and when you use the concentrating attachment, it really works!</li>
            <li> It works as well as any other consumer-type hair dryer/styler that I&#x27;ve used for the last 20 years and see nothing different in this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned the product for a couple weeks, but I expect it to last for years just like my other Conair, which is now going into the guest bathroom or into my luggage as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned the product for a couple weeks, but I expect it to last for years just like my other Conair, which is now going into the guest bathroom or into my luggage as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> Vivid dark pink with 2 attachments that I use a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether my older unit had it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem so.</li>
            <li> I used a small 10 dollar travel hair dryer for 2 years as my main dryer.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product mainly because of the brand name, I&#x27;ve owned Conair in the past, and the features.</li>
            <li> , I used to have let it air dry for a while if I wanted a short blow dry time.</li>
            <li> and it dry&#x27;s my hair in half the time of my old one</li>
            <li> The design is extremely well done with a fast dry and not that heavy.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, I really liked the dryer when it was working.</li>
            <li> I had needed one for a long time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s an inexpensive item I expected it to last a bot longer.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a bit heavier than the old one, but after a few minutes you realize the heaviness relates to the quality.</li>
            <li> My hair dried faster, looked shinier and felt extremely soft.</li>
            <li> A really, really big pink hairdryer.    </li>
            <li> (There was a big scratch that took the pink off.  </li>
            <li> the cord is 5 feet long - PLENTY of length for me and anyone else, i would think.</li>
            <li> Works well, BUT what I needed was a really long cord.  </li>
            <li> but the research said as long as it has tourmaline (and ions or ceramic or whatever) it should work well.</li>
            <li> After a few years of use my old hair dryer died on me.</li>
            <li> I got this last week and doing the hair drying job as expected..</li>
            <li> However it is a few years old now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like the hair dryer was too heavy or too loud.</li>
            <li> cord isn&#x27;t that long</li>
            <li> , hopefully it lasts long.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a really long time now with no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Appears to have a long shelf life, unless you drop it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased locally, and spent $35.99.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really heavy comparing to my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> This Blow dryer is not loud and works well.</li>
            <li> I only have it 4 stars because I almost wish it blew the hair harder.  </li>
            <li> I expect to have and use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> So not for long hair</li>
            <li> If it lasts that long with her you know it&#x27;s built to take some punishment.</li>
            <li> We will see how long that holds up.  </li>
            <li> I have had a revlon dryer i had used for a long time</li>
            <li> When I asked her how long the warranty is on this product</li>
            <li> The first one, the power switch broken internally so I couldn&#x27;t turn it on or off.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast and I have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> Good grief.</li>
            <li> It has multiple heat and power sessions, and the internal cord storage helps keep clutter down in the cabinet under my seat.</li>
            <li> I had others where the filter screen was the back of the housing, if you laid it down the wrong way the screen mounting tabs broke off too easily.</li>
            <li> It took soo long to dry my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I expected that for the wattage, weight, and size that it would dry my hair faster than my compact dryer -- no such luck.  </li>
            <li> It works quickly to dry my long hair.</li>
            <li> I know at least one other reviewer complained about it not having a loop to hang the dryer from, which I agree should probably be a feature on every hair dryer ever made everywhere, but I will upload a user photo later showing how I hang my dryer on the wall using a brass hook, which works just fine.</li>
            <li> The plug is polarized (one prong wider than the other, so you can only plug it in one way) and has a rigid sleeve on the cord beneath it.</li>
            <li> So, other than my specifically quietRevlon, and the flea size Windmere, the Infinity was very quiet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Conair dryers for years, but they share the same issue with other brands......</li>
            <li> and it would only retract about 50% of the way with the rest of the cord hanging like other dryers without retractable cords.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased because I dropped my other one and broke it.</li>
            <li> I do have to dry my hair in layers, though</li>
            <li> It also is equipped with Tourmaline Ceramic technology which, according to the box, \\&quot;generates ions that work hair molecules to help dry them inside and out...</li>
            <li> Today I went to dry my hair and the dryer</li>
            <li> but it did dry hair.</li>
            <li> you know, unless you decide to blow dry your hair while doing chores around the house and expect the blow dryer to follow.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s slow(er) to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> The cord keeper is a great feature too and keeps corn from getting all weird and twisted.</li>
            <li> which leaves me about 5&amp;#34; to maneuver to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> The higher-heat dryers without the airflow just seem to bake your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> Hence it can dry your hair in minutes</li>
            <li> (If you were trying to dry your child&#x27;s hair, probably be a pain)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks now, every morning to dry my hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally dry before replacing on the unit, of course), extending the life of my unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big</li>
            <li> I got this blow dryer because I wanted to get one which had ionic and tourmaline technology so that my hair would dry faster and be a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry well for my hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer the hurricane effect as I don&#x27;t have 30 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> the air volume being pushed out but it does dry efficiently.</li>
            <li> but not after I dry it.  </li>
            <li> One swipe of a towel over my head and my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> It dries my long thick hair much quicker than other models</li>
            <li> I have pushed both the test and reset buttons numerous times, tried multiple outlets, let it sit over night and it just plain does not work anymore.</li>
            <li> she explained that it has a 3 year limited warranty but that they could not assist me if I didn&#x27;t have a receipt.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t last long, less than a year.</li>
            <li> If you have long, thick hair this would be pretty heavy to use for any length of time.  </li>
            <li> I use warm and cold and my hair has become a lot healthier!</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new hair dryer after my previous one gave out after a few years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to keep that little screen clean, including carefully brushing it with a small stiff brush....</li>
            <li> but it is not very powerful so takes a long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> hair is halfway down my back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful but not LOUD with that annoying whiney sound they usually make.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally.</li>
            <li> I am not forced to subject my tresses to high heat, yet, I can dry my hair within about a half an hour vs. the air drying time of approximately 24 hours.</li>
            <li> With this dryer, it&#x27;s dry in 2 minutes not even!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, less than 3 months after purchasing, I unplugged it to move it to a different outlet and it no longer works.</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti has a double layer, a metal screen inside a plastic housing, making the chances of mishap much less.  </li>
            <li> Larger fan diameter equals slower and less noisy fan.</li>
            <li> But then this morning the inside exploded after using it for less than 1 minute on LOW mode.</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t dry my hair when it&#x27;s sopping wet -</li>
            <li> but I never thought it would die less than a year later!!!!</li>
            <li> I needed a good hair dryer bad!  </li>
            <li> I specifically bought this one based on the performance of the other, and it&#x27;s not lived up to par, by a long shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is light weight, which is a plus as I have thick long hair as my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on here Amazon to compare with the black and pink Conair hair dryer before buying it through SOAP.com/Wag.com -- which I believe are related sites to Amazon..</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, so it always dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> The plastic construction is tight so it feels solid in your hands.</li>
            <li> it takes forever to dry&amp;#34; kind of gals and this bad boy had it completely dry in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> but because I have had previous Conair products last me several years, I decided to throw the receipt away just a few months ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to dry my long hair (up to 70% faster than previous ones) and no frizz effect!</li>
            <li> The only con I can find is that it is a little heavier them I am use it.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a little bulky for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> especially the one for curly hair with the little prongs.</li>
            <li> cons: seems a little heavier than the T3 and the cord is on the short side because it retracts.    </li>
            <li> Cord is a little short....</li>
            <li> little big for travel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little bit heavier in weight than my last (crappy) dryer, but I would expect that from a salon quality dryer.</li>
            <li> Cord is a little short</li>
            <li> Fairly quiet The cord could extend a little longer.</li>
            <li> I selected this dryer after reading other reviewers comments, as I was looking for one that did not make me feel like I was opting for dry hair over my hearing.</li>
            <li> May think it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair quickly due to</li>
            <li> (just hang onto it and do a controlled retract or you will smack your hand badly) and not gonna lie, love the pink dryer in the morning.</li>
            <li> what a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I also give it points for being sturdy since I&#x27;m a super clumsy person and have dropped it on the floor a ridiculous amount of times without any resulting damage.</li>
            <li> The only negative is to say this is my 2nd one.  </li>
            <li> but I expect a blow dryer to last at least several years.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching which hair dryer I wanted to purchase</li>
            <li> So please do not get carried away with this fancy pink color and retractable chord facility.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Longevity - unknown.  </li>
            <li> There is a wide variety of settings for every stge of your hair (wet, damp).</li>
            <li> I wear pink a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still just a pink hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Also there is a scratch in the paint about 1/4 of an inch wide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for only a few weeks, so I cannot speak to its longevity.  </li>
            <li> I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  </li>
            <li> The color pink is sassy and space-age.  </li>
            <li> It has a few attachments with it to help you with different styles.</li>
            <li> the pink is so</li>
            <li> I would rather not have to put stress on the cord by hanging it from the plug body, but I believe since it doesn&#x27;t bend the cord, and the dryer is lightweight, that stress would be minimal if not negligible.</li>
            <li> I would rather not have to put stress on the cord by hanging it from the plug body, but I believe since it doesn&#x27;t bend the cord, and the dryer is lightweight, that stress would be minimal if not negligible.</li>
            <li> I ordered this not really knowing it had a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> ; is 4.5&#x27; (roughly).  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s (roughly) 4 feet...</li>
            <li> It feels a tad heavy to me, but the last 10 years I have used a mini hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid, heavy, multiple speed hair dryer with and a few attachments that aren&#x27;t going to see use, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quite pink.</li>
            <li> My daughter thought it was a bit heavy for her smaller hands</li>
            <li> It still works just as expected.</li>
            <li> The dryer has a heavy and solid feel to it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not complaints about this thing.</li>
            <li> They are not raised, so it is harder to control the heat settings and also shut on and off.  </li>
            <li> pros: dries my hair quicker that my T3 (that i spent $180)   </li>
            <li> This is something to be careful of anyway.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer a few months back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as pink as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty, I bought it because it was pink.</li>
            <li> and I did not really like it.  </li>
            <li> heavy - I like to hold the dryer vertically above my head</li>
            <li> The air intake on the back is a 1-3/4 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this hair dryer is that the cord sometimes has trouble retracting.</li>
            <li> for 4 months (only used a few ttimes per week)</li>
            <li> I bought one a few years back.</li>
            <li> so so so so much, such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Pink Edition - BABBPK2000,</li>
            <li> Cons: short cord, heavy.</li>
            <li> It is not overly heavy and comes with a smaller diffuser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too heavy and not from solid construction.  </li>
            <li> just a few minutes later it would automatically turn off.</li>
            <li> If anyone complains it is too big or heavy, well, I&#x27;ve got to say this is not a portable hair dryer.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer does wonders on naturally wavy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coily, natural, African-American hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, Asian hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It is a little larger than I thought it would be, though that&#x27;s probably due to the fact that it has room within it to hold the cord.</li>
            <li> Noise level is standard for a hair dryer, maybe even slightly quieter than average.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me 45 minutes to blow dry my hair and it only took 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should expect the shelf life of a hair dryer to be less than two years, because that is how long this dryer will work.  </li>
            <li> It literally takes only half the time than my previous drier.</li>
            <li> It still worked, but the power was down and it was taking longer and longer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find one that&#x27;s not loud and like a jetstream, even on low.</li>
            <li> I upgraded and bought a $50 Babyliss dryer hoping it would cut my dry time in half (like the reviews claimed).</li>
            <li> but it cuts the dry time for my hair by about a half because it&#x27;s just a stronger air flow.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel over dried or brittle as it usually did with my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering getting a professional</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly only for parties or functions because I believe extensive use of styler with style sprays and serums is not good for hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> The efficiency cuts my dry time probably in half.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly, red hair, and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This takes about 25 minutes to dry my hair fully whereas other dryers I have owned previously it took maybe 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It usually stops before fully retracted, but having been popped by some vacuum cords, I suggest being careful.  </li>
            <li> I have used this new dryer not more than 5 times in the past 3 months(since</li>
            <li> I have long hair that takes FOREVER to dry (usually 30min)</li>
            <li> The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  </li>
            <li> My thick long hair dried in half the time with my old dryer.</li>
            <li> but I just wanted to warn other people looking at this hair dryer that in this case \\&quot;what you see is not what you get\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li> Hey, if you need a hairdryer and you dig pink (and being UBER-TIDY!)</li>
            <li> any other drier does...</li>
            <li> That said, it works well and seems quieter than other hairdryers.</li>
            <li> I tested my outlet with other things and the outlet was working.  </li>
            <li> It worked extremely well while it lasted.</li>
            <li> but that is due to the retractable cord</li>
            <li> Reviews at other sites show this to be a non-uncommon problem.</li>
            <li> As for how well my hair looks after using it, I notice no difference from the other dryers.  </li>
            <li> &gt;* quieter than other hair dryers</li>
            <li> I do not recommend that you use the self retracting cord feature without holding the cord with the other hand.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife because i broke her other one.  </li>
            <li> she likes it, it works like her other one.</li>
            <li> It al o is not as noisy as some other blow dryers.</li>
            <li> This problem might be due to the retractable feature of the cord.</li>
            <li> I bought two other cheaper Conairs</li>
            <li> I am a short person with small hands</li>
            <li> Still not sure what the difference would be between this and the cheaper model with the retractable cord, but I like it overall!  </li>
            <li> so it was due time.  </li>
            <li> My other one I had had for years and was shorting out.  </li>
            <li> The opening is a bit small when compared to the Andis model which is larger at 2-3/8 inches and has side air intakes as well.</li>
            <li> and we have every reason to expect the longevity other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li> (the condenser doesn&#x27;t spin like I&#x27;ve had happen on other hair dryers)</li>
            <li> It dries my hair, but plenty of other cheaper models would do that just as well.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> and i guess i was due for a change.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have found this to be a problem with other appliances with retractable cords too.</li>
            <li> Have used this hairblower before; it lasts longer then any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the plug is really loose to the wall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basing this on the fact that it seems to take a very long time for my hair to dry using this machine as compared to other blow dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> , it is heavy and the handle is at a strange angle that makes it harder to hold than previous hair dryers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It is such a chore normally to blow dry my crazy hair but not with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I have medium length &amp; thick hair just past my shoulders and my hair will dry completely with this dryer in 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> she broke her other dryer and needed a new one since she was tired of borrowing roommates.</li>
            <li> only CON is that this dryer is very heavy.  </li>
            <li> Which means I can take it off and WASH it (being very careful to insure</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair that is mid-way down my back.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t hold a heavy dryer for very long.</li>
            <li> : This dryer takes me about 15-20 minutes to dry my thick shoulder-blade-length hair, which is about the same as my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> that nifty ionic/etc technology: I don&#x27;t know any of the science behind it, but I definitely notice a big difference in my hair with this dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I liked everything about this dryer, I find it very annoying that after only 9 months, I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> Eventually it started having electrical problems due to a loose wire or something that was caused by pulling out the cord everyday.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer can have y hair from damp to dry in less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> The lower on/off/blower level button is awkward because it&#x27;s so low and using it one handed made it hard for me to smoothly maneuver it, but after handling the dryer for a few weeks now I&#x27;m a pro.  </li>
            <li> For me this hairdryer is a little heavy and takes longer to dry my hair than I expected.</li>
            <li> So, it worked fine for 3 years but died an painful death.</li>
            <li> asked my wife about the &#x27;frizz&#x27; claim the other day, as I was skeptical about that part of the claim - and she said it really does work</li>
            <li> Its a little on the heavier side, but that is to be expected considering the technology within it.  </li>
            <li> The tourmaline makes my hair less frizzy than other dryers too.</li>
            <li> secretly because his previous dryer was so loud!</li>
            <li> Bad ergonomics, no power, cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest a regular simple(long and dangling) chord dryer rather than a complex retractable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed that after only 6 short months of very occasional use (i was only drying my hair maybe 4 times a MONTH)</li>
            <li> I did not find it to be louder or softer than the average hair dryer.    </li>
            <li> After my hairdryer broke and visiting a couple of stores with no success to replace it, I decided to put my amazon prime account to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth a penny over $9.99 in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I owned an iron (for clothing) that had one and the cord, which was incredibly long, eventually twisted and after time it didn&#x27;t wind completely anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have never really considered how heavy a hair dryer is when purchasing, so you may want to consult another review for that point.</li>
            <li> The heat output on this one is insane, and my hair always looks good.</li>
            <li> Although, it&#x27;s possible to put the dryer down without having the cord retract if you treat it like it&#x27;s made of delicate glass.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, frizzy 2A hair, and this dryer could get my hair mostly dry in under ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less noisy than other models that move less air.</li>
            <li> Also, i find this dryer a little bit more heavier than other dryers, making my hairstyling time very painful and also long.</li>
            <li> but it is very heavy to hold up for too long.  </li>
            <li> I have no problems with the hair dryer itself, however, one can&#x27;t register the warranty because the company&#x27;s drop down menu does not list the year 2011.</li>
            <li> It was placed on the side of the dryer where it sticks out, so that when you put the dryer down in between blows, it pushes the button and startles me as it trys to retract.</li>
            <li> so I immediately switch it down to medium..</li>
            <li> Be careful of fingers or retract it little by little and not all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> less than average because it died so soon.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how heavy the hairdryer was initially, now it is not so bad (bought the hair dryer back in April)</li>
            <li> About 2 months ago the original plug went bad.</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint it would be that the cord is a little too short.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very heavy and doesn&#x27;t have a very long cord.</li>
            <li> Just wish they would make it in a neutral color like silver or black.</li>
            <li> (As though it isn&#x27;t weird enough that there are entire aisles of hairdryers/straighteners/stylers).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some sort of black, pointy attachment for this thing.</li>
            <li> So I called the number on the site, and a polite gentleman answered in less than one ring.</li>
            <li> (I previously had an inexpensive Revlon)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> There is less blowing around of my hair, and I feel like my hair dries smoother</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less than that of the Conair Infiniti.</li>
            <li> I typically always buy Conair because they&#x27;re priced well.  </li>
            <li> I had one previously and wore it out.</li>
            <li> had this dryer for less than a year and out of no where it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly, not overly noisy, switches are conveniently placed (where they&#x27;re not accidentally moved on/off)  </li>
            <li> then about 2 minutes in, the drying power was cut in half.</li>
            <li> my typical life based on every day usage is two years.</li>
            <li> But less than 6 months after purchasing it, it started malfunctioning.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to talk over it when it was on high.  </li>
            <li> Less mess under my sink cabinet.</li>
            <li> All the little sticks are bent down and it gets tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li> The dryer might be a little heavier than other dryers out there, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> I dont usually dry my hair everyday, and ive used it not more than 6 months</li>
            <li> The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a mess in my drawer</li>
            <li> and so I hit my hair with cold at the end until my hair isn&#x27;t hot anymore.</li>
            <li> What a time and mess saver.</li>
            <li> First unit arrived and had a defective cold button.  </li>
            <li> Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  </li>
            <li> My old and expensive blowdryer that I received as a birthday present still ran but slowly.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair and have no issues.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long and thick...</li>
            <li> But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  </li>
            <li> &quot; my hand down the heavy dryer to get to the off button.     </li>
            <li> They are slick and do not stick out much, so it&#x27;s hard to get your fingers make it to work--especially since it&#x27;s heavier than my last</li>
            <li> But I do know I feel uncomfortable using it and threw it away and will have to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous Conair hair dryer, despite reviews that said it would be too heavy.  </li>
            <li> But I got tired of having to wind up the cord all the time after I used my old small dryer for a minute.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m done in a few minutes vs 15 with the previous one.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not super heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for just over a year and up until today, I only had one minor issue with it: the cord would not always reel in all the way when I pushed the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, sadly, today it decided to die on me.</li>
            <li> Keeps my gym bag a little less messy.  </li>
            <li> What I did not want is hot pink (I hate pink.)  </li>
            <li> for a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little heavier than I imagined....</li>
            <li> It almost gives it a little bit of leverage when you use it.     </li>
            <li> The retractable cord is a little snappy, beware of it flipping the cord against you.  </li>
            <li> ... shame on you for manufacturing such a shoddy piece of equipment!  </li>
            <li> The switches take a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve also loosened up a little.</li>
            <li> Conair FINALLY hired someone with some common sense!  </li>
            <li> it was listed at a little over $20 on Amazon at Christmas, but by the time I tried to order they were sold out every where I looked, so again I searched ...</li>
            <li> probably would have gone with one that was a little bit cheaper if i had to do it over again.</li>
            <li> Cord Reel is a little bulky.</li>
            <li> I wish the cord were just a little longer.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a bit heavier than my traveling dryer but that just means I am sneaking in a little toning exercise for my arms.  </li>
            <li> The sound is less annoying, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I usually just let my hair air dry because a blow dryer makes it look \\&quot;puffy\\&quot; and takes so long that my arms get tired.  </li>
            <li> I got so frustrated with my old hair dryer - because the cord constantly stayed a mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy and somewhat bulky</li>
            <li> a plus!&lt;br /&gt;Slight downside would be that it&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Fairly heavy (Not friendly for those who have difficulty lifting/manuevering/</li>
            <li> A little heavy (ceramics i guess) but balanced well.  </li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;s a little heavy and large/</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> compared to other blow dryers!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a really big, really expensive, pink hairdryer.    </li>
            <li> And drag the cord all over the countertop knocking everything off with it,  Big fail.</li>
            <li> This may be do to the fact that it&#x27;s a better quality/more expensive than the one I&#x27;m used to, but it&#x27;s a bit awkward when in use.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the cold button works fast</li>
            <li> The unit is heavy to use.</li>
            <li> (I will update this review after I use it a few times).</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here before buying it -- but don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s heavy like some have stated.  </li>
            <li> the downside, it is on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length wavy hair, which tends to curl messily during humid days.</li>
            <li> With this, it is also quite heavy.</li>

            <li> It is just now giving me trouble.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem heavy to me.</li>
            <li> I explained the problem, he asked me a few questions, and then looked up the warranty.  </li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>

            <li> The dryer is HEAVY, but it is not a problem for me.  </li>

            <li> It dries my hair in half the time and it isn&#x27;t frizzy at all!</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this dryer though is that it seems to get slight paint chips on the side :/</li>
            <li> Owned it less than a year, it broke!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer, not exactly a cure for the common cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I picked up a new dryer at the drug store and it was horrible, jet engine loud but not much</li>

            <li> It dries just as well as any other dryer I have used in the past (both moderate priced and expensive).  </li>
            <li> I dried my hair no more than once a week for that reason, but I can&#x27;t wait to use it every time,</li>
            <li> plus, no more tangles and messy cords taking up my bathroom space</li>
            <li> This one was noticeably quieter than some other ones I have used, and the noise is slightly lower pitch and not as shrill.</li>

            <li> We have long thick hair in this family, and it&#x27;s way too weak to do the job without taking forever.</li>
            <li> for 1875 watt dryer it generates very little power.</li>
            <li> I found it was really heavy, and I also had a really hard time with the button placement...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than the one I used before, but it does, of course, serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unbearably heavy!</li>
            <li> no more trying to make my cord wrap around my dryer to keep it out of the way.  </li>
            <li> but so does my small hairdryer.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> (they actually had the wrong user manual uploaded to the hairdryer).</li>
            <li> Just hope nothing goes wrong with it, or you&#x27;ll be spending ten bucks to replace a 25 dollar dryer!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy this one again or not.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I think I can look past that.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smoother with no static electricity.  </li>
            <li> The motor is quieter than dryers I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
            <li> No more wrapping the hairdryer cord around the unit.</li>
            <li> Im not sure why you would need it any longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed, and am thinking of getting a smaller dryer instead.</li>
            <li> was so anxious to use it.</li>
            <li> The dryer is heavier than a usual dryer because of the cord reel, and 2)</li>
            <li> The cord is a little short -- I&#x27;d like another 6\\&quot; (dirty minds...).  </li>
            <li> but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores</li>
            <li> I have broken two of these hair dryers in less that 4 months.</li>
            <li> Hard to complain for under $24.</li>
            <li> already since this one blows so hard.</li>
            <li> I wanted a dryer that wouldn&#x27;t wake up the household late at night and wouldn&#x27;t blow out my ear drums.</li>
            <li> BIG disappointment.  </li>
            <li> This sucks.</li>
            <li> Before this I was using a similar Conair unit with Cool/Low/High heat and Low/High speed settings, a cold shot button, a retractable cord reel and a diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never own another product of Conair again.</li>
            <li> My last blower lasted about 4years,,not bad for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Well the title tells you my biggest complaint with this item.  </li>
            <li> She wanted a blow dryer that could handle her thick hair, and this one does.</li>
            <li> (travel dryer, v. slow)    </li>
            <li> Reel slowly stops working over time.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> It also gets dry in approximately 5-7 minutes, cutting my drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> i mean</li>
            <li> No more tangled cord!</li>
            <li> and worst of all, didn&#x27;t dry hair as well as the old conair</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior</li>
            <li> But seriously, it&#x27;s....a....hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is meant for a serious blow dryer, I think.</li>
            <li> Was it serious?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who leaves a twisted cable mess attached to any hairdryer she has ever used.  </li>
            <li> I just got this hair dryer a few days ago to replace one that randomly stopped working.</li>
            <li> they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you&#x27;d struggle?  </li>
            <li> But after my last usage on Tuesday I became sick and paid no attention to the dryer laying on the counter in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> not sure why this couldnt be wrapped too even though the other wrapping was bad.</li>
            <li> Bad:  relatively minor complaints.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed though that it only lasted 20 months.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has the standard length cord - disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used Conair (I&#x27;ve tried the T3 and other fancy dryers and they are horrible, not to mention they don&#x27;t come with diffusers)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Conair hairdryers and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it!</li>
            <li> Ive always had problems with my hair drying to slow but not with this product!</li>
            <li> The diffuser has very hard plastic fingers.</li>
            <li> well, in truth, it doesn&#x27;t blow very hard either.    </li>
            <li> This dryer is like half time in that part because the cold button is cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and I mean tons!)</li>
            <li> After calling me a wimp, she grudgingly agreed it might be a little heavier.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet, the retractable cord works well, and it has a cold setting as well as a cold button.</li>
            <li> i purchased) and the RETRACTABLE CHORD IS already BROKEN.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any advantage to the \\&quot;tourmaline ceramic\\&quot; dryer/styler.</li>
            <li> So I bought a hair dryer holder and hang my dryer behind the cabinet door.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t broken which is a plus.</li>
            <li> although annoying to get the cord back in and out at times.  </li>
            <li> I read that some folks were not happy with the length of the cord</li>
            <li> The power level is not great and the retraction takes some repetition to get it to fully retract.</li>
            <li> I think you could get a worse blow dryer than this, at the current price, but I just felt like it was crap.  </li>
            <li> I hated the previous mess of a hair dryer cord all over my BR countertop.</li>
            <li> Seriously people, hold the plug while you push the button to retract and no one gets hurt!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess my hair doesn&#x27;t seem terribly static-y, but i live in a humid area, so  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it  and afraid I will not be using it, since I am not loving it.</li>
            <li> Alas, it was a sad day.</li>
            <li> The only downsides I have are it gives my hair a really awkward texture, like too fluffy, and it smells HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> all, I&#x27;m very disappointed with this dryer, and will look for another retractable one next time.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord has become difficult to retract.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how difficult it is to get a dryer that would meet all my requirements.  </li>
            <li> The on/off and temp control switches are difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> This left me completely disgusted</li>
            <li> The end of the plug cord is thicker, and difficult to bend, and the nose of the dryer is a bit longer</li>
            <li> It started to fail about the18- month mark and stopped altogether at 20 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shy away from another retractable cord product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It does vibrate, which is weird, and I had read about this somewhere in the reviews.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am going to have to replace it.</li>
            <li> I started to notice a faint pinkish tint to my countertop where the dryer sits.</li>
            <li> but sadly Amazon sent me a yucky fuchsia dryer.</li>
            <li> you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70&#x27;s?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my unit stopped working after about 15 months after purchasing.</li>
            <li> low-star reviewers mentioned the finish coming off on their hands, and I&#x27;d just like to clarify that is a random flaw in their dryers.</li>
            <li> Sorry conair.</li>
            <li> Avoiding heat, however, can prove to be difficult when living in the Mid-Atlantic area during the winter.</li>
            <li> the slide switches are difficult to operate on the skinny handle.</li>
            <li> They failed today August 27, 2017.</li>
            <li> The highest setting was now merely a trickle of air.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re expensive.</li>
            <li> This has been extremely frustrating when trying to dry/style my hair in the mornings before leaving for work!</li>
            <li> High&#x3D;86 dBA  Low&#x3D;76 dBA (very shrill)    </li>
            <li> It is big and heavy, but the worst part is that it vibrates like crazy - very uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating and disappointing.</li>
            <li> I used my mom&#x27;s hair dryer once and realized how horrible other hair dryers are.</li>
            <li> But Chi is expensive, and not reliable - heating element went bad in 6 mos in one, the housing cracked on another one.  </li>
            <li> To set the curl go to cold air.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*Three levels of heat, Three levels of speed, cold shot</li>
            <li> (Anyone can use it, although I never use the cold shot feature)&lt;br</li>
            <li> 7) cold shot -</li>
            <li> The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a cold shot button that functions well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This time however, the cord stopped retracting about two months of using it, so that was really unfortunate :(</li>
            <li> (So sick of those black, INSANELY bulky, dryers!!)  </li>
            <li> (I HATE chords that get twisted and stuck everywhere).</li>
            <li> Although the dryer is in working condition(as of now), the chord makes it impossible to work with.</li>
            <li> but it was a bad experience for me.</li>
            <li> a retractable cord was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> If it was bad, I would never hear the end of it.</li>
            <li> i have always hated blowdrying my hair because it always made it frizzy and poofy in the wrong ways.</li>
            <li> FRUSTRATED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also disappointed that I have to go through a rigamarole to have the dryer replaced.  </li>
            <li> However, I am disappointed it quit working after 10 months of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is DANGEROUS!</li>
            <li> You may argue that just south of 4 years is plenty for a hair dryer, I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Instead, I HATE this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> hate washing my hair b/c</li>
            <li> i hate it so</li>
            <li> Impossible to use with no cord!</li>
            <li> Seriously disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> One of the reason I wanted to try it was for the retractable cord which unfortunately does not work!!!  </li>
            <li> This might just be the worst hair dryer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> The one star was given because Conair has terrible customer service.</li>
            <li> I didin&#x27;t purchase this from amazon however this is the weakest, worst dryer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Try to press reset button, still nothing, it is very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Conair product is my favorite. This is the best dryer. I have bought it as a back-up for travel to the same&lt;br /&gt;model that I bought awhile back. It is a great dryer and functions a long time. My very first was purchased&lt;br /&gt; some years ago and did not die for many years of everyday use. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Soon after we purchased this the auto rewind quit working and leaves about 12-18&amp;#34; of cord sticking out.  Hair dryer itself works okay, but would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wanted a decent hair dryer at a good price and this was the one I picked. I have had it for over 2 years and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> The unit probably does tame friz but it leaves my hair totally flat. The cord gets stuck all the time and is too short even all the way out. The unit is heavy to use. Gave it away after two uses.</li>
            <li> The product is ok, and does the job, but compared to other Infinity hair dryers by Conair, this one isnt as powerful and thus takes longer to dry the hair. I do love the fact that it has a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  And does a nice job styling hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer.  Ample speed and heat settings, comfortable to use, and best of all, no more tangled cord.</li>
            <li> This dryer features a retractable cord. First time used, cord did not retract, and dryer was very heavy. Switch for heat control and on and off is supposed to slide up and down, but is hard to operate - does not move easily. and worst of all, didn&#x27;t dry hair as well as the old conair I had.&lt;br /&gt;Next!</li>
            <li> Bought this for $20 on Amazon (sale?).  Nice and quiet compared to the one my wife used to use.  I&#x27;m surprised more women don&#x27;t have hearing loss from all the noise of these things.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord has become difficult to retract.  This occurred in a relatively short time.  Except for this difficulty, I like the product.</li>
            <li> The greatest thing this dryer has is the retractable cord - and, of course the varied choices for temperature and blowing power!</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer -- love the retracktable cord, and the diffuser that it comes with.  It dries hair fast as well.  The first one has held up three plus years so we bought another one!</li>
            <li> My old Conair dryer finally kicked the bucket and I needed a new dryer fast. After reading reviews for about a dozen different hair dryers I finally decided on this dryer. I&#x27;ve used it about 15 times so far, so while I can&#x27;t really comment on how well this dryer holds up over time, I can review on the following features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Noise level: This dryer is pretty quiet. I wanted a dryer that wouldn&#x27;t wake up the household late at night and wouldn&#x27;t blow out my ear drums. This dryer fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Weight: I wanted a lightweight dryer. I have wrist injuries and I can&#x27;t hold a heavy dryer for very long. Luckily this dryer is pretty light and while it is only slightly painful toward the end of my drying time, it should be just fine for people without wrist injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Quick drying: This dryer takes me about 15-20 minutes to dry my thick shoulder-blade-length hair, which is about the same as my previous dryer. I do have to dry my hair in layers, though, otherwise it takes much longer to dry (I didn&#x27;t have to do this with my old dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple heat/speed settings: One of the reasons I bought this dryer was because it had multiple heat/speed settings, but only high speed/high heat works well. The high speed could even stand to be more powerful than it is. Medium heat/high speed is somewhat adequate, but takes a lot longer. Cool heat/high speed feels nice on a hot summer day, but is worthless if you want to actually dry your hair in less than two hours. Low speed is not even worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-All that nifty ionic/etc technology: I don&#x27;t know any of the science behind it, but I definitely notice a big difference in my hair with this dryer. My hair is significantly shinier, softer, and silkier than it&#x27;s ever been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this dryer as it is pretty good, though not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: end of 2013 I finally had to replace this hair dryer and relegate it to \\&quot;back up dryer\\&quot; status. It still worked, but the power was down and it was taking longer and longer to dry my hair. I upgraded and bought a $50 Babyliss dryer hoping it would cut my dry time in half (like the reviews claimed). It&#x27;s good and does dry a little faster, but I prefer the Conair, which was quieter and at peak performance I don&#x27;t think it took significantly more time to dry.</li>
            <li> Good. wired only good for home use, kinda short.  Hair dry fast, and shine after blow.</li>
            <li> this is another Christmas wish item for one of my daughters and she uses all the time. works great and has never had any issues</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this hairdryer and it&#x27;s retractable cord, but it really hasn&#x27;t lived up to the original excitement. As a hairdryer, it&#x27;s just okay. It&#x27;s no better than the one I used before, but it does, of course, serve its purpose. Although the cord does retract, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t retract all the way. Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad dryer. I was just hoping for more.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product. I have long, thick, curly, red hair, and it works wonders. Sometimes I want straight hair, so I&#x27;ll brush and dry my hair at the same time for the straight hair, and it works great! This hair dryer dries my hair in 10 min flat, sometimes in 5 minutes depending on the day. I also love the cord that goes into the dryer itself. So awesome and convenient!! You must buy this hair dryer, it will change your life! :)</li>
            <li> I went thru a couple dryers before finally finding this one.  I wanted quiet, cord reel, high power, and high heat.  What I did not want is hot pink (I hate pink.)  What swayed me was that it won an award from Allure magazine as being the best.  Thank you Allure.  Didn&#x27;t realize how difficult it is to get a dryer that would meet all my requirements.  Totally excellent dryer.  Just wish they would make it in a neutral color like silver or black.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer about six months ago and it was fine at first.  However, something plastic inside melted onto the coil and today it shot hot pieces of pink plastic onto my neck.  I contacted customer service and their response was someone will get back to me in 5 - 7 days via phone or mail.  Really!!!  I have welts on my neck from a manufacturing defect and I can expect a letter in the mail in 7 days.  Very frustrating and disappointing.</li>
            <li> The best hair dryer Ive owned. It has super power and I love that it came with attachments! A must have.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching which hair dryer I wanted to purchase and I decided the Conair Infiniti Cord Reel was exactly what I was looking for. I always go to Amazon first when making a purchase so naturally I checked to see if it was available. It was in stock, listed for a great price and also included free super saver shipping I placed my order right away. When I got home from work today the Amazon box was waiting for me - Woo-Hoo! my new hair dryer! - I opened the box and instantly knew that what I was seeing was not what I had ordered. It was made by Conair, was the same color, had the same attachments and had the same model number on the bottom of the box but it was called the Conair You Reel (see the picture I posted above). I called Conair to find out if they had changed the name and packaging of this hair dryer. I was told by the Conair Customer Service Department that You Reel is a subsidiary of Conair and although it is covered by the same warranty as the Infinti it is NOT the Infiniti. I called Amazon customer service and as always they were very friendly and offered to either send me another hair dryer or refund my money. Since I haven&#x27;t even plugged the hair dyrer in yet I wanted to try it before deciding to return/refund it. I have had several Conair hair dryers through the years and I&#x27;m sure this one will be just fine (I will update this review after I use it a few times). I&#x27;ve never had any problem when ordering from Amazon and will continue to do so but I just wanted to warn other people looking at this hair dryer that in this case \\&quot;what you see is not what you get\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have used this new dryer not more than 5 times in the past 3 months(since i purchased) and the RETRACTABLE CHORD IS already BROKEN. It keeps retracting even when i want to use the dryer. I have to stand very close to the plug point and I cannot dry or style my hair comfortably. Although the dryer is in working condition(as of now), the chord makes it impossible to work with. So please do not get carried away with this fancy pink color and retractable chord facility. I too read the reviews and was very excited to use this product but it was a bad experience for me. I would suggest a regular simple(long and dangling) chord dryer rather than a complex retractable. Also, i find this dryer a little bit more heavier than other dryers, making my hairstyling time very painful and also long.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get color show n but it&#x27;s a alsome hair dryer very does what is claimed alsome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for two and a half years, and it just died, but that&#x27;s not bad for a hair dryer. I went out and bought another the same day. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had for my short, fine hair. The hot setting isn&#x27;t overly hot, and the cool setting does a nice job of setting my style.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works just fine.  It is much heavier than my current hair dryer.  The on/off and temp control switches are difficult to use.  The retractable cord is pretty nice, although it is a very short cord.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> While looking for a hair dryer comparable to the one that just tryed to electrocute me, I found this one. The price was great and it had all the features of the much more expensive one I&#x27;d just thrown away. I&#x27;d give it a higher review but I found the on/off switch to be in an awkard position. It is a powerful hair dryer and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It still works like the first day i had it, but the retractable cord takes a little finagling to get it all the way back in.  Nonetheless, it&#x27;s much better than having all these cords all over the place!</li>
            <li> I have broken two of these hair dryers in less that 4 months. The first one, the power switch broken internally so I couldn&#x27;t turn it on or off. I liked it so much up until that point that I went and bought another of the exact same hair dryer. Unfortunately, less than 3 months after purchasing, I unplugged it to move it to a different outlet and it no longer works. I have pushed both the test and reset buttons numerous times, tried multiple outlets, let it sit over night and it just plain does not work anymore. I really enjoy how quickly it got my hair dry and loved the cord keeper feature but based on the experience it will be a long time before I purchase another Conair product.</li>
            <li> Good grief. Is there another hairdryer on the market? (As though it isn&#x27;t weird enough that there are entire aisles of hairdryers/straighteners/stylers). This is just what we need, right? Well, the Conair Infiniti is actually worth a second-look (even if it&#x27;s just for it&#x27;s peculiar color). Here is everything you need to know:    Pros:  1.) It&#x27;s cute! It&#x27;s pink! It&#x27;s fairly compact!! (So sick of those black, INSANELY bulky, dryers!!)  2.) It&#x27;s not unbearably heavy! (i.e. I could actually complete drying my hair without shaking/clinching my arm in pain!)  3.) Ergonomic! (i.e. it nicely fits in one&#x27;s hand).  4.) Affordable! (I&#x27;ve paid more than triple for a tourmaline dryer!!)   4.) Retractable cord!! (By far, the most appealing factor!! Cuts-down on the bathroom clutter ... and, as a neat-freak, I REALLY love this!)    Cons:  1.) It&#x27;s pink ... not just \\&quot;pink\\&quot; ... but SUPER pink!! (Maybe this won&#x27;t appeal to some folks!)    Hey, if you need a hairdryer and you dig pink (and being UBER-TIDY!), this is your guy!! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this for about 30 dollars at Ulta (on sale).  I was really excited to try it out; I&#x27;ve used cheap hairdryers my entire life, so the prospect of less hair frizz and better product longevity had me stoked.  BIG disappointment.  What attracted me most to this model is the gorgeous, shiny fuchsia color; however, this feature ended up ruining the whole dryer for me - its paint actually came off on my hands when I attempted to use it!  This left me completely disgusted and I actually had to send my boyfriend out to CVS to buy a cheap model I&#x27;d used without any problems before.  The Infiniti went right back to the store, where the salespeople were equally horrified to hear that the thing turned my hands pink.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for the first four months, then the cord stopped retracting, and then two months later the engine blew.  Too bad, I really liked the dryer when it was working.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer does wonders on naturally wavy, thick hair.  it does reduce frizz and makes it very soft and smooth.  the three heat settings are amazing too :)  and i can&#x27;t even say how much i love the retractable cord feature... no more trying to make my cord wrap around my dryer to keep it out of the way.  great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice having a retractable cord, but be careful that it doesn&#x27;t flip the plug up and pop you.  It usually stops before fully retracted, but having been popped by some vacuum cords, I suggest being careful.  The cord is also pretty short.  If you have a plug nearby, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this dryer with me to my hair appointment.  I wanted my hairdresser&#x27;s opinion.  She thought it was a pretty color and liked the attachments.  She commented that the buttons were quiet, although the dryer itself wasn&#x27;t.  We compared the noise level to her $150 dryer and this one on low sounded like her&#x27;s on high.  It was difficult to talk over it when it was on high.  It did have a powerful fan and dried my hair quickly (it&#x27;s short).  I asked her what she thought of the weight and she thought it was comparable to her more expensive dryer.  In her opinion, it is a good home dryer, but probably wouldn&#x27;t hold up to the use that a professional dryer gets.  Since most of us only want to use a dryer once or twice a day, this should hold up well.</li>
            <li> The plug is polarized (one prong wider than the other, so you can only plug it in one way) and has a rigid sleeve on the cord beneath it. So if your outlet is above a shelf, for example, as many bathroom outlets are, you need to make sure you have about 5-6 inches clearance to allow room for the reinforced and non-flexible bit of cord at the plug.&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer works great. Just like a hair dryer is supposed to. But I have to use it in a room that isn&#x27;t the bathroom, because my bathroom outlet doesn&#x27;t have enough space to accommodate the design of the cord. And this annoys me, daily.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Glad I bought it.  The cord keeper is certainly a nice feature and the bright color makes it easy to find under my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this hairdryer. I read the reviews here before buying it -- but don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s heavy like some have stated.  I love that it has a warm setting (not just hot and cold)</li>
            <li> As a woman with long hair, I need a good hair dryer that is easy to move around my head. This one fills the bill! With a retractable cord it makes for eash storage. It also dries hair quickly and is easy to use with your styling brushes.</li>
            <li> Compared with T3 Tourmaline Hair Dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Lower Price - 1/3 the current cost (T3 (originally cost $300, now $95).&lt;br /&gt;Faster Drying Speed - 2/3 the drying time.&lt;br /&gt;Better Controls - more options, less likely to unintentially change.&lt;br /&gt;Retractable Cord - retracts easily (but mine is still new).&lt;br /&gt;Easier Cleaning - easier to clean filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Heavier Weight - 3x heavier than T3.&lt;br /&gt;Short Cord - 6&#x27; shorter than T3.&lt;br /&gt;Static Electricity - more than with T3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity - unknown.  I&#x27;ve been using the T3 with no problems for 3 years but just got the Infinity.&lt;br /&gt;Claims - neither one gives my hair more sheen or softness than any other hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner - T3.  The weight and cord length are deal breakers.  The Infiniti will be my backup dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the Infininti hairdryer from Conair.  The product offers great features which include a self-retracting cord reel (just push a button and it automatically winds itself), a diffuser, a concentrator, 3 heat settings, and two speed settings.  I also love the pink color - it makes it easier to spot in my closet.  One of the best features are the heat settings - I started drying my 4 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair using the warm setting - which is just the right temp. for a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, it is on the heavy side.  I don&#x27;t mind this at all - but if you suffer from arthritis or carpel-tunnel - this might not be the hairdryer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new hairdryer - you should give this model a try.</li>
            <li> Like this hair blower, however I was not too happy went I saw it at Walgreens for $25 on sale as compared with your price of $38</li>
            <li> Honestly I was surprised this dryer got so many great reviews.  I found it was really heavy, and I also had a really hard time with the button placement...esp because the off button is the lower set.  My hand is usually up near the top buttons which are the heat settings and ones I don&#x27;t change very much, so I find I have to \\&quot;shimmy\\&quot; my hand down the heavy dryer to get to the off button.     I dunno...wasn&#x27;t super thrilled.      The rest of the reviews were right about the cord being slightly short, but that&#x27;s expected to keep a tidy cord keeper.</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying, I use my blow dryer lightly compared to others, so I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of this dryer. I am convinced there is no perfect hair dryer out there, but this particular one does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how quiet this is compared to some other models I&#x27;ve owned. Even on high, the noise is dramatically muted (if you shower during your childs naptime as I do, then this is HUGE!). While I initially thought the retractable cord would be a plus, it makes storing the entire unit very cumbersome. I keep my dryer in a drawer in my bathroom. My old dryer had to have the cord wrapped around it a million times, but overall, it was pretty compact. Not so with this model. The end of the plug cord is thicker, and difficult to bend, and the nose of the dryer is a bit longer then I&#x27;m used to. Not the end of the world though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the diffuser one day, but found it to be a huge pain to work with, so I just set it aside...I&#x27;ve gone this long without ever using one, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be fine without it. I always keep the concentrator on though (which only adds to the size of the dryer come storage time). It&#x27;s great for quick, high temp drying, or for bangs. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this. It&#x27;s a good dryer that gets the job done, even though storing it can be kinda awkward..</li>
            <li> I love everything about this dryer EXCEPT the \\&quot;low\\&quot; speed while on \\&quot;hot\\&quot; is NOT hot enough. It feels like it&#x27;s blowing cool air.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing. I myself would probably not want the retractable cord but she likes it. I only say this because moving parts have a tendency to break over time and it adds some weight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this directly from Amazon.com for my wife. It shipped promptly and was well-packaged. The product is attractive and well-designed, and it comes with a manual, stylish soft case and several air-flow accessories. The retractable AC cord is built- in, works well and is very convenient for storage. My wife loves everything about the product and she uses it daily. She thinks that the product is well-designed and that the variable heat settings are perfect, not too hot or cool, and she also uses the free accessories to adjust the air-flow for a variety of hair style applications. She uses it to dry the hair of my 7-year old son, and he enjoys it, too. I have used it a few times, although my hair is short, and I think the product is a great value with its safety features and its many high technology features. Excellent quality, great features, good price! We highly recommend this product and suggest that you purchase it directly from Amazon, as we did.</li>
            <li> I usualy get these types of hair dryers, con air or revlon, not too expensive and I prefer the ones with two switches like this one has- off, low, hi and a cool, warm hot switch. I used a conair 1875 cord keeper on vacation so I added this to my wish list for Xmas. I have wavy curly somewhat course and frizzy hair which I blow dry straight. This makes my hair so soft and shiny that I have to use a volumizing gel to get any lift. I am using the included diverter with it, maybe that is making the difference. With previous hair dryers I would have needed to flat iron to get it this smooth. It did take a while to get used to the weight, it is heavy and the handle is at a strange angle that makes it harder to hold than previous hair dryers I&#x27;ve had. Also I really was surprised at how much power this draws, it blows the breaker if I have lights on in other rooms. My husband looked and said it draws as much power as our microwave! Generally I like the results, just wish it was more comfortable to hold and didn&#x27;t blow the breaker. It seems to run less hot than my previous revlon 1600. The cord keeper function is nice.</li>
            <li> I just bought this hairdryer for myself. I had needed one for a long time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. This was still a little more than I wished to spend, but I found out it was worth it! I read through the product reviews and this seemed the best one, was completely right!   The color is awesome! I love the retractable cord, makes for easy storage. The only thing I do not like is that it is quite loud, but other than that, it&#x27;s amazing! It dries my hair (straight from shower, very wet) in less than 5 minutes, I used to have let it air dry for a while if I wanted a short blow dry time. Or it would take 10-15 minutes. I love how quick this one works and very effective without frizzing my hair! Definitely worth the little extra money!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s an obnoxious color but the bottom line is, it works amazingly well. It&#x27;s powerful but not super loud (for a hair dryer, at least), I can get my long hair dry and straight in about 8-10 minutes on warm temperature + medium strength (I&#x27;d rather take a couple extra minutes than do extra damage to my hair), and the settings are user-friendly. Before I bought it, I didn&#x27;t care so much about the retractable cord but now that I&#x27;ve had it for a while, I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back! It&#x27;s an incredibly convenient feature, especially living in a tiny NYC apartment. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The dry time is very fast, and the retractable cord is a huge plus.  Its a little on the heavier side, but that is to be expected considering the technology within it.  I&#x27;ve already been recommending this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was fantastic while it lasted. I love all the different speed and heat settings and how well dried my hair helping me to avoid the freeze hair I get with humid weather. I was disappointed though that it only lasted 20 months. It started to fail about the18- month mark and stopped altogether at 20 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this hair dryer I had another Conair hair dryer that lasted over 7 years! Although it&#x27;s an inexpensive item I expected it to last a bot longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair dryers for 24 years now, but I&#x27;ve no technical know-how when it comes to these things.  So, here&#x27;s my girl next door review for what it&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;ve never had a favorite hair dryer until now.  The lower on/off/blower level button is awkward because it&#x27;s so low and using it one handed made it hard for me to smoothly maneuver it, but after handling the dryer for a few weeks now I&#x27;m a pro.  I&#x27;m glad I stuck it out for several reasons.  Here are my top 6 reasons you should buy this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It dries hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2. Styling is a breeze with it&#x27;s setting options and cool shot.&lt;br /&gt;3. It handles well while being a good weight.&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s not loud (compared to my last hair dryer).&lt;br /&gt;5. The retractable cord ROCKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;6. It&#x27;s hot pink, black, and silver.  It looks gooood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to note a bit more about the retractable cord.  I owned an iron (for clothing) that had one and the cord, which was incredibly long, eventually twisted and after time it didn&#x27;t wind completely anymore.  This hair dryer&#x27;s cord is shorter (yet long enough for it&#x27;s purpose) and I find unplugging the cord, letting it settle, then pushing the retract button is the best way to be sure the cord coils up properly inside.  I also recommend not leaving the dryer out; retract the cord when not in use.  I&#x27;m hoping this will help extend the longevity of this feature that I love.</li>
            <li> love this! love that the cord retracts so I don&#x27;t have a mess in my drawer</li>
            <li> My old dryer (my very old dryer!) needed to be replaced and I decided for the price, this was worth a go.  Plus, this dryer was rated Top 10 on several sites I looked into.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It works. It&#x27;s quiet. The cord retracts. It&#x27;s not heavy (??!!). Does it do the dishes?  No, it doesn&#x27;t and maybe I should complain about that.  But seriously, it&#x27;s....a....hair dryer.  The one thing I can see is that if you were used to a hair dryer that \\&quot;just\\&quot; blew hot air, you might think this dryer makes your hair flatter.  It doesn&#x27;t cook your cuticle so your hair does lay flatter and ultimately, feels softer.  But less damage is worth it--you can always adjust your products or hair style.  Well worth the $20 I paid.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer! I bought it 3 years ago and its still going strong! Its quite powerful, with two different speed settings and the cord-keeper function is so helpful. I really recommend this one.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223XR, 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler, Cord Reel Dryer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this hairdryer from Amazon in July 2011 for $27.19 including the tax. It is now April 2012 and the cord stopped retracting. I just called Conair Customer Service and in order for them to repair it (\\&quot;at no charge\\&quot;), I must send it to them, at my own expense and must send them $7 for return shipping and they will repair it and return it to me.  I was going to do it, not having a clue what I would do without a hairdryer in the interim, when I checked Amazon again, and saw that I could buy a brand new one for $19.25 with no tax and, of course, free shipping. Obviously, that was the option I chose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I liked everything about this dryer, I find it very annoying that after only 9 months, I need to replace it. Anything similar in quality and features cost more money so now I will see how long this new one lasts.  This is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I found this dryer to be pretty heavy and way too hot.  It scorched my hair on high heat.  It also didn&#x27;t last long, less than a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for over a year and I still love it.  The cord reel is my favorite feature.  It also has high, medium, and low heat seatings and 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> For the average person, this dryer is amazing. I bought this after another dryer I bought online turned out to be pathetically lacking in power. This dries my hair very quickly, and while I&#x27;m not sure how much I believe in the ion and ceramic technology, my hair does seem to have a sheen after drying.  I have medium length wavy hair, which tends to curl messily during humid days. Using the included concentrator and a brush, I use this to straighten my hair. It works perfectly. Overall, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer much better than the one it is replacing.  It as the same wattage but it cuts the dry time for my hair by about a half because it&#x27;s just a stronger air flow.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Still going strong.</li>
            <li> I looked for a dryer that would not add more damage to my thin, color hair.....and I think this is the one for sure! It dries my hair in about 1/5 the time any other drier does...and it is quiet. A little heavier than I imagined....but you hold it for such a short time...it doesn&#x27;t matter. Love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> I love the color! The grip is great, very easy to navigate my glorious mop of nappy hair! The cord retracts. There is a wide variety of settings for every stge of your hair (wet, damp). Great for touch-ups, too. I am very pleased with the purchase and the attachments that come with it. Great investment!</li>
            <li> Not as hot as the dryer it replaced, but I adapted.  The retractable cord is a wonderful feature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by the professional quality of this hair dryer.  Leaves my hair silky smooth with virtually no frizz or extreme dryness.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If I had to describe my hair, I&#x27;d simply describe it as chronically curly. My old dryer used to make my hair more knotted and yuck but this dryer actually makes my hair super soft! Drying time is 50% shorter and my hair generally seems more healthy. It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle much. Loving this dryer! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is definitely larger in size than I had imagined. With this, it is also quite heavy. Not recommended for frequent travel. That said, it works well and seems quieter than other hairdryers. And the color is pretty - very pink!</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair and I usually just let my hair air dry because a blow dryer makes it look \\&quot;puffy\\&quot; and takes so long that my arms get tired.  This dryer really does dry your hair fast and it made my hair look very smooth.  My husband (who notices nothing, usually) even asked me what I had done to make my hair look so great.  The retractible cord is nice because it lets you store the dryer in less space without fighting with the cord.</li>
            <li> Have been using this hair dryer/styler for several weeks now.  It works as well as any other consumer-type hair dryer/styler that I&#x27;ve used for the last 20 years and see nothing different in this one.  I have not experienced any advantage to the \\&quot;tourmaline ceramic\\&quot; dryer/styler. The switch that turns the dryer/styler on and selects the high or low setting is difficult to use -- the button is somewhat recessed into the handle and does not have much of a protrusion to aid in moving it to a different position. All things considered, and comparing this to various other dryer/stylers that I&#x27;ve used over the years, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I just used my dryer last night and I&#x27;m in love. My 3 year old Conair dryer broke last week so I did my research and saw the great review on this product and they were right, it&#x27;s great!    The dryer is a bit heavier than the old one, but after a few minutes you realize the heaviness relates to the quality. It almost gives it a little bit of leverage when you use it.     The airflow is salon quality. My hair dried faster, looked shinier and felt extremely soft. It doesn&#x27;t feel over dried or brittle as it usually did with my old dryer. I dried my hair no more than once a week for that reason, but I can&#x27;t wait to use it every time, if I keep getting these results.    The color is pretty cool and the retractable cord is a BIG plus, no more tangles and messy cords taking up my bathroom space (now if only they could do that with my curling iron ;)    Over all I highly recommend this dryer, you can;t beat the quality and the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the Infiniti by Conair 223XR dryer and its features. Retractable cord, 1875 watts, different settings for cold/warm/hot temperature and also low/high air speed setting. I like the fact that it already comes with both a concentrator and diffuser. It doesn&#x27;t take long to dry my long hair (up to 70% faster than previous ones) and no frizz effect! I think the cord is long enough and there is a red mark to indicate when to stop pulling. The dryer has a nice design and color. I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for few months and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Let me just say this. I love pink. My whole room used to be painted pink. I wear pink a lot. I love that this hairdryer is pink.    That being said, I think the color is the most redeeming quality for this thing. It&#x27;s a hairdryer, people- not a car. Personally, I don&#x27;t care about torque or rpm or whatever fancy gadgets it throws in.     It&#x27;s still just a pink hairdryer. A really, really big pink hairdryer.    It&#x27;s heavy, it&#x27;s hefty (so you better have a strong grip) and it does NOT fold over. The cord retracts, but I repeat, it does NOT fold over.     It does have variable temps, which is nice I guess. It gets the job done- but so does my small hairdryer. And I don&#x27;t think that one doubles as a weapon. and my arm doesn&#x27;t hurt after using it.    There&#x27;s some sort of black, pointy attachment for this thing. I don&#x27;t know what it does. If you do, good for you! But ya know what? It&#x27;s still a really big, really expensive, pink hairdryer.    and I love pink. and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Retractable cord functions well and is convenient&lt;br /&gt;-Sliding controls don&#x27;t accidentally turn off in use like toggles&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t blow as strong as expected for 1875 watts&lt;br /&gt;-Color is hideous&lt;br /&gt;-Cord is too short&lt;br /&gt;-Vibrates in hand during use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning this after one use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this hairdryer a lot.  The thing that first drew me to this hairdryer?  The color.  It&#x27;s a bright, shiny, fushia color.  The make is very sleek and stylish.  Infiniti, by Conair, is light and easy to handle, even when you&#x27;re using a brush with your other hand!  The best part of this hairdryer is, by far, the retractable cord, which makes it very easy to store.  The filter is removable, making the life of your hairdryer longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hairdryer comes with a concentrator to help straighten your wavy or curly hair and a diffuser to give it body and life.  It also is equipped with Tourmaline Ceramic technology which, according to the box, \\&quot;generates ions that work hair molecules to help dry them inside and out... Ions smooth the cuticle layer... creating a silky, shiny look\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Infiniti to be a very usable hairdryer.  With heat options &#x27;hot&#x27;, &#x27;warm&#x27;, and &#x27;cool&#x27;, and power levels &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27;, there are plenty of way to dry and style your hair.  &#x27;Hot&#x27; never got too hot and &#x27;warm&#x27; was perfect for my use.  Some hairdryers take a long time to cool down afterwards, but I am happy to report that the Infiniti cooled off quite quickly.  The retractable cord is also very handy.  One quick word of warning about the cord, it retracts VERY fast.  Be careful of fingers or retract it little by little and not all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience, my hair did look straighter and more silky than usual, which might be due to the &#x27;Tourmaline Ceramic technology&#x27;.  As mentioned before, I really do like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  I have had 3.  Every time one stops working, I buy another one.  It makes my hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> cord does not retract majority of the time</li>
            <li> Worked great.  Love the retractable cord.  Then one day, just 10 months after buying it, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I had to throw it in the trash.  My last hair dryer lasted years and years.  This sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hair dryer that I&#x27;ve ever had, I love it! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing! I was recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Purchased in December 2011. Worked great up until November 2013. It behaves as if there is a short. I suspect it involves the retractable cord. I&#x27;ll shy away from another retractable cord product.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift my niece loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the first ionic technology hair dryer that I&#x27;ve used, and I have to say, I am very pleased.  It really does work to minimize the frizzies in humid weather.  I love that it has a cool setting and 2 speed settings.  The cord is shorter than my older dryer by about 8 inches, but for me, it doesn&#x27;t present a problem.  It is also heavier, but again, not a problem.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not harsh on my hair....love all the heat/speed levels! Excellent buy! No more digging in my travel bags with its great new color!!</li>
            <li> I loved this blow dryer.. :( but mine just died. I had it for almost 4 years, so it was probably worth the price, but.. i think i&#x27;d rather get a new one that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all the reviews, and it did not disappoint.  I love it because it dries nicely, it&#x27;s not too noisy to operate plus it has a retractable cord.  I would say it&#x27;s well worth the price I bought it from Amazon compared to other blow dryers!!</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.  Just a very basic hair dryer.  I like the color and the cord, but not the drying power.</li>
            <li> Its a little heavy, but works great for such a low price. The attachments were what won me over :)</li>
            <li> Purchased this item by virtue of reading a recommendation on it from somewhere on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!  It arrived in a timely fashion, and more or less in perfect condition.  (There was a big scratch that took the pink off.  Eh, it&#x27;s a hairdryer and with use, it&#x27;s not going to improve its looks.)  For the price, this thing blew me away!  3 temperatures, 2 speeds, retractable cord, a diffuser head, and a concentrator head for this price? AND I ended up with softer, smoother hair with the initial use!  WINNER!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer just blows, and I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way. My last Conair hair dryer (1875 watt travel red, don&#x27;t make anymore) was the best and after so many years, busted, so I bought this one. What a waste! I bought another one, and I&#x27;m moving away from Conair. Time so splurge for real quality!</li>
            <li> I just got this hair dryer a few days ago to replace one that randomly stopped working. I love this product so far- it is very sturdy without being too heavy. The cord reel is a great feature and makes storage very easy.     The hair dryer itself works great. Compared to my last one, this dries so fast! The temperature settings are also very nice with the hot not being *too* hot, and the cool is actually cool. I hope this dryer performs as well in the future as it has so far!</li>
            <li> I had read the review in In style and my prior Conair hair dryer had died.  It works great and I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> I know this was voted \\&quot;Best Hairdryer!!!\\&quot; by like 5 beauty magazines, and it does seem to dry hair pretty efficiently, but this review applies to guys with short hair that need to use a hair dryer to SHAPE their hair into styles (such as mohawks or fauxhawks). This is USEFUL for you stylish gents who are not just looking for a device to merely dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the \\&quot;high setting\\&quot; air current is not strong enough to really get your hair into staying straight upwards (if you&#x27;re going for a mohawk or even a pompadour) and keep it there (the way some of the stronger hairdryers can). Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way but you want it to be styled in an opposite direction. Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair &amp; scalp, so USE CAREFULLY AND WISELY)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured there are enough men out there looking for just this function, so I figured I&#x27;d help you all out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for well over a year so far and it has worked well.  It is sturdy and a little heavier than some, but not bad.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this hair dryer in a store years ago. (FYI...Amazon has the best price.) It is just now giving me trouble. It hasn&#x27;t completely died, but sometimes you have to smack it to get it to come on. Out of all the hair dryers over the years, I have never had one last this long, and I have never bought the exact same one two times in a row, until now that is. The cord is a generous length considering it is a cord keeper. I personally wouldn&#x27;t have a hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t store its own cord. It doesn&#x27;t seem heavy to me. I have never really considered how heavy a hair dryer is when purchasing, so you may want to consult another review for that point. If you have curly hair, the diffuser works well.</li>
            <li> The attachments don&#x27;t stay on too well and the cord is really short.</li>
            <li> purchased this to replace old conair dryer that the cord reel had ceased to work....this is much quieter, but not sure it&#x27;s more powerful......I&#x27;m happy with it and would recommend...</li>
            <li> I have no problems with the hair dryer itself, however, one can&#x27;t register the warranty because the company&#x27;s drop down menu does not list the year 2011. I sent Conair two emails regarding the &#x27;Year&#x27; problem and neither was answered. When I finally was able to contact someone on the phone I was told that yes, the year was a problem, but the company didn&#x27;t have any answer for fixing it, including not being able to take my information over the phone. Also told me that they are having problems with the company which handles their emails and none get answered. Perhaps I expected too much from Conair. Next time I will seek out another brand. Also feel that if one can not register a product for the warranty, then Amazon should think twice before dealing with that company.</li>
            <li> I had a hairdryer for over 10 years when I decided it was time to let it go and buy a new one.  I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  It worked fine and I had no complaints. I liked the sassy color and the retractable cord feature.  I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in frizz when using the dryer. I guess it dried my hair quickly, but I don&#x27;t remember noticing that it dried it any faster than my pervious hair dryer.    Today I went to dry my hair and the dryer wouldn&#x27;t work.  I pushed the reset button on the plug and it wouldn&#x27;t reset. I pushed the reset button on my outlet and it was working.  I tested my outlet with other things and the outlet was working.  The tag on the plug said I should refer to the user manual.   I found it on Conair&#x27;s website but it was not helpful (they actually had the wrong user manual uploaded to the hairdryer). So I called the number on the site, and a polite gentleman answered in less than one ring. I explained the problem, he asked me a few questions, and then looked up the warranty.  The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer. HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair&#x27;s headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     I&#x27;m really disappointed that after only 6 short months of very occasional use (i was only drying my hair maybe 4 times a MONTH) the dryer has stopped working.  I&#x27;m also disappointed that I have to go through a rigamarole to have the dryer replaced.  With today&#x27;s technology, they could easily email me a voucher for a new dryer. They could also send me a prepaid shipping label and not charge me shipping and handling for a new dryer.      Maybe I just got a clunker, lots of folks like the dryer.  Just hope nothing goes wrong with it, or you&#x27;ll be spending ten bucks to replace a 25 dollar dryer!</li>
            <li> This item was a lot heavier than I&#x27;d expected, but I really like the retractable cord quite a bit.  I can pull the dryer closer when I need to and when finished, I can just press a button and it&#x27;ll be stored nicely.  The cool air option is great for my fine, thin hair.      Worth the money.  Quality was a lot better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this in store and found it working great. It&#x27;s much quieter than my old hair dryer and I&#x27;ve only used the defuser attachment so far but it worked perfectly! It&#x27;s a tad heavier than I expected it when comparing it to my old revlon hair dryer but I love the color and I find that it&#x27;s more accurate in the air flow. Where as with my revlon it didn&#x27;t necessarily focus on one part of my hair. I think it&#x27;s reasonably priced and the retractable cord is great. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works like a decent dryer, but I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in frizz-control. I have very thick, frizzy 2A hair, and this dryer could get my hair mostly dry in under ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retractable cord is nice, as is the defuser.</li>
            <li> I am so glad Amazon had this product! It is a fabulous hair dryer. I have one upstairs and one in my downstairs bathroom.</li>
            <li> The first Conair I ever owned lasted me almost 22 years, so I definitely wanted another Conair and was willing to give the Infinity 223XR a try. I loved the &#x27;Cord-Keeper&#x27; idea and the power provided by this model, but after going through two of them in a three year period, I cannot recommend them. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t write a review, but this is the second Conair Infinity 223XR model I&#x27;ve owned that has exhibited identical problems: the cord stops retracting properly after a few uses and then the dryer one day simply ceases to function. The first one I purchased lasted almost 2 years before it stopped working. Because I take good care of my appliances and they tend to last a long time, I thought I had simply gotten a lemon. It happens to the best products every now and then. Unfortunately, the second one did not perform any better and stopped working after only 7 months. The problem doesn&#x27;t appear to be motor or fan related. Rather, my husband suspects an electrical issue with either the cord or the plug. Regardless, I am done with this model!</li>
            <li> Updated 11/9/12: About 2 months ago the original plug went bad. It had a built in GFCI feature and the trip switch eventually became stuck so that it would not turn on. I replaced the plug with a new, heavy duty one I bought at Home Depot, figuring the bathroom outlet&#x27;s GFCI feature would provide the same protection. Then last night, while drying my daughter&#x27;s hair, it started to smell of something burning and a few hot ceramic embers came shooting out. One stung my daughter on the back of the neck and while I waved my hand in front I got one embedded in my hand. Very small but very hot stinging. I threw it away for safety reason. So, it worked fine for 3 years but died an painful death. Be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I was using a 25 year old, 1200 watt hair dryer. It may lost some of its punch over the years but it did dry hair. This is an upgrade, but it isn&#x27;t a radical difference. The upside is the retractable cord. This makes getting it out and putting it away much easier and faster. The downside is that the cord is fairly short (the big safety device at the plug end is another story). I&#x27;ll learn to live with it, but when I&#x27;m trying to dry the hair of my 7 and 8 year olds, who move around a lot, a longer cord is welcome. Now I have to get them to move their head around instead of me moving the dryer around. One thing I have noticed is that my kids now complain the air is too hot, something they didn&#x27;t do with the old dryer (I have to switch to medium heat, and then it takes longer). It has a hot, medium and cool setting (and a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; push button for interrupting a hot flow) and slow and fast speeds. The buttons for speed and temperature are similar and you need to remember which is which. The cord retraction button, which is not obvious, is up on the motor housing; somehow I keep forgetting it&#x27;s there. Overall, a good dryer, with some benefits and drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, this dryer certainly comes with all of the \\&quot;essential requirements\\&quot; that I look for in a hair dryer.  I won&#x27;t buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  The filter is easy to remove and clean It also isn&#x27;t too heavy.  The color is cute, although I don&#x27;t know if most men would like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On using it, it has good power, and it&#x27;s not too noisy.  It also doesn&#x27;t get hot anywhere but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that&#x27;s not bad.  If you are a stylist who likes to hold the barrel of the dryer, this is totally doable.  And it&#x27;s cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  The cord is a good length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn&#x27;t come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  It&#x27;s a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I have two issues with this product.  The first is minor... there is no loop or hook to hang the thing up!  I keep my dryer on a hook inside the door or my bathroom vanity cabinet, and it&#x27;s an annoyance that I can&#x27;t hang this there.  And because the cord is retractable, you can&#x27;t really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is more significant.  I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  It gives my hand a bit of a workout while holding it.  I can&#x27;t say whether this is a problem will this model, or just for some reason the one that I was sent.  But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is nice, but without understanding specifically the benefits of \\&quot;ionic, tourmaline\\&quot; etc., I don&#x27;t see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  Personally, I&#x27;d rather have one with a hanging loop.e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  Personally, I&#x27;d rather have one with a hanging loop.</li>
            <li> wow. she is awesome woman say that it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry there hair. I need to order one more for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year. It worked extremely well while it lasted. It died today. I guess I have to purchase another dryer again. Not sure if I will buy this one again or not. I think a hair dryer should last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I have a very finicky daughter.  I was looking for a light blowdryer with enough heat and blowing power to dry her thick hair. I found it! I checked reviews and this dryer meets all my expectations.  The retractable cord is great.</li>
            <li> i have realy course hair ( im black) this did not dry my hair straight. so i went to the hair salon instead</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is very powerful, the cord is longer than my other cord keeper dryer, and I love all the settings.  The only drawback is that it is a bit heavy, but this is why it is so powerful.  So I will take a lil extra weight for the power gained. (it&#x27;s not that heavy anyway, it&#x27;s just not feather light either)</li>
            <li> i bought this dryer after a lot - i mean a LOT - of researching online, on amazon, on the websites of all the different brands available, and finally decided this blow dryer is the best for my needs. i&#x27;m a college student who needs to get in &amp; out asap! this blow dryer definitely does MORE than what i would expect, and with the diffuser attachment i get fabulous sexy waves or with the concentrator attachment i get sleek straight hair.  what i love the most about this blow dryer is the power. at low setting, you actually get a fairly decent amount of power. at high setting, this blow dryer is way more powerful than i would expect!  to all the people complaining about heat - you should probably keep in mind how damaging hot air can be, and realize that the hot setting on this dryer, though not salon-hot, is probably the best in terms of hair health.  i don&#x27;t understand why a lot of the reviews bash on this dryer for being too heavy - i think it&#x27;s the size of a regular dryer! it&#x27;s definitely heavy if you are comparing it to a TRAVEL dryer; in which case i don&#x27;t even know why you&#x27;re purchasing a regular sized dryer and assuming it will be a good travel sized dryer.  also, when people say the cord is too short - since i researched and could not find the cord length written here anywhere, let me just tell you (now that i actually own the dryer) the cord is 5 feet long - PLENTY of length for me and anyone else, i would think. you know, unless you decide to blow dry your hair while doing chores around the house and expect the blow dryer to follow. that might be a problem.  PS - LOVE the color!</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Dryer is great. Light, quiet an works really well. Has all the attachments I need for keeping my hair curly.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was smaller than I expected and by it&#x27;s relatively light weight.But I had trouble pulling the plug out, as it was very stiff. When I finally got it out all the way, the cord wouldn&#x27;t retract when I pushed the button. Also there is a scratch in the paint about 1/4 of an inch wide. Other than that it seems to work just fine.I like the cool setting.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 2 years and recently it stopped working when the cord moved. To get by, I move the cord until it starts working again. I had a feeling a retractable cord was a bad idea. This could start a fire! So if you are looking for a short term hair dryer that is a fire hazard, this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did it do leading up to this point? Not impressed. My previous Conair Ion dryer was awesome. My thick long hair dried in half the time with my old dryer. My expectations were high for this one and it was just average...less than average because it died so soon. I am willing to spend the extra money for a quality dryer. You should too!</li>
            <li> Nice blower for personal use....it heats well. I have fine and long hair and it took me 25 min to dry all my hair which is a pretty good time consider that a professional dries my hair in 45 min</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer! But I got mine at target for 25 dollars! It&#x27;s great I love every thing about it it&#x27;s very lightweight! I like how it only takes me 7 minutes to dry my hair when its in on high and hot!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, BUT what I needed was a really long cord.  This hair dryer has the standard length cord - disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought one of these several years ago.  It had heavy use and just started to get worn, so I decided to get a new one.  I ended up buying yet another of the same and I am glad I did.  This is a solid dryer.  Conair has actually improved it over the years...I can tell and that is great to know.  If you have curly hair, like me, it comes with a nice diffuser that is actually usable.  Love the retractable cord...wish it had a folding handle too, but no biggie.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is faster compared to my old one, the cord doesn&#x27;t use extra space as it rolls inside, which I find very convenient.</li>
            <li> I selected this dryer after reading other reviewers comments, as I was looking for one that did not make me feel like I was opting for dry hair over my hearing. I was replacing one that had many of the same features as this one, except it felt like it was piercing my eardrums to use it. This one is much better, as was promised. In fact, it really is the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. The only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because of the button that retracts the cord. It was placed on the side of the dryer where it sticks out, so that when you put the dryer down in between blows, it pushes the button and startles me as it trys to retract. It should have been made so that the button recedes a bit so it isn&#x27;t accidently pushed. But, all in all, it is great. I have learned to be more cautious as I lay it down and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new hair dryer after my previous one gave out after a few years.  I did considerable research, and was drawn to this one by the great reviews and the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is suitable, but I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It increased my drying time (I previously had an inexpensive Revlon)&lt;br /&gt;- Even on the highest setting, the temperature does not get that hot&lt;br /&gt;- It is a bit on the heavy side&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The retractable cord is great for storage</li>
            <li> i love this hair dryer it works great the cord makes it alot more convinient a little heavy but that is due to the retractable cord</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and only dry my hair with a diffuser.  This hair dryer come with a diffuser and a concentrator, but I purchased it specifically for the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser is slightly smaller than most other diffusers that I have had in the past; however, it works just as well as any that I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because the retractable cord is much shorter than the cord of all hair dryers that I have had in the past (53 inches).  The length isn&#x27;t a problem, it&#x27;s just shorter than I am used to.  But I do like the hair dryer a lot.  It&#x27;s time efficient, not unbearably loud, and sturdy.  The retractable cord is very convenient.</li>
            <li> this hairdryer isn&#x27;t as powerful as my last one so it&#x27;s slow(er) to dry my hair.  Supposedly they both have 1875 watts, but this one is weaker.  The cord does retract (snaps FAST -- watch out!) but it&#x27;s shorter than most and still sticks out about 6&amp;#34; (the big socket plug plus a couple inches of thicker cord stem)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice, is shiny, etc. but not fabulous.</li>
            <li> I am beyond thrilled with this product. Definitly one of the most affordable I have ever purchased, yet has all of the style and effectiveness of a high end salon model. The design is stylish, it&#x27;s very quiet compared to my old dryer, which thrills my roomie, since I typically shower and style at 2 a.m. lol I love the rectractable cord, as well as the concentrated attatchment. And the best part? It dries my fine, unruly hair quickly and frizz free, leaving it so soft. I read the reviews carefully before purchasing this item, and I am now among the top percentage of 150% satisfied. Great job Conair!!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very quiet, drys quickly, prevents frizz and includes two attachments all for an extremely low price. It&#x27;s the best hair dryer I have ever used. Added bonus, the cord reeler function makes storage a breeze. A must have!</li>
            <li> it makes your hair less frizzy as you blow dry it; well worth the money...it also has a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> I wanted a ceramic dryer because my old dryer was dryng out my hair and making it appear dry and course.  I purchased this ceramic, ionic dryer to protect my hair and also achieve&lt;br /&gt;a softer look. Itgave the results that I was looking for. It certainly works! Also a good feature it the automatic cord wind. I am very pleased. The dryer was reduced in price and&lt;br /&gt;this made the purchase sweeter as it is a great product at a bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this dryer and it deserves the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this hair dryer - it worked great but it only lasted a year and a half.  All of a sudden it just stopped working...what a huge disappointment.  I would think a hair dyer would last a while.  I also made a point to remove the lint but still...stopped working. Also, after a while the retractable cord would get stuck.  I&#x27;d have to play around with it in order to have it retract all the way.  Seriously disappointed!</li>
            <li> i have always hated blowdrying my hair because it always made it frizzy and poofy in the wrong ways. Because I knew was going to purchase a new blowdryer for college I did a bit of research. I have long hair that takes FOREVER to dry (usually 30min) and I go to college in Wisconsin so I knew I couldn&#x27;t walk around with damp hair like I do in California. I was seriously considering getting a professional but the research said as long as it has tourmaline (and ions or ceramic or whatever) it should work well. So i liked that it was cheap and had the retractable cord so I tried it. I LOVE this blowdryer. It dries my hair in half the time and it isn&#x27;t frizzy at all! The attachments are perfect and the retractable cord is the greatest thing ever in college. I&#x27;ve had this now for about 6th months and i still love it. Every time I go home I regret not taking it with me because it so nice. I think next time I go home I&#x27;m going to buy one so I can have it there!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother to replace her old blow dryer. Should last her years to come.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly as described and the price was great.  I would definitely recommend it and purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I have one of these already and love it. Will make a great gift. It is powerful &amp; the reel cord makes this blow dryer even better!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son.  He loves it.  He says it is better than mine so I tried it.  It is.  It&#x27;s smaller, heavier but it does a really nice job.  It is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. The cord system is super convenient.Easy to use for a reasonable price. Get it! you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> This dryer was a great one during the 8 months that it worked. Loved the retractable cord and how fast it could dry my overly-thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I burn up a dryer, I have some notice (burnt motor smell, maybe some popping noises), but not this one. It worked fine yesterday, and today would not work. Checked the outlets, did the test/reset on the dryer and that worked, but the dryer itself is dead. Reviews at other sites show this to be a non-uncommon problem.</li>
            <li> Graduation gift for my niece.  She loved it.  Especially the fact that the cord disappears into it.....</li>
            <li> Hey, it&#x27;s a Conair.  What more needs to be said.  Conair makes great products!  Love the color; love the power; love the retractable cord.  Although more powerful, lighter in weight and smaller in size.  And, the price is terrific -- beat Costco by $3!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for only a few weeks, so I cannot speak to its longevity.  This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don&#x27;t care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.  I usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn&#x27;t blow my hair so much.  The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn&#x27;t worry too much because it didn&#x27;t take very long to dry my hair.  If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  As for how well my hair looks after using it, I notice no difference from the other dryers.  My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  I have not tried this in a humid environment.  I highly recommend this dryer.  Update on 2010-10-17: This dryer is still working great and I still consider it the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Update on 2011-12-29: I cut my hair shorter last April and no longer use the hair dryer.  It was still working perfectly after three years.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of useage, I know this hair dyer inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only CON is that this dryer is very heavy.  But after experiencing the great drying power, I can overlook this CON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this dryer does what it claims, it reduces static amazingly well.  The ionizing effect is obvious.  My hair is softer and non-fuzzy, a daily occurrence with my older hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the perm that I have, my previous hairdryers would make my hair very frizzy.  It was very easy to overdry.  With this Conair Infiniti, my hair drys nice and smooth, silky and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is halfway down my back.  With my other hairdryers I would frequently have my hair sucked into the back of the dryer, burning my hair and catching it in the fan.  The Conair Infiniti has a double layer, a metal screen inside a plastic housing, making the chances of mishap much less.  Early in the morning this is a nice safety feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser attachment works great to dry the curls without them flying all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT - Be sure to read the instructions.  Dry your hair on hot.  To set the curl go to cold air.  This works wonderfully!  Thanks for the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retractable cord is great for storage.  The color pink is sassy and space-age.  I like it.  I would easily give it 5 stars, if it wasn&#x27;t for the weight.</li>
            <li> This product works quickly, quietly, and efficiently.  I love the retractable cord - that&#x27;s one of the best features ever for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful little blow drier.  Don&#x27;t buy it for the retractable cord as it only works so so.</li>
            <li> This works good, but not as good as my old one that I got at Walmart for $15.00.  It&#x27;s a little heavy and somewhat bulky but I like the fact that the cord recoils inside.  It keeps it out of the way, but the cord is not very long so you must stay close to the outlet.  I have very long hair and my old blow dryer dries my hair a lot faster than this one does. I had no need for the attachements so I tossed them in the trash.  It works OK, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I owned the model before this one for about 8 years. It was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day I bought it, until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower. Alas, it was a sad day. I specifically bought this one based on the performance of the other, and it&#x27;s not lived up to par, by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this dryer 6 months ago and the retractable cord already doesn&#x27;t work. That&#x27;s the WHOLE reason I wanted this model. This one is heavier, hotter, and the cool shot is really just warm. Not to mention, it&#x27;s hot pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;m very disappointed with this dryer, and will look for another retractable one next time. I don&#x27;t recommend getting this one, if that is the feature luring you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--UPDATE - Sept 2014&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer totally died a month ago. I&#x27;d had it 18 whole months, and it completely quit working. No fireworks, no warning, just plugged it in, and nothing. I tried several outlets throughout the house, and it would. not. work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Conair, and based on its model number, which indicated it was well within warranty, they would replace it for free, sort of. I had to pay $15 in shipping to return it to them. I think that&#x27;s totally bogus, given that the unit shouldn&#x27;t have had ANY problems in that timeframe. Hopeful, I sent it along. In about three weeks, they sent me another dryer--same model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally. I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic. It&#x27;s quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it&#x27;s well-vented and easily cleaned. Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly. They fall off this one--the one from the deceased predecessor, and the one that came with this replacement. It&#x27;s virtually no use to me without the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don&#x27;t have faith this one will last. That it works well is only part of what makes a product great. Longevity is part of the equation, as well.I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don&#x27;t have faith this one will last.

            <li> I love that it comes with the attachments!  Eventhough I do not use them very often they are there if I need them.  My only compliant would be I would like it if the strength button and heat button were switched. I LOVE the retractable cord.  Its super convenient and helps the bathroom look orderly.</li>
            <li> After a few years of use my old hair dryer died on me. So I got this one, its been working great so far. It has a few attachments with it to help you with different styles.</li>
            <li> This is second time i&#x27;ve bought this dryer, after first one servced me well.  It&#x27;s powerful but not LOUD with that annoying whiney sound they usually make.  I love the recoil of cord.  Happy happy, for second time.  :)</li>
            <li> It does a good job drying my hair, has temperature settings so I don&#x27;t have to use too much heat. I love the retractable cord and the diffuser.</li>
            <li> So I got this as my gym bag hair dryer for after swimming. I thought that the retractable cord would be perfect for that. It&#x27;s ok. The problem is actually that the retractable cord sticks straight out (&amp; won&#x27;t bend at all), about four inches from the bottom of the handle. So it actually makes it bigger than my normal hair dryer, so I switched them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I haven&#x27;t had problems with the cord - it retracts well. I hold onto to the cord because it does retract pretty quickly and I think it could snap your finger- it&#x27;s that fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like is the attachments: a diffuser and I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called, but it makes the output hole smaller and in a line - this is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I turned it on for first time (without attachments), I thought oh this hair dryer is significantly less powerful than my normal one, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s right because it dries my hair much faster. There is less blowing around of my hair, and I feel like my hair dries smoother bc it&#x27;s not getting whipped around so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s quieter than most hair dryers. Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s not going to literally be quiet, but for a hair dryer, it&#x27;s quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The settings are great and when I put it on cool and press the cold button, the air is cold. This is great because I am always fighting frizz and so I hit my hair with cold at the end until my hair isn&#x27;t hot anymore. This dryer is like half time in that part because the cold button is cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let&#x27;s face it the pink is so cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it very much. It does a good job. I just did 4/5 stars because the cord sticks out so far when fully retracted and that was a bit of a bummer for my expectations.</li>
            <li> I got this last week and doing the hair drying job as expected.. my concern is &amp;#34;when I keep it in High.. it&#x27;s giving a wire burning smell. so I immediately switch it down to medium..I dont know if any body who bought this experience a similar situation!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used Conair (I&#x27;ve tried the T3 and other fancy dryers and they are horrible, not to mention they don&#x27;t come with diffusers) and it&#x27;s always been good on my curls. The heat output on this one is insane, and my hair always looks good. Only problem is that I&#x27;ve had the thing for a few months, and the diffuser is completely melted. All the little sticks are bent down and it gets tangled in my hair. Conair should either answer their customer service emails or sell diffusers separately as well so I&#x27;m not left without one. FRUSTRATED.</li>
            <li> Aside from being an attractive color and design this hair dryer works beautifully.  It is comfortable to handle, dries hair quickly, and stores easily with the retractable cord.  There is nothing more anyone could desire from a dryer.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is really a great hair dryer! Before this I was using a similar Conair unit with Cool/Low/High heat and Low/High speed settings, a cold shot button, a retractable cord reel and a diffuser attachment. However it is a few years old now. I recently repaired a short that was in the cord that developed after years of use. Thankfully it was very close to the plug and only reduced the cord length by a few inches. The older one is still unpleasantly loud on high though, and I was having to use earplugs while drying my hair just to keep the noise out. I&#x27;m very finicky about my hearing and didn&#x27;t want to hold something next to my head for 20 min a day that was going to slowly destroy that and annoy me in the present.&lt;br /&gt;The cord reel was a must-have option for me, as was the diffuser attachment since I have naturally curly hair and like to style it that way. I also like that this dryer has Tourmaline. I&#x27;m not sure whether my older unit had it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem so. This dryer definitely gets the job done faster, with MUCH less noise on high that is easily tolerated comfortably sans earplugs, which was a high priority. The heat is nice too, and though I believe it has a slightly lower temperature than my older unit, it&#x27;s more than adequate. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t get hot except at the business end. Sometimes I like to hold the dryer from the barrel and it doesn&#x27;t even get slightly warm. The cold shot button is a nice feature too which I seldom use, but it&#x27;s nice to have. I think the cord is a bit longer as well. While I would have preferred rocker switches, the slider switches are simple and solid. The styling of this dryer is SUPER CUTE haha! Though it&#x27;s plastic, I love the metallic fuchsia finish and the sporty modern detailing. I know at least one other reviewer complained about it not having a loop to hang the dryer from, which I agree should probably be a feature on every hair dryer ever made everywhere, but I will upload a user photo later showing how I hang my dryer on the wall using a brass hook, which works just fine. I would rather not have to put stress on the cord by hanging it from the plug body, but I believe since it doesn&#x27;t bend the cord, and the dryer is lightweight, that stress would be minimal if not negligible. One could probably rig some kind of keyring zip tied around the flared fitting that guides the cord into the dryer body if you must have something to hang it from, but I found it unnecessary for my setup. Did I mention that it makes my hair look fabulous too? Even without product, it does an excellent job of getting my hair dry, voluminous, and shiny with minimal disturbance and frizz, which as a curly girl is always an issue. The price is also unbeatable @ $20 with free shipping. I saw this same dryer in Ulta, Sears, BB&amp;B, etc. for twice the price, plus tax. I&#x27;ve only owned the product for a couple weeks, but I expect it to last for years just like my other Conair, which is now going into the guest bathroom or into my luggage as a travel dryer. At this price however, I may consider buying a 2nd. I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who needs a fabulous, quiet, affordable, space &amp; time saving hair dryer loaded with features.ang my dryer on the wall using a brass hook, which works just fine.

            <li> This hair dryer is terrific! The ionic feature makes my hair dry silky and smooth, believe-it-or-not, the static fly-aways are gone! I&#x27;ve had friends ask if I&#x27;ve just had my hair professionally done (no lie, really). I love the way the cord reels up into the dryer. The cord is the perfect length when it is pulled out all the way and tucks away when not in use making it much easier to store. I give this dryer two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on here Amazon to compare with the black and pink Conair hair dryer before buying it through SOAP.com/Wag.com -- which I believe are related sites to Amazon.. Not sure. Anyway, I really wanted one with a retractable cord and one that was pink. I&#x27;ve only used this once -- I received it yesterday. So far, I like it. It does vibrate, which is weird, and I had read about this somewhere in the reviews. I think I can look past that.  It&#x27;s heavier than my older pink Revlon dryer, and it seems only slightly more powerful. I&#x27;m not a picky person since I just tend to dry my hair partially most days. The color isn&#x27;t as bright as the photos show. It looks darker, by a tad -- raspberry color. It is a very nice looking dryer though. The silver part is brushed, and not pointy, like the photo seems. I really, REALLY love the cord. SO convenient!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!  Perfect price &amp; works great.  I would recommend this to anyone with no hesitation.  I use both attachments, and both work great.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly with the diffuser that comes with the dryer.  It delivers just enough heat and coupled with the diffuser it is a great combination to make my shoulder length curly hair look great.</li>
            <li> My daughter has enjoyed using the hair dryer. She wanted a blow dryer that could handle her thick hair, and this one does.</li>
            <li> Great price daughter loved all the attachments</li>
            <li> After reading several hair dryer reviews, I was very interested in the 213X model in this line: [[ASIN:B000E8O8UQ Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]], but my local retailer had the 223 model, so I thought I would give it a shot. I like the idea of the retractable cord, but now that I&#x27;ve used it once, I know that 5&#x27; is too short for my taste. I was also expecting a better dry from an ionic dryer, but my hair didn&#x27;t seem any less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see several reviews state how heavy this hair dryer is. I don&#x27;t agree. Either my old dryer was extremely heavy, or the other reviewers have much higher standards than I do. The dryer feels solid and well-made. It&#x27;s definitely not \\&quot;featherweight\\&quot;. But I would not refer to it as heavy.    I also would not describe this dryer as quiet, as some reviewers did. I did not find it to be louder or softer than the average hair dryer.    The dryer dried my hair very quickly. I was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. I found the temperature and speed settings to be more than adequate and well-placed on the dryer handle (no accidental bumping).    The retractable cord is another plus. My old dryer had a long, bulky cord that was always in the way. Be cautious when retracting the cord, though. The directions say to hold onto the end of it while retracting. I found that hard to accomplish because it retracts extremely quickly. Press the retract button gently until you get an idea of how fast it&#x27;s going to move.    I will come back and update my review after more use. I only purchased this dryer last week. So far I am pleased and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I won a contest years ago and got this from ConAir. This is the second one I&#x27;m owning. I love it. And the cord keeper is such a great function, you will never go back to using a messy cord again. My hair is long, naturally curly, then keratin, then extensions. This dryer works for everyone. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hairdryer once my Bed Head one caught on fire.  When it came, I was sort of excited because of the retractable cord.  Now I really like it because it has three different heat settings, plus a button for extra cool.  I always use the warm setting, and it&#x27;s nice because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning my hair off.  Also, it&#x27;s rather quiet, which is nice because I use it at 6:00 a.m. when my husband is still sleeping.  I would re-purchase this again if I had to.</li>
            <li> Thank you thank you thank you for making a hair dryer with a retractable cord.  I cannot express how wonderful this feature in particular is!  The jury is still out on the dryer itself as I&#x27;ve not had it long enough to know its durability/reliability, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quite hair dryer.  I love the retractable cord feature.  However, I am disappointed it quit working after 10 months of use.</li>
            <li> I had this blowdryer for 2+ years when it blew out and had to be replaced (totally my fault by the way, didnt realize you are suppose to clean out the back of blowdryers. fuzz had gotten in my filter and the motor blew). When I went to buy a new one, I wanted to replace with same model because I loved it so much. It dries my long thick hair much quicker than other models and I do think it is better on your hair (so they advertise, and I so like to think!) The cord keeper is a great feature too and keeps corn from getting all weird and twisted. Get this! Your hair will thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  It is very quiet compared to many dryers I have had.  It is awesome having so many heat and speed settings.  It comes with attachments which is a plus but doesn&#x27;t really need them. The retractible cord is very handy for storing in the drawer.  I would definitely buy again. The only con I can find is that it is a little heavier them I am use it.</li>
            <li> I needed a good hair dryer bad!  I ordered this not really knowing it had a retractable cord.  What an awesome idea!  Just love it.</li>
            <li> This was a top beauty buy of 2012 and it is a cheap and great buy for a hair dryer works great buy and deal</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this blow dryer. Quiet and easy to use.  Looks great also love the color.  Love the retractable cord</li>
            <li> I like the color, the attachments, and the retractable cord. I didn&#x27;t feel like the hair dryer was too heavy or too loud. If you blow dry your hair on high then yes it is loud but if you use the lower setting it is actually pretty quiet. I&#x27;d buy this again, I think it was a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a new dryer for ages, but kept waiting because I couldn&#x27;t decide on what to get.  This Conair is a great choice.  I never realized a dryer could actually be quiet &amp; do such a great job on thin, flat hair.&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer is so quiet, compared to my old one.  My hair is smoother with no static electricity.  A really nice dryer.  The defuser makes my hair fuller than it really is.</li>
            <li> It came very soon after ordering it.  It performs exactly as it was advertised.  It is very easy to use and the recoiling power  cord is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer, not exactly a cure for the common cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. It does dry my thick african-american hair very quickly and leaves a shine. I cannot give it five stars because the cord is too short - could be a tad longer - I constantly have to re-plug in the socket.</li>
            <li> i thought I was just buying a cheep retractable cord dryer....it works better than all of my salon quality dryers! So happy.</li>
            <li> I want to like this hairdryer.  I want to LOVE this hairdryer.  Instead, I HATE this hairdryer.  The cord is so unbelievably short that I am boxing this thing up and sending it right back.  I&#x27;ve placed more than 70 orders with Amazon this year and this is the very first thing I am returning.  The cord is a ridiculous 54&amp;#34; and I cannot dry my hair without first clearing the entire counter of everything on it or risk knocking it over with the short cord.  Think about it...54&amp;#34; is 4.5&#x27; (roughly).  I have to stand 22&amp;#34; away from the wall because that&#x27;s how deep the cabinet is.  Add in another 24&amp;#34; from my wall plug height to my head height and that&#x27;s (roughly) 4 feet...which leaves me about 5&amp;#34; to maneuver to dry my hair.  And drag the cord all over the countertop knocking everything off with it,  Big fail.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how heavy the hairdryer was initially, now it is not so bad (bought the hair dryer back in April) I have found that I have to retract the retractable cord several times for it to completely retract. I really like the 3 heat settings and how fast my hair dries.</li>
            <li> I have been through a lifetime of hairdryers and this one tops the list! It&#x27;s powerful but doesn&#x27;t blast your hair beyond recognition...especially at the lower speed and on warm. Not having to deal with wrapping up the cord is such a plus...the retractable cord works beautifully and saves space in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and has all the features considered a must have, at a very affordable price. And do I love the retractable cord. What a time and mess saver. It feels a tad heavy to me, but the last 10 years I have used a mini hair dryer. I really don&#x27;t use a hair dryer on a regular basis, so I asked my niece who is a beautician to use it and tell me how she liked it and she loved it. After calling me a wimp, she grudgingly agreed it might be a little heavier. Not really a problem for most people, unless like me you have arthritic joints. However my hair is so short and my use is brief, it is no problem for me. It is a good bargain. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My needs in a hair dryer are simple, this serves them all. This replaces the travel dryer that will only see travel duties, as I wouldn&#x27;t pack this dryer for travel. It&#x27;s a solid, heavy, multiple speed hair dryer with and a few attachments that aren&#x27;t going to see use, but that&#x27;s just me. The cord retracts, uh, vigorously and might double as a defensive apparatus. It is nice that the cord isn&#x27;t running across the bathroom anymore.  The sound is less annoying, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The airflow is generous and I can&#x27;t say if the ions do anything, but it&#x27;s fast at drying my medium length hair. It&#x27;s better than most other simple hair dryers I&#x27;ve used and seems like it will last a long time. For $30, you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short list-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* fast drying&lt;br /&gt;* nice retracting cord&lt;br /&gt;* good ranage of settings&lt;br /&gt;* quieter than other hair dryers&lt;br /&gt;* a bit on the heavier side&lt;br /&gt;* overall a good value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite pink.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law asked for this dryer after using the same one that I gave my daughter. They both think it does a great job oon drying their hair.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Infinity by Conair 223F Cord Reel Dryer. It dries just as well as any other dryer I have used in the past (both moderate priced and expensive).  The retractable cord is a great bonus.  And I love the color.  It is very fun.</li>
            <li> Very good, highly rated blow dryer.  Lots of settings, does not dry out hair.  The color could be better -- like silver or black -- but a very good performing product.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife.  First unit arrived and had a defective cold button.  Returned for exchange with Amazon, new unit works well, and wife is happy with it.  Hard to complain for under $24.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has adequate heat, but excellent air flow, which I prefer.  The higher-heat dryers without the airflow just seem to bake your hair dry.  The retractable cord is only 4 ft. long, but again that&#x27;s adequate in most situations.</li>
            <li> The motor is quieter than dryers I&#x27;ve owned in the past. Easy to operate. Love the cord reel! Does a fast job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li> It dries her very thick and long hair quickly and with ease. Has a cool shot button, and strong airflow!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my family and we all just love it!  The cord is a little on the shorter side, but the dryer itself works great and dries the hair very fast! Worth the $.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer....super quiet..and dries hair quickly.... it is very light compared to my other hairdryers and the cord winder works very well</li>
            <li> Really like this hair dryer.  Works well and particularly like the auto-reel feature.  Nice not to have to leave the cord out around a hot hair dryer.  The varying speeds are all I need and I have been pleased with this hair dryer.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This BlowdryerThis is awesome! It has amazing power and I love the fact that the cord is retractable. Would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for almost 5 years; it is sturdy, I like that I can control separately fan speed and heat and its retractable cord. Can ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> Does an exactly job drying and I have used a lot of different dryers.  Love the different settings.  It didn&#x27;t get 5 stars as it is a little heavy, but would buy it again it that good.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has great power and different heat settings. The price and quality are great, it is very heavy duty. The automatically recoiling cord is a bonus!</li>
            <li> Love this blow drier! It&#x27;s quieter than my last one and dries my hair quicker. The color is really fun too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this blow dryer for at least 7 or more years.  I can&#x27;t remember how long I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer exactly, but I know I bought it when my daughter was a baby &amp; she&#x27;s almost 9.  The best blow dryer ever!  The button to retract cord fell off last year...no big deal.  I need to finally replace it because it is starting to make noises when I use it.  Price is just an added bonus!!</li>
            <li> Being a man and purchasing this as a gift for my wife I was looking for something that was of professional quality. The hair dryer is aesthetically awesome, the self coiling feature, and the accessories are all great selling points. According to my research ([...] the ceramic and tourmaline are all good features if you want even heating that won&#x27;t hurt your hair. While researching I found that any wattage above 1300 is considered \\&quot;pro\\&quot;. This dryer being 1875 would definitely fit into that \\&quot;pro\\&quot; description.  It did not. I wish the dryer had more blowing power. I suggest getting something with more watts. It is a great hair dryer if you are on a budget and are looking for the scientific features of ceramic and tourmaline and accessories.</li>
            <li> This is a quick drying dryer, which is what we all want, lol.  The retractable cord is a little snappy, beware of it flipping the cord against you.  I love the color, very bright and cheerful.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I bought this almost 3 years ago, and it&#x27;s still going! I gave it 4 stars because I think it does get a little too hot on the highest setting, and not hot enough on the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting. However, if you are looking for a nice dryer on a budget, this is a great choice. I love the fact that the cord winds up.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is awesome. My only complaint is that the cord is super short compared to others I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped it recently and the cord no longer retracts, but I can only blame myself for that. The dryer itself still works perfectly in regards to heat and power after a year or more of almost daily use.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  Its not very heavy or particularly loud and the amazing thing is, it actually reels the cord in!!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer dries my hair faster while remaining very quiet! I am able to dry my hair with my daughter&#x27;s room door open and she does not stir. Its very compact and I love the way it travels, small!</li>
            <li> I wish the cord retracted every time perfectly but it usually works and I love that feature.  Otherwise, a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It has all of the settings (hot, warm &amp; cold) plus the settings are on a slide as opposed to the toggle settings. You don&#x27;t have to worry about  accidentally changing temperatures or turning drier off in the middle of styling you hair. I also like the retracting cord, it makes storing so much easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous Conair hair dryer, despite reviews that said it would be too heavy.  Once the cord is unwound, it&#x27;s really not heavy (and you wouldn&#x27;t use it with the cord retracted).  Not having to manually wind up the cord for storage is such a time and headache saver.  It makes it so easy to put it away everyday in a drawer instead of leaving it out on the counter, still plugged in.</li>
            <li> The first one I had lasted maybe 1 year then quit, I contacted Conair they opened a ticket, I mailed it to them they sent me a replacement. I&#x27;ve had the replacement for about 1-1 1/2 years and it stopped working, I&#x27;m assuming it has to do with the retractable cord because I tried resetting the outlet and the plug, I tried a different outlet, it was working then stopped! I&#x27;ll never own another product of Conair again. I bought a Revlon brand hair dryer for my 11 year old daughter to use to learn to blow dry her hair and it&#x27;s been a life saver!!!</li>
            <li> There are so many hair dryers to choose from. This one is powerful (dries my hair in much less time), lightweight, useful accessories and multiple settings. Best of all, it has a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> nice and quiet, retractable cord....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is super powerful too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this item and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Having the power cord being able to retract is an awesome feature. No more messy cords to deal with, hence easy storage.</li>
            <li> ... of blow-styling, but it is a bit heavy. You wouldn&#x27;t want to travel with it, and if you had a big, long, full head of hair that took awhile to dry, your arm would get mighty tired.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mid size hair dryer.  It is great for compact places, as I hate having to wrap a cord up.  I like the multiple heat settings and the high and low and cool shot button.  I have purchased two of these...one for myself and one for my guest bathroom (and in case I need a back-up).  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I bought it because the cord is retractable which eliminates winding around the handle or a big tangle when storing.  The biggie though is how much quieter it is than my old dryer &amp; then there is the benefit of how much faster it dries my hair.  Love, Love, Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this primarily for the retractable cord, which works well. Dryer works well &amp; doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is sturdy and I like that it&#x27;s not noisy when I&#x27;m drying my hair. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap and it works perfect! The retractable cord is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;Slight downside would be that it&#x27;s a little heavy but then again, sometimes light means &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;,  so I don&#x27;t mind and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> The cord is a little short - but this machine is strong sturdy and well built.  So far so good.  I&#x27;m happy w/the purchase.</li>
            <li> nice hair dryer but not sure why this couldnt be wrapped too even though the other wrapping was bad. why could this not be wrapped?</li>
            <li> Pleased with new blow dryer.  Dries hair, just as advertised.  Love the retractable cord.  Keeps my gym bag a little less messy.  Love the red.</li>
            <li> worked just like it is supposed to really like the dryer got the job done in half the time of my old blower. Will recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The design is extremely well done with a fast dry and not that heavy.  The switches are out of the way and there no accidently switch off or temperature change.</li>
            <li> I had a really old Conair that I liked but it was quite shabby, so replaced it with what I knew should be a good hairdryer. The different heat levels are great with the cool down to set the curl</li>
            <li> Love the hairdryer!  Just what I was looking for and perfect for taking with on trips instead of packing the big dryer!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife as a gift and still its working as new. I gave this to my sister too and she loves it as well. The hot/cold/warm air setting is too good and also the force with which it blows air is too nice. Hence it can dry your hair in minutes</li>
            <li> I have owned this type of hair dryer for about 8 years.  However, this particular hair dryer I just bought in September 2013 to replace the previous hair dryer that was the same as this, but it was a different color.  It has worked perfectly well until the other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has ever had this experience ever!  I have sometimes left my dryer plugged into my outlet after blow drying my hair and this time was no different.  But after my last usage on Tuesday I became sick and paid no attention to the dryer laying on the counter in my bathroom.  But I kept smelling a sweet smell coming from the bathroom area and just thought it was my plug in freshener.  I had just bought a new insert.  But the next day I saw a puddle of red underneath my dryer and I saw that the area next to the plug reel up was melting!!  Really, does something like that happen.  I pulled the dryer plug immediately and put the dryer on a paper towel and it continued to seem to melt.  Red kept flowing from it for quite awhile.  This could have been a fire issue and something inside the dryer overheated.  I don&#x27;t know.  But I do know I feel uncomfortable using it and threw it away and will have to purchase a new one.  To Conair ... shame on you for manufacturing such a shoddy piece of equipment!  If anyone be able to illuminate me on what happened or has experienced the same thing, please reply and let me know.  Oh and I gave this dryer 3 stars because it worked perfectly up until the melting.  In fact I&#x27;m upset that I won&#x27;t get to continue using it, but I won&#x27;t take the chance now.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair dryer when it&#x27;s working.It cuts off by itself every time I use it though. So, I have to turn it off, push the buttons on the cord,and restart. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer after reading customer reviews here. Overall, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;*Dries long, thick hair very quickly (I have over shoulder length hair and it only took 10 minutes, great because I have a 10 month old who doesn&#x27;t nap long)&lt;br /&gt;*Cord keeper (no messing with wrapping up the cord)&lt;br /&gt;*Three levels of heat, Three levels of speed, cold shot (Anyone can use it, although I never use the cold shot feature)&lt;br /&gt;*Comes with concentrator &amp; diffuser&lt;br /&gt;*My hair was fairly frizz-free after use (the \\&quot;Ion technology\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;*Decent price (I purchased for 29.99 @ Target)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;*Fairly heavy (Not friendly for those who have difficulty lifting/manuevering/arthritis etc)&lt;br /&gt;*The cord isn&#x27;t that long (If you were trying to dry your child&#x27;s hair, probably be a pain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, hopefully it lasts long. My last dryer was only $15 and lasted 5 years before it blew out.</li>
            <li> Had no idea this hair dryer had a retractable cord!! I was very excited to see that. Works great, but it makes our apartment fuse blow every time I use it more than 10-15 minutes (might just be our place but we live in a townhome).</li>
            <li> I have had this item for a while, but waited before posting a review. I have had no problems with it at all. It is not super noisy and dries my hair rather quickly. Some people complain of the weight, and while it is not the lighest hair dryer around, it does not wear out my arms when using it.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that I love the color, this is a dynamo of a blow dryer.  I have been using Conair products since my very 1st blow dryer over 30 years ago.  Their quality is excellent and long lasting.  The retractable cord along with the excellent reviews made it an easy choice.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The reel back cord is a nice feature but it is not very long so not much room to move with it. Does not get as hot as my old Conair hair dryer did.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer performance is very good.  The cord is a problem.  While the retractable cord is a great idea,  it is not long enough.  Often when I use it, it stalls because of the pulling on the cord at the plug outlet.</li>
            <li> my favorite hair dryer finally  gave up:/  but i looked on here and found the exact one thankss!!!!!☻☻♥♥</li>
            <li> It works great! Enjoy the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is already stalling out on me and I just got the hair dryer.  It works great but don&#x27;t expect miracles with the cord.</li>
            <li> Bought this for wife and sisters-in-law to use when visiting.  They love it and the retractable cord keeps down the mess.  Comes with each to attach and remove diffuser and concentrator attachments.</li>
            <li> So far I love the dryer.  I especially like being able to reel the cord in for easier storage.</li>
            <li> had the same model before but in blue. this is a newer model as i great. loves the cord retraction</li>
            <li> It works just fine.  Light weight, pretty color, and efficient heat.  I don&#x27;t have anything else more to add.  Unless you want me to lie.</li>
            <li> Great hair-dryer!! Powerful in strength, but light in weight. The cord is great too-- but it is extremely quick in wrapping up, so be careful!</li>
            <li> I also use this hair dryer.  I like it better than the 1 we originally had, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t think it puts out as much air.  So since I&#x27;m the 1 writing the review, I give it 5 stars.  LOVE the retractable cord!</li>
            <li> I used the Infiniti by Conair 223F blow dryer on my 10 year olds hair. She has a head full of long blond hair but it is fine. Usually when I use a blow dryer on her hair it gets to be fly away and static filled. This blow dryer worked great on her hair. It left it looking smooth and with a nice shine. She didn&#x27;t get the fly away messy look from it. I started out using the hot setting and then moved down to the warm setting as her hair was drying. She liked that I was able to use the cooler setting especially when blowing it on her face to dry her bangs. I love that the cord retracts back into the handle for storing. Makes it much easier to put away when done using it and also makes it nice while using it that you don&#x27;t have to have a long cord dangling in your way. I don&#x27;t mind the color, it actually looks more of a reddish purple to me than pink. The dryer is a little bulky for smaller hands. My daughter thought it was a bit heavy for her smaller hands but I had no problem hanging on to it and using it. Overall, a nice blow dryer that works well.</li>
            <li> Infiniti by Conair 223F Cord Reel Dryer    Noise data included - good job overall    Here are some points not discussed elsewhere. The Infinity is a medium weight hairdryer heft wise. The plastic construction is tight so it feels solid in your hands. It does a good enough a job drying hair (not significantly faster or slower than any other 1875 watt dryer). I like the removable filter which is mounted fairly flush with the back of the housing. I had others where the filter screen was the back of the housing, if you laid it down the wrong way the screen mounting tabs broke off too easily. Here is a tip for cleaning the plastic windowscreen like filter underneath; I used to clean it with tweezers to pull off the accumulated lint about once a month. I now use a Q-tip, simply touch the tip against the lint, twirl, and the lint gets tangled in the Q-tip and comes right off.     In use the dryer is pretty well balanced, and what surprised me, fairly quiet as well. It is not advertised as a particularly quiet model, which is important to me, but it is. I found that dryers with large diameter air inlets and outlets are usually quieter. Larger fan diameter equals slower and less noisy fan. This one was noticeably quieter than some other ones I have used, and the noise is slightly lower pitch and not as shrill. I decided to do a noise comparison of all the dryers we had in the house and sure enough, per minute of drying time, the Infinity was the second quietest. What was more surprising is how noisy these things are, not just objectively but subjectively as well. 86 dBA is LOUD. I tested all of them with a noise level meter held 12\\&quot; away at a right angle to the discharge of air. Here are the results:    Revlon Quiet Ceramic 1875 High&#x3D;80 dBA  Low&#x3D;71 dBA    Conair Infinity 1875  High&#x3D;83 dBA  Low&#x3D;79 dBA    Remington All That 1875 High&#x3D;86 dBA  Low&#x3D;76 dBA (very shrill)    Windmere MTD1CP ~1200 High&#x3D;82 dBA  Low&#x3D;71 dBA (travel dryer, v. slow)    So, other than my specifically quietRevlon, and the flea size Windmere, the Infinity was very quiet. A good value, and a pleasure to use. PS. I do not recommend that you use the self retracting cord feature without holding the cord with the other hand. It does snap back, and it just feels like a gimmick feature that will break if you use it too often.</li>
            <li> I just got this hairdryer a few days ago for Christmas, so I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s longevity, but I love it already.  After the first use, I noticed that my mid-back length, thick hair was less frizzy, more manageable and softer.  It also gets dry in approximately 5-7 minutes, cutting my drying time in half.  It&#x27;s a heavy dryer, but does the job and with only a moderate level of noise on high.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this 2 months and use it 3x a week.  I&#x27;d recommend it as the best hair dryer in this price range.    Good:  it&#x27;s very powerful; your hair will dry quickly.  It&#x27;s can get very hot on the high heat setting, but the medium heat setting is a great compromise if you have fine hair.  The lint trap comes off and can be cleaned very easily.  The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button gets it as heat-free as I&#x27;ve ever experienced (with other dryers it&#x27;s still pretty warm).    Bad:  relatively minor complaints.  The cord is a little short -- I&#x27;d like another 6\\&quot; (dirty minds...).  I&#x27;d also like a loop on the handle so I can hang it on a hook.  This is more important to me than the cord retractor, which I don&#x27;t use; those things usually stop working after a while anyway.    The switches take a little getting used to.  At first I didn&#x27;t like them because they are harder to move, but then I realized that if they were the easier, toggle-type of switch, being placed where they are on the handle, I&#x27;d be inadvertently changing the settings and turning it off during use.  So I&#x27;m okay with them now.  They&#x27;ve also loosened up a little.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife because i broke her other one.  she likes it, it works like her other one.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is a great hairdryer.  She uses it almost daily and the cord re-tractor is the best because it helps me from stepping on the cord.</li>
            <li> Love the cord; not quite enough power.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer it does my hair very fast</li>
            <li> I bought it 10 month ago. Its quality can be trusted.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price.  An ionic dryer should not cost $200.00</li>
            <li> I had this same hair dryer for over ten years before it stopped working, so I replaced it with the same model!  I only wish there were more color options, but for the quality the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer but the last one went on me after one year.  If the price wasn&#x27;t as good as it is on Amazon I might have looked around for a similar one that lasts longer.  I never had a problem with it dying out so soon so maybe it was a fluke. Otherwise I really like how it drys.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the retractable cord. Hadn&#x27;t bought a new dryer in years because I have short fine hair and don&#x27;t need one much. But I got tired of having to wind up the cord all the time after I used my old small dryer for a minute. This dryer is meant for a serious blow dryer, I think. Someone who has a lot of hair and needs drying power. Be aware that this machine is big and heavy. I don&#x27;t need such a powerful machine, My mistake I guess, but threw away the box before I realized. Seems very well made, but I wish I had something lighter. With a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> My conair hair dryer decided to bite the dust on me and the following day I was having a medical procedure done.  I was pressed for time so I ordered this one and have one day shipping.  I must say that I love this hairdryer.  It is pretty in color and looks exactly like it does online.  It is not too heavy and comes with two extensions.  I love the choices between low, medium and high and also low, warm, hot and cool.  I highly recommend this item.  It is not too noisy either.</li>
            <li> I like the speed and heat varieties. It works quickly to dry my long hair. I would suggest that you have an outlet above the counter to use with this hair dryer, otherwise the cord may be too short.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter. I also own one and so does my other daughter. We absolutely love this hair dryer. It has 3 speed settings (low, med, high), 2 temperature settings (low, high), and a cool button. It is nicely powered with each setting and very nicely made. I&#x27;ve had mine for a few years now and the reel cord still works as well as it did the day I purchased it. If you are considering buying this product I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Replaced hairdryer with this one.  Hair feels great.  Powerful hairdryer that does the job quickly.  Relatively quiet on the high setting.</li>
            <li> For me this hairdryer is a little heavy and takes longer to dry my hair than I expected. It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Best feature for me is the cool setting not found on other hair dryers. In hot, humid weather, the cool setting allows me to dry my hair and not overheat while doing so!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a really long time now with no complaints.  It still works just as expected.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Easy to use, quite stylish (and how important is that when one is blow drying their hair!).  Dries hair quickly without any frizz.  The cord even retracts!  It has multiple heat and power settings.  Appears to have a long shelf life, unless you drop it.  Word to the wise,  take care not to drop it on a hard floor.  This is my second one.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. Perfect power and the tools that it came with are great for styling your hair. The best part of this product is that the cord is retractable. Perfect for staying organized!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer, and not just because it keeps the chord inside... many hair dryers get super hot even on meduim heat, this has a very soft medium heat, and is hot enough... and I am not sure what all makes it work so well, but it dries hair FAST.</li>
            <li> Quieter than most!  Dries quickly. The cord storage is great but does have issues once in awhile.  Never had one that didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Very good product with many drying options. Love it!</li>
            <li> The blow dryer works great, so far i have had no issues with it. The retractable cord is convenient. It al o is not as noisy as some other blow dryers.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has been great, but it only lasted me for 1 year. The cord is shorting out.  I plug it in and have to have the cord in a certain position or it won&#x27;t work.  Today it wouldn&#x27;t work all. This problem might be due to the retractable feature of the cord. Unfortunately, I am going to have to replace it.</li>
            <li> As far as hair dryers for daily bathroom use go, this is a good one.  I&#x27;m sure there are a bunch of pro features that it may not have, but it is exactly as described and it has been a solid performer every day for about a year now.  Heat temps are good, and unit stays pretty cool even if used for several minutes.  And the red color is fun too.</li>
            <li> This dryer moves a lot of air, multiple heat and air speed settings. The temperature is nice, and the auto cord retractor works good and comes in handy. It&#x27;s less noisy than other models that move less air.</li>
            <li> This might just be the worst hair dryer I have ever tried. I have curly hair that I usually blow dry straight, no problem, but with this one I could not get it straight &amp; ended up just resigning myself to using my flat iron on the still damp but very frizzy fried mess I ended up with. As another reviewer commented, you have to destroy the packaging to get it out, but I am going to do my best to get it back in there &amp; sealed up to return as this was just a waste of money. An extra star for the retractable cord though; that would have been great had this been a dryer I could tolerate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use: not too heavy; 3 temperature settings; easy to put away; buttons don&#x27;t block anything; reasonable price; enough drying power... The only draw back is that there is NO color choices. So I bought a hair dryer holder and hang my dryer behind the cabinet door.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I loved the idea of having a retractable cord. The cord works as well as I had hoped, and the unit has an added blessing as well: The housing doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot, so I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool before putting it away.</li>
            <li> I received this blow dryer today and it is NOT an Infiniti blow dryer. It is just a regular Conair blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.  I like that it has three heat settings which are useful when wanting my hair to be straighter or have more curl.  I was hesitant about the retractable cord, but it works great and I have not had any issues with this dryer at all, Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Got my first same hair dryer about 9 years ago, it just died, (however I used it maybe 2-10 times a month)&lt;br /&gt; I upgraded to the newer model and still love the cord keeper!</li>
            <li> The power is not very high, which I was really hoping for. It&#x27;s much less than that of the Conair Infiniti.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t have a retractable cord. Its amazing and so much more organized than they use to be. Maybe i&#x27;m late on this new technology but its great. Hair dryer itself is amazing as well and does the job in minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks now, every morning to dry my hair and I love it. The color is nice (red, not pink), it is not too loud, there are 2 speeds and 3 temperatures. I use high speed and medium temperature and it dries my medium length hair in a few minutes. If I use the high temperature, the drying time is about half. There is one feature that I totally love - the RETRACTING CORD - no more wrapping the cord around the hair dryer. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in May from Target. It burned out today.  Not a value product.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer. It is nice and quiet and easy to handle.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> My daughter needed a hair dryer with a retractable cord for dorm life. The color matched all her stuff.  It was perfect.  Arrived quickly with no hassles.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I bought it 4 years or so ago and just recently bought another one because I am living between 2 cities and wanted one in each of my bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I made a great lady happy with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> 2nd one of these I have owned.  The retractable cord is a must for me.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  It is quiet, there are 3 temperature settings, hot/warm/cold, and 2 speed settings.  I love the retracting cable, which allows for easy uncluttered storage.  I did have to get used to holding it securely while I pressed the button on the side to retract the cable, though, dropping it the first time, because I didn&#x27;t have a good hold on it.  I had really long hair when I first got it, and then I cut my hair super short recently, so I have yet to figure out how the diffuser works.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it for some wavier locks once my hair grows out.  This is definitely a good price for a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on Time as it said it would no complaints + ) &#x3D; ) &#x3D;0 &#x3D;) &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> Good product.  So far, has withstood the back and forth trips between houses.  Daughter loves having her own hairdryer and we feel safe with this one, no problems yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about time there&#x27;s a nice working hair dryer that pumps out the heat to dry hair quick. I&#x27;m a guy with short hair and this dryer does the job in 2-3 minutes. The dryer has a heavy and solid feel to it. Not like the light plastic feeling dryers. Also, the retractable cord actually works!</li>
            <li> make my hair style look good all day</li>
            <li> Really like this hair dryer. I&#x27;ve had it about 7 months now and the handle part that you hold has become sticky to the touch. When I rinsed it off and dried it the color came off on the towel. Is there something that will fix this? Otherwise it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Works as it should.</li>
            <li> Quiet! great product for the value.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a Conair ceramic that quit after 5 years.  I bought two other cheaper Conairs and I got what I paid for.  Bad ergonomics, no power, cheap feeling.  Donated those to the gym lockerroom and decided to spend a few dollars more for this one.  So far so good!  A little heavy (ceramics i guess) but balanced well.  Feels good in my hand.  Not the most powerful or hot, but better than the previous ones.  I hope it lasts a long time because I like it fine.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this hair dryer after sifting through consumer reports and customer reviews. I couldn&#x27;t be happier to have the quality of this dryer at the price I paid. I have VERY thick, longer hair that used to take me 10-15 minutes to get completely dry in the past. I have never used this new dryer for longer than 5 minutes because it dries so quickly without leaving that singed, damaged feel I used to get with my old dryer. The ceramic/ionic features must be doing their jobs because it really lives up to the description. Love the retractable cord. I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> Blow drying my hair is by far my least favorite activity everyday so I like to get a powerful blow dryer that can help speed up the process... this one is great! I strongly suggest to anyone looking for one with power!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this dryer is perfect for it. Ive always had problems with my hair drying to slow but not with this product! i also love the feature that the cord is stored in the blow dryer itself, saves a lot of hurt feet &#x3D;)  Overall i am veyr glad i bought this and would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am my 3rd of 4th one of these. In my experience, they usually last about 1-3 years of daily use before it dies and you have to buy a new one. It doesn&#x27;t do anything fantastic for my hair, but it gets the job done. It is the only one that I have found on the market that has a retractable cord, and for that reason alone I continue to buy these. This time however, the cord stopped retracting about two months of using it, so that was really unfortunate :( Will continue to buy until I find something better at a decent price with a retractable cord!</li>
            <li> Absolutely not complaints about this thing. Gives off lots of heat, has adjustments for everything and it retracts the cord when not in use.</li>
            <li> This dryer does a great job.  Powerful, dries and styles my hair quickly.  Often don&#x27;t even have to use a straightener for smoothing.  I love the retracting cord too - no tangled up mess.  For the price, a steal!</li>
            <li> I have bought MANY blowdryers over the years.  I typically always buy Conair because they&#x27;re priced well.  This one is significantly quieter than any other I have owned.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I had to return this dryer because it was too heavy for me.  I thought my strong, volleyball playing daughter might want it, but she also said it was too heavy. Powerful enough but too heavy.</li>
            <li> The dryer works good and has all the features that I need.  The retractable cord is also a great feature.</li>
            <li> Works great but wished it had a medium heat setting</li>
            <li> Love this product! My first one lasted 5+ years. The only reason I replaced it was because the cord got damaged during a move. Great price!</li>
            <li> This is the first thing I bought on-line before.  After my hairdryer broke and visiting a couple of stores with no success to replace it, I decided to put my amazon prime account to use.  The hairdryer arrived on time. The pink was a little different from what I thought it would be, but still nice.  The retracting cord is great. No more wrapping the hairdryer cord around the unit. This is what sold me on this unit to begin with. My only problem with the unit is the slide buttons.  They are not raised, so it is harder to control the heat settings and also shut on and off.  Overall I am very happy with the unit. The price was great and the retractable cord overrides any button issues.  If you order this, you will be very pleased!! Another plus, it is not as large as you would think it would be, so it will be great for traveling. YOU GO AMAZON!</li>
            <li> This broke after a couple of weeks.  Threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> A gift to one of my daughters for Christmas and she has been using it for almost a year every day and still works fine!</li>
            <li> Works great and love the rewind!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought for my wife, it works super well and hiding the cord is awesome - especially when you have kids.</li>
            <li> I have had high end hair dryer&#x27;s and inexpensive like this style.  This has worked for me just as well as the more expensive styles.  The cord does get stuck and it takes a bit to get it to reel back inside but it has lasted long enough.</li>
            <li> So when I went to look for a blowdryer all I really wanted it have was attachments- because I realized that not all blowdryers come with attachments- especially the one for curly hair with the little prongs. When I saw this one, I was pretty much mesmerized - not only did it come with attachments( including the diffuser), but it was pink and it a had button that would reel the cord in for you. When I got it though, did that remain true? Yes! the length of the cord might not be the longest but it isn&#x27;t short either- it&#x27;s a rather standard size I suppose. It works perfectly like any other blowdryer. I think the only reason I am putting four stars at this point is because after being so into the reeling feature , the reel started having problems about 2-3 months into owning the blowdryer. Was it serious? No, I can still push the cord into the blowdryer and everything is working fine. So if this isn&#x27;t going to be a problem with you I&#x27;d recommend it. It was a good buy, and I ended up coming back and buying another one of these for a friend.</li>
            <li> Great space saving idea.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product. And I love the retractable cord!! Comes with the two attachments that work great! Buy this one!</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the very high reviews.  I agree.  It is a great product.  It is a bit heavy though.  SO I do not use it every day</li>
            <li> Thought all hairdryers were the same. This one is lioke going to a salon. Liked it so much , bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should expect the shelf life of a hair dryer to be less than two years, because that is how long this dryer will work.  I purchased locally, and spent $35.99.  It was ok while it lasted, but certainly nothing special.  Even though the Amazon price is lower, I would still say pass.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  I have gotten used to ceramic, ionic technology (dries quickly and leaves hair soft) having used expensive Chi hair dryers for a couple of years now. But Chi is expensive, and not reliable - heating element went bad in 6 mos in one, the housing cracked on another one.  Why spend $80-100 when you can get the same quality with this hair dryer?  Also love the retractable cord. Noise level is not bad either. No complaints whatsoever, and love the price.</li>
            <li> This dryer works nicely until the buttons fall off. The paint chipped on the handle so you will get glitters all over your hands after drying your hair. The one star was given because Conair has terrible customer service. They don&#x27;t ever answer their phone and it takes them forever to respond to emails. It took them over 2 months to replace the defective hair dryer and they gave me a total different color and chipped hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great,  quiet hair dryer. Like having separate controls for heat and fan. Pretty easy to hold, not heavy. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works perfect still after a year.  Inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this well over a year ago but wanted to write a review since I enjoy this hair dryer so much. What I love about it most is the retractable cord--awesome invention. I also like that you can remove and clean the filter. Noise level is standard for a hair dryer, maybe even slightly quieter than average. My only criticism is that it is the heaviest hair dryer I have owned. So glad I bought this and not a super cheap one.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it didn&#x27;t work at all. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not very big which is just fine with me. I am a short person with small hands so it fits comfortably in my hand and it is also light weight.  Vivid dark pink with 2 attachments that I use a lot. The auto cord reel is genius!!! A bonus.</li>
            <li> This is my third one,,lol. But I don&#x27;t care,,it&#x27;s quiet, and it has a lower blow setting I can&#x27;t find anywhere else.  This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen.  I love the self wind cord.  My last blower lasted about 4years,,not bad for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has a good weight to it and the motor sounds quiet and smooth. Drys my hair quickly. Love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Really nice blowdryer the reel cord is very convenient and I&#x27;m glad I bought this blowdryer from conair ha ha</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair dryer that was gentler on my hair since I tend to use a flat iron on it daily.  I was using one of the cheapest hair dryers you could buy and once I started using this one, there was a noticeable difference.  It&#x27;s much quieter and the varied heat controls are very useful.  It&#x27;s also a cute color that is very close to the picture.  It seemed a little heavy a first compared to my cheap hair dryer, but you get used to it.  And of course, it&#x27;s always nice to have a retractable cord.  I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dryer so far. :)</li>
            <li> What is so exciting about a hair dryer? What a difference it makes in shine, silkiness and styling.  I read reviews on hair dryers priced from $$$ to $. I chose this dryer based upon consistently good reviews, benefits, features and price.  This dryer changed my baby fine, thin hair that frizzes in humidity and loses volume in dry climates to lovely, silky brilliantly shiny locks.  I know, it sounds far fetched, but for me, this dryer delivered what it claimed.  Thank you to all that reviewed this product over the months.  You helped me choose a great hair dryer.  Before those of you in the market for a new hair dryer plunk down $200 or even $50 for a hair dryer, try this one.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace one just like it, because I love the hair dryer.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the first one I had only lasted about 2 years and I feel like it should have lasted longer.  Maybe this one will.</li>
            <li> stopped working 3 months after purchase!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because the cord isn&#x27;t quite long enough. 4-5&amp;#34; longer would gave been perfect! Otherwise the dryer is fabulous for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love my hair dryer and the delivery was as stated (time frame).</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. The retractable cord is a must have for someone who uses many hair devices.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and wanted something that can blow dry my hair quickly and this product is what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, and the retractable cord is awesome!  I can store this in my gym bag without worrying about tangles.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the greatest hair dryer yet! I love the retractable cord, the choice of heat levels and speeds PLUS a cool button. It&#x27;s soooo much quieter than my old dryer that my dog doesn&#x27;t need to leave the room now. I bought it as an extra but now use it as my main dryer. I have shoulder length blonde hair and this really does a terrific job.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I had one previously and wore it out. I had to buy another one just like it. I especially lile the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair dryer! I have very frizzy hair, and this is the first blow dryer I have owned that actually helps to reduce frizz. My hair is almost frizz free after I blow dry, so I can just quickly run my flat iron over it rather than having to iron tiny sections to remove the frizz. The high speed is very powerful, and it dries my hair quickly. The retractable cord is a great feature so the cord isn&#x27;t laying all over my counter when I&#x27;m not using the dryer. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 (I would have liked to give it 4.75 if I could) is because it takes a little while to heat up. Otherwise, this is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because i need one with a retractable cord. Otherwise, it is fairly heavy and kind of loud. Not the best or the worst, I have owned it for a while and it hasn&#x27;t broken which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This IS actually a nice dryer... although annoying to get the cord back in and out at times.  I have had this for about 4 years.  However, it now has a short in the cord where it attaches to the reel.  This makes the dryer not come on.  I have to jiggle the cord and turn back on to get it to work.  For obviously fire hazard reasons, I unplug it after use, but will need to find a new dryer as it&#x27;s simply not safe to keep using.  That being said, I guess for the price it&#x27;s fine; it does work well until it fails.  Just DON&#x27;T pull the cord too far out else you will likely have the same problem as me.</li>
            <li> I love the Infinity Conair hairdryer.  I especially like that it has the ceramic heater since it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to burn my 2 year old great granddaugher when she is in the the bathroom with me.  The Cord Reel works great.</li>
            <li> love this blow dryer - cool with retractable cord and small that fits when you travel! perfect size, weight and great air quality. drys hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Am always surprised when something does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do in the description.  I don&#x27;t like the diffuser but the cord sure sucks in well.</li>
            <li> Have had this for about a year and it is not only still going string, but is still in fantastic shape. This was a worthy purchase</li>
            <li> Well the title tells you my biggest complaint with this item.  Otherwise, it seems to be a sufficient dryer.  It is slightly heavier than my last dryer, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  The cord retracts fine.  I can&#x27;t tell you if the tourmaline ceramic ionic feature really makes a difference, though.  I guess my hair doesn&#x27;t seem terribly static-y, but i live in a humid area, so  it probably wouldn&#x27;t be to begin with.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this dryer worked.  It produced a good stream of nicely heated air and seemd to dry my hair fairly well.  However after 3 months of normal use (used it once a day for about 5/7 days a week).  It suddenly stopped producing hot air.  Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered lots of things on Amazon before, but this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review. I just love this hair dryer! I bought it because I was tired of all the different cords on our bathroom counter- hair dryer, straightener, curler, husband&#x27;s shaver charger, etc. So the retractable feature was what drew me to this product. But after using it, I&#x27;ve found a bunch of added bonus, one of which is how fast it dries my hair. It literally takes only half the time than my previous drier. It&#x27;s also pretty quiet, and the ceramic coil doesn&#x27;t produce the burning smell like older hair driers do. Overall I&#x27;d say this is the one product that really impressed me. [...]</li>
            <li> I like this drying in many ways. It is lightweight, it is powerful, has a great retractable cord and that is a huge plus! I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Speedy shipment, easy ordering, sent just as described, awesome product. My teen aged daughter is loving this hair styler! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very good, more than pleasant with the product.</li>
            <li> what an ingenious idea!!!  great hair dryer!</li>
            <li> My favorite blow dryer finally died, so I was forced to buy a new one. I am so glad I did. This blow dryer dries my super thick, long hair way faster than any other blow dryer. And I think it looks shinier and straighter too. The pink color is pretty, and makes it easy to find in my pile of hair instruments. The retractable cord is so nice, it doesn&#x27;t get tangled in with my 3 curling irons and flat iron. (I wish they had the retractable cord too!). And the cord doesn&#x27;t retract too fast and hit you in the hand. Great, salon-quality blow dryer for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great hair dryer with 1870 watts and easy to clean filter and several heat and speed settings, but the cord is retractable.  You push the button and the cord retracts into the handle and out of the way!  I have a second one in my guest bathroom because everyone who stays at my house (I live at the beach) wants to borrow my hair dryer even if they bring their own!  I never got to use it myself!  My married daughter has asked for only one thing for her birthday...this hair dryer!  Everyone has dropped it on the tile floor and it takes the abuse.  I may purchase a couple more for gifts.  I love it and so does everyone who uses it!</li>
            <li> I like this blow dryer except for several issues.  I have short hair so use the low speed setting mostly. It is fairly quiet unless you turn it on high speed.  Then it&#x27;s loud.  It is much heavier than my old Revlon blow dryer that I finally had to replace.  If you have long, thick hair this would be pretty heavy to use for any length of time.  The diffuser has very hard plastic fingers. Wish they&#x27;d make soft, pliable ones that would be more comfortable to lift and twist hair. The retractable cord is a great feature and works well if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> The moment I pulled the dryer out of the box, I thought - wow, it&#x27;s really heavy comparing to my old dryer.  I love the color, but color is not the main feature to consider when buying a hair dryer, right?  I haven&#x27;t tried it  and afraid I will not be using it, since I am not loving it. Probably, it will go back to the store (It didn&#x27;t come from Amazon).</li>
            <li> This dryer seems to be good enough; I bought it on a recommendation. As far as performance is concerned, it takes longer to dry hair than the 5 year old plain ceramic Conair dryer it was replacing. The retractable cord is a gimmick and is the feature that caused me to return it. If you are to lay the dryer on the side with the button, it will most likely activate causing the cord to retract, and this isn&#x27;t a good thing if the dryer is on. Although, it&#x27;s possible to put the dryer down without having the cord retract if you treat it like it&#x27;s made of delicate glass.</li>
            <li> pros: dries my hair quicker that my T3 (that i spent $180)   cons: seems a little heavier than the T3 and the cord is on the short side because it retracts.    Definitely worth it  ... will never spend big money on a hairdryer again ater using this one!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for over 1 1/2 years now and I love it. My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That&#x27;s the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I&#x27;m styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that&#x27;s for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don&#x27;t remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it&#x27;s common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I&#x27;d mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open &amp; clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan &amp; on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway &#x27;cause  I&#x27;m impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it&#x27;s still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn&#x27;t include this feature because she doesn&#x27;t use it  but I wouldn&#x27;t buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don&#x27;t use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it&#x27;s not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It&#x27;s the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it&#x27;s been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You&#x27;ll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it&#x27;s a great value. In my area Target &amp; Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I&#x27;d buy it again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer a few months back. I started to notice a faint pinkish tint to my countertop where the dryer sits. Over time the tint became darker and darker. This hair dryer works fine, but if you don&#x27;t want your counter stained pink, don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas and I&#x27;ve used it several times since then.  I&#x27;ve had great luck with Conair in the past--this dryer was replacing my old 1875 (which I&#x27;ve used for 8+ years).  This new one is a good dryer, works well, but there are some drawbacks which have resulted in the mediocre score above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1.  Comes with all the extra accessories and has three heat settings and two speed settings, which results in quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;2.  My hair feels lighter and softer--like it does when I leave the salon.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Quiet.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The retractable cord reeler is very nice!  Works well and helps save space in storage/travel.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Fun color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference in shine, as they advertised.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy.  This may be do to the fact that it&#x27;s a better quality/more expensive than the one I&#x27;m used to, but it&#x27;s a bit awkward when in use.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The buttons on not easy to slide when in use.  They are slick and do not stick out much, so it&#x27;s hard to get your fingers make it to work--especially since it&#x27;s heavier than my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two Cons may just be a matter of getting used to it, therefore as time goes by the score may change, but at this point, it gets a three.  I would recommend the dryer, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure it&#x27;s worth the difference in price to the cheaper model (which is lighter and has bigger buttons).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using this dryer now for about 5 months and I like it a lot.  It dries quickly and my hair still feels light and soft. My hair is usually shiny, so it&#x27;s hard to determine if the dryer is making a difference, or if it&#x27;s just my natural hair and good shampoo/conditioner.  I&#x27;m used to the weight of it now, and the buttons are more managable--it just took a little time to adjust to the difference.  Still not sure what the difference would be between this and the cheaper model with the retractable cord, but I like it overall!  The retractable cord is the best part I think.  It stores much better than my last one without the hassle of wrapping the cord.  Sometimes it takes a couple tries to get it to go all the way in, but I don&#x27;t expect it to be perfect every time!  All in all, a good purchase!</li>
            <li> Dryer works wonderfully, I love the wind up cord.  Dryer works quickly, yes a little noisy, but that&#x27;s on high speed.  Perfect dryer in every way.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I had hoped and the filter keeps falling off the back.  Otherwise, works okay.  Retractable cord is nice.</li>
            <li> It made my hair look very smooth and the retractable cord is really great. Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I used a small 10 dollar travel hair dryer for 2 years as my main dryer.  It took soo long to dry my long hair.  With this dryer, it&#x27;s dry in 2 minutes not even! It&#x27;s so strong! But I love being able to set the heat several ways.  Very customizable.  The cord is amazing! It stays inside the dryer and out of my way when it&#x27;s not in use.  I also love the color.  It&#x27;s not as pink as it looks in the picture. It&#x27;s more marroon but, still pretty.  I highly recomend!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Does an excellent job without frizzing the hair.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a powerful hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 3 years now, it still works well, does the job.  There&#x27;s nothing super fancy about it, I just like the color, had decent reviews and I like having a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> heavy. loud. inefficient. frizztastic. burny. i&#x27;ve had it maybe a year and i had to invest in a way better one [[ASIN:B001T0HHDS Babyliss Pro BABNT5548 2000 Watt Ionic Nano Titanium with Integrated Ion Generator Hair Dryer]] already since this one blows so hard. (ha!) well, in truth, it doesn&#x27;t blow very hard either.    but yes, my does it do a great job sucking up that cord! well, for the first 4 months or so anyway.</li>
            <li> Ordering a hair dryer is a hair-raising experience: Hair dryers proliferate. If you want to be scientific, order the top ten and try each one out. Choose the best one and send back the other ten. But that&#x27;;s only if you have nothing else to do with your time. So be smart: Order this one or read the Consumer&#x27;s Guide on hair dryers.</li>
            <li> My old and expensive blowdryer that I received as a birthday present still ran but slowly. Hence, my new replacement. Would have been happy for an orange one but sadly Amazon sent me a yucky fuchsia dryer. At least, it works great and has more options than I thought. Great for someone always on the go!</li>
            <li> No complaints. I have very thick hair and this hairdryer dries it very quickly. The settings are great. The cord is wonderful. The price is awesome.</li>
            <li> great blow dryer ... while it actually worked. had this dryer for less than a year and out of no where it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift right as my old hair dryer crapped out on on me. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and I like the retractable cord. Less mess under my sink cabinet.</li>
            <li> Great for personal use and for one person using daily. It&#x27;s got a more quiet engine but still dries fast and I love the retractable cord. I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren&#x27;t super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life. Of course I&#x27;ve had my dryer for months now and it&#x27;s all working great still, but if you have daughters or someone sharing it and they aren&#x27;t careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually. Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don&#x27;t just yank it. Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button. It keeps from the plugin slapping everything in the area.</li>
            <li> Low airflow on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting, amazing for curly hair! It&#x27;s so hard to find one that&#x27;s not loud and like a jetstream, even on low. Great diffuser attachment, all around the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve had for curls.</li>
            <li> Why did I put off getting a new hair dryer so long? This thing gets the job done in half the time of my old dryer. Love it!</li>
            <li> this was a great christmas present. the haet adjustment and cord extension were great, the gfci was a good addition and the color was cool.</li>
            <li> This Blow dryer is not loud and works well. Conair make good products. it comes in different variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Conair dryers for years, but they share the same issue with other brands......the little mesh screen filter in the back gets easily clogged with dust, lint, and hair....causing the unit to overheat and eventually die.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to keep that little screen clean, including carefully brushing it with a small stiff brush....but then the particulates fall into the motor causing more problems or the lint and stuff just plain won&#x27;t come off the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this new dryer, to replace a Conair model from several years ago.  Conair FINALLY hired someone with some common sense!  I was surprised.....this unit has a REMOVABLE screen filter!  Which means I can take it off and WASH it (being very careful to insure it&#x27;s totally dry before replacing on the unit, of course), extending the life of my unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big selling point in my opinion....removable filter info should be in the description.  Bravo, Conair, well done!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with my purchase. I use it sparingly only for parties or functions because I believe extensive use of styler with style sprays and serums is not good for hair and scalp. I have medium length thin hair and so far it&#x27;s working great for me :)</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! Pretty color and I am absolutely digging the retractable cord! Works perfectly! I read that some folks were not happy with the length of the cord but I found it to be more than long enough for me. Im not sure why you would need it any longer. Very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Alright so this is the second one I&#x27;ve bought in 2-3 years.  I hope they keep making it b/c it&#x27;s awesome.  It isn&#x27;t too loud and is super fast at getting the job done.</li>
            <li> Ok, yes, it is a little bulky, but it&#x27;s because it has tons (and I mean tons!) of power, which you can easily control so you don&#x27;t burn your hair. The cord can be &amp;#34;sucked in&amp;#34; in 2 secs and then just put the whole thing away. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  Everything as described.  Seriously people, hold the plug while you push the button to retract and no one gets hurt!</li>
            <li> I got this product very cheap just because the box was dented but it did not affect the product. I love this dryer and I use the diffuser mainly. It is a great product and you do not have to pay a lot for a good dryer and diffuser. Sometimes it is hard looking for a good diffuser and this is great.</li>
            <li> good hair dryer works well</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! It works really well and I love that the cord retracts up. The dryer might be a little heavier than other dryers out there, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer 4 years ago, and not only is it still in nearly perfect shape, it is the best dryer I have ever owned! The airflow is very powerful, and I love how to cord is reeled inside of the dryer (I HATE chords that get twisted and stuck everywhere). I used my mom&#x27;s hair dryer once and realized how horrible other hair dryers are. This one is truly the best! I also love the defuser piece it comes with. I have a lot of thin, wavy hair, and this dryer dries it quickly!</li>
            <li> My daughter was happy with it. She has heavy hair and she especially liked the cord that coiled.  Red is her color</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for Christmas.  I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won&#x27;t retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70&#x27;s?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you&#x27;d struggle?  You&#x27;d pull it a tiny bit and hope it&#x27;d release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it&#x27;d pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other observations:&lt;br /&gt;- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.&lt;br /&gt;- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  It just frustrates me so much that I had to do it just in the hope that I might save someone else the trouble of experiencing this thing.</li>
            <li> This dries my hair much faster than my old one. I travel quite a bit, so it&#x27;s nice to have the cord retract. No complaints!</li>
            <li> What will happen if my hair dryer goes out and I don&#x27;t have another. I had to keep her away from buying a back up until Christmas. She loves the new one.</li>
            <li> Nice product with a lot of power.  I love how the cord reels up inside of the dryer for storage.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly, not overly noisy, switches are conveniently placed (where they&#x27;re not accidentally moved on/off)  The air filter can be removed for cleaning.  I use all three temperature settings, both fan speeds, and the cool-shot button.</li>
            <li> product of very good quality, impeccable wine .. recommend the truth .. I hope to continue buying ... 100% original product ..</li>
            <li> I liked this hair dryer for a lot of reasons. The retractable cord is nice, but I had to struggle with it numerous times. Unfortunately my unit stopped working after about 15 months after purchasing.</li>
            <li> I like the dryer because of the cord reel feature, I just wish it was not so loud.</li>
            <li> I bought it in February. After using it 2-3 times it caught on fire, burned some of my hair and then literally exploded inside. I got it replaced by Amazon right away who sent me the exact same one. I thought all was fine after almost 2 months of using it. It would get very hot although I would never use it for more than 2 minutes (I have short thin hair so it dries super fast) and never use the HIGH mode (only LOW) as I was too afraid to burn my hair again. But then this morning the inside exploded after using it for less than 1 minute on LOW mode. This product is DANGEROUS!</li>
            <li> So I was at a hotel over the weekend and they had one of these hair dryers.  I thought &amp;#34;Wow!  This thing is quiet and powerful!  I need one.&amp;#34;  Mind you, my old dryer was almost 6-7 years old so it was due time.  For the price I was skeptical but holy moly is this thing awesome!  I&#x27;m one of those &amp;#34;I hate washing my hair b/c it takes forever to dry&amp;#34; kind of gals and this bad boy had it completely dry in a few minutes.  It&#x27;s heavier than my last one but who the heck cares because I don&#x27;t lose hearing after use and I&#x27;m done in a few minutes vs 15 with the previous one.  So yeah... Clearly I recommend this. :)</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!  Powerful, quiet, dries hair quickly, multiple settings give you options.  This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve owned.  The first one lasted for years, so when it was time to replace it, I wanted the exact same one.  Very happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I had a blow dryer just like this one that lasted for 5+ years, it wore out so I replaced it with another just like it in February 2014. The one I purchased this year lasted only 7 months.  I will not purchase another Conair hair care product again.  I think the company should replace it and am going to contact them as soon as I can locate my paperwork.</li>
            <li> Perfect for vanity top storage! I hated the previous mess of a hair dryer cord all over my BR countertop. Only problem was, the distal opening of this hair dryer was bigger than my old hair dryer holder. So, I got creative and purchased a solid marble drinking cup at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond. Problem solved! The solid marble cup is heavy enough to hold down the dryer, it fit perfectly into the interior of the cup, AND eliminated the counter-top clutter of a power cord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this dryer a couple of times but it is great so far. It is actually much nicer looking than in the picture, it is quieter than my last dryer, it dries my hair a bit faster than my old dryer, and as for the temperature hot is hot warm is warm and the cool is truly cool! The only downside is the cord is like 2\\&quot; too short when I am trying to blow dry my daughters hair. But I guess that is more of a personal problem ha ha ha! I would recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> I owned a remington for 5+ years and it quit on me so I purchased this dryer from my local store because it was reasonably priced and it had the reel style cord.  Well I have only owned it for 3 months and it has decided to quit on me there is a short in the cord somewhere and if it is not plugged in just right it will not work.  I had to go out and purchase a new dryer I went with the remington again.</li>
            <li> Nice hairdryer but it is very heavy to hold up for too long.  If you have short fine hair, you can tolerate the weight, but if your hair is thick, mid length to long requiring longer drying times....holding this heavy dryer up for extended periods will make the job more laborious than it needs to be.  I prefer my old Revlon Ionic Pro Sylist.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters each needed a hair dryer.  I ordered this for one of them  She loved It.  She loved the power.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after mine started to burn me after a while!!!  This dryer works very well - it doesn&#x27;t get too hot and it was a nice cool setting.  I only have it 4 stars because I almost wish it blew the hair harder.  When I turn it on, it feel like I have it on a medium setting, instead of high.  But overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  And the color is awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this blowdryer.  I love how I don&#x27;t have to mess around with the cord anymore.  The cord does, however, get stuck sometimes and you have to unwind it and do it over and over again until the cord is properly inserted back into the blowdryer.  I also get this burnt smell from the dryer after using it for 10 minutes.  Still, I like this blowdryer more than the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a second hair dryer for the home.  I like the retractable cord feature, and the heating element is pretty good.  It could use a little more air flow power though.  Since my original hair dryer broke, I am in the market for another one.  (This one still works good, but my older hair dryer broke).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised to see that in about 11 months time, this dryer has gone up in price by 2.5 times what I originally paid.  Back in April 2012, I got this for only $10.  On March 6, 2013 (today), Amazon is now selling it for close to $25!?  Guess I won&#x27;t be getting another one of these...</li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord on this hairdryer and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the color but IMO this hairdryer doesn&#x27;t give off the heat or air pressure of other top blow dryers on the market. I&#x27;m basing this on the fact that it seems to take a very long time for my hair to dry using this machine as compared to other blow dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the winding cord seemed too good to be true. The dryer itself worked great. The cord was too good to be true.  The cord got stuck inside the dryer after a month  of using this. Impossible to use with no cord! This dryer is an epic FAIL.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for a few years now. In all honesty, I bought it because it was pink. This thing gets very hot, and has a lot of power, but with that power comes a lot of noise. The number one thing I like about this hair dryer is that it is very sturdy. I have dropped this thing, abused it, broken pieces off of it, and haven&#x27;t really taken care of it, yet it continues to work flawlessly. Just yesterday the cord stopped retracting without some help, but given the abuse this has had, I don&#x27;t think it is a product flaw. I highly recommend this for teenagers, people who travel a lot, or just anyone who tends to use things more heavily than others.</li>
            <li> This was okay, but it was not as powerful as my Revlon dryerthat it was intended to replace.  It is languishing in the donations at the moment and I am using the old dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is pretty big and heavy.  I expected that for the wattage, weight, and size that it would dry my hair faster than my compact dryer -- no such luck.  I&#x27;m not impressed, and am thinking of getting a smaller dryer instead.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It is a little larger than I thought it would be, though that&#x27;s probably due to the fact that it has room within it to hold the cord. The retractable cord is convenient. The dryer is a bit heavier but heats hotter with more power and is quieter than older hair dryers. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairdryer I have owned. It is a little quieter than other dryers and does a nice job drying my thick hair. I like the different speeds and  different heat settings. The price was also great. I would recommend this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy over the internet without being able to see this hair dryer up close. I compared the price to my local general merchandise discout store and this was half the price, so I decided to purchase through Amazon. I am glad I did. I wish I had gotten this hair dryer sooner! I like that its quiet, yet drys my hair a lot faster than my old hair dryer. If I had one complaint it would be that the cord is a little too short.  Otherwise it has all the features I need.</li>
            <li> The bearing in my wife&#x27;s blow dryer was getting pretty loud (enough to wake me up in the morning - she gets up before me).  Got this one based on the reviews here and elsewhere.  It looks good as far as blow dryers go I guess (I don&#x27;t use them), It&#x27;s actually fairly quiet, considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my wife about the &#x27;frizz&#x27; claim the other day, as I was skeptical about that part of the claim - and she said it really does work (she normally has a &#x27;frizz&#x27; problem).  Not sure if it&#x27;s a placebo affect, but she&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy.  She likes it better than her previous one, so that was already a plus.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for a relative and I did not really like it.  I noticed that the retractable cord does not work exactly right and sometime does not work at all.  I see paint coming off.  I am told this hairdryer is really hot in temperature, perhaps to hot for hair drying.  Did not meet my expectations.  I would not recommend dryer to a friend or relative... Prompt delivery.  R. Dawson</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great hair dryer for the price. The cord winds into the dryer awesome feature. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Really works good. Can&#x27;t be beat for the price.  Time will tell how well it holds up, but it seems to be well made so I expect to have and use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product! Not to heavy or loud which in my house is a huge plus. Love the fact that it has a cord reel inside. Makes putting it up look nice &amp; organized</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer.  My other one I had had for years and was shorting out.  This was a perfect replacement and was affordable too.</li>
            <li> I do not think it&#x27;s better than the cheap revlon blow dryer. In the way that it leaves your hair and the fact that revlon feels lighter to hold. Cord is very short. But I got my conair real cheap so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. It gets the job done really fast however the only qualm I have is that the cord is only three foot long.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of a retractable cord, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing about this dryer.  It is big and heavy, but the worst part is that it vibrates like crazy - very uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m being honest, I expected a little more from this blow dryer. I used to have a Conair ionic blow dryer from Costco and it made my hair so silky smooth. I don&#x27;t know anything about Tourmaline Blow Driers, but I thought it was supposed to be like ionic? Well, my hair is in one big poof after I use this blow dryer. Thank God for flat irons. So it does the job drying my hair, but not so eloquently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: Good amount of heat and blow, a few settings to switch it up. The main plus... I just love this retractable cord. It really was the reason I purchased this product over others. Works well. No tangles or hold ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could go back in time and change my order I probably would, but this blow drier was cheap, cute, and does it&#x27;s main purpose, so I&#x27;ll keep it for a while.</li>
            <li> The wife had some specific requests for the new hairdryer she wanted.  1) girly color, 2) retractable cord, 3) high power.  This had the reviews to support it and the criteria to meet these needs.  It has delivered.  She feels it dries her hair significantly faster than her prior hairdryer which was allegedly the same wattage.  If that&#x27;s all true, this saves money too.</li>
            <li> I have owned about 9 hair dryers in the last 5 years, and this is easily the best of them all. I had the predecessor to this dryer, and it was incredibly heavy. This one is a lot lighter, and I feel like the air moves faster. The tourmaline makes my hair less frizzy than other dryers too.</li>
            <li> If you have ten hairs trying to do the work of thousands, as I do, this baby is not for you.Not as much OOMPH as the one I lost, that was about ten years old, on a trip somewhere, even though this supposedly has the same power and is the same brand. Also, why did it only come in hot pink?! My least favorite color.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful dryer and works for me.  It drys my hair quickly.  This product arrived fast, too.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this blow dryer twice but it is very powerful. It has not dried out my hair and it is quick. I love the fact that this blow dryer has a retractable cord. It is very convenient for a college student like me and it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was too heavy, and, although it claims 1875 watt, it was neither as strong or hot as the ION I had been using</li>
            <li> love the retractable cord. haven&#x27;t had a problem with it yet.</li>
            <li> Was happy with everything about hair dryer. Color is great, retractable cord, heat settings, smooths hair! So glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is very efficient. The retractable cords are convenient and I have no malfunctioning problems at all. The colour is bright and pretty. I think I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I picked this out because of the cord-keeper design, and it replaced my functioning 1875 watt non-tourmaline dryer. Unless you really want a cord-keeper dryer or have already chosen the ~$30 price point, I might look around more before settling on this one. However, it does the job and I&#x27;m going to keep it. Personally, I wish I hadn&#x27;t been so desperate and had spent a little more time looking, but I&#x27;m also willing to spend a little (or a lot) more money for something I won&#x27;t want to replace later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* cord-keeper - no tangled cords!&lt;br /&gt;* good wattage - fast dry&lt;br /&gt;* tourmaline does soften hair - noticeable, but subtle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* heavy - I like to hold the dryer vertically above my head and it&#x27;s significantly heavier than a non-tourmaline.&lt;br /&gt;* large - this is above average in size, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some low-star reviewers mentioned the finish coming off on their hands, and I&#x27;d just like to clarify that is a random flaw in their dryers. I have porcelain skin and use this on the highest setting for about 20-30 minutes and have not seen any finish come off - so if you&#x27;re worried about that, it&#x27;s not the norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this being a tourmaline dryer, it&#x27;s an upgrade from non-tourmaline; the technology used dries the water on your hair and you should see less heat damage. In my perception, it does not dry any faster than a non-tourmaline at the same wattage.</li>
            <li> Love the power of this hairdryer, plus the retractable cord and it&#x27;s QUIET!! Can&#x27;t think of anything more you could want.</li>
            <li> i so love this dryer. it&#x27;s working amazingly with my fine hair and it makes it shiny and style it very good. another thing that i like is the way the plug inserts inside the tool.. Very genius and am sooo happy with it. ilove conair in general, so afforble and quality beyond expected everytime</li>
            <li> that has held up well with weekly use on waist length hair. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the reel up cord makes for really neat storage.</li>
            <li> perfect its light and has all the right settings and the cord retracts so no wrapping it around the handle</li>
            <li> The power level is not great and the retraction takes some repetition to get it to fully retract. In fact, most times I have to pull all the way out and hold the cord taught while it retracts in ordernto get it to fully retract. My last hair dryer broke because the cord was bet at the entry to the dryer too many times and shorted out. That is why I got the retractible one.If you do not need retraction, I recommend getting a standard cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 9 months after purchase, the dryer just stopped working. I have never had one do this in such a short period of time and there has been no change in the use of a hairdryer for me. I had to purchase a new one - and it was not this model!!</li>
            <li> I didin&#x27;t purchase this from amazon however this is the weakest, worst dryer I have ever used.  I have owed several in my life as I have very long hair.  This takes about 25 minutes to dry my hair fully whereas other dryers I have owned previously it took maybe 10 minutes.  One of the reason I wanted to try it was for the retractable cord which unfortunately does not work!!!  I pulled it out the first time I used it and it would only retract about 50% of the way with the rest of the cord hanging like other dryers without retractable cords.  I would have to advise to avoid this dryer like the plague.  It isn&#x27;t even that cheap for what you get so I can&#x27;t see why someone would own this.  I&#x27;m def going back to babyliss.  Sorry conair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who leaves a twisted cable mess attached to any hairdryer she has ever used.  This one stores a lot easier with the cable stored and it seems that the cord is not twisting.  She likes the dryer too.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference the first time I dried my long hair with this dryer.  The dryer does not get as hot as my other Ionic Dryer but it works much faster.  I would say it takes half the amount of time to dry my hair with this dryer - and my hair feels terrific (full of volume and very silky). This is the best dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased because I dropped my other one and broke it. This hair dryer seriously does make my hair smoother, and when you use the concentrating attachment, it really works!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  I tried someone&#x27;s dryer like this and fell in love with it so had to buy my own.  I love the reel cord but also the fast drying time.</li>
            <li> Works great @ just the right temp.  Hair never looked better with just a brush and dry.  Love the retractable cord!  Definitely the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever had and at a great price to boot!</li>
            <li> I have purchased both, this Conair model 223NP and the Andis model 81290 hair dryer. The Andis is more feature packed (see my separate review). The Conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned including the Andis model. I used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference, the Conair was only 76db vs. 83db from the Andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers. The Conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair. There are 2 heat settings (low &amp; high) and a cool setting. The cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button (no heat at all). The air intake on the back is a 1-3/4 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen. The opening is a bit small when compared to the Andis model which is larger at 2-3/8 inches and has side air intakes as well. This begs the question of reliability of the Conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the Conair model, this could cause more heat build up of the motor. Only time will tell. The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility. The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models. Air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the Conair and 198 degrees on the Andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached, all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory. The retractable cord is nice and measures 5 feet + 3 inches with 5-1/2 inches that does not retract into the handle. The retracter is a bit stronger than the Andis model but it will still require you to help feed the cord all the way to its end. The dryer does come with a 3 year warranty but the Andis model comes with a generous 5 year warranty. Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.  My favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design &amp; feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design &amp; feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I just got me new blow dryer and I LOVE it. It is so quite and it dry&#x27;s my hair in half the time of my old one, I also love that the cord winds right up.</li>
            <li> The heat is great. works great.  It isn&#x27;t too heavy. Love Conair brand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why no 5*****. Well first it doesnt have a hook to hang it :(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Althougt I love the retractable cord, is toooo short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the highest setting, the temperature does not get that hot. So not for long hair</li>
            <li> I got this blow dryer because I wanted to get one which had ionic and tourmaline technology so that my hair would dry faster and be a lot smoother. My curls are slightly straightened when I use this which is great for me! My hair looks a lot shiner and feels a bit stronger than before.&lt;br /&gt; I also liked that fact that it had various heat settings. The retractable cord and red color was a nice feature as well. What I don&#x27;t like about this dryer though is that it seems to get slight paint chips on the side :/</li>
            <li> I do like this drier.  This is the third one that I have bought, so I guess that says that they don&#x27;t last forever but that has just been my experience with hair dryers in this price range.  I do love the retractable cord, that is part of the reason I keep buying this model.  I also like the multiple temperature and speed settings.  It seems to dry well for my hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this hair dryer is that the cord sometimes has trouble retracting. But it dries my hair super fast. It&#x27;s definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> She needed a new one, so I surprised her with this one. She absolutely loves it. Its the only thing she uses.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.  This dryer really gets the job done, not only does it dry your hair but it straightens my natural locks</li>
            <li> Cord is a little short....but I love the way it works.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer. I had one just like this for many years and it finally broke.  I picked up a new dryer at the drug store and it was horrible, jet engine loud but not much air blowing power to back it up.  So I bought another one at a different store. Same basic issue. Finally, in frustration, I decided to look for the exact dryer I used to have and there it was. When it arrived I plugged it and turned it on and it was like coming home. It&#x27;s not terribly loud (at least compared to the other two I tried), the buttons are such that you don&#x27;t keep accidentally turning them off and on as you grip the handle, and it has good drying power.  The one strange thing was that even though this picture is clearly the dryer I had, the one I got was exactly the same but orange instead of burgundy. Regardless, it&#x27;s a great blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Very nice hairdryer. She&#x27;s been using it a year now with no issues at all. If it lasts that long with her you know it&#x27;s built to take some punishment. Great deal. Will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked fine.. for 4 months (only used a few ttimes per week) Expected more life. Definitely will not buy again!</li>
            <li> Love it, good service</li>
            <li> This is my first hair dryer purchase in many years because I had curly hair, which I am now straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: dries hair quickly (I was using it on high for the first few weeks, but today I set the temperature to medium and my hair still dried fairly quickly), cute color, retractable cord, quick \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button, price&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it seemed a bit heavy on the first day, but I got over that quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After months of research on Tourmaline, Ionic, Ceramic hairdryers... I wanted the Revlon RV544blu as it came in the nicest teal color.... it was listed at a little over $20 on Amazon at Christmas, but by the time I tried to order they were sold out every where I looked, so again I searched ... Then I found this Conair 223XR in bright pink, and it had all three attributes, ionic, ceramic interior, and tourmaline! It even came with a retractable cord, so I thought it would be perfect. Having used it now for several weeks, I found that it is light enough not to tire my arms, and it has the three temp settings including cool, along with the cool shot! I never thought of this, but it is my favorite feature! Being able to cool off my hair after it is dry is the best thing about it (except maybe the great color of it!  The only downside I have found is that with the retractable cord that means it comes with a shorter cord. One of the reviews I had seen mentioned 5 feet so I thought that would be alright, but mine has only about 4 feet of cord, so I use an extension cord with it so I can sit wherever I want when I dry my hair; otherwise it is perfect and I plan on buying it as gifts for some of my family/friends. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to upgrade or replace an old hair dryer!</li>
            <li> i love this blowdryer...it&#x27;s pink &amp; i especially love the retractable cord.  I can throw it under the sink cabinet without having a whole mess of cord.  I love that the 3 temperature settings.  I use warm and cold and my hair has become a lot healthier! I will definitely be repurchasing when this one dies!</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for about a year now and it has held up great, has great power and is hot enough.  I have medium length &amp; thick hair just past my shoulders and my hair will dry completely with this dryer in 7 minutes.  My only complaint is that the plug is really loose to the wall so I have to plug it into an adapter I have otherwise it will literally fall out of the wall plug.  Also it is very short cord even when pulled out all of the way.  Sometimes when trying to retract the cord it gets stuck and wont go in all of the way so I have to keep pulling it in and out to try to get it to reel up all the way.  When it does this it makes me just want to wrap the cord around the dryer negating the whole idea of the reel.  Overall its been a good dryer though and am glad I have it and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a hair dryer for a reasonable price. This item was just what we were looking for with a great price and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Kind of heavy, cord sometimes doesn&#x27;t roll up all the way, not very powerful but my hair is soft when using it.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for the price.  High wattage for fast drying.  The retractable power cord is a very nice design element.  No winding the cord around the handle.  Red color is very pretty also.  I&#x27;ve owned several Conair hairdryers and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this hairdryer.  It delivers what it promises and the fact that you push a button and the cord retracts INSIDE the handle is a definite plus for neat storage!</li>
            <li> Good power, good weight, good diffuser, and I like the retractable cord feature, too. Would recommend this dryer without hesitation.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and dries hair quickly, Love the rewind feature and that the filter can be cleaned easily.  Also the Cool button sets hair into place after styling hair.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me ten years and passed down to my son still working. I really love the retractable cord, prevents clutter.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy. the price was much better than I expected and the quality is top notch. my wife absolutely loves this!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great airflow. I bought one a few years back. Still working.&lt;br /&gt;A little big for travel. However I bought another for the guest bath.&lt;br /&gt;Everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted in a hair blower.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> This product works really good and the price is reasonable. I strongly recommanded.&lt;br /&gt;I will say this might be the best choice for product in this price range.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer, doesn&#x27;t turn your hair into straw, and I love that it has a medium heat setting, instead of the usual hot and cool.  The cord is retractable and their is a removable filter at the end to clean out all the dust that accumulates in these things.  Very good design!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for the diffuser option. I have thick, coily, natural, African-American hair and I avoid putting a lot of heat on my hair repeatedly. Avoiding heat, however, can prove to be difficult when living in the Mid-Atlantic area during the winter. Unless, of course, you welcome a case of pneumonia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool setting paired with the diffuser on this hair dryer solved my issue. I am not forced to subject my tresses to high heat, yet, I can dry my hair within about a half an hour vs. the air drying time of approximately 24 hours. (Yes, it takes that long for my natural hair to air dry with product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has held up well and the retractable cord is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I was able to purchase such a nice dryer for such an economical price! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I saw this hair dryer on Amazon.  I was looking for one with a retractable cord, and this one had the highest reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing it from Walmart instead.  It cost more there, but I had a gift card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product.  The cord retracts, quickly and easily.  I recommend pulling the cord all the way out before you use it.  You can adjust both the heat and the fan.  I have short hair that is thick and on high heat and high fan I am able to dry my hair in under 4 minutes.  It leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth, not dried out feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bit heavier in weight than my last (crappy) dryer, but I would expect that from a salon quality dryer.</li>
            <li> A replacement for another Conair, this one is the best. There are cheaper models, but this one is very well made and we have every reason to expect the longevity other reviewers have noted. I use the low setting (I used to use high on my old one) and it works beautifully and is much quieter. The cord retractor is great; at first I expected this to be just a marketing gimmick, but now I wouldn&#x27;t buy a dryer without one. Very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first, and then untangle it whenever you take it out. We ended up buying two of these to prevent my daughter from swiping it and having to search. Nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced. This is not a cheap throw-away, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about 2 years. I have to say, it was good for the price. It dries my thick shoulder length hair in about 12 minutes (on a good day). The only downsides I have are it gives my hair a really awkward texture, like too fluffy, and it smells HORRIBLE. I don&#x27;t know why, because I&#x27;ve cleaned the fan and everything, but it smells like burning hair all the time. I would recommend this product, though.</li>
            <li> This is one efficient dryer, and it seems to do a great job in reducing frizz in my curly hair. I use it with the diffuser (haven&#x27;t attempted a straight styling with it yet) and I get great results even on the high-hot setting. Love the the cord retracts for easy storage, too. Wrapping a cord around the handle every time gets old pretty fast when you&#x27;re using a dryer every day.</li>
            <li> No more tangled cord! Love this dryer. It is also pretty quiet for it&#x27;s high wattage. I recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Hot setting should be changed to almost warm. Warm setting should be renamed cool. Same for blower settings. By the time this generates heat and air your hair will already be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After 60 days it has started making a grinding noise for about 15-20 seconds when first turned on. What next sparks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into the trash.</li>
            <li> Simply put this is THE best hair dryer I have ever owned. Love the speeds and the ease of use, it&#x27;s not heavy to hold</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dries your hair quickly and it&#x27;s not too loud.  This is the second one that I&#x27;ve bought.  The first one lasted about 6 years and then the cord wore out and was exposing bare wires but the motor never wore out.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Very sturdily built. The spring loaded wind-up cord works well and has a powerful motor. I gave it a 4 Star rating for two reasons. 1) I think it&#x27;s kind of heavy and 2) the slide switches are difficult to operate on the skinny handle. They may want to consider push buttons that lock and unlock as well as using some light weight manufacturing materials or new style servo on the next model. Yeah.... Chinese,  Right?&lt;br /&gt;After using this hair dryer that I purchased on Nov 23 2013 as it turns our I was correct in my assessment of the cheap switches. They failed today August 27, 2017. You may argue that just south of 4 years is plenty for a hair dryer, I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. Many other hair dryer manufacture&#x27;s produce a product that lasts twice as long. You be the judge..........</li>
            <li> bought as a gift for daughter, this is what she wanted, model and style. she&#x27;s 30 and knows what she wants.</li>
            <li> I got so frustrated with my old hair dryer - because the cord constantly stayed a mess.  I found this retractable cord dryer.  The reviews were good on the dryer itself, but I really just wanted the retractable cord.  Well, I got a wonderful retractable cord and a great blow dryer!  This one is considerably quieter than my old dryer, too.  Win win.</li>
            <li> My old blow dryer was starting to spark (eek!) and leaving my hair frizzy each day. This blow dryer has been WONDERFUL though and leaves my hair smooth every day. I don&#x27;t even need my straightening iron anymore!!</li>
            <li> Very good dryer for the price. I like the high speed without having to use high heat. Retractable cord is great.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for and the price was great! Works great and cut my drying time believe it or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hair dryer, but the lower control buttoms -- which I use the most -- are impossible to handle, at least for my fingers.  I put the plug in the socket &amp; pull it out when I&#x27;m done.  I cannot use the handle control to turn it off.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> good controls for both heat and air pressure.  Great for using on low air/hi heat to spiff up my hair instead of doing a full blowout.  one of the better conair products i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord makes it super easy to travel with this lightweight hair dryer, and the amount of heat, power and airflow you get from it is perfect for coaxing my wavy hair to curls when I use the diffuser. And the nice bright fuschia color is fun. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for in a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> When this hairdryer came i was super excited. I bought to replace the one i had bought back in high school (longer ago than I care to remember).  It works well, nothing special.  It&#x27;s nice that the cord can be stored inside the dryer istelf, but leaves the plug portion just hanging out awkwardly so it makes it kind of hard to store in a regular sized vanity drawer. It comes with two attachments which i use and find helpful when drying my hair for special occasions.  it&#x27;s okay, probably would have gone with one that was a little bit cheaper if i had to do it over again.</li>
            <li> got this for my daughter who is away in college. she broke her other dryer and needed a new one since she was tired of borrowing roommates. was able to order this and have it shipped directly to her. she was thrilled. said the retractable cord is perfect for storage in a tiny dorm room. said it is very powerful and dries her hair fast and leaves it shiny. she also likes the color since it coordinates with her dorm decor.  i like the fact i could ship it right to her and that she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and in order to dry it without frying it, I like to use a diffuser, a low fan setting and a mid heat setting.  This hair dryer claims to have all of that, but the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; heat setting is so cool that I have to use &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; if I ever want my hair to actually dry.  The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting is what it claims to be and can be downright scalp scalding.  I have no problem with the hot setting being that hot, I appreciate it when I&#x27;m straightening my hair, but the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting is insufficient for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the hair dryer is great, the attachments work well (the condenser doesn&#x27;t spin like I&#x27;ve had happen on other hair dryers) the retractable cord doesn&#x27;t have any problems, the air intake never sucks my long hair in and the color is even a nice midway point between red and pink.</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;s a little heavy and large/ but it works beautifully. It&#x27;s well priced. Meets all my requirements for a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Received promptly.  Dries my hairs so much quicker than my previous drier and leaves it feeling smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Priced right. Cord Reel is a little bulky. works a bit too well and best to hold button with one hand and guide the cords back with the other as it snaps back quickly. Has 3 setting and hot and cool.  All you need to do well job.  As bit large for travel so I will by a smaller one if I need to, although all the hotels we go to have a hair drier.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a good value for the price.  I purchased this because the cord was retractable and it is easier to pack when traveling.  It is light weight, which is a plus as I have thick long hair as my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, gets your hair dry in no time and the cord  gets store in the same dryer, my daughter loves it, thanks a lot!!</li>
            <li> Love the retractable cord and the ease of storage. This is a very stylish dryer and dries my hair really fast leaving it softer because of the Ion.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my SO... secretly because his previous dryer was so loud! Thankfully this one is much quieter and he digs the retractable cord. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t hot pink!</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my daughter she loved it &amp; is getting alot of use out of it!  delivered super fast &amp; great price Thanks</li>
            <li> I am really picky about hair dryers since I have long very think hair. I used the new dryer this morning and my hair dried quick and frizz free. It usually takes me 45 minutes to blow dry my hair and it only took 25 minutes. SO HAPPY!! I just got it, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> The one major downside to this drier is that it vibrates in my hand which I don&#x27;t like. It does dry my hair very fast and the cord keeper works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I dont usually dry my hair everyday, and ive used it not more than 6 months (bought it end of 2012) and now i cant switch it on already. i hate it so so so so so much, such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer, helps me when styling my hair. Comes with 2 connectors for styling and love using them both. Great product for the value and I like the color. The retractable cord is a big plus too.</li>
            <li> We have had numerous hair dryers, this is def. one of the best. Forceful air and the cord retractor has worked great so far. Very satisfied, one note is while pushing the retract cord button, hold the cord as it goes in so it doesnt whip around.</li>
            <li> Good price on this dryer with the excellent option of a built in cord reel.  We will see how long that holds up.  Couple of issues I disliked about this product was the weight seems a bit heavy, wish it was a bit quieter, and also doesn&#x27;t seem like the air blows very hot.  Seems to take longer to dry my hair compared to my older model.</li>
            <li> Great item. It does not get too hot and does not cause my hair does not get frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer! It&#x27;s small, quiet, and quick to dry your hair! I haven&#x27;t really used hairdryers in the past so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it with but when I used my sister&#x27;s for the first time, I knew I had to have one of my own! I also give it points for being sturdy since I&#x27;m a super clumsy person and have dropped it on the floor a ridiculous amount of times without any resulting damage.</li>
            <li> Works great and I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> We have long thick hair in this family, and it&#x27;s way too weak to do the job without taking forever. So,  I ordered the  Babyliss Pro Hair Dryer Ceramix Xtreme Pink Edition - BABBPK2000, and it dries our hair in 2 or 3 minutes completely.  We&#x27;ll put this one in our travel bag and use it when we travel.  It would be fine for someone with short hair, or thin hair that doesn&#x27;t take too much time to dry.  It&#x27;s nice and quiet, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer because of the retractable cord. This feature is great! But... The dryer itself has really helped my hair. With three temperature settings and two speeds, I&#x27;ve been able to minimize heat damage without increasing drying time. Love it!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> There are many models that have the same number of speed and temperature settings, so the only reason I chose this model over others was the retractable cord,  The instructions tell you to be careful with it and to never over extend the cord. I babied this thing, but the retractable cord stopped functioning after several months. The high speed setting is equal to the medium speed on my old hairdryer. It dries my hair, but plenty of other cheaper models would do that just as well.</li>
            <li> I had to find this model on Amazon because my local Targets weren&#x27;t selling this model anymore. My puppy chewed up my first one, and bought another type at Target, but it was SO loud, and I took it back. I&#x27;m happy that I found this for sale on Amazon because it&#x27;s quiet-as far as blow dryers go- and I love the retractable cord. As long as they make this particular model, that will be my first choice if something happens to my new one.</li>
            <li> Nice, easy, portable hand dryer that is available in fun colors.  I use this product with an attachable hood dryer to deep condition my hair.  Very convenient and the retractable cord makes it easy to store without the hassle of dealing with a messy cord.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is pretty impressive! I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and am still happy with it. It dries my hair fast and leaves it smooth. It is actually better than my old $120 blow dryer! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re like me with tons of dry, course hair (enough for two people) this is a great little hairdryer.  I prefer the hurricane effect as I don&#x27;t have 30 minutes to dry my hair but that&#x27;s just me.  Nothing against the dryer, it works great.</li>
            <li> Have had this for almost 3 years now without any problems.. That&#x27;s impressive for hai dryers and hair straighteners anymore</li>
            <li> I tried it once and it came on with full power and then about 2 minutes in, the drying power was cut in half. There was nothing I could do to get it to come back on with full power. The highest setting was now merely a trickle of air. No idea what happened, but not going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this blow dryer.  The only negative is to say this is my 2nd one.  My first one stopped working after about a year and a half.  No idea why.  However, this is the BEST blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the retractable cord.  It&#x27;s such a great convenience and the main reason I bought it in the first place.  The bonus is that it actually dries really fast and leaves hair looking much smoother than my previous dryer.  I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if not for having to replace in such a short time.  Totally worth it for the price and quality, though.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, Pros: heats well, powerful, quick, retractable cord. Cons: short cord, heavy. Overall: I would buy again but it&#x27;s not the BEST for the price.</li>
            <li> Cord is a little short but I&#x27;d easily give up a long cord for the convenience of it being retractable. May think it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair quickly due to the air volume being pushed out but it does dry efficiently. I have long and thick hair and have no issues. But, I don&#x27;t dry my hair when it&#x27;s sopping wet - it&#x27;s the last thing I do when I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li> I used a similar dryer while on vacation and was amazed at the difference it made when styling my hair.  I like the retractable cord and multiple settings.  For its size, it&#x27;s not all that heavy and the color is very stylish.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer and have recommended it to others who also liked it.  It&#x27;s not too loud, the heat settings are just right and it&#x27;s not super heavy.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that with the first one I bought, I retracted the cord everyday after using it.  Eventually it started having electrical problems due to a loose wire or something that was caused by pulling out the cord everyday.  So I bought another one and just don&#x27;t retract the cord and it&#x27;s perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great because of a few key features: 1- the retractable cord. ok ok not so special. 2- it has 3 heat settings, 3 levels of blowing and a cooling button for this price thats unheard of. Its so sturdy and nice and a cool metallic color too. Not loving the neon barbie pink but hey its a great dryer for cheap. And its got some nice attachments too like a huge SERIOUS diffuser !</li>
            <li> Reel slowly stops working over time.  6 months now since purchase and most of the cord will not retract.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer a month or so ago. So far, I like it a lot. It dries my hair fast and I have really thick hair. My hair is left silky and straight. It does get a little hot, but not too hot. Id recommend it to anyone. It is a great price too.</li>
            <li> Great  hair Dryer, very powerful and durable. This has fallen a couple of times in the bathroom and it&#x27;s still in one piece! I love it! The price was also a great deal?</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and someone mentioned the cord is too short.  I agree.  It&#x27;s doable but I have to watch that I don&#x27;t turn around or move too far from the outlet.  Hair dryer is much heavier than my older model - I believe it&#x27;s because of the reel inside the dryer for the cord.  The cord hiding in the hair dryer seems like a waste - I prefer the lighter model.  My sister has the same one and after a while the button to reel the cord in broke.</li>
            <li> Loved this hair dryer, but just after a year of use, it just stopped working. Was really bummed!</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair dryer and dries my hair really quickly.  The cord retractor worked once then quit working.  I was going to return it, but it was too much of a hassle and I didn&#x27;t want to pay the return shipping, so I just kept it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I had this one for ~6 years before it finally gave out. I immediately replaced it with the same product. It&#x27;s affordable, lasts and works great!</li>
            <li> It works great.  Live the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> I bought this especially for my curly hair because I needed a dryer with a diffuser. After using it for a while the diffuser has melted and is deformed completely. Apparently the diffuser is not made to last through the levels of heat that the dryer produces !!!! This is rediculous !</li>
            <li> Loud like most hair dryers. I like the temperature setting and retractable cord. Air flow very good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair dryer for about 9 months now and have been really happy with it. It is not overly heavy and comes with a smaller diffuser. I find it a lot easier to use without a giant diffuser on the end. My just past the shoulders, curly hair is dry in minutes, the retractable cord is very handy (just hang onto it and do a controlled retract or you will smack your hand badly) and not gonna lie, love the pink dryer in the morning.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is the best I have ever used, and I hope that they keep on making it!  It is SUPER quiet, has plenty of power, has a removable and cleanable inlet filter, and has a great retractable cord feature.  FYI - my typical life based on every day usage is two years.</li>
            <li> I got a great deal on this blow dryer and it wasn&#x27;t even worth it at a great price.  It&#x27;s way too heavy and not from solid construction.  It&#x27;s too loud and yeah, it blows a lot of air, but while it was blowing it was doing nothing for my frizz factor.  I think you could get a worse blow dryer than this, at the current price, but I just felt like it was crap.  It&#x27;s not worth a penny over $9.99 in my opinion.  The retractable cord is a nice feature, but I think it probably has something to do with the heaviness of the blow dryer and that nice feature doesn&#x27;t compensate for a very sore arm after just 10 minutes of blow drying.  Just say no to this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a year ago and it started as a great dryer. The retractable cord is convenient, but after a year the heat has now been blown. It normally takes me around 20 minutes total to dry my hair, but with this dryer it takes me around 40 minutes. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It works very well, the three temperatures and speeds give you a good range of options depending on what you intend to do on your hair. The difusor has a good size and it&#x27;s a great option for curly hair. I just didn&#x27;t see a big result in reducing frizz, which can be hair dependent...</li>
            <li> Another great product. You have many settings available to you and the retractable cord is a real bonus. I hang my blow dryer in a over the door hair product caddy,  and it&#x27;s much easier to close the cabinet door now without a cord getting in the way. I have very fine, short hair and this dryer fluffed it up nicely and it&#x27;s very fast.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great.  It compares with a $100+ dryer for a fraction of the cost.  I was so excited to find this on Amazon, as it&#x27;s so much cheaper than at Ulta.  Really, really great device, and the attachments only add to that.</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair You Reel dryer I&#x27;ve purchased. I bought one for myself and a year later for my daughter. It dries my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s good quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer for Christmas, and I love it! The retractable cord is perfect for the limited space of my bathroom, The attachments work really well and my hair dries quickly. The only &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my old dryer, but this may actually be better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer for it&#x27;s light weight, and for the fact that it&#x27;s not so NOISY! Buy it today!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with this hairdryer. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5/5 because I&#x27;m not quite raving--it didn&#x27;t transform my hair, like some people claimed, or dramatically reduce my drying time, but for the price, this hairdryer is a great value and I think I&#x27;ll be using mine for quite some time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this hairdryer for about a month now. Here are my impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t get as hot, but dries my hair in about the same amount of time as my old (non-ceramic, non-ionic) hairdryer (if anything, a little faster). Lower heat is less damaging to my hair, so since this dryer still gets it done just as quickly, that&#x27;s a good thing in my book!&lt;br /&gt;- Has three heat settings and two intensity settings, allowing for lots of control.&lt;br /&gt;- Has a cold shot button that functions well.&lt;br /&gt;- Retractable cord is very convenient for traveling and storage.&lt;br /&gt;- Design is sleek and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the cord were just a little longer. Maybe I&#x27;m asking for too much, but this one seems a little shorter than my last, and I find myself pulling on it fairly often.&lt;br /&gt;- The hairdryer is a bit heavy, but nothing unmanageable. Get that arm workout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the diffuser or concentrator attachments, so I can&#x27;t give an accurate review of those. But just out of the box and unmodified, this dryer has proved to be a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this product mainly because of the brand name, I&#x27;ve owned Conair in the past, and the features. I have thick curly hair so I use the product on low with the diffuser. After only 5 uses the dryer would turn off, and then back on. This happens several times during use as if it has a short or a bad connection inside the dryer. &#x3D;( Now I&#x27;ll have to pay postage to send it to the CONAIR service dept....I think I&#x27;ll just buy another dryer and skip the hassle.</li>
            <li> I replaced my 13-year old Conair hair dryer with this one.  I love it!  The efficiency cuts my dry time probably in half.  The dryer is HEAVY, but it is not a problem for me.  I would also be careful of the retractable cord - it can fly all over the place and hit you or something else.  I have had the dryer for several months now, and so far no problems mechanically.  I&#x27;m hoping it will last as long as my last one!</li>
            <li> I really liked the the cord on it, I don&#x27;t have to wrap it around the hair dryer just push the button and it slides back up. I also liked the different settings on it as well.  I am really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not to hot on hot setting&lt;br /&gt;Retractable cord works great. Keeps clutter off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None really to mention..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 05/06/2013&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed when I use the blow dryer now that there some some air escaping from the slider controls on the handle. This is nothing to really change how I use the blow dryer, but this should probably not happen.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Infiniti by Conair model for several years, but was looking to upgrade it to something lighter with a retractable cord, which is exactly what this is. I have medium-long hair, and this dries it in about half the time of my old one. The cord sometimes doesn&#x27;t go in all the way, I have to pull it back out a bit and press the button again, but this really hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me, and my vanity drawer is much neater now.</li>
            <li> Item ok - cord does not always retract as it is suppose to...but dryer works fine!</li>
            <li> This is a much better hair dryer that I have ever used.  It is light, and has several options to use.  Love the retractable cord.  Stores easily!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great.  One of my biggest gripes about hairdryers is when they blow too much air and this one does not do that. I love that the cord is retractable, I would just prefer if there were a loop or some other way to hang it and have it out of the way in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer. It does a great job at drying your hair quickly and yet does not seem to dry out your hair. I love the happy hot pink color and especially like the retractible cord so I can put my hairdryer in a drawer when I am finished. It arrived quickly and was appropriately packaged.</li>
            <li> Owned it less than a year, it broke! For no reason! Try to press reset button, still nothing, it is very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long and thick... mid back length.  This blow dryer can have y hair from damp to dry in less than 10 minutes!  AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I kept this dryer because I threw the box away but it is not very powerful so takes a long time to dry my hair. It is lightweight which is good but not as good as my old but loud Baby Bliss which I was trying to replace.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it would dry my long hair faster than my old school, non-ceramic blow dryer. It may have shaved a minute off of drying time. Hey, I can use a minute to spare, but it&#x27;s still not a miracle worker as you might be led to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature that is helpful is the retractable cord, when it works. 25% of the time it doesn&#x27;t retract the whole way and leaves 6 inches of cord exposed. After a few times of unraveling and retracting, it eventually retracts all the way.</li>
            <li> I ordered for this hair dryer because of the advantages i saw.I have had a revlon dryer i had used for a long time and i guess i was due for a change.&lt;br /&gt;I really looked out for one very good and with very advanced settings.I was able to get this dryer down to Africa,from the U.S.However,on receiving Infiniti Conair dryer;i was so anxious to use it.Like my custom has always been, i read the manual and was so suprised it was a 125volts!I was so dissappointed...i have not been able to use the product since i received it.&lt;br /&gt;My question is how do i use the product since my country has a voltage of 220volts.I would really love to.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my last Conair blow dryer pooped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: dries quickly, silky, smooth hair&lt;br /&gt;Con: none yet</li>
            <li> I love the retracting cord. Such a space saver and not have to worry about the cord falling into any bowls. I love the settings on this and the attachments although I don&#x27;t know how to use them. I would recommend for people to keep the instructions for the attachments but I did not. The color is really stylish. This is perfect for my long, thick hair. It is such a chore normally to blow dry my crazy hair but not with this dryer.</li>
            <li> This thing pumps out hot air pretty much instantaneously. Great for people with no patience. It might be nice if it had more oomph on the high setting, but my girlfriend says the same thing so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t throw stones.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews but am very happy to have this product. I had been using a traveling blow dryer for almost ten years and did not realize there was a difference in dryers until I asked my therapist/hairstylist why my hair always looks so great there but not after I dry it.  She said to go buy a tourmaline blow dryer. The tourmaline blow dryers I kept browsing through we&#x27;re expensive. I finally decided on this one. I am happy to say anytime I use this dryer or my daughter borrows it our hair looks smooth and silky. Our fine hair usually shows broken hairs or growing hairs and this dryer makes all that smooth and more polished. One feature I really like is the retracting cord. I&#x27;m a tidy person and wires are tacky so I&#x27;m glad to tuck it away and not have to wrap the cord on the dryer every time I use this.  The dryer is a bit heavier than my traveling dryer but that just means I am sneaking in a little toning exercise for my arms.  I would recommend this dryer to any lady looking for a nice dryer.</li>
            <li> It works fine but I wish it had a hook on the handle so I could hang it up. Also so sometimes my hair gets stuck in the top of it when it is drawing in air.</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I decided to go with this blow dryer because it had all the features I wanted and I was able to get it at a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve had this dryer for just over a year and up until today, I only had one minor issue with it: the cord would not always reel in all the way when I pushed the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, sadly, today it decided to die on me. I plugged it in and it was working just fine when all of a sudden it made a weird sound, shut off and caused the outlet to smoke. I tried it in other outlets to be certain and sure enough, it will not longer turn on. I did use it pretty much every day so it had heavy use but I expect a blow dryer to last at least several years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not bald, but pretty close.  One swipe of a towel over my head and my hair is dry.  For the missus, however, well she&#x27;s pretty happy with it.  The retractable cord works great, the weight is fine, and she says she&#x27;s got less static in her hair.</li>
            <li> I have always been a loyal conair customer. I have owned many of their products through the years and have been very pleased until I bought this product. I have always liked that conair products are fairly inexpensive, they are great quality, and they have a long lifespan. My hair dryer before this one worked just as well and lasted for 7 years years. The one prior lasted me 10 years! At first this product worked perfectly! I loved it! But less than 6 months after purchasing it, it started malfunctioning. I would start using it and just a few minutes later it would automatically turn off. I tried the reset button on the appliance, I tried various outlets in my house, and I even tried resetting the outlets as well. I finally determined that it was the hair dryer that wasn&#x27;t working properly. This has been extremely frustrating when trying to dry/style my hair in the mornings before leaving for work! When I tried to contact their customer service department their representative was lacking personality. She could only provide me with the mailing address for comments and complaints. When I asked her how long the warranty is on this product she explained that it has a 3 year limited warranty but that they could not assist me if I didn&#x27;t have a receipt. I normally do keep receipts for any appliance I purchase but because I have had previous Conair products last me several years, I decided to throw the receipt away just a few months ago. I didn&#x27;t expect this hair dryer to last me as long as the others but I never thought it would die less than a year later!!!! So my advice...keep the receipt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of these for over 5 years and used it DAILY! My mother still has hers from 7 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;Mine worked flawlessly until it just stopped working last week. I am buying a second one today. Hope the quality is still the same.</li>
            <li> for 1875 watt dryer it generates very little power. My wife liked the color.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is very heavy and doesn&#x27;t have a very long cord.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. Durable and easy to use. Cord will not retract all the way after but I have found that in every retractable that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer ever!! Why anyone wants one where the cord is all over I don&#x27;t know.  Works great and is reasonably priced.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Daughter borrowed it, and she liked it, also. Is still working after over a year.</li>
            <li> Low noise, but powerful. The cord keeper is very convenient. My last dryer&#x27;s wire was broken off because I have to interwine the wire.</li>
            <li> Ordered because of good price, multiple heat settings, and multiple speed settings.  I am pleased thus far.  The only \\&quot;complaint&#x27; is that the cord seems a bit short, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s so it can adequately retract into the unit.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
            <li> Lasts for years. This is my second one and when this one dies, I&#x27;ll replace it with the same one. Cord keeper is awesome- I&#x27;ll never go back. Excellent quality blow dryer- hot and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for a few months now and I love it! The only con that I have found is the Retractable chord. It never retracts all the way and hasn&#x27;t from day one. I have found this to be a problem with other appliances with retractable cords too. Luckily that is the only con!</li>
            <li> I liked this hairdryer. The restractable cord had been a feature I was looking for and this one worked well.  I have thin hair, so it always dried quickly.  The different heat/speed settings were useful.  But, it just died on me.  One day it turned off while I was using it.  Left it for a minute and it turned back on.  But, two days later, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even had it two years.  I&#x27;ve burned out hair dryers before, but never had one that was ok one day and not working the next. Bought it at a chain store, so don&#x27;t know if I still have the receipt to look into the warranty, but I&#x27;ve already ordered a new hair dryer here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you are using a hairdryer without a retractable cord, as yourself...why? This is so easy to use and saves a few seconds each morning. Also stores away very neatly. Hot air, nice color, good price. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  It is very quiet, the retractable cord works well, and it has a cold setting as well as a cold button. It feels solid and is easy to handle.  It&#x27;s everything I was looking for in a dryer and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Wife hasn&#x27;t even said a peep to me about it.  If it was bad, I would never hear the end of it.</li>
            <li> I was able to dry my hair quickly and it looked very healthy afterwards. I think this is a winner. A must have is also the retractable cord!</li>
            <li> Fairly quiet The cord could extend a little longer. Nice weight and good balance. Succeeds on the friz control / reduction.</li>
            <li> And She says it&#x27;s good and it only takes 5 minutes to get her hair dryed.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this but I guess it&#x27;s good^^</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair that is mid-way down my back.  My old hair dryer last several years but finally died.  I decided on this one because of the reviews and the color (I admit it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is beautiful.  It is the most &#x27;pretty&#x27; hair dryer that I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retractable cord is a must for me.  This is an awesome feature that I will not go without.  It makes it possible for easier storage and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord getting tangled, ripped, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heating settings are very standard and work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**The only issue for me is the power (or lack thereof.)&lt;br /&gt;The highest setting has about the same amount of power as the lowest setting on my old hair dryer.  (My old dryer had the same amount of watts as this one.)  Due to this, it takes much more time to dry my hair than I am used to.  However, if you have short hair this iron might be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I do love this dryer.  I feel like my hair looks better after I blowdry and I don&#x27;t have to then flat iron as much as I did before with my old dryer.  It does have a short cord, but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 3 years! I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it! Love that it has different speed and heat settings. If anyone complains it is too big or heavy, well, I&#x27;ve got to say this is not a portable hair dryer.</li>
            <li> retractable cord is good as long as it works....over a few months it doesn&#x27;t retract anymore but I can feed it in.</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a year and it still works great&lt;br /&gt;the cold button works fast&lt;br /&gt;the cleaning sheild is a great feature to remove lint</li>
            <li> This is a great standard size blowdryer.  It has multiple heat and power sessions, and the internal cord storage helps keep clutter down in the cabinet under my seat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a year since I purchased this hair dryer and I love it.  I love the retractable cord and the different heat settings, as opposed to just having low and high options.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  It makes my hair feel so soft and the air is not drying.  The cord retracts so it is easy to store.  This is the best hair dryer I have ever had!</li>
            <li> This dryer was not for me and amazon refunded my money immediately. This is a regular dryer. I have fine hair that gets frizzy and needs to dry quickly. I now know I need to stay with the professional models.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd or 3rd Conair I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;ve found them all to be durable, well-constructed appliances. This hairdryer--maybe even more than the previous model--leaves my hair especially smooth and sleek. It dries hair quickly, and the concentrator attachment really works well so that you can put the dryer right next to your brush. My two complaints are related to the retractable cord function: 1) The dryer is heavier than a usual dryer because of the cord reel, and 2) The cord is not very long, maybe only 3&amp;#34;. Neither of these things may be a problem for you. If you specifically WANT a retractable cord, the extra weight is worth it, otherwise, it&#x27;s just extra weight. And if you don&#x27;t need a long cord, if your outlet is right next to your mirror for instance, the short cord is no big deal. But just keep these things in mind</li>
            <li> Have used this hairblower before; it lasts longer then any other I&#x27;ve used.  Would reocmmend it to everyone.  Also, the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, it seemed as if this dryer would perform well for my hair type. I have thick, coarse, Asian hair and a lot of it. This dryer is nothing special though. It&#x27;s not that powerful, and nothing worth raving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Three heat settings (The fastest speed though is not that powerful)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Retractable feature makes the cord quite short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my roommate who has thin hair LOVES this hair dryer and is even considering getting her own.</li>
            <li> Great product! Induces less frizz than with my previous hair dryer, which is my favorite quality about the product.  Pretty color.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is awesome. The retractable cord is very convenient and promotes easy storage. I love it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great this product. Love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about cord. Quick free delivery through prime account. Would recommend to others.</li>
