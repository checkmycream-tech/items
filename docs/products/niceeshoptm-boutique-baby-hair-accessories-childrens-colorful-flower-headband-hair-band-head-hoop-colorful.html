            <li>cause it very colorful and love the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge headband.</li>
            <li>but I just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable putting it on my daughters head.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very cute on my 18mo old baby.</li>
            <li>Super cutee.</li>
            <li>More for babies, than older girls.</li>
            <li>it is very pretty &amp; colorful.  </li>
            <li>A little snug (will stretch with time) but everything else is great for the price.</li>
            <li>I hope this will be the price, but in the end I said, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I have a almost 18 month old and it looks cute on her.</li>
            <li>I did not love it at first, was expecting something a little more dainty, but looks really cute once on.  </li>
            <li>Bigger than i thought it was going to be, but still cute.</li>
            <li>Looks so pretty on child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice little band.</li>
            <li>but it seems like she can fit it now, and her head isn&#x27;t  big!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with all of the items that I have ordered and received only 1 item</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The flowers are very soft and so far it resist very well to all to pulls and chewing my baby</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use it right now - will have to set aside for when she&#x27;s much bigger.</li>
            <li>I live this headband everyone comments on it when I put it in my daughter and it goes with all outfits</li>
            <li>It was cute but too small.  </li>
            <li>+, my 4 month old&#x27;s head is 15+.</li>
            <li>But i was searching for items for a baby - 3 months old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one she wants to wear.</li>
            <li>Service was good but the quality of the product was mediocre.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for girls over the age of 9 as it is a very tight fit.</li>
            <li>Small fit window.</li>
            <li>it was a present for my mom the first day she wore it it loose</li>
            <li>This is clearly for a grown child - way too big.  </li>
            <li>Too big for my 3 month old</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t fit my daughter as i expected it&#x27;s to small for her</li>

            <li> SUPER CUTE!!! Ideal for baby girls!</li>

            <li> Looks really beautiful</li>
            <li> This was a little too big for my daughter and there were strings sticking out from the flowers. It&#x27;s ok but I just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable putting it on my daughters head. So, I decided to use it for myself. Not for a baby but if you are a hippie like me, you can use it.</li>
            <li> Ehhh very cheaply made, you get what you paid for</li>
            <li> Like it fits just wright</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my 5 year old and matches everything! I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for girls over the age of 9 as it is a very tight fit.</li>
            <li> Adorable! Comfortable. Doesn&#x27;t stay on well. Small fit window.</li>
            <li> Looks as in the photo, but a little tight om my 2 year old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I have a almost 18 month old and it looks cute on her. She looks Hawaiian! I ordered for when she&#x27;s 2 years but it seems like she can fit it now, and her head isn&#x27;t  big!</li>
            <li> This headband is so cute and my daughter loves it! It came almost 2 weeks early so that was awesome!</li>
            <li> Service was good but the quality of the product was mediocre. There were lots of unfinished threads that needed to be snipped. All in all, ok...</li>
            <li> So cute!  Fit my 15 month old perfectly!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and worth the longer wait to get it.  It says it is for an infant but is 16+, my 4 month old&#x27;s head is 15+. So she has this to grow into.</li>
            <li> Super cute and fit perfect!</li>

            <li> Very cute!! Too big for my 3 month old but will keep for when she gets bigger.</li>
