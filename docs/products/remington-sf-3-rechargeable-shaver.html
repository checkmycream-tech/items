    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very impressed with both shave and options included on this shaver.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is you want a close shave, excellent trimmer, and guard against overcharging.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaver!</li>
            <li>It may not be the best shaver out there</li>
            <li>The on-board trimmer is excellent.</li>
            <li>Great razor!</li>
            <li>If you take good care of it, IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver on Amazon for $30 a year ago and its still in great condition.</li>
            <li>Holds a great charge.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor at a great price.</li>
            <li>but this one&#x27;s worked out great for me.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t as happy with this</li>
            <li>Very good deal for a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>Great price, good shave.</li>
            <li>It is quite good.</li>
            <li>This was not as good as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>in many discount stores!</li>
            <li>I took about a week to adjust--after which I can now give myself a nice shave without worry of irritation.  </li>
            <li>It will always miss a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hair catching system is downright unsanitary.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>Again, good as a backup or perhaps as a cheap razor, but don&#x27;t rely on it for closeness.</li>
            <li>You get all this without the HUGE ticket price!</li>
            <li>You can pay much more, but all you&#x27;ll get is a brand name.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and he thanks me for buying it every time he gets a great shave.</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer :)</li>
            <li>It still held a great charge and really buzzed to life.</li>
            <li>Better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a razor blade to shave for more than 40 years.  </li>
            <li>It is light, has a sleak design, is comfortable to handle, and seems to stay charged for a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>EVERY THING I WOULD EXPECT FOR THE PRICE AND MORE</li>
            <li>Could you perhaps envision the domestic competition that Yugo had to best in order to make it to the world market?</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have replaced the foil many times.  </li>
            <li>OK, but could be better at this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to spend a lot more effort to get even a semi-decent shave</li>
            <li>I have been using it and love it.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>The cord on the older model was sturdier and connected very nicely.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is very easy to clean and operate.</li>
            <li>(as one did I used many years ago), glides easily around my face, shaves closely and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>GOOD SHAVE FOR A SMALL TRAVEL RAZOR GREAT BATTERY LIFE</li>
            <li>I found that I have to keep playing with it in order for the charge light to stay on.  </li>
            <li>There is a light that turns on to show it is receiving electricity.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>You do want to use it on a clean face.</li>
            <li>Twenty minutes to clean the razor or just leave all sorts of gunk in</li>
            <li>Even though my beard grows in different directions, I&#x27;ve found this shaver provides a good close shave.  </li>
            <li>this shaver simply cannot give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver for starters... unless your name is Big Foot!</li>
            <li>Charge lasts more than one shave, depending on how much beard you have.  </li>
            <li>First one broke after two uses, contacted sender and they sent instructions for free return and another was on</li>
            <li>I prefer single foil over double foil, for best shave.  </li>
            <li>Replaceable foil available separately, at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Real close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I had a nice red &amp;quot;W&amp;quot; carved on my cheek from this shaver.  </li>
            <li>the comfort of this razor is worth it.</li>
            <li>New one is working fine.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in my dop kit and since it held a charge so long I didn&#x27;t have to carry my cord with me.</li>
            <li>It started &amp; very fast.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>i have tried many times to charge and discharge but it does not have enough power to run shaver with head on .</li>
            <li>Although, PocketGO 370 from Braun, which I recently tried, is much better.</li>
            <li>It must be charged first and then you can shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I broke my old braun so this became my primary razor.  </li>
            <li>I turned it on without plugging it in to charge first.</li>
            <li>Well, I have been very pleased with this little razor.</li>
            <li>It feels good in my hand, does not make my hand itch from excessive vibration</li>
            <li>Stipulated: That I considered the low price of this razor, and that it had a strong influence on my decision to buy.</li>
            <li>But, in deciding whether to purchase this razor, I also relied on the largely favorable reviews of the product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s just as portable, holds a charge just as well and actually gives a quiet, close, complete shave, without pain and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It shaves very well.</li>
            <li>Its cost and ratings attracted me since I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on an experiment.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t give me a very close shave, even after using it for the recommened 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t so much \\&quot;shave\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers stated, it does not do a good job overall.</li>
            <li>The only way to clean it is with q-tips and rubbing alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an older version of this model</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Sure, my stubble comes in a little quicker in the evening than it did with a blade but</li>
            <li>I bought this razor about a year ago mainly for rare occasional use when out of town.</li>
            <li>Use on your clean and dry face.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the closeness within a few days.</li>
            <li>I was so amazed I just ordered a new screen &amp; cutter.</li>
            <li>Not a Mercedes, I figured, but a good solid Civic, or perhaps a Subaru, or at least a</li>
            <li>clear?</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace a 20 year old Ronson shaver that has never given me any problems.  </li>
            <li>It is also loud.</li>
            <li>I will grant, my Norelco 7310 is nearly 3x the cost.</li>
            <li>I mean, i work at the place that sells shavers (can&#x27;t mention the name here, because it&#x27;s an unofficial review) and we have so many alternatives,</li>
            <li>If you plan on daily use of a main razor, DO NOT get this.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would help some facial irritation I attributed to shaving with a normal blade razor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very noisy, but people who say it&#x27;s too noisy really are not familiar with Remington brand (they all are noisy)...     </li>
            <li>I needed a new shaver last month (12/2014)</li>
            <li>I got this as a backup for my old Braun electric that I&#x27;ve used forever since I like single head screen razors and it was inexpensive.  </li>

            <li> I got this as a backup for my old Braun electric that I&#x27;ve used forever since I like single head screen razors and it was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I also use the trimmer feature to take care of other bread grooming duties, and the occasional wild hair.  </li>
            <li> so this will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> The shaving machine working just fine, but unfortunately the recharging working with 110W,</li>
            <li> I purchased this Remington due to its low price (one star), and it still runs (second star).</li>
            <li> The only minus is it&#x27;s Rechargeable</li>
            <li> I know, because I turned it on, stepped outside and closed my door and could still hear</li>
            <li> Trims long beards</li>
            <li> I have a theory that the reason they tell you it will take two to three weeks for your beard to adjust is actually because it takes a little time for you to get used to wielding an electric razor around all the turns of your face.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a year now and have had absolutely no problems.  </li>
            <li> Inside the foil are multiple levels of rectangular edges where your dead skin gets buried.</li>
            <li> Other than this one issue</li>
            <li> and I always have to use a little bic blade razor to get a few places this misses (especially hairs on the neck</li>
            <li> The trimmer works  for only a few seconds and then stops dead.</li>
            <li> Skin oils make it less efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Despite it&#x27;s inefficiencies, as pointed out in previous reviews, despite it&#x27;s noisy rattle ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a telephone handset cord and doesn&#x27;t fit snugly into the base to charge.  </li>
            <li> It will destroy it.</li>
            <li> but you have to go over a few times to get everything...</li>
            <li> (I shave every few days</li>
            <li> He thinks its an expensive shaver but little does he know that it only costs $30.</li>
            <li> It is particularly bad on the neck and jaw line, even with several passes and multiple directions.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very, very uneven.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not real happy with the design changes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, the cutting blade is nearly impossible to clean and also get clogged with dead skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go in circles and do not put hardly any pressure to your face .</li>
            <li> The thing I like least is the power cord.  </li>
            <li> I cannot imagine any situation where saving $25 could be worth using this terrible Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as good or as close.</li>
            <li> razor is not only bad, it&#x27;s disgusting or else very, very time consuming.</li>
            <li> I do like the shape, being thin to hold and with the angle that is helpful.  </li>
            <li> WORST thing about this shaver is that, when there is no charge left in the battery, you cannot plug it in to shave (I don&#x27;t know if all rechargeable shavers are susceptible to this).  </li>
            <li> But cleaning it with a brush is impossible.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad buy.  </li>
            <li> It is a terrible product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Had a [costly] name-brand electric shaver. It was SO [costly] to upkeep and replace parts ,that I decided to go cheaper route. Very impressed with both shave and options included on this shaver. You can pay much more, but all you&#x27;ll get is a brand name. The bottom line is you want a close shave, excellent trimmer, and guard against overcharging. You get all this without the HUGE ticket price! What a bargin! I couldn&#x27;t find a shaver with these options ... in many discount stores! What a find!</li>
            <li> I was shaving my face with the SF3 shaver and felt a stinging on my face.  I turned the shaver off and found two holes in the micro screen.  I had a nice red &amp;quot;W&amp;quot; carved on my cheek from this shaver.  I bought this shaver to replace a 20 year old Ronson shaver that has never given me any problems.  I am still waiting to hear from Remington Products on this matter.  This SF3 shaver didn&#x27;t last a month from the date of purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver on Amazon for $30 a year ago and its still in great condition. My husband loves it and he thanks me for buying it every time he gets a great shave. He thinks its an expensive shaver but little does he know that it only costs $30. I just bought another one for my dad. If you take good care of it, IT WORKS GREAT! Satisfied customer :)</li>
            <li> I found this shaver in my dads belongings about 3 years after he passed away. I didnt even know he had it. I turned it on after i found it. It still held a great charge and really buzzed to life. I use it now. It shaves very well. Use on your clean and dry face. Go in circles and do not put hardly any pressure to your face . It is quite good. I use the sideburn trimmer for my sideburns.. and also for removing those whiskers that the shaver doesnt quite get, and then reshave over those spots. Holds a great charge. and recharges within 5 or 10 mins. after im done shaving. my shaver says \\&quot;sf-4\\&quot; on it.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a year now and have had absolutely no problems.  Better yet I have had no skin irritations for a year which was a constant problem when I used a blade. This is a great razor at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a razor blade to shave for more than 40 years.  I decided to try an electric shaver as I was having skin rashes with the blade. This is my first electric shaver.  Even though my beard grows in different directions, I&#x27;ve found this shaver provides a good close shave.  I have a beard and use this shaver to trim my neck.  I also use the trimmer feature to take care of other bread grooming duties, and the occasional wild hair.  This shaver is very easy to clean and operate. This is an excellent shaver!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a year ago mainly for rare occasional use when out of town. At home I use &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; manual razors with shaving foam/gel. I purchased this Remington due to its low price (one star), and it still runs (second star). That&#x27;s about it. Like other reviewers stated, it does not do a good job overall. It is particularly bad on the neck and jaw line, even with several passes and multiple directions. It is also loud. If you plan on daily use of a main razor, DO NOT get this. Either look else where or stick with manual razors.</li>
            <li> Very good deal for a nice close shave.  It may not be the best shaver out there but it does give a quality shave without a lot of irritation.  I&#x27;ve had problems with shavers drying out my skin but this one&#x27;s worked out great for me.  I took about a week to adjust--after which I can now give myself a nice shave without worry of irritation.  I prefer these style shavers to the one&#x27;s with three rotating cutters.  It is light, has a sleak design, is comfortable to handle, and seems to stay charged for a good amount of time.  It is also equipped with a side-burn shaver.  I purchased the replacement blade and battery as well for any extra $15.00.  It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to do that so this will last you a long time.  Great price, good shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help some facial irritation I attributed to shaving with a normal blade razor. Its cost and ratings attracted me since I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on an experiment. Well, I have been very pleased with this little razor. It feels good in my hand, does not make my hand itch from excessive vibration (as one did I used many years ago), glides easily around my face, shaves closely and cleans easily. I&#x27;ve had it for about three weeks and I just plugged it in for its second charge. It fits nicely in my dop kit and since it held a charge so long I didn&#x27;t have to carry my cord with me. I have a theory that the reason they tell you it will take two to three weeks for your beard to adjust is actually because it takes a little time for you to get used to wielding an electric razor around all the turns of your face. I was satisfied with the closeness within a few days. Sure, my stubble comes in a little quicker in the evening than it did with a blade but the comfort of this razor is worth it. And I can always run it over my face if I need to go out at night. You do want to use it on a clean face. Skin oils make it less efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> GOOD SHAVE FOR A SMALL TRAVEL RAZOR GREAT BATTERY LIFE EVERY THING I WOULD EXPECT FOR THE PRICE AND MORE</li>
            <li> Stipulated: That I considered the low price of this razor, and that it had a strong influence on my decision to buy. But, in deciding whether to purchase this razor, I also relied on the largely favorable reviews of the product. Not a Mercedes, I figured, but a good solid Civic, or perhaps a Subaru, or at least a Hyundai.&lt;br /&gt;NO! ...   Remember Yugo?   ... Could you perhaps envision the domestic competition that Yugo had to best in order to make it to the world market? Despite it&#x27;s inefficiencies, as pointed out in previous reviews, despite it&#x27;s noisy rattle ... Bottom line ... this shaver simply cannot give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;We clear?</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave, screen broke and cut my face while shaving.</li>
            <li> the shaver will not charge up enough to use. i have tried many times to charge and discharge but it does not have enough power to run shaver with head on . It will run without head. Does not shave close enough with head!!!! Gary</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband.  First one broke after two uses, contacted sender and they sent instructions for free return and another was on it&#x27;s way.  New one is working fine.</li>
            <li> The shaving machine working just fine, but unfortunately the recharging working with 110W, and I put it in 220W, then the battery was dissolved, now I can&#x27;t recharging it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as happy with this as I thought I would be.  I have an older version of this model and I&#x27;m not real happy with the design changes.  The thing I like least is the power cord.  It&#x27;s like a telephone handset cord and doesn&#x27;t fit snugly into the base to charge.  I found that I have to keep playing with it in order for the charge light to stay on.  The cord on the older model was sturdier and connected very nicely.  Other than this one issue, It&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad buy.  However, it didn&#x27;t give me a very close shave, even after using it for the recommened 3 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t tried, but this shaver supposedly can go for weeks without having to be charged.  But you can leave it on charge in between shaves without risking damage to the battery, as there is an automatic overcharge protection feature. The on-board trimmer is excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver for starters... unless your name is Big Foot! I mean, i work at the place that sells shavers (can&#x27;t mention the name here, because it&#x27;s an unofficial review) and we have so many alternatives, but after all the feedback and looking into it, I bought this one.     The only minus is it&#x27;s Rechargeable ONLY. But, it gives a close shave... Yeah. it&#x27;s very noisy, but people who say it&#x27;s too noisy really are not familiar with Remington brand (they all are noisy)...     I would reccomend it to anyone, especially first-timers.     P.S. Although, PocketGO 370 from Braun, which I recently tried, is much better.</li>
            <li> What this has going on for it, is the price. That&#x27;s it. It is a terrible product. It doesn&#x27;t so much \\&quot;shave\\&quot; as it \\&quot;trims while attempting to rip out hairs\\&quot;. Even once you&#x27;re \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; you already have a 2 O&#x27;clock shadow. And it&#x27;s very, very uneven. Not only that, but even if you spend 10 minutes shaving, it simply will not get every hair. It will always miss a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hair catching system is downright unsanitary. You cannot rinse this razor out. It will destroy it. But cleaning it with a brush is impossible. Inside the foil are multiple levels of rectangular edges where your dead skin gets buried. The only way to clean it is with q-tips and rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Further, the cutting blade is nearly impossible to clean and also get clogged with dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s NOISY. You can literally hear it being used outside of your house. I know, because I turned it on, stepped outside and closed my door and could still hear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is not only bad, it&#x27;s disgusting or else very, very time consuming. Ten minutes to shave. Twenty minutes to clean the razor or just leave all sorts of gunk in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will grant, my Norelco 7310 is nearly 3x the cost. But it&#x27;s just as portable, holds a charge just as well and actually gives a quiet, close, complete shave, without pain and is very easy to clean. I cannot imagine any situation where saving $25 could be worth using this terrible Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for many years.  I have replaced the foil many times.  Nice close shave.  I prefer single foil over double foil, for best shave.  Replaceable foil available separately, at a reasonable price.  Charge lasts more than one shave, depending on how much beard you have.  Trims long beards but you have to go over a few times to get everything...OK, but could be better at this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WORST thing about this shaver is that, when there is no charge left in the battery, you cannot plug it in to shave (I don&#x27;t know if all rechargeable shavers are susceptible to this).  It must be charged first and then you can shave.  Perhaps you can just leave it plugged in all the time to avoid this (I shave every few days so I don&#x27;t leave mine plugged in all the time).  There is a light that turns on to show it is receiving electricity.</li>
            <li> I got this as a backup for my old Braun electric that I&#x27;ve used forever since I like single head screen razors and it was inexpensive.  I do like the shape, being thin to hold and with the angle that is helpful.  It holds a charge well and is easy to clean.  As a backup razor it&#x27;s been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I broke my old braun so this became my primary razor.  It&#x27;s definitely not as good or as close. I have to spend a lot more effort to get even a semi-decent shave and I always have to use a little bic blade razor to get a few places this misses (especially hairs on the neck lying down).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m looking into a replacement.  Again, good as a backup or perhaps as a cheap razor, but don&#x27;t rely on it for closeness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this SF-3 Remington quite some time ago, I can&#x27;t remember when. Possibly 8 years ago (??) When pricing the screen, I decided to purchase a different shaver. I needed a new shaver last month (12/2014) I came across the SF-3 (forgot I even had it.) I turned it on without plugging it in to charge first. It started &amp; very fast. I was so amazed I just ordered a new screen &amp; cutter. I have been using it and love it.</li>
            <li> This was not as good as I was hoping for. The trimmer works  for only a few seconds and then stops dead. You hear the motor running but nothing is happening. I have to take off the heard guard and run it so it will work again after I put the heard guard back on. For shaves It works well. I already had on the the trimmer was not working, that is why I bought this one.</li>
            <li> Great razor! Real close, comfortable shave.</li>
