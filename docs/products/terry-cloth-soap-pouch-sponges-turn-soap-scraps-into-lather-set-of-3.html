            <li>I guess if you want to ex foliate it is great.</li>

            <li>you are a person that uses a sponge in the shower, this may be a great idea for you.</li>
            <li>Shipping and handling was great.  </li>
            <li>Lathers very nice.</li>
            <li>Like the title says these are just not that good.  </li>
            <li>Good service, product doesn&#x27;t work that well</li>
            <li>Well built, great quality, nice colors.</li>
            <li>Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>Still a good product and a good price, will but this product again.</li>
            <li>With this, he has a blast washing himself, which frees me up to get more done!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing way to use up soap scraps without wasting anything.  </li>
            <li>There are others available that look like a deflated loofah which work great.  </li>
            <li>I thought the terry material would be a nice replacement with added softness.</li>
            <li>These were perfect for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having better luck with the sisal ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to locate these for the longest time and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I thought it would work as well as a washcloth if not a lil better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>They are okay</li>
            <li>rated 4 stars because I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>That said, if you&#x27;re planning to use the terry cloth pouches to finish off mostly used up bars of soap, they will work fine.</li>
            <li>holds the soap great no wasted soap bits</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better with a full sized bar, but that&#x27;s not what I wanted it for.  </li>
            <li>this is wonderful for me as I am  disabled and have issues  with bar soap.</li>
            <li>I bought both because these were cheap and these got donated.</li>
            <li>thanks to the handy rope.  </li>
            <li>I removed the sponge and put whatever amount of soap chips I can fit.</li>
            <li>it didnt even really feel nice against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good otherwise so far.</li>
            <li>Idea was good, but maybe using different materials would work better.  </li>
            <li>I love when a product pops up describing exactly what I&#x27;m searching for.  </li>
            <li>great for people that still like to bathe with soap bar instead of liquid, this way they are able to use the soap to the end and not have little ends of soap leftover.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to use those little slivers of soap.  </li>
            <li>For the price, they&#x27;re certainly worth a try.  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be to add some kind of a draw string to keep the soap pieces contained while using the product but that is a nit.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to assist my young grandson&#x27;s in learning to wash themselves,  and purchased more for the adults in the family.  </li>
            <li>Bought this item based on positive reviews!  </li>
            <li>Great for unfinished small soap bars.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a handy cord to hang it up with to dry it out between uses which will keep it clean and sanitary, when the soap runs out, put it in the washing machine and start filling a new one.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty</li>
            <li>I did find another use for them but most likely will not purchase them agan.</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes for this soap pouch.</li>
            <li>all of these got thrown away after their first use.  </li>
            <li>idea but needs a pouch that fully seals made from a different, more comfy, material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I never used it as it was filling with soap bits and taking up space in the shower</li>
            <li>They were nearly exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best soap savers, they&#x27;re soft and all terry cloth with a soft sponge interior - every other soap saver I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon is abrasive, made of either nylon or loofah.  </li>
            <li>Everything about this thing is good, except that it is pretty small.</li>
            <li>Smart idea.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really care for these.</li>
            <li>and the soap wants to fall out --</li>
            <li>and he really like them.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t suds up very well.  </li>
            <li>but that didnt work very well</li>
            <li>It was not quite what I expected but that is not your fault; the mesh soap pouches were more to my liking.</li>
            <li>I wanted to put whole bar in it.</li>
            <li>It is lined with so much foam sponge inside that the water can&#x27;t get in and soap can&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li>They work, but not being able to sinch the top is a poor design.  </li>
            <li>Terry cloth too thick to get good suds going</li>
            <li>Great for using the small slivers of soap left over.</li>
            <li>Nice little soap huggers - one for each of us!</li>
            <li>so far and still works as well as when we first started using it.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was just a little bigger to fit my hand inside easily.</li>
            <li>with this you may not even need to buy a separate bath soap, the slivers from your other household soaps in a soap saver can easily take it&#x27;s place, it did for us.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised at how much use you get out of it -</li>
            <li>When using this in the shower, it didn&#x27;t create near as much lather as a the mesh soap pouches.</li>
            <li>Doesnt sud as normal sponges would.</li>
            <li>(i stored soaps in there before i would normally stop using them, expecting to get a good use from the little piece later - but it was just a bunch of old soap in a crappy pouch when i finally got around to that 1 use).  </li>
            <li>The terry  cloth kept the soap to wet between showers so the soap also depleted quickly.  </li>
            <li>and the pouch just kind of sucks in general.  </li>
            <li>Not good, better off paying a little more to get something of quality.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>I love the concept, but the soap has a hard time getting from the bar to your skin through the pad.</li>
            <li>a hole developed within two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I used it once so far.</li>
            <li>Once I had enough, I used it for a few days, then switched back to bar soap until I have more slivers.  </li>
            <li>When I first get in the shower, I get it wet to let the water soak into the soap.  </li>
            <li>(i really thought they tossed it without giving it a proper chance, but after all that frustration, i totally understand now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The terry cloth exterior and sponge foam core make large amounts of lather very quickly and it continues to do so for a surprisingly long time, not bad for a few otherwise useless thin slivers of soap and some sponge &amp; terry cloth - we&#x27;re still on the first one we filled.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;d be surprised how much extra use you&#x27;ll get out of your saved slivers in the bath and shower when you use a soap saver.  </li>
            <li>The terry cloth pouches are not able to hold a very large bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>Then after I shampoo, I add a little more water, give it a squeeze, and out comes a thick lather.  </li>

            <li> did not even want to use it long enough to create lather.  </li>
            <li> then it was even more frustrating trying to soap myself while trying to keep all these little pieces of soap in the pouch.  </li>
            <li> I use high quality soaps and don&#x27;t like to throw away when the soap gets too small to stay on my soap shelf (metal rack) ...</li>
            <li> i TRIED to compress all the soap into a single brick</li>
            <li> after i finally decided to use it, the soap pieces would fall out as i was scrubbing myself and it made a mess of a bunch of soap all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> If you hate wasting soap, you will love these!  </li>
            <li> My grandmother used to knit little turtles and put left over soap in them.  </li>
            <li> Do not work as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> The one improvement I’d like is a way to cinch the pouch closed, but it still works for me.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Did not work as I expected.</li>
            <li> Was not very useful.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;hard to get larger bars inside small sac</li>
            <li> i should have just used the soap until i couldnt anymore like usual instead of saving and hoping for usage later.</li>
            <li> The terry cloth pocket is just not adequate -- when wet it stretches out (terry!)</li>
            <li> but with less suds.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not last long.  </li>
            <li> Hey, no soap no clean body.</li>
            <li> The foam inside does shrink down so it is almost as if your just using a plain wash cloth</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> And, if you intend on keeping the bar of soap in the pouch between uses, it&#x27;s difficult to ring the water and soap completely out without removing the soap bar.  </li>
            <li> There a bit on the thin side, granted I buy hand made bars of soap which are bigger then tradition soaps.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it ended up being a waste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Drys stiff</li>
            <li> Too small for the bars of soap</li>
            <li> Also the pouch is too small and you cannot use the rope as a drawstring...</li>
            <li> The spongy side, which is just foam, collapses while washing,  which means you end up with a small crumbled up piece of terry cloth.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I tried squeezing soap slivers together to make one, but they usually don&#x27;t hold up, plus can hurt your hands squeezing them.  </li>
            <li> Sponge inside is way too thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the terry pouch for about three weeks now and it is difficult to work up a lather.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys....</li>
            <li> too difficult to lather soap!</li>
            <li> Bad news.  </li>
            <li> With all the bad reviews I wanted to believe it would work, but it&#x27;s a no-go.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in these.  </li>
            <li> All adults hate it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t really care for these. Do not work as I expected. too difficult to lather soap!</li>
            <li> I love the concept, but the soap has a hard time getting from the bar to your skin through the pad. I&#x27;m having better luck with the sisal ones.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I like to use soap pouches and I thought we would try these.  Unfortunately, it did not last long.  a hole developed within two weeks.  The terry  cloth kept the soap to wet between showers so the soap also depleted quickly.  Skip these and go for the net ones.</li>
            <li> this is wonderful for me as I am  disabled and have issues  with bar soap.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing way to use up soap scraps without wasting anything.  I&#x27;ve been trying to locate these for the longest time and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Too small for the bars of soap</li>
            <li> I use high quality soaps and don&#x27;t like to throw away when the soap gets too small to stay on my soap shelf (metal rack) ... Bought this item based on positive reviews!  Very disappointed.  The terry cloth pocket is just not adequate -- when wet it stretches out (terry!) and the soap wants to fall out -- did not even want to use it long enough to create lather.  Maybe it would work better with a full sized bar, but that&#x27;s not what I wanted it for.  Cannot return now that have opened &amp; used one of them. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used it once so far. This does not lather well. You have to constantly add water and when you do that washes away your suds. The foam inside does shrink down so it is almost as if your just using a plain wash cloth but with less suds. Very disappointed. I thought it would work as well as a washcloth if not a lil better.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best soap savers, they&#x27;re soft and all terry cloth with a soft sponge interior - every other soap saver I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon is abrasive, made of either nylon or loofah.  Soap savers are a must when you buy handmade or slightly more expensive soaps, however even if you buy regular store bought soaps you&#x27;d be surprised how much extra use you&#x27;ll get out of your saved slivers in the bath and shower when you use a soap saver.  The terry cloth exterior and sponge foam core make large amounts of lather very quickly and it continues to do so for a surprisingly long time, not bad for a few otherwise useless thin slivers of soap and some sponge &amp; terry cloth - we&#x27;re still on the first one we filled.  It has lasted 3 months (!) so far and still works as well as when we first started using it.  There&#x27;s a handy cord to hang it up with to dry it out between uses which will keep it clean and sanitary, when the soap runs out, put it in the washing machine and start filling a new one.  For the price, they&#x27;re certainly worth a try.  You&#x27;ll be surprised at how much use you get out of it - with this you may not even need to buy a separate bath soap, the slivers from your other household soaps in a soap saver can easily take it&#x27;s place, it did for us.</li>
            <li> Nope for the soap. Not what I expected</li>
            <li> Like the title says these are just not that good.  They work, but not being able to sinch the top is a poor design.  There are others available that look like a deflated loofah which work great.  I bought both because these were cheap and these got donated.</li>
            <li> For the money....... I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again. They just don&#x27;t lather up like some soap holders do. They are pretty but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> These are the washbags I used to stuff the scented soaps in.&lt;br /&gt;They make wonderful gifts, especially great  stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to use those little slivers of soap.  I collected slivers from 3-4 bars of soap before using the pouch.  Once I had enough, I used it for a few days, then switched back to bar soap until I have more slivers.  When I first get in the shower, I get it wet to let the water soak into the soap.  Then after I shampoo, I add a little more water, give it a squeeze, and out comes a thick lather.  The one improvement I’d like is a way to cinch the pouch closed, but it still works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend it to anyone.  It is my wash cloth at the gym so my bar of soap doesn&#x27;t fall on the shower floor -- thanks to the handy rope.  Also great for home use.</li>
            <li> Good service, product doesn&#x27;t work that well</li>
            <li> My mother wanted soap on a rope and couldn&#x27;t find one.  She is 97 and can&#x27;t pick up the soap when dropped.  This solves the problem.  My grandmother used to knit little turtles and put left over soap in them.  Same thing.  Wish I could find the turtles though.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. When using this in the shower, it didn&#x27;t create near as much lather as a the mesh soap pouches. Also the pouch is too small and you cannot use the rope as a drawstring...</li>
            <li> needs to be slightly larger&lt;br /&gt;hard to get larger bars inside small sac&lt;br /&gt;love these pockets for bathing</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t lather well or stay together. After one washing, one of them is already falling apart. Went and bought a loofah.</li>
            <li> Well built, great quality, nice colors. Lathers very nice. Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for my 4 year old. He prefers bar soap, but was always losing it in the tub. With this, he has a blast washing himself, which frees me up to get more done!</li>
            <li> Looked around for these awhile and finally found on Amazon. Nice little soap huggers - one for each of us!</li>
            <li> Terry cloth too thick to get good suds going</li>
            <li> Bad news.  Drys stiff I guess if you want to ex foliate it is great.</li>
            <li> They are okay but not what I had in mind to use. I did find another use for them but most likely will not purchase them agan.</li>
            <li> The terry cloth pouches are not able to hold a very large bar of soap.  And, if you intend on keeping the bar of soap in the pouch between uses, it&#x27;s difficult to ring the water and soap completely out without removing the soap bar.  That said, if you&#x27;re planning to use the terry cloth pouches to finish off mostly used up bars of soap, they will work fine.</li>
            <li> There a bit on the thin side, granted I buy hand made bars of soap which are bigger then tradition soaps.</li>
            <li> Did not work as I expected. Enough said.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this soap pouch. I had a plastic one that worked well, but was falling apart. I thought the terry material would be a nice replacement with added softness. I&#x27;ve been using the terry pouch for about three weeks now and it is difficult to work up a lather. Good otherwise so far.</li>
            <li> Great for unfinished small soap bars. Lather up with ease.</li>
            <li> These are great!  My only suggestion would be to add some kind of a draw string to keep the soap pieces contained while using the product but that is a nit.</li>
            <li> great for people that still like to bathe with soap bar instead of liquid, this way they are able to use the soap to the end and not have little ends of soap leftover.  Smart idea.</li>
            <li> Great for using the small slivers of soap left over. Sames money and worked well. Purchased these as a gift and he really like them.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in these.  They don&#x27;t suds up very well.  They are also sort of flimsy.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> Sponge inside is way too thin. Doesnt sud as normal sponges would. It lasts up to 2 weeks, after that it gets moldy. Not good, better off paying a little more to get something of quality.</li>
            <li> and it feels great on my skin&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely use these from now on&lt;br /&gt;nice product wonderful idea&lt;br /&gt;props to the producer</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to put all the soap pieces to reuse. There wasn&#x27;t enough room for 3 pieces of soap chips let alone with the sponge that came in it. I removed the sponge and put whatever amount of soap chips I can fit. Was not very useful. To lather the pouch, I tried keeping it moist but caused mildew. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to assist my young grandson&#x27;s in learning to wash themselves,  and purchased more for the adults in the family.  All adults hate it.  The spongy side, which is just foam, collapses while washing,  which means you end up with a small crumbled up piece of terry cloth.  The only way to get it back to shape so you can actually wash yourself is by submerging it in water and there goes the suds you&#x27;ve worked up.  Idea was good, but maybe using different materials would work better.  Sorry guys....</li>
            <li> If you hate wasting soap, you will love these!  In the past, I tried squeezing soap slivers together to make one, but they usually don&#x27;t hold up, plus can hurt your hands squeezing them.  Not only does this save soap slivers, but is a washcloth also, which is also machine washable.</li>
            <li> rated 4 stars because I&#x27;ve had better. Still a good product and a good price, will but this product again.</li>
            <li> all of these got thrown away after their first use.  gave one to different people in the house &amp; i kept mine the longest cuz i kept accumulating soap pieces and put them in here.  after i finally decided to use it, the soap pieces would fall out as i was scrubbing myself and it made a mess of a bunch of soap all over the bathroom.  it didnt even really feel nice against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i TRIED to compress all the soap into a single brick but that didnt work very well, they still split apart.  then it was even more frustrating trying to soap myself while trying to keep all these little pieces of soap in the pouch.  and the pouch just kind of sucks in general.  tossed it after my 1st use just like everyone else (i really thought they tossed it without giving it a proper chance, but after all that frustration, i totally understand now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good idea but needs a pouch that fully seals made from a different, more comfy, material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i thought this would be an efficient use of money (using the soap to its fullest use) but it ended up being a waste (i stored soaps in there before i would normally stop using them, expecting to get a good use from the little piece later - but it was just a bunch of old soap in a crappy pouch when i finally got around to that 1 use).  i should have just used the soap until i couldnt anymore like usual instead of saving and hoping for usage later.</li>
            <li> I love when a product pops up describing exactly what I&#x27;m searching for.  One click and it&#x27;s on the way to my house at a discounted rate!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I never used it as it was filling with soap bits and taking up space in the shower so I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a person that uses a sponge in the shower, this may be a great idea for you.</li>
            <li> Shipping and handling was great.  It was not quite what I expected but that is not your fault; the mesh soap pouches were more to my liking.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this thing as a back scrubber like a wash cloth when showering. Everything about this thing is good, except that it is pretty small. I wish it was just a little bigger to fit my hand inside easily.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase these to put my leftover soap in. I wanted to put whole bar in it. It did not work so well. It is lined with so much foam sponge inside that the water can&#x27;t get in and soap can&#x27;t get out. Hey, no soap no clean body. With all the bad reviews I wanted to believe it would work, but it&#x27;s a no-go.</li>
            <li> holds the soap great no wasted soap bits</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a few months.  They were nearly exactly what I needed.  My only complaint is that the rope fell off of the first one that I used.  Otherwise I would have rated them at 5 stars.</li>
