            <li>pretty good stuff ...</li>
            <li>pretty good smell</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it had a dropper or pump top to make quantity control a little easier, but generally awesome product from awesome company.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and fresh, definitely liked the overall feel on my face and helps keep my beard looking great.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>seems cheap and inefficient to me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil is light, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m slicking up my beard or that I&#x27;m going to be rubbing it off on anything</li>
            <li>You could find similar stuff cheaper, but this works great</li>
            <li>Does a good job of keeping your beard soft, but a tad pricey.  </li>
            <li>I just got it yesterday not bad ...</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something lighter but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>the smell is nothing special, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>One of the best oils I have used, I have a very thick beard.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to know their is a big beird community who take care of ourselves</li>
            <li>First beard oil</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied that it does the job.</li>
            <li>This keeps my beard about as soft and smooth as it&#x27;s gonna get.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted ..</li>
            <li>Smells great, last a long time.</li>
            <li>Not heavy on the beard, and has, for me, reduced the quantity of beard hair loss when combing significantly, and leaves my beard softer.</li>
            <li>Even my friends noticed how much nicer my beard was looking</li>
            <li>I knew to this whole beird oil ....</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much when I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>There is also not a dropper on the cap, which you get with many other equivalent brands that cost less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about the product itself, it has a pronounced herbal pepperminty aroma and is slightly on the more viscous side of the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and my beard already feels more controlled in terms of combing it, the hair is softer, and I&#x27;ve had a few compliments from the lady-folk who&#x27;ve checked it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice faint aroma, it fades quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling it all day.  </li>
            <li>Makes my boyfriends beard soft and kissable</li>
            <li>and wow....I never thought that my beard could ever be this soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a beard (consistently) for the last 4-5 years, and I&#x27;m still learning about how to care for it properly.  </li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t have a long think beard you probably won&#x27;t notice the smell as much as I do.</li>

            <li> reason I only give it 3 stars is that the cap design is very poor, and in spite of that it is still $10 more than other very similar products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had used expensive hair care conditioners in the past and decided to give this a try...worked better than I</li>
            <li> This oil was a lot stronger smelling than I had expected.</li>
            <li> short, if you&#x27;ve got a beard and are looking to try out Beard Oils (I recommend for what its worth), it&#x27;s hard to go wrong here.  </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried any other brands</li>
            <li> but i plan on sticking with BeardBrand and maybe try some of their other oils too</li>
            <li> It is a little overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;quot;This item is the same as beardbrand oil and scent is sent in random to you.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> method of delivery is Malaysia small post.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is what I got when I complained</li>
            <li> , so it is not good to travel with.</li>
            <li> WAY too expensive.</li>
            <li> The cap is very thin aluminum</li>
            <li> the part of this product that deserves one star isn&#x27;t even the expensive price, its how pathetic the oil dispenses.. there is no dropper</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pleasant, but not overpowering.  First beard oil I bought based upon favorable review from an online article in the Manual online.  Does a good job of keeping your beard soft, but a tad pricey.  Overall satisfied that it does the job.</li>
            <li> Seller delivered in the time period. Great product,  nice odor to it , makes my goatee look great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Shipped quickly and smells great.  My only wish is that it had a dropper or pump top to make quantity control a little easier, but generally awesome product from awesome company.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love this stuff. And the Citrus. WAY too expensive. But it&#x27;s really good stuff. This keeps my beard about as soft and smooth as it&#x27;s gonna get. Crack for your beard? Well, crack might be cheaper. But I get the metaphor and I agree.</li>
            <li> Great product. The smell is great and it really makes my beard look and feel great. Would buy from beardbrand again 100%</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted ..quicker then I thought!&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells great, my beard is freaking awesome now</li>
            <li> One of the best oils I have used, I have a very thick beard. Smells great, last a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and fresh, definitely liked the overall feel on my face and helps keep my beard looking great. Even my friends noticed how much nicer my beard was looking I didn&#x27;t even know lol, but glad to hear compliments</li>
            <li> This is not Beardbrand!&lt;br /&gt;This is what I got when I complained&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This item is the same as beardbrand oil and scent is sent in random to you.&lt;br /&gt;The method of delivery is Malaysia small post.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Aiita&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ad said Tea Tree Oil and is not even close...</li>
            <li> What a rip off.  $27+ for 1 oz, in a glass bottle with no rubber gasket.  WD40 would be just as good and then you could oil your hinges.  No wonder this guy got tossed from &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product to make ones beard soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had used expensive hair care conditioners in the past and decided to give this a try...worked better than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife loved the feel and look of my beard!  Will be a regular customer forever!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and has a pleasant, clean smell.</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday not bad ...pretty good stuff ...pretty good smell I knew to this whole beird oil ....it&#x27;s nice to know their is a big beird community who take care of ourselves</li>
            <li> Amazing product, fast shipping. Tks!</li>
            <li> This oil was a lot stronger smelling than I had expected. I was hoping for something lighter but it&#x27;s not bad and if you don&#x27;t have a long think beard you probably won&#x27;t notice the smell as much as I do.</li>
            <li> great stuff.. if you want to get a lil control of your beard use this. i haven&#x27;t tried any other brands but i plan on sticking with BeardBrand and maybe try some of their other oils too</li>
            <li> the product itself works well. it is very light (which works great for my longer beard) and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. the smell is nothing special, but not unpleasant. the part of this product that deserves one star isn&#x27;t even the expensive price, its how pathetic the oil dispenses.. there is no dropper so you&#x27;re just supposed to continuously shake over and over to get the oil out. seems cheap and inefficient to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used beard oil before. This stuff is fantastic. Nice light aroma. Not heavy on the beard, and has, for me, reduced the quantity of beard hair loss when combing significantly, and leaves my beard softer. I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it restores shine and helps make my beard more manageable, while leaving it smelling great, without being over bearing.</li>
            <li> gave a nice shine to the beard and once I started using it, the looks and the compliments on the beard increased 10 fold!  I will definitely be using this product again . . . . thank you beardtree</li>
            <li> No complaints on this product. Shipped very quickly. Smells great! Makes my boyfriends beard soft and kissable :)&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase this for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard (consistently) for the last 4-5 years, and I&#x27;m still learning about how to care for it properly.  I was referred over to Beardbrand Tea Tree by Beardsy.com, and after reading a number of articles elsewhere regarding Beard Oil, I took them up on their recommendation to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is light, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m slicking up my beard or that I&#x27;m going to be rubbing it off on anything and everything my face comes in contact with.  It has a nice faint aroma, it fades quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling it all day.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and my beard already feels more controlled in terms of combing it, the hair is softer, and I&#x27;ve had a few compliments from the lady-folk who&#x27;ve checked it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;ve got a beard and are looking to try out Beard Oils (I recommend for what its worth), it&#x27;s hard to go wrong here.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the product itself, it has a pronounced herbal pepperminty aroma and is slightly on the more viscous side of the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only give it 3 stars is that the cap design is very poor, and in spite of that it is still $10 more than other very similar products. The cap is very thin aluminum and it leaks, so it is not good to travel with. There is also not a dropper on the cap, which you get with many other equivalent brands that cost less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless they switch up their caps and drop the price, I will be not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Great product and love the light fragrance it has. Only downsides I&#x27;d have to say is they compromise design for function. It should have a dropper instead of having to unscrew the cap and ration it into your palm. The product is also a tad more expensive than otger brands as well.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much when I ordered this product.  I just figured that I&#x27;ll have a nice smelling beard and the idea of softness would be a dream to attempt later on.  It&#x27;s been two weeks now and wow....I never thought that my beard could ever be this soft.  I will buying this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good and manly. It makes the beard shine and tames the beast. The wife digs the shine. It is a little overpriced for what it is. You could find similar stuff cheaper, but this works great and I have purchased it twice now.</li>
