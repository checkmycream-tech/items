            <li>The product has worked great.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a product that will make your hair stronger, look fuller and healthier, this will be great for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is THE VERY BEST PRODUCT I have ever used ...really makes my very fine hair appear to be thicker &amp; therefore more pleasing to me !</li>
            <li>It feels great on my scalp and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Does give my hair a nice texture and volume when you apply to the roots, smells great.</li>
            <li>I especially loved the Everstrong Sulfate Free, Hair thickening shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I use it as a good detangler.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t because it works great for me :)</li>
            <li>The product was OK, but not that great.</li>
            <li>I think my hair was more successful</li>
            <li>Same for the shampoo, great combo and smells great</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>&amp; I receive so many compliments of my hair lloking so nice.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>Love the three together and recommend it to all who want their hair to be a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an Herbal Essence flowery type smell, maybe use another product on top of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a better price on amazon than in stores, plus it wasn&#x27;t in every store I looked--</li>
            <li>Love the stuff</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>Its just OK....</li>
            <li>there is a better product than this for stronger hold.</li>
            <li>Bedhead, It&#x27;s a 10, B&amp;Sexy, Rusk are all better options.</li>
            <li>And yes, it did meet my original expectations: gives nice thickening.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and leaves my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say about this product is that the spray bottle works good.</li>
            <li>If it would have helped my fine hair have more volume I probably could have dealt with the scent, but causing my hair to come out when brushing landed this product in the trash.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>Gets out all the knots and makes your hair really easy to brush through.  </li>
            <li>it was extremely strong.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t stand strong scents, DO NOT use this.</li>
            <li>love that this product is full of amino acids and has no silicones or sulfate.</li>
            <li>My fine hair responds well to this product, it gives me fullness and body</li>
            <li>Adds super body!</li>
            <li>I used this product as directed and applied it primarily to my ends</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks but plan to purchase more and give it a fair chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate the spray mechanism, it makes it very easy to target your roots.  </li>
            <li>My fine 70 year old hair that is colored, looks better than ever and feels healthy</li>
            <li>this product is exactly what my hair needs for a bit more volume....shipped on time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Delivery was exact Love</li>
            <li>Full Body Look.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li>My hair was nice and soft immediately after using.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has other great products.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed this product works great with my other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other then that, it works great for my hair.</li>
            <li>After it dries, it has a freshly washed, clean shampooed smell.</li>
            <li>Smells good and goes on easy but didn&#x27;t really give any extra body or thickening of the hair.  </li>
            <li>It is good for dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Not a dramatic difference but a nice soft bounce to my hair without stickiness or loss of shine.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it received a very positive review in a magazine for thickening or giving the impression of thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ve tried other thickeners, and this does the trick better than the others.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t honestly expect much from this but was surprised the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the whole system.</li>
            <li>I flat ironed, sprayed a conditioning oil with its own scent on my hair, sprayed strawberry perfume all over me, febreze all over my home.</li>
            <li>I love hair products and since I use the shampoo of the same flavor, I decided to try this...  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was on sale, and from the description sounded like exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the tonic itself was the same herbal scent but amplified a million times more it seemed.</li>
            <li>The nozzle broke off the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I used this product daily for two weeks before reviewing so that I could make sure my review would be accurate, and unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t produce good volume or lift for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottles, easy to use because it has a pump.</li>
            <li>The product comes in a pure liquid form, like water.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair, and this product does seem to give my hair extra volume.</li>
            <li>I have used several other products in the L&#x27;Oreal Ever line and always found their scents pleasant.  </li>
            <li>works really well with the shampoo</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s working, although I can&#x27;t attribute it to this one product specifically - I&#x27;m using the whole set.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery....</li>
            <li>I really like L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s fiber fill volume line, so</li>
            <li>and I noticed my hair looked Much fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li>I noticed the sections with the product on looked much fuller, healthier, and uniformed.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t offer volume or anything, really.</li>
            <li>and this is at the very bottom of my list.</li>
            <li>Because, a year in a half ago I experienced a lot of breakage due to my hair getting tangled pretty</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly  recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Helps give my thin hair a little boost at the scalp where I need it; better then most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I also wouldn&#x27;t use it if you have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product and it went back to the normal amount of stray strands.  </li>
            <li>This one smells like extra hold hairspray with some undertones of a natural scent I couldn&#x27;t discern.  </li>
            <li>Everything  but the one where I sent you an e-mail that  the top of the bottle was broken and could not be used.</li>
            <li>growth takes 3 months so those of you who gave it two weeks are apparently looking for a volumizer or just aren&#x27;t giving it enough time to produce results.</li>
            <li>when I used it, it is liquidy, not a foam, that you spray near your roots, work it through, dry, etc.  </li>
            <li>have course, extremely curly, permed hair which appeared very fine and weak at the last 6 inches.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin shoulder length hair, and as a beauty product junkie, I&#x27;m always trying new product to give my hair volume, as you can see from my other reviews.  </li>

            <li> It is extremely lightweight and made my hair look naturally thicker, like I didn&#x27;t have any product on at all!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the smell</li>
            <li> At first, because of the negative reviews I almost put it back on the shelf.</li>
            <li> it gave my scalp at first, over time, those areas started to get a little red, and would sometimes feel a little &amp;#34;sore&amp;#34; after using.</li>
            <li> , before applying to my whole head, I did a test and took small sections of hair the same size, and applied this product to one and not the other, then flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, very fine hair, and this product did not seem to add any thickness or body that I could detect, and in fact seemed to make it even softer and less manageable than it is without any product on it at all.  </li>
            <li> The pink splotch is totally temporary and harmless.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I just use a dry shampoo and that adds volume.</li>
            <li> I looked in the box to see if it had gotten loose, but it just wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo and Conditioner had a slight herbal smell to them (possibly rosemary oil???).</li>
            <li> Anything (think Nioxin) that stimulates the scalp will tingle and probably cause a pink splotch where it touches the skin.</li>
            <li> It was even easier to brush my hair when it was still wet.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair everyday with a different shampoo and conditioner, and the smell is STILL in my hair.</li>
            <li> I just transfered it into my empty bottle and used it.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair limp and flat.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected!  </li>
            <li> Not much difference, a little lift.</li>
            <li> Worked very little for me, made my hair dry</li>
            <li> My hair does seem healthier and not weighted down.</li>
            <li> in fact, I think it might have made my hair a little softer, therefore deflating some volume.  </li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t feel like I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> This is something I found that helps with my limp hair and thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure my hair is thicker than before i started using it</li>
            <li> It is truly nasty and strong.  </li>
            <li> thing I have found to date, for thin and limp hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair appear thick and shiny as well as manageable.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not what I was expecting:(</li>
            <li> Since I found the product difficult and confusing, I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker, at the very least!</li>
            <li> and I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> If you are desperate to thicken your hair and don&#x27;t mind the scent you have to bear, this is an inexpensive solution to your problem.</li>
            <li> The smell is also unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> , it does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> The system did thicken my hair in even just one use, despite the awful scent.</li>

            <li> I have very thin, very fine hair, and this product did not seem to add any thickness or body that I could detect, and in fact seemed to make it even softer and less manageable than it is without any product on it at all.  I used the L&#x27;Oreal thickening shampoo with the L&#x27;Oreal thickening conditioner and thickening tonic.  None of the three products worked for me, either together or separately.</li>
            <li> I love hair products and since I use the shampoo of the same flavor, I decided to try this...  Not much difference, a little lift.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t see any noticeable hair thickening going on. I don&#x27;t use it every day, maybe I should. Does give my hair a nice texture and volume when you apply to the roots, smells great. Don&#x27;t know that I would buy again, but I&#x27;ll use what I have and I won&#x27;t feel like I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> The product has worked great. It leaves your scalp and hair feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;It also has other great products.&lt;br /&gt;Love them all!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottles, easy to use because it has a pump. It is good for dry scalp. Ok</li>
            <li> I started using this product and within a couple applications noticed that a lot of hair was coming out when I pic&#x27;d or brushed my hair.  I stopped using this product and it went back to the normal amount of stray strands.  The smell is also unpleasant.  I have used several other products in the L&#x27;Oreal Ever line and always found their scents pleasant.  This one smells like extra hold hairspray with some undertones of a natural scent I couldn&#x27;t discern.  If it would have helped my fine hair have more volume I probably could have dealt with the scent, but causing my hair to come out when brushing landed this product in the trash.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and leaves my hair super soft.  The ladies are always impressed.</li>
            <li> This is THE VERY BEST PRODUCT I have ever used ...really makes my very fine hair appear to be thicker &amp; therefore more pleasing to me !</li>
            <li> Worked very little for me, made my hair dry</li>
            <li> This is not an instant volumizer (a stiffener that lifts the roots) It has ingredients that stimulate the scalp to hopefully encourage the regrowth of hair-specifically rosemary oil. Anything (think Nioxin) that stimulates the scalp will tingle and probably cause a pink splotch where it touches the skin. The pink splotch is totally temporary and harmless.&lt;br /&gt;Hair growth takes 3 months so those of you who gave it two weeks are apparently looking for a volumizer or just aren&#x27;t giving it enough time to produce results. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks but plan to purchase more and give it a fair chance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll check back in in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> My fine 70 year old hair that is colored, looks better than ever and feels healthy</li>
            <li> Made my hair limp and flat. Doesn&#x27;t thicken or provide any volume at all. Dumped out the rest after only two uses.</li>
            <li> I especially loved the Everstrong Sulfate Free, Hair thickening shampoo.</li>
            <li> My fine hair responds well to this product, it gives me fullness and body and I am addicted! :) I&#x27;ve tried other thickeners, and this does the trick better than the others.</li>
            <li> works really well with the shampoo and I use it as a good detangler.  Gets out all the knots and makes your hair really easy to brush through.  adds body and shine.  Highly recommend.  And price here on amazon.com can&#x27;t be beat!!</li>
            <li> The product comes in a pure liquid form, like water.  I did not find any instruction for application - after all, one doesn&#x27;t apply this sort of thing to the hair itself.  Since I found the product difficult and confusing, I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely awesome.  Use it on my hair all the time &amp; I receive so many compliments of my hair lloking so nice.&lt;br /&gt;Must be that Full Body Look.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> this product is exactly what my hair needs for a bit more volume....shipped on time</li>
            <li> This is perfect for fine, thin hair. Adds super body! You&#x27;ll think you have twice as much hair without the feel of a heavy product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s working, although I can&#x27;t attribute it to this one product specifically - I&#x27;m using the whole set. My hair feels thicker, at the very least!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t honestly expect much from this but was surprised the first time i used it. The volume and body in my hair was was definitely plumped. Not a dramatic difference but a nice soft bounce to my hair without stickiness or loss of shine. Plan on keeping this in stock.</li>
            <li> Terrific tonic! Fast delivery.... A+</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on the smell of this product and should have listened.  I don&#x27;t know if this product works or not because the smell is like Vicks Vapor Rub.  It is truly nasty and strong.  So if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like a medicine cabinet, go for it. Otherwise, go with something else.  The only good thing I can say about this product is that the spray bottle works good.</li>
            <li> I like this product as a leave in after blowdrying. Not sure my hair is thicker than before i started using it but it isn&#x27;t thinner....</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, however, when I opened the package, the bottle was missing the nozzle portion. I looked in the box to see if it had gotten loose, but it just wasn&#x27;t there. I can&#x27;t even use it because there nothing to press to release the product. Definitely not what I was expecting:(</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair, and this product does seem to give my hair extra volume.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin shoulder length hair, and as a beauty product junkie, I&#x27;m always trying new product to give my hair volume, as you can see from my other reviews.  I really like L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s fiber fill volume line, so I hoped this product would have similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t.  I used this product daily for two weeks before reviewing so that I could make sure my review would be accurate, and unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t produce good volume or lift for my hair.  There are things I like about it - I like how it smells, and I like the tingle it gives my scalp. I also really appreciate the spray mechanism, it makes it very easy to target your roots.  However, I didn&#x27;t notice any additional volume after repeated use...in fact, I think it might have made my hair a little softer, therefore deflating some volume.  I also wouldn&#x27;t use it if you have sensitive skin...while I did like the tingle it gave my scalp at first, over time, those areas started to get a little red, and would sometimes feel a little &amp;#34;sore&amp;#34; after using.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected!  Great product along with the Shampoo and Thickening Tonic!  Love the three together and recommend it to all who want their hair to be a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> Same for the shampoo, great combo and smells great</li>
            <li> This is something I found that helps with my limp hair and thinning hair.  Gives me some boost.  I use it whenever I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Best thing I have found to date, for thin and limp hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale, and from the description sounded like exactly what I needed. At first, because of the negative reviews I almost put it back on the shelf. However, I&#x27;m very glad I didn&#x27;t because it works great for me :)&lt;br /&gt;I have course, extremely curly, permed hair which appeared very fine and weak at the last 6 inches. Because, a year in a half ago I experienced a lot of breakage due to my hair getting tangled pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt; I used this product as directed and applied it primarily to my ends and I noticed my hair looked Much fuller and healthier. It is extremely lightweight and made my hair look naturally thicker, like I didn&#x27;t have any product on at all!&lt;br /&gt;Also, before applying to my whole head, I did a test and took small sections of hair the same size, and applied this product to one and not the other, then flat ironed. I noticed the sections with the product on looked much fuller, healthier, and uniformed. So, I know this product works.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the smell, it does not smell bad. After it dries, it has a freshly washed, clean shampooed smell. If you&#x27;re looking for an Herbal Essence flowery type smell, maybe use another product on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed this product works great with my other products.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a product that works like a volumizing hold spray, this is not that product. But if you&#x27;re looking for a product that will make your hair stronger, look fuller and healthier, this will be great for you.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product is full of amino acids and has no silicones or sulfate.</li>
            <li> I was expecting thickening results, and got bonus body and fullness. My hair was nice and soft immediately after using. It was even easier to brush my hair when it was still wet. And yes, it did meet my original expectations: gives nice thickening.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it received a very positive review in a magazine for thickening or giving the impression of thicker hair.  I am all for that, so wanted to try it.  I think my hair was more successful when I used it, it is liquidy, not a foam, that you spray near your roots, work it through, dry, etc.  It was a better price on amazon than in stores, plus it wasn&#x27;t in every store I looked--so if you have trouble finding it, it came fast and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the whole system. The Shampoo and Conditioner had a slight herbal smell to them (possibly rosemary oil???). They seemed to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the tonic itself was the same herbal scent but amplified a million times more it seemed. From the moment it came out of the bottle it was extremely strong. I put it on my damp hair, and after that it seemed all downhill. It ended up on my clothes, bedding, car headrest, couch, and anywhere else my head or hair had rested on in some way. As I am writing this, it has been four days since I had sprayed the tonic on my hair. I washed my hair everyday with a different shampoo and conditioner, and the smell is STILL in my hair. I flat ironed, sprayed a conditioning oil with its own scent on my hair, sprayed strawberry perfume all over me, febreze all over my home. It is STILL lingering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend using the tonic if you don&#x27;t have to. The system did thicken my hair in even just one use, despite the awful scent. If you are desperate to thicken your hair and don&#x27;t mind the scent you have to bear, this is an inexpensive solution to your problem. If you can&#x27;t stand strong scents, DO NOT use this.</li>
            <li> Everything  but the one where I sent you an e-mail that  the top of the bottle was broken and could not be used. I just transfered it into my empty bottle and used it.  Love the stuff</li>
            <li> The product was recommended by a fellow user. I love the product but I cannot find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> stinky! doesn&#x27;t work.  Doesn&#x27;t thicken hair</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair, used it for a brief time and then couldn&#x27;t find it again.  It makes my hair appear thick and shiny as well as manageable.  I highly  recommend it.  Thanks Amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li> Its just OK....would like it to be a stonger hold than it is.......for hair thickener or volumizer.perhaps there is a better product than this for stronger hold.</li>
            <li> Great price! fast shipping. I will definitely buy again from seller Thank you</li>
            <li> Product was damaged and 1/4 of it leaked out of the bottle into the packaging. Other then that, it works great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all. Doesn&#x27;t offer volume or anything, really. I&#x27;m a product whore and this is at the very bottom of my list. Bedhead, It&#x27;s a 10, B&amp;Sexy, Rusk are all better options.</li>
            <li> The product was OK, but not that great. The nozzle broke off the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Helps give my thin hair a little boost at the scalp where I need it; better then most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Delivery was exact Love it 😉</li>
