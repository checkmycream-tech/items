            <li> Okay so the item actually got to me in about two weeks and I was really happy. The images were a bit small but my nails at the moment are pretty short. It would t really work with my longer nails but for now it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> this plate it&#x27;s really small it is okay for short nails i guess but if you have long nails you are going to need a way to stamp the design twice</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work , my sister and I bougth this stamping plate because has pretty designs but we have the same problem the disgns never get to the stamper, we used with special nail polish for stamping and doesn&#x27;t work at all ,we have others plates that work just fine</li>
            <li> Not to bad, and not good</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t rate yet haven&#x27;t received it yet but I know I will enjoy it</li>
            <li> After waiting for 24 days, it was a little earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have extremely small finger nails it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;Finally got it but all the designs were soo small, cute design too bad!! maybe only good for toe nails and pinky! And the sides are soo sharp had to file it but still sharp.... Not buying this again!</li>
            <li> arrived on time, in great condition, works great and was exactly as shown. some of these pick up better than others but a few are large enough to cover my entire nail</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it properly yet, but when I do, I&#x27;ll give it 5 .</li>
            <li> This was a great product,except when u take the plastic off it mat cut your finger badly being that the edges are very sharp .</li>
            <li> I have medium lenght nails and the images are a bit on the small side, for either short nails or girls&#x27; nails...other than that they work fine. It came earlier than expected which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Love this stamping plate. Lots of great designs all on this one plate.  I&#x27;m hoping they make other plates too.</li>
            <li> these were horrible. The etchings aren&#x27;t nearly as deep as they should be. Extremely thick polishes are the only things that work - Opi wasn&#x27;t even taking! Even then, I had to put two layers of polish down, and &#x27;roughen&#x27; my stamper every. single. time. I know it&#x27;s not the polish or the stamper, as other plates work fine.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t even get this for a beginner, they&#x27;ll just become frustrated with lack of results.&lt;br /&gt;Only polishes that seem to work well is Kleancolor - which is surprising as it&#x27;s an off brand.</li>
            <li> Horrible plate. The groove designs are not deep enough so the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the image every time. The edges around the plate are super sharp, so handle with care. Each design square is small so it may not cover the entire nail. Only works with certain, very thick polish.</li>
            <li> Cool plate. Love the designs. The possibilities would be endless. Love that it came in a very timely manner. Thanks.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE ABSOLUTELY SO MUCH. THEY MAKE REALLY CUTE DESIGNS IN LESS TO KNOW TIME!</li>
            <li> I will not stamp but i love the designs. I really wish it would work. ? :(</li>
            <li> I wish u could give 0 stars becouse this thing is a poce if s***e</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with the stamper, so it&#x27;s pretty much useless. If it came with the stamper, I would have given this a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> Does not transfer design to nails.... Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work and is very sharp I even cut my self I tried to contact the seller for a refund and they just ignored me..so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all..</li>
            <li> It was bent when I received it</li>
