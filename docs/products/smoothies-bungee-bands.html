            <li>Do not buy this product for own use.  </li>
            <li>Your ponytails will hold high and proud!!!</li>
            <li>so glad that I could find them.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and great</li>
            <li>Tried it some more and never got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>but there aren&#x27;t many instances when I have a ton of time to just play with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would love to know what the additional $1.49 went towards.</li>
            <li>Will definitely by more soon.</li>
            <li>maybe they&#x27;ll work better if someone else can put it in my hair.</li>
            <li>These bungees are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Easy to use; better than pulling hair through bands.</li>
            <li>Rusts easily but does the job</li>
            <li>Stretch out very quickly</li>
            <li>These little items are awesome.</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of hair and run through bands and scrungees, these bungees let you customize the fit to you.  </li>
            <li>OK, if it takes you a couple times to get it just right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read up on them first and hooked them to my hair and not the hooks to the hooks.</li>
            <li>This worked much better for me as I experienced little or no tangles from the hooks of the bungee bands..</li>
            <li>and I did, these are far better than the regular hair bungees no pulling or hair breakage easy to use and great for the hair</li>
            <li>The bands can easily be bent and stretched to hold your hair in a more secure way.</li>
            <li>Great little hook bands.</li>
            <li>The hook wasn&#x27;t as curved so it wouldn&#x27;t stay secure very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still worth it.   </li>
            <li>This was a joke, right?</li>
            <li>yeah right,</li>
            <li>It make a gorgeous ponytail but it needs practice to get it on right &amp; not to slip down.</li>
            <li>Works great on my thick 4c hair.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Diane brand that I used because they last longer.  </li>
            <li>These were great, although not very durable, the end hooks popped out after a short while and there is not way to fix it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone especially if you want to keep healthy hair.</li>
            <li>If the ends were reinforced, I would certainly repurchase.</li>
            <li>no hair removal &amp; much easier</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them much</li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to but it works great, make sure you pinch it at the base of the elastic when winding it around your hair, otherwise you can break it faster</li>
            <li>I use mine almost daily and can gather my hair and fasten it quickly.</li>
            <li>They seem to be decently made.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend for easy up due.</li>
            <li>i settled on the Pulleze bands, which seem more durable (hasn&#x27;t stretched out yet like regular bands</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to those with thick hair who want a nice hold for their ponytail.</li>
            <li>i have fine mostly straight hair but a lot of it (medium thickness, long length pony) &amp; tried these because regular elastic bands pull my hair out every time i pull my motorcycle helmet off.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I am a junkie of trying new things.</li>
            <li>What surprised me was they held my heavy &amp;#34;dread&amp;#34;-locs in an elegant bun without overly pulling.</li>
            <li>I think I finally know how to use them properly and they maintain my style better than traditional ponytail holders.</li>
            <li>I then decided to used a rubberband first to hold my ponytail and then the bungee band second.</li>
            <li>I like the idea behind the bungee bands and once I figured out how to use the product, it does a nice job of holding my thick hair up into a nice ponytail.</li>
            <li>maybe for very thick/curly hair that it only has to wrap around once, but those that say hook it to hair &amp; wrap</li>
            <li>The hooks don&#x27;t seem to grab hair very well, and the second one in a month just fell off.</li>
            <li>While they pull a bit it was not painful or noticeable after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>When I want to wear my hair up or back I LIVE BY wearing these.</li>
            <li>I have really thick, long hair and wanted to be able to keep up my ponytail.</li>
            <li>or maybe their hair isn&#x27;t straight &amp; fine, but these are useless to me.</li>
            <li>Good idea, but very difficult to use on yourself.  </li>

            <li> Good idea, but very difficult to use on yourself.  </li>
            <li> When I first got these bands, I had a hard time using them.  </li>
            <li> I certainly should have paid attention to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the other reviews -- these are so simple to use</li>
            <li> Would HIGHLY recommend especially if your hair is thick!</li>
            <li> but because you can keep wrapping around, you can still get them tight enough.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and very thick and these work so well and don&#x27;t pull out I my hair like regular hair ties.  </li>
            <li> These arrived in 2 days as expected.</li>
            <li> it was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> The cords were so small that I think only a child can use it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews, the elastic is weak and separated from the hook after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Also, because they are not too tight and do not pull or tug at your hair, they are less damaging then others.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick (afro type) and long.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I can find another use for them because it is too much trouble to return them.</li>
            <li> I have semi thick tight curly hair, these work wonders to keep the ponytail tight and neat.</li>
            <li> I use this to tie up my daughter&#x27;s thick hair in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> All the people who gave it a bad review in my opinion are obviously not coordinated or have a brain.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> The absolute worst part was being forced to pay $1.95 shipping since these arrived in a business sized envelope and the seller used a Forever stamp to mail them to me.  </li>
            <li> However, the product is weak at the two ends.</li>
            <li> I found these very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Kinda poor quality.</li>
            <li> I get sloppy results every time I do it myself</li>
            <li> They are NO good for hair!</li>
            <li> I was distraught when I thought I lost one of the three I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to hold hair and wrap bungee.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re almost impossible to put it on by yourself.</li>
            <li> and she had very bad experience with it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as good as the ones I used to get at Sally&#x27;s. The hook could be thicker</li>
            <li> Kinda poor quality. Rusts easily but does the job</li>
            <li> I used these years ago when they used to sell them in a store close-by and have been searching for them ever since.  I don&#x27;t understand the other reviews -- these are so simple to use and they make the coolest ponytails which cannot be done with regular ponytail holders.   Hook to your hair, wrap it around, hook the second one....that simple.  OK, if it takes you a couple times to get it just right it&#x27;s still worth it.   Easier on my hair and no ponytail holder headaches by the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I found these very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Good idea, but very difficult to use on yourself.  Do not buy this product for own use.  It&#x27;s very difficult to hold hair and wrap bungee.  I haven&#x27;t used it on another person.  Using this product is a two person job.</li>
            <li> It did what I needed it to do. I&#x27;m glad I read up on them first and hooked them to my hair and not the hooks to the hooks. Works great on my thick 4c hair.</li>
            <li> This was a joke, right? I certainly should have paid attention to the negative reviews.  Hopefully I can find another use for them because it is too much trouble to return them. They are NO good for hair!</li>
            <li> I use this to tie up my daughter&#x27;s thick hair in a ponytail. It make a gorgeous ponytail but it needs practice to get it on right &amp; not to slip down.</li>
            <li> These little items are awesome. I have semi thick tight curly hair, these work wonders to keep the ponytail tight and neat. I love the smoothies! Just ordered another set.</li>
            <li> These arrived in 2 days as expected. What surprised me was they held my heavy &amp;#34;dread&amp;#34;-locs in an elegant bun without overly pulling. While they pull a bit it was not painful or noticeable after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I like the idea behind the bungee bands and once I figured out how to use the product, it does a nice job of holding my thick hair up into a nice ponytail. However, the product is weak at the two ends. Like other reviews, the elastic is weak and separated from the hook after only a couple of uses. The elastic needs to be stronger and/or reinforced at the hook ends so that it doesn&#x27;t separate.</li>
            <li> it was not what I had expected. The cords were so small that I think only a child can use it.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but it works great, make sure you pinch it at the base of the elastic when winding it around your hair, otherwise you can break it faster</li>
            <li> No sign of hair tie but may not hold thin/small amounts of hair. Perfect for buns. Unlike hair ties, they last!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she had very bad experience with it. The hook wasn&#x27;t as curved so it wouldn&#x27;t stay secure very well. And the hook came out for TWO of the cords after a couple of uses. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> i have fine mostly straight hair but a lot of it (medium thickness, long length pony) &amp; tried these because regular elastic bands pull my hair out every time i pull my motorcycle helmet off. maybe for very thick/curly hair that it only has to wrap around once, but those that say hook it to hair &amp; wrap around~ yeah right, or maybe their hair isn&#x27;t straight &amp; fine, but these are useless to me. i settled on the Pulleze bands, which seem more durable (hasn&#x27;t stretched out yet like regular bands do) no hair removal &amp; much easier once i got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these smoothies because these are what my mother would use on our head when I was a child and one day I was sitting at home after letting my hair grow out and said I wonder if I can find these hair fasteners on line and I did, these are far better than the regular hair bungees no pulling or hair breakage easy to use and great for the hair so glad that I could find them. shipping was fast and great I highly recommend to anyone especially if you want to keep healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Stretch out very quickly</li>
            <li> I tried it. Tried it again. Tried it some more and never got the hang of it. I saw a YouTube video of a hairstylist recommend this which is why I bought it. I have really thick, long hair and wanted to be able to keep up my ponytail. Didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick (afro type) and long.  I bought these because I am a junkie of trying new things. When I want to wear my hair up or back I LIVE BY wearing these. I was distraught when I thought I lost one of the three I have. I cannot find them in the store anymore. But these are so AWESOME!!! Would HIGHLY recommend especially if your hair is thick!</li>
            <li> Much better than the Diane brand that I used because they last longer.  My hair is natural and very thick and these work so well and don&#x27;t pull out I my hair like regular hair ties.  they do stretch out but because you can keep wrapping around, you can still get them tight enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even gotten mine yet, but I have had them before but couldn&#x27;t find them at any store. All the people who gave it a bad review in my opinion are obviously not coordinated or have a brain. It can be done with one person just used your head and they work.</li>
            <li> Loved it. I bought this style of bungees for my hair 20 years ago on an open market in Istanbul, Turkey and I had never seen them again. Your ponytails will hold high and proud!!! Great little hook bands.</li>
            <li> These bungees are pretty good. I think I finally know how to use them properly and they maintain my style better than traditional ponytail holders. I haven&#x27;t used them much so I can&#x27;t speak to their durability but I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The item is great for someone who has course hair.  The bands can easily be bent and stretched to hold your hair in a more secure way.</li>
            <li> When I first got these bands, I had a hard time using them.  I would use the bands alone and the hooks would get all tangled in my hair.  It was a disaster.  I then decided to used a rubberband first to hold my ponytail and then the bungee band second. This worked much better for me as I experienced little or no tangles from the hooks of the bungee bands.. I would recommend this product to those with thick hair who want a nice hold for their ponytail.</li>
            <li> Very handy item, They hold well and at a great price. I use mine almost daily and can gather my hair and fasten it quickly.</li>
            <li> These were great, although not very durable, the end hooks popped out after a short while and there is not way to fix it. If the ends were reinforced, I would certainly repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have to practice using these but there aren&#x27;t many instances when I have a ton of time to just play with my hair.  They seem to be decently made.  The absolute worst part was being forced to pay $1.95 shipping since these arrived in a business sized envelope and the seller used a Forever stamp to mail them to me.  I would love to know what the additional $1.49 went towards.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; better than pulling hair through bands. Would recommend for easy up due. Will definitely by more soon.</li>
            <li> These ponytail bungees are the best!  If you have a lot of hair and run through bands and scrungees, these bungees let you customize the fit to you.  Also, because they are not too tight and do not pull or tug at your hair, they are less damaging then others.  Try them and once you do, you will never want to go back to a scrungee again.</li>
            <li> Useless....does not hold anything. Just stay away.</li>
            <li> The hooks don&#x27;t seem to grab hair very well, and the second one in a month just fell off. Not good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re almost impossible to put it on by yourself. I get sloppy results every time I do it myself (hair pieces falling out of the pony tail, rigid bumps, etc.) I&#x27;m gonna have my girlfriend help me out...maybe they&#x27;ll work better if someone else can put it in my hair.</li>
