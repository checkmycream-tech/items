            <li>It all works in the end, but though I love Tree of Life&#x27;s retinol and vitamin C moisturizers</li>
            <li>Thank you, Tree of Life.tle mostly unused.  </li>
            <li>I love the moisturizing retinol</li>
            <li>If I could add more stars to rate them, I would.</li>
            <li>This is LOVELY, lightweight and velvety.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products.  </li>
            <li>Someone may do better within 3-4 weeks, someone else may find improvement after 6 weeks or 2 months.  </li>
            <li>I think, finally I have found good products with great price from Tree of Life Beauty :-).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I started taking biotin.</li>
            <li>Putting this cream on felt very cool and refreshing</li>
            <li>I was so excited when seeing it!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the most pure and effective creams I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love the feeling of thie cream, so far so good</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has a very light, almost unnoticeable scent.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it absorbed quickly</li>
            <li>The price is also better than good for the results I get so overall</li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother and more even right away.  </li>
            <li>It feels very clean and fresh...</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this Matrixyl containing moisturizer to add to my routine face maintenance (retinol, vitamin C serum and gel, sunscreen, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This company (Tree of Life) is a company completely dedicated to making sure their customers are satisfied with their products.  </li>

            <li>I can see my skin improves more every day as the skin turns out so soft, more radiant and brighten.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and absorbs right into the skin, but you can still feel the moisture.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I liked its clean sent and how far it went without leaving my skin feeling covered in oil.  </li>
            <li>Really looking forward to the continued improvements that are sure to come.</li>
            <li>I am trying it for the first time, so I am excited to see results after a month.</li>
            <li>They told me to go ahead and keep the bottle which I will gladly accept and now continue to use it on my neck and chest which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as my face.  </li>
            <li>They told me to go ahead and keep the bottle which I will gladly accept and now continue to use it on my neck and chest which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as my face.  </li>
            <li>I love that it smells natural (as it should).  </li>
            <li>Then, after a month, I can see some of my brown spots from the old acne lighter and the skin turns more radiant and brighten.</li>
            <li>This is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>They were quick and efficient in sending the product and had very fast customer service responses.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the Matrixyl Anti Aging Moisturizer was at night after cleansing with mild liquid soap followed by a gentle scrub.</li>
            <li>I accepted gratefully and offered to send back the bottle mostly unused.  </li>
            <li>I have only had a fabulous experience with Tree of Life Beauty products and customer service!</li>
            <li>And while my skin is healthy - my morning and evening routine with these products has gotten me closer to my ultimate goal:</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much sleep, and this product helps hide that!</li>
            <li>I was about to purchase another set, but lucky that I got a free 2-oz retinol moisturizer sample last week.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, after the second week of using them, I only feel my skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The cream itself works absolutely great on my skin, after numerous searches I finally can say I found my product - skin brightened up, toned and evened out, dark spots are vanishing and on latest pictures my face looks airbrushed which surprised me a lot.</li>
            <li>I am trying this particular product for the first time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on it yet, and so I&#x27;ve been experimenting.  </li>
            <li>The Tree of Life products are amazing---all of them so far that I have tried for anti-aging products and the price is beyond worth it.</li>
            <li>so I could put my make up on straight after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus I love the freebies, comes with samples of their other products</li>
            <li>highly recommend Tree of Life as a company as well.  </li>
            <li>I seemed to be none the worse for wear despite the mild stinging, but many beauty experts recommend not using products that cause any stinging.  </li>
            <li>Since starting, fine lines are definitely reduced.</li>
            <li>So fun to finally have a moisturizer that goes on smooth, covers with such a small amount and then absorbs so quickly and doesn&#x27;t get oily when I put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised to smell peppermint and immediately upon contact with my face, I felt a stinging sensation.  </li>
            <li>Just wanted to let you know I am using daily clean scrubs to wash the face, then applying anti-aging, then retinol moisturizers on, then applying sunscreen (only for day time).</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and specially my eyes easier to get red from facial  lotion or cream.</li>
            <li>I used this product along with the other Tree of Life products and I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly I saw results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to always follow advice, but I have wondered why Tree of Life uses peppermint in this face product, a known irritant for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I will order from this company again and again based on the products they offer as well as their complete integrity.  </li>
            <li>I will order from this company again and again based on the products they offer as well as their complete integrity.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night and my skin is soft but never greasy.  </li>
            <li>However, after trying these products from Tree of Life Beauty, I have no problem with it so far.</li>
            <li>It claims to be natural</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s too early to see changes.</li>
            <li>I see a real difference in my skin--not nearly as dry in this winter weather.</li>
            <li>am a 54 year old female.</li>
            <li>At times I&#x27;ll add AHA&#x27;s, but for my sensitive skin, only occasionally.</li>
            <li>Absorbs well for my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve been doing lately is to use this moisturizer for my neck and forehead which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as as the rest of my face; and I use another Matrixyl product with no scents (either natural or not) on those parts sensitive to this product.</li>

            <li> Throw away your other products - you simply won&#x27;t need them.</li>

            <li> I am an Aesthetician and spent over 4 years in the luxury skin care industry in NYC.</li>
            <li> I wrote my review, I received an email from Tree of Life offering me a refund for the Matrixyl Anti Aging Moisturizer due to my sensitivity to the peppermint.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this and the other 3 I am using.</li>
            <li> I started with the Retinol with Hyaluronic acid cream and received 3 other samples.</li>
            <li> I saw some friends that I had not seen in a few months and every single one commented on my skin.</li>
            <li> We should give it a try at least 6-8 weeks as everyone has different skin types and textures.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> The brown spots  and some small wrinkle lines lighter and lighter.  </li>
            <li> Since I only use the scrub once a day, I tried it when I didn&#x27;t use the scrub, and it still stung a little, but not too badly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was excited to try this Matrixyl containing moisturizer to add to my routine face maintenance (retinol, vitamin C serum and gel, sunscreen, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I use some of the products at night such as this one, and some during the day.  At times I&#x27;ll add AHA&#x27;s, but for my sensitive skin, only occasionally. The first time I tried the Matrixyl Anti Aging Moisturizer was at night after cleansing with mild liquid soap followed by a gentle scrub. I was very surprised to smell peppermint and immediately upon contact with my face, I felt a stinging sensation.  I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on it yet, and so I&#x27;ve been experimenting.  Since I only use the scrub once a day, I tried it when I didn&#x27;t use the scrub, and it still stung a little, but not too badly. I never mix it with my retinol products now either.  I seemed to be none the worse for wear despite the mild stinging, but many beauty experts recommend not using products that cause any stinging.  I&#x27;m not one to always follow advice, but I have wondered why Tree of Life uses peppermint in this face product, a known irritant for sensitive skin.  What I&#x27;ve been doing lately is to use this moisturizer for my neck and forehead which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as as the rest of my face; and I use another Matrixyl product with no scents (either natural or not) on those parts sensitive to this product. It all works in the end, but though I love Tree of Life&#x27;s retinol and vitamin C moisturizers, I probably won&#x27;t order this one again once it&#x27;s gone just because it is a hassle putting only here or there and not all over my face and neck. Oh and the jury is still out on any skin improvement as I&#x27;ve only just started using it.  I&#x27;ll try and update this review after about 8 weeks of use to report any improvements I see.&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/2/15&lt;br /&gt;After I wrote my review, I received an email from Tree of Life offering me a refund for the Matrixyl Anti Aging Moisturizer due to my sensitivity to the peppermint.  I accepted gratefully and offered to send back the bottle mostly unused.  They told me to go ahead and keep the bottle which I will gladly accept and now continue to use it on my neck and chest which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as my face.  This company (Tree of Life) is a company completely dedicated to making sure their customers are satisfied with their products.  They go out of their way to ensure this and I find myself in awe.  In addition to treating me fairly and beyond, they have also offered me a free bottle of one of my favorite products (which I was invited to choose from their products on Amazon), the Tree of Life Vitamin C eye gel.  I will order from this company again and again based on the products they offer as well as their complete integrity.  Thank you, Tree of Life.tle mostly unused.  They told me to go ahead and keep the bottle which I will gladly accept and now continue to use it on my neck and chest which aren&#x27;t as sensitive as my face.

            <li> I use three of the produts (not the eye gel). Since starting, fine lines are definitely reduced. I saw some friends that I had not seen in a few months and every single one commented on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it reduces any wrinkles but it is a great moisturizer, very light. Absorbs well for my dry sensitive skin.  Plus I love the freebies, comes with samples of their other products</li>
            <li> Did not live up to the hype. My skin did not improve.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Tree of Life porducts!</li>
            <li> I am trying this particular product for the first time. I love the moisturizing retinol cream.&lt;br /&gt;This company stands by their products,  you can buy with confidence.  Their CSR are great.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service and great products makes us loyal consumers.</li>
            <li> So fun to finally have a moisturizer that goes on smooth, covers with such a small amount and then absorbs so quickly and doesn&#x27;t get oily when I put on my makeup.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the most pure and effective creams I have ever used.  It goes on easily and absorbs right into the skin, but you can still feel the moisture.  I love that it smells natural (as it should).  It feels very clean and fresh... I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Pump Doesn&#x27;t Work! And scent is bothersome</li>
            <li> I have only had a fabulous experience with Tree of Life Beauty products and customer service! If I could add more stars to rate them, I would. Somehow 5 stars just isn&#x27;t enough.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 54 year old female. And while my skin is healthy - my morning and evening routine with these products has gotten me closer to my ultimate goal: Have great looking skin without makeup! Tree of Life Beauty products makes that end goal attainable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using their products for only a month by the way...I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the price is a great deal! Throw away your other products - you simply won&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> Excellent ... the product ingredients are as advertised. Very happy with the vibrate and refreshed look.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tree of Life products for over a month and am amazed how it has&lt;br /&gt;softened my wrinkles and I have had comments, &amp;#34;what are you doing? You are looking so great.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Needles to say this makes me very happy.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product.  My skin felt smoother and more even right away.  Really looking forward to the continued improvements that are sure to come.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I don&#x27;t get much sleep, and this product helps hide that!</li>
            <li> I am an Aesthetician and spent over 4 years in the luxury skin care industry in NYC. This is LOVELY, lightweight and velvety. It adds hydration to even the deeper skin layer adding fulness to depleted skin. It&#x27;s a must for any regimen at this price!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products.  The Tree of Life products are amazing---all of them so far that I have tried for anti-aging products and the price is beyond worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, affordable moisturizer for awhile now and this one fits the bill.  I use it at night and my skin is soft but never greasy.  It absorbs quickly and has a very light, almost unnoticeable scent.  I love the way my skin feels using this!</li>
            <li> I bought anti aging and retinol moisturizers on Amazon based on the good reviews and have used them for more than 6 weeks. I have a very sensitive skin and specially my eyes easier to get red from facial  lotion or cream. Therefore, I am very careful when buying different skincare products. However, after trying these products from Tree of Life Beauty, I have no problem with it so far. To be honest, after the second week of using them, I only feel my skin so soft and smooth.  Then, after a month, I can see some of my brown spots from the old acne lighter and the skin turns more radiant and brighten. I was so excited when seeing it!  Then the 6th week passing by I can see my skin improves more every day as the skin turns out so soft, more radiant and brighten. The brown spots  and some small wrinkle lines lighter and lighter.  I was about to purchase another set, but lucky that I got a free 2-oz retinol moisturizer sample last week.  I think we should be patient when using skincare products. We should give it a try at least 6-8 weeks as everyone has different skin types and textures. Someone may do better within 3-4 weeks, someone else may find improvement after 6 weeks or 2 months.  I think Tree of Life beauty produces great skincare products with a great price. I wanted to try anothe skincare product skin rejuvenating cream.  Just wanted to let you know I am using daily clean scrubs to wash the face, then applying anti-aging, then retinol moisturizers on, then applying sunscreen (only for day time). I think, finally I have found good products with great price from Tree of Life Beauty :-). The only thing I am worrying about, their products are good, soon they will increase the price :-(</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of thie cream, so far so good</li>
            <li> Great service, item arrived on time, clean and neatly packaged with 3 additional samples and explanatory brochure. The cream itself works absolutely great on my skin, after numerous searches I finally can say I found my product - skin brightened up, toned and evened out, dark spots are vanishing and on latest pictures my face looks airbrushed which surprised me a lot. I would recommend this and the other 3 I am using. I started with the Retinol with Hyaluronic acid cream and received 3 other samples. After using it for just a week I started to see visible difference in my skin appearance. Samples ran out so I purchased the other 3 products now in regular size, so altogether I am using 4 products (two at night and two in the morning) and I can&#x27;t be happier with the results. It claims to be natural (what I&#x27;ve been looking for) so I am hoping I will settle with this product and would not have to be on a lookout for another one for a while. The price is also better than good for the results I get so overall I had a very good experience with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> This feels amazing on my skin. I am trying it for the first time, so I am excited to see results after a month.</li>
            <li> This is worth the price.  I see a real difference in my skin--not nearly as dry in this winter weather.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with the other Tree of Life products and I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly I saw results.  I have several sun spots and they were visibly lighter after about 3 weeks of using the product.  Putting this cream on felt very cool and refreshing and you could tell your skin was being hydrated.  It didn&#x27;t feel like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried that you can tell you are putting chemicals into your skin which is ultimately damaging.  I liked the fact that it absorbed quickly so I could put my make up on straight after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Tree of Life as a company as well.  They were quick and efficient in sending the product and had very fast customer service responses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to use a lot of moisturizer as I&#x27;ve always had oily skin.  However, with this product, I found it didn&#x27;t leave my face with an oily feeling and kept my face feeling fresher for hours.  I liked its clean sent and how far it went without leaving my skin feeling covered in oil.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s too early to see changes. I&#x27;m glad I started taking biotin.</li>
