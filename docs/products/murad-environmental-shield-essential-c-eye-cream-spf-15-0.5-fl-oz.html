            <li>Murad is one of the best products on the market.</li>

            <li>I have used this eye cream for years and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon at a reduced price.  </li>
            <li>Got a sample of this at Sephora and really liked it, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price in the store.</li>
            <li>So that kind of stunk,</li>
            <li>She is now happy with it.it worth money we gave.</li>
            <li>It seems like thats the best way to really combat fine lines and aging (by using sunscreen to prevent those things.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard great things about Murad and this is the first Murad product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>very light on my skin</li>
            <li>It blends nicely into my skin, and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that it has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>(have only been using about a week now), but definitely great for preventing signs of aging caused by the sun!</li>
            <li>Many eye creams do not.  </li>

            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do believe prevention is the best policy and that this SPF eye cream has protected my eyes from further sun damage.</li>

            <li>I love this product and have been using it for about a year.</li>
            <li>My face never looked better and I&#x27;m 67.</li>
            <li>I have some over the counter creams that are better.</li>
            <li>This product was ok.  </li>
            <li>I found the clinique products to be much better and much more affordable than murad.  </li>
            <li>i pressed the pump many times to get the cream.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Essential C Eye Cream is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to use Vitamin C products on my face.  </li>
            <li>and I swear this is definitely in my top three of all time.  </li>
            <li>I samples this at Massage Envy first then decided to buy it because I loved it.</li>
            <li>gave me a satisfaction that i was making a good choice in spending so much on an eye cream.</li>
            <li>This product does help reduce fine lines around the eyes as well as reduce puffiness.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes the puffiness out from under my eyes in the morning and smooths out fine lines.</li>
            <li>The product arrived as promised, it is really a great product for keeping your eyes look younger.</li>
            <li>It goes on luxuriously and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>When you put it on, it goes on your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Just use a tiny dab and spreads great.</li>
            <li>Excellent lightening fast next day shipping!</li>
            <li>With the sun being such a culprit in the aging department, it is so nice to have an eye cream with SPF!</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this product and was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>Gentle and love that it has SPF.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise I love this eye cream, and highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I love this so much that I just bought the salon size</li>
            <li>price of $44 is great compared to $60 from other places.</li>
            <li>(That being said Amazon has the best price, Sephora price&#x27;s are ridiculous)</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly, and you can then put concealer over it.  </li>
            <li>You should&#x27;t use RETINOL if you are pregnant.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to spend this amount of money, there are too many other good products out there to pick from.</li>
            <li>My dark circles and bags are greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what was listed in the description!</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a product burn my eyes!  </li>
            <li>If used properly though, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Makes a big difference ,each time you use it it you can see results that remain for the whole day; not permanently but each day the ssme good result</li>
            <li>It is rapidly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, does not irritate my eyes, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Early on when I had this eye cream, I dropped it, and the top broke.</li>
            <li>The cost is a bit of a challenge that is why I love Amazon I can usually find a deal much better than retail and have it mailed right to my door.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This cream is pretty pricey</li>
            <li>I initially got a sample size from Sephora and fell in love with it when I tried it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>If you come to close to the area under the eye in a short time it seems to creep into the eye and causes more irritation.</li>
            <li>If this eye cream changes my face it all or makes it shinier, it&#x27;s not enough to notice :).</li>
            <li>I actually use this on a bit more of my face than my eyes- on my nose and forehead.</li>
            <li>Oh, being an avid golfer, I&#x27;m out in the sun all the time-of course wearing  sunglasses too.</li>
            <li>HAD TO ORDER MORE, and this tube will last me forever.</li>
            <li>The price is much better than at local stores sometimes by</li>
            <li>Makeup goes over it really well too!</li>
            <li>My first bottle lasted about 4 months with twice-daily usage.</li>
            <li>Some eye creams can sting a ton if you accidentally get them in your eye, but the couple of times I have gotten this in my eye, it just barely stings for a minute or two, and then I am fine.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>dont want to wait until i really have eyes that look like they NEED a smathering of eye cream</li>
            <li>This really moisturizes the eye area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it much.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and helps with puffiness.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>and I feel it&#x27;s kind of a waste to use Murad&#x27;s at night since it has the spf in it.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 and my eye area seems to be holding &#x27;up&#x27; better than other areas on my face.  </li>
            <li>Great product but came half empty.</li>
            <li>My eye area feels firmer, and the fine lines haven&#x27;t gotten worse, even in this sunny, squint-worthy weather :)</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular Murad product (eye cream with the&#x27;C) since it came out.</li>
            <li>I got the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Eye Cream to use under and around my eyes in the daytime, mainly because I like the idea of using an eye cream with SPF in it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.  </li>
            <li>I love that it does not leave a greasy feel at all like many other eye creams and has an spf which is hard to find in eye creams.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin very very soft.  </li>
            <li>and it is exactly the same and the package arrives sealed.  </li>
            <li>More so than anything I have used in the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I have very dark circles; always have; and am beginning to see the start of some fine lines.  </li>
            <li>wanted something with natural plant extracts, caffeine, and UV protection...</li>
            <li>But the benefit far out</li>
            <li>I have been using it nearly every day for a month now.</li>
            <li>still need time to decide--but like so far</li>
            <li>I am 24 years old living in Miami</li>
            <li>But 30 minutes later, it was hurting my eyes for three hours straight and after that my eyes got swollen.</li>
            <li>It has no smell and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>has sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t sting sensitive eye area</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive and always gets aggravated.  </li>
            <li>Murad does a fine job of making products that ordinary women can afford and this product is one of them.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical to order cosmetics online in case they were old or somehow not as good as what they sell from the local retailers</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product for dark under eye circles and to reduce puffiness, while providing sun protection to the delicate eye skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin around my eyes and my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, and it definitely helps with fine lines and dark circles.</li>

            <li> My first bottle lasted about 4 months with twice-daily usage.</li>
            <li> Some eye creams can sting a ton if you accidentally get them in your eye, but the couple of times I have gotten this in my eye, it just barely stings for a minute or two, and then I am fine.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> dont want to wait until i really have eyes that look like they NEED a smathering of eye cream</li>
            <li> This really moisturizes the eye area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it much.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and helps with puffiness.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li> and I feel it&#x27;s kind of a waste to use Murad&#x27;s at night since it has the spf in it.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 and my eye area seems to be holding &#x27;up&#x27; better than other areas on my face.  </li>
            <li> Great product but came half empty.</li>
            <li> My eye area feels firmer, and the fine lines haven&#x27;t gotten worse, even in this sunny, squint-worthy weather :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular Murad product (eye cream with the&#x27;C) since it came out.</li>
            <li> I got the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Eye Cream to use under and around my eyes in the daytime, mainly because I like the idea of using an eye cream with SPF in it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.  </li>
            <li> I love that it does not leave a greasy feel at all like many other eye creams and has an spf which is hard to find in eye creams.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin very very soft.  </li>
            <li> and it is exactly the same and the package arrives sealed.  </li>
            <li> More so than anything I have used in the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark circles; always have; and am beginning to see the start of some fine lines.  </li>
            <li> wanted something with natural plant extracts, caffeine, and UV protection...</li>
            <li> But the benefit far out</li>
            <li> I have been using it nearly every day for a month now.</li>
            <li> still need time to decide--but like so far</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old living in Miami</li>
            <li> But 30 minutes later, it was hurting my eyes for three hours straight and after that my eyes got swollen.</li>
            <li> It has no smell and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> has sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t sting sensitive eye area</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive and always gets aggravated.  </li>
            <li> Murad does a fine job of making products that ordinary women can afford and this product is one of them.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to order cosmetics online in case they were old or somehow not as good as what they sell from the local retailers</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for dark under eye circles and to reduce puffiness, while providing sun protection to the delicate eye skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes and my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it definitely helps with fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> too thick, doesnt smell good and came with a broken seal.</li>
            <li> there are a lot of empty space in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;the product overall is good, making me feel safe against the sun, but it&#x27;s a little bit dry and difficult to spread out,i mean, compared with other eye cream.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t cause those little white dots that can form near your eye.  </li>
            <li> I always got those using other brands of eye cream such as Clinique&#x27;s all about eyes, which I now only use at night.  </li>
            <li> I started wearing this every day and the damage as completely stopped (no new lines), the circles have gone and the bags are less puffy.</li>
            <li> This and one other product are the only products every made that I am &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; allergic to in my eye area.  </li>
            <li> My eye area is too dry not to use a night cream</li>
            <li> This product was not new.</li>
            <li> I previously had a facial and this product was used.</li>
            <li> I only use about half a pump....</li>
            <li> I wish it were cheaper, but other than that, no complaints, and I think I will use it for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and do not have any negative reaction to this cream.</li>
            <li> but this has irritated my skin and does not really moisturize the area.  </li>
            <li> It leaves absolutely no white-cast.</li>
            <li> Be careful getting it too close to your eyeball</li>
            <li> And when I think of all the money spent on other brands, I want to cry.</li>
            <li> and the other day a colleague mentioned I seemed &amp;#34;well rested&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Extremely recommended this product, it works.</li>
            <li> other brands head to head with this</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Planning on trying some other Murad products when my others run out.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this again and intend to try other items by Murad.</li>
            <li> She tried other products before Murad.</li>
            <li> The other two are either discontinued or I can no longer justify the price.  </li>
            <li> I like the Vitamin C in the cream as I feel it reduces puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> and I have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes so an eye cream is a must.  </li>
            <li> Does it make my dark circles disappear?  </li>
            <li> Despite spending a fortune on eye creams, I noticed my eyes aging quite badly around 3 years ago with lots of fine lines appearing, heavy bags and dark circles.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of my dark circles in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday, even when I&#x27;m inside because you never know if you&#x27;ll be in the sun.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after a few days of using..</li>
            <li> half so ordering from Amazon is recommended!</li>
            <li> Many people complain that Murad&#x27;s eye cream burns terribly if it get&#x27;s into your eyes which I have to say that it does</li>
            <li> Not sure why the cream runs but stopped using.</li>
            <li> I look less tired.</li>
            <li> But if I do, at least my eyes won&#x27;t be puffy.</li>
            <li> Which is ridiculous, because it&#x27;s an eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I have never had allergic reaction this bad in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Shine and weird face texture are my usual issues with sunscreens.</li>
            <li> People have a very hard time guessing my age.  </li>
            <li> I no longer fear looking in the mirror upon awakening to find how tired and puffy my eyes are.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tired them all.</li>
            <li> This cream has made a dramatic difference in the appearance of my eyes.</li>
            <li> The Murad line is expensive, but you can expect quality ingredients for the price.</li>
            <li> Maybe I bought the wrong product</li>
            <li> Which means I don&#x27;t look tired even when I am!</li>
            <li> The teabags in my kitchen are used for tea, the cold spoons are for ice cream, and I can leave the cucumbers and potatoes off my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I couldn&#x27;t experience any results from this eyes cream!</li>
            <li> I tried this at least 10 times before I just gave up on it, it&#x27;s awful.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed because of that.</li>
            <li> Returned this product - it made my eyes automatically painfully tear every time I tried to use it!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. My eyes look happy and refreshed. I love that it has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> Great price. Product came with factory seal.</li>
            <li> I am a mid 30&#x27;s middle school teacher. One day a student told me that I reminded him of his grandmother. Grandmother? Really? That was enough. I previously had a facial and this product was used. I have been applying it to my eyes twice daily and the other day a colleague mentioned I seemed &amp;#34;well rested&amp;#34;. Done. Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and am happy to find an eye cream with SPF.</li>
            <li> too thick, doesnt smell good and came with a broken seal. Amazon great - returned it no problem</li>
            <li> Makes a big difference ,each time you use it it you can see results that remain for the whole day; not permanently but each day the ssme good result</li>
            <li> The product arrived as promised, it is really a great product for keeping your eyes look younger. Extremely recommended this product, it works.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream made by Murad.  Your eyes will look younger in no time with this cream.  It&#x27;s great at reducing puffiness in the morning and helps prevent wrinkles too.  People have a very hard time guessing my age.  I think Murad has some of the best skin care products.  The Murad line is expensive, but you can expect quality ingredients for the price.</li>
            <li> I did my research in eye creams. &lt;br /&gt;I wanted something with natural plant extracts, caffeine, and UV protection... &lt;br /&gt;Putting other brands head to head with this gave me a satisfaction that i was making a good choice in spending so much on an eye cream. &lt;br /&gt;To me this is all about preventative care.   &lt;br /&gt;I dont want to wait until i really have eyes that look like they NEED a smathering of eye cream, i intend to use this stuff to prevent just that. &lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price of $44 is great compared to $60 from other places. &lt;br /&gt;Make the investment to help your eyes.</li>
            <li> This really moisturizes the eye area.</li>
            <li> Great day eye cream. This cream is pretty pricey but I have to say it lasts me for about 9 - 10 months.  I initially got a sample size from Sephora and fell in love with it when I tried it.  (That being said Amazon has the best price, Sephora price&#x27;s are ridiculous) I love that it does not leave a greasy feel at all like many other eye creams and has an spf which is hard to find in eye creams.  It also doesn&#x27;t cause those little white dots that can form near your eye.  I always got those using other brands of eye cream such as Clinique&#x27;s all about eyes, which I now only use at night.  Switching to only nighttime use keeps those pesky white bumbs away.  My eye area is too dry not to use a night cream and I feel it&#x27;s kind of a waste to use Murad&#x27;s at night since it has the spf in it.  Many people complain that Murad&#x27;s eye cream burns terribly if it get&#x27;s into your eyes which I have to say that it does but that is IF it get&#x27;s into your eyes.  But the benefit far out way&#x27;s that con and plus it&#x27;s no different than getting eye makeup in your eye and that doesn&#x27;t deter me from wearing eye makeup either.  All and all a great eye cream, keeps the eye area moisturized and protected from the sun during the day without leaving a greasy feel.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I tried this at least 10 times before I just gave up on it, it&#x27;s awful.  It has a pleasant feel on the skin and it feels hydrating, but if you put it to close to the eye it stings.  Which is ridiculous, because it&#x27;s an eye cream.  So I tried not to get it too close the next times I used it...this cream migrates and every time I end up tearing up and crying because it stings soooo much.....So no thank you.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen in this product made my eyes burn-- I don&#x27;t really use it much.</li>
            <li> For years (decades, now that I think about it) I have been searching for an eye cream that reduces puffiness and makes my eyes look brighter in the morning.  This is the one.  I no longer fear looking in the mirror upon awakening to find how tired and puffy my eyes are.  The teabags in my kitchen are used for tea, the cold spoons are for ice cream, and I can leave the cucumbers and potatoes off my face.  It goes on luxuriously and the results are fantastic. I highly recommend it. And when I think of all the money spent on other brands, I want to cry. But if I do, at least my eyes won&#x27;t be puffy.</li>
            <li> been using it for years works great, one of many murad products that I use. I&#x27;ve tried others but this seems to work the best</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this product.  I have sensitive skin around my eyes and my skin is dry.  Maybe I bought the wrong product but this has irritated my skin and does not really moisturize the area.  If you come to close to the area under the eye in a short time it seems to creep into the eye and causes more irritation.</li>
            <li> Wonderful eye cream! With the sun being such a culprit in the aging department, it is so nice to have an eye cream with SPF! I&#x27;ve always heard great things about Murad and this is the first Murad product I&#x27;ve tried. I like it a lot, it hydrates well. Can&#x27;t say it does anything for eliminating wrinkles yet (have only been using about a week now), but definitely great for preventing signs of aging caused by the sun!</li>
            <li> Great product but came half empty. Disappointed because of that. Very tiny amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> I fell immediately in love with this product! I have been using it nearly every day for a month now. I bought it because it was on a recommendation list from celebrity make-up artist and tutorial video maker Lisa Eldridge. Shine and weird face texture are my usual issues with sunscreens. If this eye cream changes my face it all or makes it shinier, it&#x27;s not enough to notice :). I actually use this on a bit more of my face than my eyes- on my nose and forehead. I wish it were cheaper, but other than that, no complaints, and I think I will use it for a long time!</li>
            <li> Gentle and love that it has SPF.  Many eye creams do not.  Seems to have lightened up the eyes and diminished some lines!</li>
            <li> still need time to decide--but like so far</li>
            <li> Perfect! Shipped item appropriately for this Arizona heat. Excellent lightening fast next day shipping! Perfect product! I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it&#x27;s exactly what was listed in the description! Will shop again!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. Despite spending a fortune on eye creams, I noticed my eyes aging quite badly around 3 years ago with lots of fine lines appearing, heavy bags and dark circles. I started wearing this every day and the damage as completely stopped (no new lines), the circles have gone and the bags are less puffy. I do believe prevention is the best policy and that this SPF eye cream has protected my eyes from further sun damage. It&#x27;s also great for my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my eyes now.</li>
            <li> Wish I could afford every time I purchase MURAD!</li>
            <li> Thought I would give this a try based on the reviews. I spend a lot of money on skin care products so the price wasn&#x27;t a surprise. However it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a product burn my eyes!  Obviously it&#x27;s from the sunscreen in it. That doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to out sunscreen in an eye cream. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. If you&#x27;re willing to spend this amount of money, there are too many other good products out there to pick from. I&#x27;d pass on this.</li>
            <li> This product does help reduce fine lines around the eyes as well as reduce puffiness.  The cost is a bit of a challenge that is why I love Amazon I can usually find a deal much better than retail and have it mailed right to my door.</li>
            <li> Works great, just don&#x27;t accidentally get any of it in your eye-- it burns. I see a visible difference in the darkness of the area beneath the eye. I look less tired.</li>
            <li> Just opened this product and found it had been resealed.  This product was not new. The pump did not work.  The product appeared used.</li>
            <li> This cream has made a dramatic difference in the appearance of my eyes. My dark circles and bags are greatly diminished. Yay! I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product and was excited to use it. I am 24 years old living in Miami and I was looking for an eye cream with SPF in it. I used it yesterday as its direction says on the package. When you put it on, it goes on your skin smooth. But 30 minutes later, it was hurting my eyes for three hours straight and after that my eyes got swollen. My eyes have been swollen for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of good reviews about this product but just make sure you use a sample of it before spending $30 on it. I have never had allergic reaction this bad in my entire life. It may work for you but it is definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream! I buy all of Murad&#x27;s products. It&#x27;s very similar to Arbonne.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for about a year. I samples this at Massage Envy first then decided to buy it because I loved it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular Murad product (eye cream with the&#x27;C) since it came out. I am 60 and my eye area seems to be holding &#x27;up&#x27; better than other areas on my face.  I don&#x27;t have crows feet &#x27;yet&#x27;. Oh, being an avid golfer, I&#x27;m out in the sun all the time-of course wearing  sunglasses too. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for dark under eye circles and to reduce puffiness, while providing sun protection to the delicate eye skin.</li>
            <li> I received a tiny sample of this cream and used it for over 2 weeks every day.  Just use a tiny dab and spreads great. HAD TO ORDER MORE, and this tube will last me forever. My undereye skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t finish the bottle since I can&#x27;t handle the stinging in my eyes. Not sure why the cream runs but stopped using.</li>
            <li> This is the Only eye serum that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water and I&#x27;ve tired them all. My face never looked better and I&#x27;m 67.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was recommended by a friend.  I&#x27;ve used many eye creams and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It makes your skin very very soft.  I just started using neova eye cream but I am going back to Dr Murad.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for years and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon at a reduced price.  I like the Vitamin C in the cream as I feel it reduces puffiness and dark circles.  It is rapidly absorbed into the skin.  I recommend this product highly.  Murad does a fine job of making products that ordinary women can afford and this product is one of them.</li>
            <li> Returned this product - it made my eyes automatically painfully tear every time I tried to use it!</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this at Sephora and really liked it, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price in the store. As always, Amazon came through with the best price.&lt;br /&gt;It takes the puffiness out from under my eyes in the morning and smooths out fine lines. I only use about half a pump....a little goes a long way! I have sensitive skin and do not have any negative reaction to this cream. Planning on trying some other Murad products when my others run out.</li>
            <li> This eye cream feels great and moistures wonderfully.  I will purchase this again and intend to try other items by Murad.</li>
            <li> very light on my skin</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the ease of application, it has an SPF 15 and that it is a pump</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and I have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes so an eye cream is a must.  I have tried department store brands and drugstore brands including: Lancôme, Almay, Khiel&#x27;s, Strivectin, Perricone MD and I think this is the winner.  I like that it absorbs quickly, and you can then put concealer over it.  It has no smell and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I was skeptical to order cosmetics online in case they were old or somehow not as good as what they sell from the local retailers but I compared this with the bottle from Sephora and Ulta and it is exactly the same and the package arrives sealed.  The price is much better than at local stores sometimes by half so ordering from Amazon is recommended!</li>
            <li> Have used murad products for some time now,they are the best!!  I like the eye cream and moisturizer  for my face,would not use any thing else.</li>
            <li> has sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t sting sensitive eye area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I couldn&#x27;t experience any results from this eyes cream! I have some over the counter creams that are better.</li>
            <li> This product was ok.  I found the clinique products to be much better and much more affordable than murad.  Will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She tried other products before Murad. She is now happy with it.it worth money we gave.</li>
            <li> I love this product, does not irritate my eyes, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i pressed the pump many times to get the cream. there are a lot of empty space in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;the product overall is good, making me feel safe against the sun, but it&#x27;s a little bit dry and difficult to spread out,i mean, compared with other eye cream.</li>
            <li> This and one other product are the only products every made that I am &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; allergic to in my eye area.  Wonderful product.  Use it everyday, even when I&#x27;m inside because you never know if you&#x27;ll be in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream! I got the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Eye Cream to use under and around my eyes in the daytime, mainly because I like the idea of using an eye cream with SPF in it. It seems like thats the best way to really combat fine lines and aging (by using sunscreen to prevent those things.) I like that this product has Vitamin C in it as well.  It blends nicely into my skin, and absorbs very quickly. It leaves absolutely no white-cast. Makeup goes over it really well too! Some eye creams can sting a ton if you accidentally get them in your eye, but the couple of times I have gotten this in my eye, it just barely stings for a minute or two, and then I am fine. Early on when I had this eye cream, I dropped it, and the top broke. So that kind of stunk, but otherwise I love this eye cream, and highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Just now purchasing my second bottle of this stuff.. My first bottle lasted about 4 months with twice-daily usage. A little bit goes a long way, and it definitely helps with fine lines and dark circles. I noticed a difference after a few days of using.. Plus I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Be careful getting it too close to your eyeball cause it WILL burn. If used properly though, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. It has retinol, SPF 15  and Vitamin C in it. You should&#x27;t use RETINOL if you are pregnant.</li>
            <li> This is amazing eye cream.  It gets rid of my dark circles in just a few minutes.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Murad is one of the best products on the market. Essential C Eye Cream is wonderful.  Very soothing and helps with puffiness. I love it.  And, amazons pricing is great.</li>
            <li> I love this so much that I just bought the salon size so I don&#x27;t run out!  My eyes had started to have a darker tone under them and they already look brighter two weeks later.  Which means I don&#x27;t look tired even when I am!</li>
            <li> This might be the millionth eye cream I have tried.  I have very dark circles; always have; and am beginning to see the start of some fine lines.  I really like this cream.  More so than anything I have used in the past 5 years.  Does it make my dark circles disappear?  No.  And nothing will.  But what it does do is provide me with a perfect canvas to apply my concealer.  My eye area feels firmer, and the fine lines haven&#x27;t gotten worse, even in this sunny, squint-worthy weather :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to use Vitamin C products on my face.  My skin is too sensitive and always gets aggravated.  But I have had no problems with this.  I think I have read that some people experience stinging, but I have not.  I use it morning and night and it never stings even if I&#x27;m wearing my contacts.  I have tried every eye cream on the market in the last 10 years and I swear this is definitely in my top three of all time.  The other two are either discontinued or I can no longer justify the price.  When I bought this on amazon it was in the low $30 range.  Prices vary, so shop around.</li>
            <li> The only eye cream with SPF to use in the daytime. Love it!</li>
