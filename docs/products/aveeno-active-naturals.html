    <ol>
            <li>One of the best SPF face lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Love it, very happy to have found it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best sunscreen cum moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to be the best thing ever.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist is impressed.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist is impressed.</li>
            <li>you care about your skin, you should get this product as it is the best product to get in the price</li>
            <li>Aveeno is truly the best moisturizer there is</li>
            <li>The best lotion you can buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the 12 oz bottle is a generous size.  </li>
            <li>so I was happy to see Aveeno add SPF to their product.  </li>
            <li>Moisturiser is great for quenching your skin cells, however the UV rays will still damage your skin over time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy.</li>
            <li>I have had very good luck with Aveeno products, so I was thrilled to see this lotion with SPF 15.</li>
            <li>but it works as I have fair skin and have managed to stay burn-free for over a year now.</li>
            <li>Good moisture</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema and fragrance free Aveeno lotion works great.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s still an excellent and highly recommended lotion.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels better and shaving is a lot more pleasant.</li>
            <li>Found a lotion better for me.</li>
            <li>Most people forget about their hands when using sunscreen, but your hands can be more of a giveaway to your age than your face.</li>
            <li>I wanted a lotion with spf that would work for my arms and chest area for enough protection to feel better about sitting in the sun in traffic and this is perfect!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I could find it for cheaper than that as well.</li>
            <li>I love this because it includes sun screen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite skin lotion.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel like I need to use more lotion than I would with non-sunscreen lotion</li>
            <li>I love the Aveeno with SPF 15...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely good for hot sunny summer days.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry skin conditions.</li>
            <li>Very good basic moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Being allergic to the scents of most sunblocks, I was excited to get this lotion believing that customer&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li>And all other catch phrases that suggest that things are awesome.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs easily, and keeps my skin moist virtually all</li>
            <li>The smell can also easily be masked with perfume or cologne.</li>
            <li>It feels and smells like a cheap summer sunscreen</li>
            <li>and I didnt enjoy going to work with my face smelling like that all day</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and hydrated with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is as cheap as it gets.</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>Lightly fragranced.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to the skin</li>
            <li>Updated my review to five stars only because I love good service.</li>
            <li>Offers good sun</li>
            <li>i love this lotion, just right consistency&lt;</li>
            <li>I moved to a very warm sunny climate and my skin started drying out and I needed a daily SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a great, non-greasy moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling smooth, dare I say silky, all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bee using it daily for over a year and have noticed a pleasant improvement in how my skin looks and feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i like the pump, easy to control just the right amount&lt;</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have that strong sunscreen smell, and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin if I use it right after shaving my legs.  </li>
            <li>and then I can switch to Aveeno full</li>
            <li>Just order a full size bottle</li>
            <li>I was hoping this Aveeno would be even more gentle and mild, since it doesn&#x27;t contain perfume.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>it has a really pungent strong sunscreen smell.  </li>
            <li>The new formulation is much thicker and doesn&#x27;t absorb as easily or smell quite as nice as the older product.  </li>
            <li>, I just wanted to start with something smaller to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li>While the SPF isn&#x27;t as high as I&#x27;d like, it&#x27;s a good daily sunscreen/lotion for non-summer use.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after a shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is a excellant lotion and the sunblock is just right for my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I do use higher SPF if I&#x27;m exposed all day or swimming but for a daily product that doesn&#x27;t feel like sunscreen AND keeps my skin nice, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too keen on buying this again, but didn&#x27;t really find any other good moisturizers with SPF.</li>
            <li>This will most likely be my go to day</li>
            <li>- since I started using lotion every day my skin has been much softer, smoother, and generally looks and feels better and healthier.  </li>
            <li>It is more a sunblock going on, all white and&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li>Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno products, especially this lotion with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion!!</li>
            <li>Upon trying the lotion I found it to smell exactly like Coppertone sunblock.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great to have the same feel as my other Aveeno lotion but with protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>This lotion provides long lasting moisturization, as well as good sun protection for every day exposure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to forget to take care of the skin, especially the arms and legs, but it really does pay to keep it soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to forget to take care of the skin, especially the arms and legs, but it really does pay to keep it soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The minimal scent is pleasant and only noticeable when I literally put my nose an inch from my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only way I can remember to put sunscreen on every day, because I love the lotion and how soft it makes my skin, but I need the sunscreen for health and safety and to keep from prematurely aging!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a little of that sunscreen feel to make it a noticeable difference than the regular lotion, but absorbs and feels great.</li>
            <li>I really dislike lotions, I have oily skin and everything makes me break out and/or feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>Very thick.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>(I also use Retin-A micro, a very drying retinoid cream for acne).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really liking this Aveeno moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lotion absorbs readily.</li>
            <li>Goes in well, not too much slime.</li>
            <li>that is common with products with a fair amount of SPF protection.</li>
            <li>Very very good....cannot live without it....</li>
            <li>Love that there is a sunscreen too, but not irritating or break out causing (like other sunscreen/moisturizers have done.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I do recommend the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 15.uch softer, smoother, and generally looks and feels better and healthier.  </li>
            <li>I did learn that Aveeno tests on animals, however, so once I finish this bottle I may not buy another unless I absolutely cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>This is on the list of top products to buy for basic facial care.</li>
            <li>caused some irritation on one of my kids skin, but the older kids seem to like it.</li>
            <li>Granted, I still *much* prefer this sunscreen to any others I&#x27;ve found, especially since it&#x27;s broad spectrum, is light on the SPF</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I am very sensitive to sun screens and this one made my skin very itchy.</li>
            <li>The price it&#x27;s selling for is way too high.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>This product is almost exactly the same as the Aveeno Active Naturals non spf lotion, except it has 15SPF and a very light sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>it feels like normal body lotion on my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But just because I want skin protection doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell like suntan lotion or feel like I&#x27;ve slathered myself with some kind of greasy goo.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, it has SPF 15 protection that is a moderate amount of UVA/UVB protestion that is just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sun is the main enemy when it comes to making you look old.</li>
            <li>I really like this one because it sinks right in,</li>
            <li>The advantage this product has over the original active naturals lotion is the SPF15.</li>
            <li>My kids and I have eczema prone skin but its dry and hot in the desert where we live.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s hard to find in most lotions.</li>
            <li>We are not outside as much because of the heat</li>
            <li>Have sensitive skin and about a year ago reverted to using natural products.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows a completely organic moisturizer with a SPF of 15-30 please let me know the name.</li>
            <li>I use it to help prevent skin cancer, but I like how my skin seem soft, thick and more elastic.</li>
            <li>Not just when I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for extended periods of time, but even during a normal day when I&#x27;m only exposed to the sun while walking between buildings and cars.  </li>
            <li>However I will recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin any iritation, and as long as I don&#x27;t apply a second coating right away,the white film is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>It does have a slight odor, but it dissipates quickly - and that&#x27;s a personal preference thing anyway.</li>
            <li>The downside if of course the smell, however it is barely noticeable unless you put your nose to your skin and smell.</li>
            <li>The usual great aver no lotion quality with just a little SPF protection for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Love the sunscreen for her because it gives her a little protection without a  heavy sunscreen on school days.</li>
            <li>so I like that this also provides SPF 15 protection which is enough protection for the short periods of time that I am in direct</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a general statement for those who are lax on using a body lotion daily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a general statement for those who are lax on using a body lotion daily.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use the regular Active Naturals; that works very well for me.</li>
            <li>The usual suntan lotions were not something I would be able to make myself use everyday</li>

            <li> Unfortunately I am very sensitive to sun screens and this one made my skin very itchy.</li>
            <li> The price it&#x27;s selling for is way too high.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> This product is almost exactly the same as the Aveeno Active Naturals non spf lotion, except it has 15SPF and a very light sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> it feels like normal body lotion on my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But just because I want skin protection doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell like suntan lotion or feel like I&#x27;ve slathered myself with some kind of greasy goo.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, it has SPF 15 protection that is a moderate amount of UVA/UVB protestion that is just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sun is the main enemy when it comes to making you look old.</li>
            <li> I really like this one because it sinks right in,</li>
            <li> The advantage this product has over the original active naturals lotion is the SPF15.</li>
            <li> My kids and I have eczema prone skin but its dry and hot in the desert where we live.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to find in most lotions.</li>
            <li> We are not outside as much because of the heat</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin and about a year ago reverted to using natural products.</li>
            <li> If anyone knows a completely organic moisturizer with a SPF of 15-30 please let me know the name.</li>
            <li> I use it to help prevent skin cancer, but I like how my skin seem soft, thick and more elastic.</li>
            <li> Not just when I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for extended periods of time, but even during a normal day when I&#x27;m only exposed to the sun while walking between buildings and cars.  </li>
            <li> However I will recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin any iritation, and as long as I don&#x27;t apply a second coating right away,the white film is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor, but it dissipates quickly - and that&#x27;s a personal preference thing anyway.</li>
            <li> The downside if of course the smell, however it is barely noticeable unless you put your nose to your skin and smell.</li>
            <li> The usual great aver no lotion quality with just a little SPF protection for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Love the sunscreen for her because it gives her a little protection without a  heavy sunscreen on school days.</li>
            <li> so I like that this also provides SPF 15 protection which is enough protection for the short periods of time that I am in direct</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a general statement for those who are lax on using a body lotion daily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a general statement for those who are lax on using a body lotion daily.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the regular Active Naturals; that works very well for me.</li>
            <li> The usual suntan lotions were not something I would be able to make myself use everyday</li>
            <li> No moisturizer wasn&#x27;t right, lots of brands (from Olay and other drug store brands, to EL, Lancome, Clinique etc either didn&#x27;t do much, or made my face an oil slick after a few hours, or broke me out, etc.</li>
            <li> One pump on my hands soaks in quickly, what little scent there is dissipates after a few minutes, and my skin is moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Those rays really do affect the skin, even in small doses.  </li>
            <li> and I swear, this holds back some of the natural shine that usually come.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> For a long time, I have been using Lubiderm with SPF on my hands and chest.  </li>
            <li> It is a lotion and sunscreen all in one without the greasy feel of other similar products.</li>
            <li> I use this for my child who has dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, oily in places and dry in others.</li>
            <li> otherwise my face will feel dry.  </li>
            <li> This is a review of Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 15, 12 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I needed a daily moisturizer that provided a little bit of protection.  </li>
            <li> I like aveeno because it soothes my skin and is non greasy, So I decided to buy one with an SPF; it does leave a white film on my skin for a little while, didn&#x27;t expect that  with an SPF of 15.</li>
            <li> May be due to the fact that I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> When using this lotion especially in the sun you are fully covered, it&#x27;s a little harder to rub into the skin</li>
            <li> The few moisturizers that actually protects your skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> One of the few daily use lotions that has SPF 15.</li>
            <li> What I expected from Aveeno with spf.</li>
            <li> I put on the same amount I do with other products but this one left me feeling icky all day.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> As a fair-skinned lifelong Florida resident, former sun worshiper, and wife of someone who has had melanomas removed several times, I take protecting my skin from the sun fairly seriously.  </li>
            <li> Not many people know, but SPF is your basic anti ageing ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very, very minimal fragrance that is nothing like suntan lotion, and</li>
            <li> but the kids were getting dark just being in the car.  </li>
            <li> This is an okay product, but the smell is really annoying.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was a little too hopeful, as the lotion was too similar to other sunscreens (thick, sticky, long-lasting, etc)...</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because a previous customer stated that it doesn&#x27;t smell like suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell of sun screen is a bit off-putting but it fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten burned from everyday activities, though.</li>
            <li> It has a small amount of scent like sun tan lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use a stronger suntan lotion, but for the usual routine I think  SPF 15 is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure quite what to do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I try to avoid excessive time in the sun, there are times that I have to be in the sun</li>
            <li> Now I just have to get the last bit of Eucerin out of the bottle (don&#x27;t you hate it when the pump won&#x27;t suck up the last inch of product in the bottom of the bottle?)</li>
            <li> it goes on very thick and heavy, and ends up being mildly water repellent.  </li>
            <li> But it still had a little bit of a suntan-lotion-type of smell and felt a little weird on my skin</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s but still have oily skin, so finding something that suits me has been hard.</li>
            <li> I used to wash with Cetaphil cleanser and and then use Cetaphil moisturizer twice a day, but I began to notice that Cetaphil cream just sat on my skin and left it feeling shiny and clammy, while my skin still flaked off like crazy</li>
            <li> I do not feel like I&#x27;ve got thick, gooey lotion on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m going to be out working in the yard or doing some activity that will mean longer exposure</li>
            <li> also prefer my skincare products to have some subtle scent to it</li>
            <li> and so I have to take it seriously.</li>
            <li> How frustrating.</li>
            <li> In the past I was using a Eucerin lotion and that wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use my expensive skin products on these areas because the costs add up quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and everyone should be using sunscreen on their face because its constantly exposed and its terrible for acne</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very expensive to buy in Canada.</li>
            <li> very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate that feeling which is why I seldom used skin lotions in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For 3 days in a row, I wore this on my chest and hands and suffered horrible watery eyes and runny nose.  </li>

            <li> My kids and I have eczema prone skin but its dry and hot in the desert where we live.  I needed a daily moisturizer that provided a little bit of protection.  We are not outside as much because of the heat but the kids were getting dark just being in the car.  This did the job but it doesn&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
            <li> I use this for my child who has dry skin.  The SPF 15 is a plus.  It has a small amount of scent like sun tan lotion.  Overall, works well and non-greasy.  Excellent for dry skin conditions.</li>
            <li> Very good basic moisturizer with sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy, absorbs quickly. It does have a slight odor, but it dissipates quickly - and that&#x27;s a personal preference thing anyway.</li>
            <li> One of the best SPF face lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.  This will most likely be my go to day face lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> I really dislike lotions, I have oily skin and everything makes me break out and/or feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;....I moved to a very warm sunny climate and my skin started drying out and I needed a daily SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on a whim and I was so pleased! It soaks into the skin and while only SPF 15, it does provide protection, maybe not for a sunbathing session or swimming but it works as I have fair skin and have managed to stay burn-free for over a year now. I do use higher SPF if I&#x27;m exposed all day or swimming but for a daily product that doesn&#x27;t feel like sunscreen AND keeps my skin nice, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, very happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> smells like sunscreen</li>
            <li> Very very good....cannot live without it....it&#x27;s extremely good for hot sunny summer days. we all use it.....it&#x27;s the best sunscreen cum moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be the best thing ever. My room mates used it.  The inactive ingredients are not mentioned on the review. Include these too in the description. Found a lotion better for me. Updated my review to five stars only because I love good service. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Most people forget about their hands when using sunscreen, but your hands can be more of a giveaway to your age than your face. This lotion provides long lasting moisturization, as well as good sun protection for every day exposure. One pump on my hands soaks in quickly, what little scent there is dissipates after a few minutes, and my skin is moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Reddit approved! This is on the list of top products to buy for basic facial care. I bought it and agree!</li>
            <li> As a fair-skinned lifelong Florida resident, former sun worshiper, and wife of someone who has had melanomas removed several times, I take protecting my skin from the sun fairly seriously.  Not just when I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for extended periods of time, but even during a normal day when I&#x27;m only exposed to the sun while walking between buildings and cars.  Those rays really do affect the skin, even in small doses.  Because of that, a couple of years ago I started using a lotion with SPF 15 each and every day.  When I&#x27;m going to be out working in the yard or doing some activity that will mean longer exposure I&#x27;ll use a stronger suntan lotion, but for the usual routine I think  SPF 15 is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just because I want skin protection doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell like suntan lotion or feel like I&#x27;ve slathered myself with some kind of greasy goo.  The usual suntan lotions were not something I would be able to make myself use everyday so I went in search of a regular body lotion with SPF protection.  In the past I was using a Eucerin lotion and that wasn&#x27;t too bad.  But it still had a little bit of a suntan-lotion-type of smell and felt a little weird on my skin so when the bottle started to run low I looked around for another brand to try.  I ordered this Aveeno lotion based on the reviews and ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have to say the Eucerin is out and the Aveeno is in!  Very, very minimal fragrance that is nothing like suntan lotion, and it feels like normal body lotion on my skin.  The price is great and the 12 oz bottle is a generous size.  I&#x27;ll probably order the larger size when I run out, I just wanted to start with something smaller to see if I liked it.  Now I just have to get the last bit of Eucerin out of the bottle (don&#x27;t you hate it when the pump won&#x27;t suck up the last inch of product in the bottom of the bottle?) and then I can switch to Aveeno full time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - since I started using lotion every day my skin has been much softer, smoother, and generally looks and feels better and healthier.  My dermatologist is impressed. I can&#x27;t give Aveeno or Eucerin credit for that, though, since I also use another brand&#x27;s non-SPF lotion at night.  It&#x27;s just a general statement for those who are lax on using a body lotion daily.  It&#x27;s easy to forget to take care of the skin, especially the arms and legs, but it really does pay to keep it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I do recommend the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 15.uch softer, smoother, and generally looks and feels better and healthier.  My dermatologist is impressed. I can&#x27;t give Aveeno or Eucerin credit for that, though, since I also use another brand&#x27;s non-SPF lotion at night.

            <li> I have had very good luck with Aveeno products, so I was thrilled to see this lotion with SPF 15. Unfortunately I am very sensitive to sun screens and this one made my skin very itchy. I will continue to use the regular Active Naturals; that works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s but still have oily skin, so finding something that suits me has been hard. No moisturizer wasn&#x27;t right, lots of brands (from Olay and other drug store brands, to EL, Lancome, Clinique etc either didn&#x27;t do much, or made my face an oil slick after a few hours, or broke me out, etc. I received this aveeno with colloidal oatmeal as a bonus with a scrub cleanser, so tried it and my skin is smoother yet not oily and I swear, this holds back some of the natural shine that usually come. Love that there is a sunscreen too, but not irritating or break out causing (like other sunscreen/moisturizers have done.) Just order a full size bottle so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> It is more a sunblock going on, all white and&lt;br /&gt;well like sunblockish not at all like a body cream at all</li>
            <li> I wanted a lotion with spf that would work for my arms and chest area for enough protection to feel better about sitting in the sun in traffic and this is perfect! It&#x27;s got a little of that sunscreen feel to make it a noticeable difference than the regular lotion, but absorbs and feels great.</li>
            <li> The usual great aver no lotion quality with just a little SPF protection for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Offers good sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;- Good moisture levels.&lt;br /&gt;- Convenient open/close nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Very thick.&lt;br /&gt;- Container says non-greasy but it definitely felt greasy to me. I put on the same amount I do with other products but this one left me feeling icky all day.&lt;br /&gt;- The price it&#x27;s selling for is way too high. I saw it on Walmart.com for around $10 and I&#x27;m sure I could find it for cheaper than that as well. $15 is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also prefer my skincare products to have some subtle scent to it but this is fragrance-free, which you may or may not like. Not too keen on buying this again, but didn&#x27;t really find any other good moisturizers with SPF. So, yeah.</li>
            <li> I love this because it includes sun screen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. I have very dry skin and this is one of the rare moisturizer products I&#x27;ve used that works as advertised (and I&#x27;ve used at least a dozen).  It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs easily, and keeps my skin moist virtually all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everyone else, I also worry about sun exposure so I was happy to see Aveeno add SPF to their product.  The new formulation is much thicker and doesn&#x27;t absorb as easily or smell quite as nice as the older product.  Nonetheless, it&#x27;s still an excellent and highly recommended lotion.</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin and about a year ago reverted to using natural products. I like aveeno because it soothes my skin and is non greasy, So I decided to buy one with an SPF; it does leave a white film on my skin for a little while, didn&#x27;t expect that  with an SPF of 15. However I will recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin any iritation, and as long as I don&#x27;t apply a second coating right away,the white film is barely noticeable. Would have preferred that the manufacturer didn&#x27;t add  &amp;#34;methyl paraben&amp;#34; in this product, even though it is listed under inactive ingredients. If anyone knows a completely organic moisturizer with a SPF of 15-30 please let me know the name.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past it has a really pungent strong sunscreen smell.  It also made my face greasy.  it goes on very thick and heavy, and ends up being mildly water repellent.  It feels and smells like a cheap summer sunscreen and I didnt enjoy going to work with my face smelling like that all day</li>
            <li> This product is almost exactly the same as the Aveeno Active Naturals non spf lotion, except it has 15SPF and a very light sunscreen smell. The downside if of course the smell, however it is barely noticeable unless you put your nose to your skin and smell. The smell can also easily be masked with perfume or cologne. The advantage this product has over the original active naturals lotion is the SPF15. Not many people know, but SPF is your basic anti ageing ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun is the main enemy when it comes to making you look old. It damages your skin, and dries it out. Moisturiser is great for quenching your skin cells, however the UV rays will still damage your skin over time. This product comes with SPF15 which protects your skin from UVB and UVA rays, and will ALSO moisturise your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care about your skin, you should get this product as it is the best product to get in the price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturises well.&lt;br /&gt;- Helps with anti ageing. (SPF blocks sun damage to skin)&lt;br /&gt;- Unnoticeable smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the &amp;#34;stickier&amp;#34; lotions. But I like that it contains SPF</li>
            <li> Aveeno is truly the best moisturizer there is AND it comes with SPF.  It is not greasy and it lasts a long time.  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, oily in places and dry in others. I also have problems with rosacea and moderate acne. I used to wash with Cetaphil cleanser and and then use Cetaphil moisturizer twice a day, but I began to notice that Cetaphil cream just sat on my skin and left it feeling shiny and clammy, while my skin still flaked off like crazy (I also use Retin-A micro, a very drying retinoid cream for acne).&lt;br /&gt;So now I have begun to use Aveeno in the morning under my foundation and concealer, and Cetaphil cream at night. My skin feels so smooth and hydrated with this moisturizer. At night, the heavier duty Cetaphil still works because that&#x27;s when I apply my Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great moisturizer. The smell of sun screen is a bit off-putting but it fades after a few minutes. I did learn that Aveeno tests on animals, however, so once I finish this bottle I may not buy another unless I absolutely cannot live without it. Also, it&#x27;s very expensive to buy in Canada.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product, but the smell is really annoying. that is common with products with a fair amount of SPF protection. Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I have been using Lubiderm with SPF on my hands and chest.  I don&#x27;t like to use my expensive skin products on these areas because the costs add up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with Lubriderm is that it contains fragrance.  I was hoping this Aveeno would be even more gentle and mild, since it doesn&#x27;t contain perfume.  Not so.  For 3 days in a row, I wore this on my chest and hands and suffered horrible watery eyes and runny nose.  I&#x27;m not sure quite what to do.  I might just have to use face products on my chest and hands.  How frustrating.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 15, 12 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really liking this Aveeno moisturizing lotion. I put it on right after a shower in the morning. It is a great, non-greasy moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling smooth, dare I say silky, all day long. Moreover, it has SPF 15 protection that is a moderate amount of UVA/UVB protestion that is just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion absorbs readily. I do not feel like I&#x27;ve got thick, gooey lotion on my skin. I hate that feeling which is why I seldom used skin lotions in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I try to avoid excessive time in the sun, there are times that I have to be in the sun so I like that this also provides SPF 15 protection which is enough protection for the short periods of time that I am in direct sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this lotion has no added fragrance. The minimal scent is pleasant and only noticeable when I literally put my nose an inch from my skin. It provides all-day moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite skin lotion.</li>
            <li> The few moisturizers that actually protects your skin from the sun. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. This is your anti aging solution. This is as cheap as it gets. -20 years of aging</li>
            <li> Since I had two pre-melanoma spots removed a few months ago, I&#x27;ve tried to be really diligent about wearing an SPF lotion every day.  I really like this one because it sinks right in, doesn&#x27;t have that strong sunscreen smell, and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin if I use it right after shaving my legs.  While the SPF isn&#x27;t as high as I&#x27;d like, it&#x27;s a good daily sunscreen/lotion for non-summer use.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly and I like that it has sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products, especially this lotion with sunscreen.  I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t oily, moisturized my skin and didn&#x27;t have a sunscreen scent and I got all those in this product.  It&#x27;s so great to have the same feel as my other Aveeno lotion but with protection from the sun.  Highly recommend this lotion!!</li>
            <li> So I bought this because I always forget to put sunblock on my face and even a short time in the sun I burn. So I bought this hoping I could just use this as I moisturize daily. I have been using it, but it does have an oily feel to it like sunscreen and smells of sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and fragrance free Aveeno lotion works great.  Love the sunscreen for her because it gives her a little protection without a  heavy sunscreen on school days.</li>
            <li> The best lotion you can buy.  Plus it has sunscreen.  That&#x27;s hard to find in most lotions.</li>
            <li> Lightly fragranced.  Absorbs pretty fast.  Sometimes I feel like I need to use more lotion than I would with non-sunscreen lotion otherwise my face will feel dry.  May be due to the fact that I have dry skin.  Haven&#x27;t gotten burned from everyday activities, though.</li>
            <li> This is a excellant lotion and the sunblock is just right for my arms and legs. I use it daily during the spring, summer and fall months.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to the skin</li>
            <li> caused some irritation on one of my kids skin, but the older kids seem to like it.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion, just right consistency&lt;br /&gt;i like the pump, easy to control just the right amount&lt;br /&gt;i wish it was also sunblock</li>
            <li> One of the few daily use lotions that has SPF 15. Goes in well, not too much slime. Good value.</li>
            <li> When using this lotion especially in the sun you are fully covered, it&#x27;s a little harder to rub into the skin but once you&#x27;re done you don&#x27;t have to worry about sun burns you&#x27;re covered...</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because a previous customer stated that it doesn&#x27;t smell like suntan lotion. Being allergic to the scents of most sunblocks, I was excited to get this lotion believing that customer&#x27;s review. Upon trying the lotion I found it to smell exactly like Coppertone sunblock.....very disappointing. But, the product works well anyway, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the product would be similar to the regular Aveeno lotion -- but with SPF 15... Maybe I was a little too hopeful, as the lotion was too similar to other sunscreens (thick, sticky, long-lasting, etc)... Granted, I still *much* prefer this sunscreen to any others I&#x27;ve found, especially since it&#x27;s broad spectrum, is light on the SPF (so I can still tan), and Aveeno always makes products that don&#x27;t make my skin freak out. I still recommend it, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle lotion!</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. It is a lotion and sunscreen all in one without the greasy feel of other similar products.</li>
            <li> And all other catch phrases that suggest that things are awesome.  I started using this every day, not only does it help with occasional sunburns from walking out but my skin feels better and shaving is a lot more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of issues with skin cancer and my dermatologist recommended this product. I&#x27;ve bee using it daily for over a year and have noticed a pleasant improvement in how my skin looks and feel. It&#x27;s like my skin is 20 years younger. I use it to help prevent skin cancer, but I like how my skin seem soft, thick and more elastic.</li>
            <li> The product works well, does have a sunblock scent. No residue left on skin however if you sweat or get it on your cloths it will stain them&lt;br /&gt;Orange.</li>
            <li> I love the Aveeno with SPF 15... It&#x27;s the only way I can remember to put sunscreen on every day, because I love the lotion and how soft it makes my skin, but I need the sunscreen for health and safety and to keep from prematurely aging! I&#x27;ve had melanoma twice and so I have to take it seriously. I almost cried when my target stopped carrying it. Thank goodness for Amazon!!</li>
            <li> No would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this daily. It&#x27;s wonderful. What I expected from Aveeno with spf. I use another SPF protection dialy use lotion for my face, however.</li>
            <li> I have actually noticed my skin looking softer after switching to this and everyone should be using sunscreen on their face because its constantly exposed and its terrible for acne</li>
