            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it, I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>kinda had to fly by seat of her pants, but she figured it out quickly!</li>
            <li>these things are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Great skin care product to cleanse and smooth the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I scrubbed for about s good 2 minutes and then rinsed the suds off, I felt s huge difference!</li>
            <li>but that was probably my own fault by reading the product description as closely as I should have.</li>
            <li>but it is really nice for the price.</li>
            <li>The device is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The best product in the market so far.</li>
            <li>My wife purchased the Neutrogena microdermabrasion system and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>and I love when something I give is so well liked.</li>
            <li>It makes my face very smooth &amp; is very easy to use, but my face has never been my problem.</li>
            <li>But this was a good deal, its not the best, its a vibrator with the attachement, in other words it does not turn, it vibrates.</li>
            <li>Package came quickly and in good shape</li>
            <li>Remember that the FDA does not regulate cosmetics in this country and that your skin is the largest organ in your body, it easily absorbs any kind of toxic chemical you put on it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t stop touching my face</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>: Be sure to watch the \\&quot;NEUTROGENA\\&quot; tutorial on their website or on you tube.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and plan to buy one for each of my sisters.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>Great product that really works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is better than using the sponge alone.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered this.. I was going to buy a Clarisonic which is about $200</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the word \\&quot;microdermabrasion\\&quot; in the description.</li>
            <li>The deal was made even better by the inclusion of a holiday \\&quot;bonus pack,\\&quot; which consisted of additional microdermabrasion pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it, satisfactorily, for some time, until I started having difficulty finding more disposable cleaning pads.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s instructions recommends using their set 3 times a week, as I recall, versus my being able to use the Dove product every day, if I wanted.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth after using this product!</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the product, so I decided to buy one for my sister, also.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love the device.</li>
            <li>The product is OK.</li>
            <li>This holiday bundle is a great deal because the replacements pads alone can be very costly.</li>
            <li>I am very excited about this product.</li>
            <li>but this works just as good for a more reasonable price!</li>
            <li>She has wanted one for a long time and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I saw this set before the holidays, at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>Should be pretty good.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel like silk and gets it so clean!</li>
            <li>Love the easy way to attach the pads and the easy way to use it.</li>
            <li>Coming with the bonus pack made it a sweet deal!</li>
            <li>I got this Bonus set for a great price and love the results I am getting by using it daily.</li>
            <li>It is a visible improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to remember to use, because I am seeing results.</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate, and the cleansing pads happily produce more foam/soap than I thought they possibly could.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my doctor has commented on how nice my skin is (thanks, Mom!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update this in about a month to talk about an difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have light acne breakouts which improved</li>
            <li>It is worth the price and more.</li>
            <li>it gave me a smooth face</li>
            <li>I have light acne breakouts which improved</li>
            <li>My skin looks so smooth after one time using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth after I used it.  </li>
            <li>If you want to have smooth skin, give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my face felt amazingly smooth</li>
            <li>My face feels really, really smooth after use and seems to be improving in appearance.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I only use when I need to but great product to have around.</li>
            <li>Your skin is incredibly smooth after use.</li>
            <li>Even if you do not have one -- this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>you can get it a try cheap,,, Try it</li>
            <li>With the inclusion of the extra pads, this was a great deal when I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It really works!!!  </li>
            <li>So, I thought this would be a cheap way to clean and scrub my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is now noticeably smoother and my breakouts have been significantly reduced...</li>
            <li>I got this when it was on sale for 19.99 but either way its sooooo worth your money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more smooth and feels so much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My face is soooo smooth after the first try!</li>
            <li>Really makes skin look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>My skin was always good, but in recent years, it started to deteriorate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Twice a week is good enough for me!</li>
            <li>After uses, I have noticeably different (for the good) skin.</li>
            <li>not bad product.</li>
            <li>Good product does clean your face well after using this I will probably look for something that provides a little deeper clean and better exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena best product for handling fine lines but results are very slow for visibility.</li>
            <li>but this is pretty quick, easy and delivers results.  </li>
            <li>I use this for mild acne scars</li>
            <li>It works great on my face and back; my complexion is clear and super smooth now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first time I used the brush (applicator?)</li>
            <li>I bought the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Holiday Bonus Pack a month ago and have been using it 3 times a week (especially after intense workouts) and the results have been amazing!</li>
            <li>The result was my face was very smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>Been using this for a few months now and so happy with the results.</li>
            <li>use this 3 times a week and really helps smooth out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For $15, I think that is well worth it.</li>
            <li>so rare these days)</li>
            <li>The product did not help decrease my breakouts; however I would still say that the provided skin improvements made it worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have gotten rid of my dull skin for good!</li>
            <li>The price is right and I will probably buy again when it breaks.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin right away after the first use.</li>
            <li>issue is that the high setting on this does create a great vibration that does cause some tingling in your head for a few minutes after you finish.</li>
            <li>First, It arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Since the first time she used she felt her skin softer and she loves it.</li>
            <li>I have seen so many facial brushes advertised at exorbitant prices, this was a deal and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Then my husband (knowing I had used the kit) said he thought my face looked even better the next day.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin was softer than ever after the first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now decided - once these refill pads run out, I&#x27;ll be on the lookout (again, at Amazon), for something else that will hopefully provide more of an invigorating cleansing, rather than a facial resurfacing.</li>
            <li>I only wish there was no need to purchase more pads, but they gotta make money</li>
            <li>this is not a quick fix but over time it will smooth out scares,and moisturizers work better( no longer have to use the heaviest moisturizers on the market ) and my makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li>Felt a positive difference after first use.</li>
            <li>I used their products for years but now that I&#x27;m becoming more aware of chemicals, no more.</li>
            <li>This works very well to exfoliate the skin leaving it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my skin feels so soft &amp; clear.</li>
            <li>have a similar system from Dove, which is not described as \\&quot;microdermabrasion,\\&quot; but is a more gentle cleaning set of handle and disposable \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; pads.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it the FULL specified time on EACH area of your face but DON&#x27;T PRESS DOWN!</li>
            <li>,she really noticed  a difference in her skin and how soft it left after a single use, Overall it was a great Purchase:) .</li>
            <li>I use this twice weekly and run the pad only (after it&#x27;s on the machine) under hot water about two or three times during treatment so that the machine glides over my skin smoothly throughout the process.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, even the fine lines on my forehead are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was a little iffy about buying this because I already own a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really recommend this microdermabrasion kit.</li>
            <li>I tried this product it works very well</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li>my face was so much smoother after using this product.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m really hoping to see continued results.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s much cheaper than these branded rotating face brushes that cost $100</li>
            <li>After a couple of uses i noticed my face was much smoother.</li>
            <li>really isn&#x27;t any to speak</li>
            <li>The pads stay on the head the whole time.  </li>
            <li>In the time since I have been using this, my skin has brightened and looks so much clearer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into much beauty maintenance</li>
            <li>This made my skin so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I really like the service and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it only 2 times, but I love how my face</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for a new system to clean their skin!</li>
            <li>Instead I&#x27;ve been making my own sugar mask with honey and green tea and the results are decent.</li>
            <li>I have only used it 2x, but I can see the scarring on my face go significantly away.</li>
            <li>Your skin actually feels softer right after the first use.</li>
            <li>It was so much smoother than normal.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the handle is too wide and flat for a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, was skeptical on it&#x27;s claims on the box, but it really does deliver.</li>
            <li>So when I saw this one at such a reasonable price I figured it was worth the risk.  </li>
            <li>I was actually wanting the brush version and still may buy one of those but since using this my face has cleared up tremendously</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use it sparingly in the first few days if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend experimenting with this</li>
            <li>It comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this to evryone.  </li>
            <li>in viewing this picture and reading the description it represents that you are recieving the machine and a bonus box of pads which was why I chose to spend a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t find the Neutrogena set had very much sudsing action to it, compared to my trusty old Dove setup.</li>
            <li>It sloughs off dead skin and keeps my complexion looking healthy.</li>
            <li>These were not horrible to begin with, but I do wear make up everyday, so there were some.</li>
            <li>After my first treatment, I could feel and see the results - my skin was smoother to the touch, my facial creme absorbed instantly, and my skin tone was brighter.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin very soft and does not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>I cannot say if my little tiny wrinkles will ever disappear BUT this brush is GREAT for gentle resurfacing and I&#x27;m hoping it will help me get rid of a little sun spot I have on my forehead.</li>
            <li>But to get yourself motivated buy this, otherwise you can lose a lot of money if you buy one of the other and end up not using it, like so many people that buy excercise machines and then only use them for a clothes hanger...</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>after the first scrub, your skin feels different.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>This little machine is an easy way for my daughter to take care of her face...</li>
            <li>I have always had great skin, but occasionally experience breakouts due to the hormones in my birth control; this seems to tame that.</li>
            <li>I hope they actually work well as we can all use a quick facial once in a while.</li>
            <li>so much that even one of my friends commented on my skin the other day, which was really encouraging!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s why I use it once every two weeks,</li>
            <li>It says to use it three times a week, but I use it twice a week since I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I kept it for myself and my face is noticeably baby butt soft.  </li>
            <li>They are surprised when I mention drug store brand that doesn&#x27;t cost hundreds and doesn&#x27;t irritate like Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>This is by no means a professional strength, but it does work to make the skin look</li>
            <li>microdermabrasion pads are a lot rougher than my old Dove cleansing pads.</li>
            <li>And keep in mind, while the initial price for this \\&quot;system\\&quot; may be reasonable, as it was in my case, it&#x27;s the refills that will get you.</li>
            <li>(guess I&#x27;ll have to pull out the sewing machine and make a case that can hang in my shower or near my sink).  </li>
            <li>and I like the rotary action</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very simple to use device, requiring just 2 AA batteries, and really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Her skin really does appear significantly younger looking than before using this product.</li>
            <li>My face is soft after use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like much because can&#x27;t note the different at all</li>
            <li>only larger, right?  </li>
            <li>Ever since I switched to meutrogena two years ago, my complexion is clear, acne free, and scars from past explosions are either gone or barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>, I really didn&#x27;t need the \\&quot;microdermabrasion\\&quot; part so much as I just wanted the cleansing part, with a *little* texture.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable compared to other products.</li>
            <li>After one use, my face was about 90% as soft as it was after the $50 professional facial.</li>
            <li>guess I was just a little overly excited at finding a product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li>than 10 years ago I had several professional microdermabrasion sessions for acne.</li>
            <li>My face looks younger, feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s skin is not entirely what they dream of it to be and being a bonus pack, you receive a 3 month supply for an extremely low price!</li>
            <li>The little motor is really powerful and the puffs have plenty of facial cleaner in them.</li>
            <li>I noticed a decrease in red skin discolorations, soft skin, and an overall “glow”.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my skin started to breathe again after all that dead skin and makeup built up for years.</li>
            <li>I got an exfoilator bead in my eye and couldnt see out of my eyes for a whole day and a half</li>
            <li>gave good skin that usually glows, but alas time and my sometimes laziness was taking its toll.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t red for too long after, and with my sensitive skin just washing it makes it red for a while.</li>
            <li>, It keeps my skin soft all day long!!</li>
            <li>It makes it feel tight which I like and seems to be helping my large pores appear smaller and gives my skin an overall nicer appearance.</li>

            <li> love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it, I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> kinda had to fly by seat of her pants, but she figured it out quickly!</li>
            <li> these things are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Great skin care product to cleanse and smooth the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I scrubbed for about s good 2 minutes and then rinsed the suds off, I felt s huge difference!</li>
            <li> but that was probably my own fault by reading the product description as closely as I should have.</li>
            <li> but it is really nice for the price.</li>
            <li> The device is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The best product in the market so far.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased the Neutrogena microdermabrasion system and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> and I love when something I give is so well liked.</li>
            <li> It makes my face very smooth &amp; is very easy to use, but my face has never been my problem.</li>
            <li> But this was a good deal, its not the best, its a vibrator with the attachement, in other words it does not turn, it vibrates.</li>
            <li> Package came quickly and in good shape</li>
            <li> Remember that the FDA does not regulate cosmetics in this country and that your skin is the largest organ in your body, it easily absorbs any kind of toxic chemical you put on it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t stop touching my face</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> : Be sure to watch the \\&quot;NEUTROGENA\\&quot; tutorial on their website or on you tube.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it and plan to buy one for each of my sisters.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> Great product that really works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is better than using the sponge alone.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this.. I was going to buy a Clarisonic which is about $200</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the word \\&quot;microdermabrasion\\&quot; in the description.</li>
            <li> The deal was made even better by the inclusion of a holiday \\&quot;bonus pack,\\&quot; which consisted of additional microdermabrasion pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it, satisfactorily, for some time, until I started having difficulty finding more disposable cleaning pads.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s instructions recommends using their set 3 times a week, as I recall, versus my being able to use the Dove product every day, if I wanted.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth after using this product!</li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the product, so I decided to buy one for my sister, also.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love the device.</li>
            <li> The product is OK.</li>
            <li> This holiday bundle is a great deal because the replacements pads alone can be very costly.</li>
            <li> I am very excited about this product.</li>
            <li> but this works just as good for a more reasonable price!</li>
            <li> She has wanted one for a long time and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I saw this set before the holidays, at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> Should be pretty good.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel like silk and gets it so clean!</li>
            <li> Love the easy way to attach the pads and the easy way to use it.</li>
            <li> Coming with the bonus pack made it a sweet deal!</li>
            <li> I got this Bonus set for a great price and love the results I am getting by using it daily.</li>
            <li> It is a visible improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to remember to use, because I am seeing results.</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate, and the cleansing pads happily produce more foam/soap than I thought they possibly could.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my doctor has commented on how nice my skin is (thanks, Mom!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this in about a month to talk about an difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have light acne breakouts which improved</li>
            <li> It is worth the price and more.</li>
            <li> it gave me a smooth face</li>
            <li> I have light acne breakouts which improved</li>
            <li> My skin looks so smooth after one time using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth after I used it.  </li>
            <li> If you want to have smooth skin, give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my face felt amazingly smooth</li>
            <li> My face feels really, really smooth after use and seems to be improving in appearance.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I only use when I need to but great product to have around.</li>
            <li> Your skin is incredibly smooth after use.</li>
            <li> Even if you do not have one -- this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> you can get it a try cheap,,, Try it</li>
            <li> With the inclusion of the extra pads, this was a great deal when I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It really works!!!  </li>
            <li> So, I thought this would be a cheap way to clean and scrub my face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is now noticeably smoother and my breakouts have been significantly reduced...</li>
            <li> I got this when it was on sale for 19.99 but either way its sooooo worth your money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more smooth and feels so much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My face is soooo smooth after the first try!</li>
            <li> Really makes skin look and feel better.  </li>
            <li> My skin was always good, but in recent years, it started to deteriorate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Twice a week is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> After uses, I have noticeably different (for the good) skin.</li>
            <li> not bad product.</li>
            <li> Good product does clean your face well after using this I will probably look for something that provides a little deeper clean and better exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena best product for handling fine lines but results are very slow for visibility.</li>
            <li> but this is pretty quick, easy and delivers results.  </li>
            <li> I use this for mild acne scars</li>
            <li> It works great on my face and back; my complexion is clear and super smooth now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first time I used the brush (applicator?)</li>
            <li> I bought the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Holiday Bonus Pack a month ago and have been using it 3 times a week (especially after intense workouts) and the results have been amazing!</li>
            <li> The result was my face was very smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months now and so happy with the results.</li>
            <li> use this 3 times a week and really helps smooth out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For $15, I think that is well worth it.</li>
            <li> so rare these days)</li>
            <li> The product did not help decrease my breakouts; however I would still say that the provided skin improvements made it worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have gotten rid of my dull skin for good!</li>
            <li> The price is right and I will probably buy again when it breaks.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin right away after the first use.</li>
            <li> issue is that the high setting on this does create a great vibration that does cause some tingling in your head for a few minutes after you finish.</li>
            <li> First, It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Since the first time she used she felt her skin softer and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many facial brushes advertised at exorbitant prices, this was a deal and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Then my husband (knowing I had used the kit) said he thought my face looked even better the next day.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was softer than ever after the first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now decided - once these refill pads run out, I&#x27;ll be on the lookout (again, at Amazon), for something else that will hopefully provide more of an invigorating cleansing, rather than a facial resurfacing.</li>
            <li> I only wish there was no need to purchase more pads, but they gotta make money</li>
            <li> this is not a quick fix but over time it will smooth out scares,and moisturizers work better( no longer have to use the heaviest moisturizers on the market ) and my makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> Felt a positive difference after first use.</li>
            <li> I used their products for years but now that I&#x27;m becoming more aware of chemicals, no more.</li>
            <li> This works very well to exfoliate the skin leaving it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my skin feels so soft &amp; clear.</li>
            <li> have a similar system from Dove, which is not described as \\&quot;microdermabrasion,\\&quot; but is a more gentle cleaning set of handle and disposable \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; pads.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it the FULL specified time on EACH area of your face but DON&#x27;T PRESS DOWN!</li>
            <li> ,she really noticed  a difference in her skin and how soft it left after a single use, Overall it was a great Purchase:) .</li>
            <li> I use this twice weekly and run the pad only (after it&#x27;s on the machine) under hot water about two or three times during treatment so that the machine glides over my skin smoothly throughout the process.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, even the fine lines on my forehead are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a little iffy about buying this because I already own a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really recommend this microdermabrasion kit.</li>
            <li> I tried this product it works very well</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> my face was so much smoother after using this product.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m really hoping to see continued results.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s much cheaper than these branded rotating face brushes that cost $100</li>
            <li> After a couple of uses i noticed my face was much smoother.</li>
            <li> really isn&#x27;t any to speak</li>
            <li> The pads stay on the head the whole time.  </li>
            <li> In the time since I have been using this, my skin has brightened and looks so much clearer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into much beauty maintenance</li>
            <li> This made my skin so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really like the service and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it only 2 times, but I love how my face</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for a new system to clean their skin!</li>
            <li> Instead I&#x27;ve been making my own sugar mask with honey and green tea and the results are decent.</li>
            <li> I have only used it 2x, but I can see the scarring on my face go significantly away.</li>
            <li> Your skin actually feels softer right after the first use.</li>
            <li> It was so much smoother than normal.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the handle is too wide and flat for a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, was skeptical on it&#x27;s claims on the box, but it really does deliver.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this one at such a reasonable price I figured it was worth the risk.  </li>
            <li> I was actually wanting the brush version and still may buy one of those but since using this my face has cleared up tremendously</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use it sparingly in the first few days if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend experimenting with this</li>
            <li> It comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this to evryone.  </li>
            <li> in viewing this picture and reading the description it represents that you are recieving the machine and a bonus box of pads which was why I chose to spend a little bit more.  </li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t find the Neutrogena set had very much sudsing action to it, compared to my trusty old Dove setup.</li>
            <li> It sloughs off dead skin and keeps my complexion looking healthy.</li>
            <li> These were not horrible to begin with, but I do wear make up everyday, so there were some.</li>
            <li> After my first treatment, I could feel and see the results - my skin was smoother to the touch, my facial creme absorbed instantly, and my skin tone was brighter.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin very soft and does not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> I cannot say if my little tiny wrinkles will ever disappear BUT this brush is GREAT for gentle resurfacing and I&#x27;m hoping it will help me get rid of a little sun spot I have on my forehead.</li>
            <li> But to get yourself motivated buy this, otherwise you can lose a lot of money if you buy one of the other and end up not using it, like so many people that buy excercise machines and then only use them for a clothes hanger...</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> after the first scrub, your skin feels different.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> This little machine is an easy way for my daughter to take care of her face...</li>
            <li> I have always had great skin, but occasionally experience breakouts due to the hormones in my birth control; this seems to tame that.</li>
            <li> I hope they actually work well as we can all use a quick facial once in a while.</li>
            <li> so much that even one of my friends commented on my skin the other day, which was really encouraging!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s why I use it once every two weeks,</li>
            <li> It says to use it three times a week, but I use it twice a week since I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I kept it for myself and my face is noticeably baby butt soft.  </li>
            <li> They are surprised when I mention drug store brand that doesn&#x27;t cost hundreds and doesn&#x27;t irritate like Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> This is by no means a professional strength, but it does work to make the skin look</li>
            <li> microdermabrasion pads are a lot rougher than my old Dove cleansing pads.</li>
            <li> And keep in mind, while the initial price for this \\&quot;system\\&quot; may be reasonable, as it was in my case, it&#x27;s the refills that will get you.</li>
            <li> (guess I&#x27;ll have to pull out the sewing machine and make a case that can hang in my shower or near my sink).  </li>
            <li> and I like the rotary action</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very simple to use device, requiring just 2 AA batteries, and really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Her skin really does appear significantly younger looking than before using this product.</li>
            <li> My face is soft after use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like much because can&#x27;t note the different at all</li>
            <li> only larger, right?  </li>
            <li> Ever since I switched to meutrogena two years ago, my complexion is clear, acne free, and scars from past explosions are either gone or barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> , I really didn&#x27;t need the \\&quot;microdermabrasion\\&quot; part so much as I just wanted the cleansing part, with a *little* texture.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable compared to other products.</li>
            <li> After one use, my face was about 90% as soft as it was after the $50 professional facial.</li>
            <li> guess I was just a little overly excited at finding a product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> than 10 years ago I had several professional microdermabrasion sessions for acne.</li>
            <li> My face looks younger, feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s skin is not entirely what they dream of it to be and being a bonus pack, you receive a 3 month supply for an extremely low price!</li>
            <li> The little motor is really powerful and the puffs have plenty of facial cleaner in them.</li>
            <li> I noticed a decrease in red skin discolorations, soft skin, and an overall “glow”.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my skin started to breathe again after all that dead skin and makeup built up for years.</li>
            <li> I got an exfoilator bead in my eye and couldnt see out of my eyes for a whole day and a half</li>
            <li> gave good skin that usually glows, but alas time and my sometimes laziness was taking its toll.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t red for too long after, and with my sensitive skin just washing it makes it red for a while.</li>
            <li> , It keeps my skin soft all day long!!</li>
            <li> It makes it feel tight which I like and seems to be helping my large pores appear smaller and gives my skin an overall nicer appearance.</li>
            <li> also very use on elbows, and any other rough spots.</li>
            <li> My first treatment was the most dramatic because my wrinkles were actually less noticeable after all of the dead skin was buffed away.</li>
            <li> I use this 1-2 times a month due to my face being so sensitive.</li>
            <li> got this item for a little gift for my wife..was a little trepidatious about getting her this type of present, married men understand where i am coming from!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft, and age spots have started fading after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> One even said that for some strange reason, I look younger.  </li>
            <li> I have already went and got some refills and plan on using this on a regular basis for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> there are  limited instructions on outside of box, no instructions inside.</li>
            <li> After using it for a little over a week, about every other day, I find that about 80% of my blackheads, or clogged pores are cleared up and much reduced.</li>
            <li> I have used the kit a few times, but so far I like it!  </li>
            <li> And when the handle gets wet, as it will, it makes it difficult to change settings, or turn off the unit, because the button to do that doesn&#x27;t have enough of a \\&quot;grip,\\&quot; and is more recessed on the wide handle, making it too slippery to operate with a wet hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are pricey, IMO, and like razors with disposable blades, you have to keep on buying these refill pads, as long as you want to keep using this system.</li>
            <li> Be careful around the eyes and use it on the low speed.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s really just like an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> its similar to the other face scrub brushes.</li>
            <li> I used it but from the reviews it say it was similar to getting a microdermabrasion, which not true at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I found some on eBay, which I bought out of a little desperation, but the eBay shipping charges makes going back to eBay</li>
            <li> Only been using it a few days and my skin is already showing some improvement.  </li>
            <li> So, I understand Dove pulled this item from the market, with no advanced notice, and no time to stock up on pads, so I was left with a handle, and</li>
            <li> I think of something rotating when thinking of microdermabrasion brushes so the product wasn&#x27;t exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> BUT be careful if you have never used it.</li>
            <li> Do you have trouble with blackheads, big pores, rough skin, oily skin, or acne prone skin?</li>
            <li> I found other you tube reviews helpful as well but be careful when following the advice of others because some of them did NOT follow directions and ended up with red, inflamed skin after pressing down too hard.</li>
            <li> However, when the product arrived, I only received the device and the small container of pads.  </li>
            <li> is other problem areas.</li>
            <li> Lost the other one.</li>
            <li> and I think I will go and check out the other ones with scrubbing brushes on them.</li>
            <li> My face was a little dry afterwards, so I had to use my Kiehl&#x27;s oil eliminator moisturizer and</li>
            <li> Everything came complete nothing broken and on time</li>
            <li> I have had problems in the past with acne and scars along with dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though beware not to over exert force for it may be too harsh over soft skin and leaves behind redness.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight improvement in my acne scars already.</li>
            <li> it has made my face look smoother &amp; less</li>
            <li> I spent hundreds on microderm abrasion treatments in the past.  </li>
            <li> my face is a mess, so</li>
            <li> I have used it every other day for the past week</li>
            <li> My legs have always been rough, bumpy &amp; dull</li>
            <li> I rarely use the pads it comes with though, I&#x27;ve used one pad for 2 weeks every 4 days (4 times) and I don&#x27;t use them cuz of the chemicals in them which are bad.</li>
            <li> But if i used it everyday i would irritate my skin so skip every day.</li>
            <li> FYI, IMO, the sudsing level would have offered some level of \\&quot;protection,\\&quot; so to speak, between your delicate face and the rough texture of the pad.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old with some sun damage from being a rather silly teenager.  </li>
            <li> Daughter uses everyday.</li>
            <li> No more clogged pores.</li>
            <li> not sure it does anything</li>
            <li> The vibration feels weird on your nose and upper lip.</li>
            <li> vibrates to hard .........</li>
            <li> I was told some ignorant users complained to Dove that the disposable pads came off the handle, causing their faces to become \\&quot;scratched.\\</li>
            <li> I kept re-wetting it, hoping for at least *some* suds, like with my Dove unit, until I realized therejust</li>
            <li> I intended to give to my daughter&#x27;s friend, who is going through puberty and breaking out pretty bad and my 15 year old son, an athlete, who has terrible breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my skin was looking bad, dark, big pore, tired looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find receipt as I&#x27;m partially blind</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but i tried product.</li>
            <li> I have been eyeing a competitive power face cleansing tool, and I could never figure out why so expensive?  </li>
            <li> Sometime I have been careless to fall asleep with make up on.</li>
            <li> So I used it for a few weeks ,but began to break out terrible all over my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This puppy buffs away all the nasty dead skin and keep my face glowing.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a quality facial tool.  Love it.  Two speeds and works great.  I use each pad twice. The 2nd time with a dab of facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product only lasted six days until the on off button broke off. I couldn&#x27;t find receipt as I&#x27;m partially blind but I even got pads to go with this. Now I&#x27;m forty two dollars in the hole for this product</li>
            <li> these things are amazing.  you can put them on, pull them off 1&#x60;5 minutes later and see gunk off of your nose you never imagined.</li>
            <li> This works very well to exfoliate the skin leaving it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on your skin! I would definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for a new system to clean their skin!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s why I use it once every two weeks, be carefull if you have the same skin tipe.</li>
            <li> in viewing this picture and reading the description it represents that you are recieving the machine and a bonus box of pads which was why I chose to spend a little bit more.  However, when the product arrived, I only received the device and the small container of pads.  In addition, when you use this product, the device simply vibrates.  The pad remains on your face and vibrates.</li>
            <li> Great skin care product to cleanse and smooth the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Though beware not to over exert force for it may be too harsh over soft skin and leaves behind redness.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this microdermabrasion kit. It works great on my face and back; my complexion is clear and super smooth now. After the first use, my skin started to breathe again after all that dead skin and makeup built up for years. No more clogged pores. It says to use it three times a week, but I use it twice a week since I have a sensitive skin. There is some redness after you applied the product, so try to do it at night time since this is a deep exfoliation. After two weeks of use, even the fine lines on my forehead are starting to disappear. I have light acne breakouts which improved but I still have to use my store brand Sulfur Mask as an overnight. The device is very easy to use. The best product in the market so far.</li>
            <li> I like the product. The actual product was damaged when it arrived and the extra cleaning pads were strowed out everywhere. I like the product though.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but i tried product. It is worth the price and more. there are  limited instructions on outside of box, no instructions inside. I googled what others did and used the product once a week (stayed out of the sun for a day after) and after 8 weeks my co-workers asked me what I was doing to my face! my complexion was impressive. this is not a quick fix but over time it will smooth out scares,and moisturizers work better( no longer have to use the heaviest moisturizers on the market ) and my makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months now and so happy with the results. Your skin actually feels softer right after the first use. So happy!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product it works very well it gave me a smooth face i can&#x27;t stop touching my face</li>
            <li> Love it. My skin is very soft. Love the easy way to attach the pads and the easy way to use it. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I am very excited about this product. It sloughs off dead skin and keeps my complexion looking healthy. I use this twice weekly and run the pad only (after it&#x27;s on the machine) under hot water about two or three times during treatment so that the machine glides over my skin smoothly throughout the process. Be sure to use it the FULL specified time on EACH area of your face but DON&#x27;T PRESS DOWN! My first treatment was the most dramatic because my wrinkles were actually less noticeable after all of the dead skin was buffed away. I apply 100% Aloe after each treatment. I have light acne breakouts which improved but I still have to use my store brand Sulfur Mask as an overnight spot treatment on occasion so this is not an \\&quot;acne miracle\\&quot; for HORMONAL breakouts but with continued use it will keep pores unclogged and improve the appearance of acne scars. Just be patient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Be sure to watch the \\&quot;NEUTROGENA\\&quot; tutorial on their website or on you tube. I found other you tube reviews helpful as well but be careful when following the advice of others because some of them did NOT follow directions and ended up with red, inflamed skin after pressing down too hard. You should not be in pain after using this product so if you are, back off on the amount of pressure you apply during treatment.</li>
            <li> Good product does clean your face well after using this I will probably look for something that provides a little deeper clean and better exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I got this Bonus set for a great price and love the results I am getting by using it daily. My skin is so much smoother and brighter. I feel like I have gotten rid of my dull skin for good!</li>
            <li> desde el primer dia que lo us&amp;eacute;, not&amp;eacute; la diferencia en mi cara.. mucho mas suave he hidratada.. excelente producto.</li>
            <li> my face was so much smoother after using this product. i would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their skin.</li>
            <li> This little machine is an easy way for my daughter to take care of her face... she uses PROACTIVE with this and enjoys her results.  She has wanted one for a long time and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Only been using it a few days and my skin is already showing some improvement.  Package came quickly and in good shape</li>
            <li> These pads are made of a toxic soup of dioxins like sodium lareth sulfate and PEGS as well as carcinogenic preservatives and parabens--yuck! Sending back! Please take some time to research these chemicals for the sake of yours and your families&#x27; health. Remember that the FDA does not regulate cosmetics in this country and that your skin is the largest organ in your body, it easily absorbs any kind of toxic chemical you put on it. Also, I just learned that Neutrogena tests on animals. I used their products for years but now that I&#x27;m becoming more aware of chemicals, no more.</li>
            <li> First, It arrived on time. I bought this product to my mother. Since the first time she used she felt her skin softer and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Love , Love !! This product</li>
            <li> Its smaller than I thought. The little motor is really powerful and the puffs have plenty of facial cleaner in them. I used it as soon as I got it (today) and my face feels noticeably cleaner. My face was a little dry afterwards, so I had to use my Kiehl&#x27;s oil eliminator moisturizer and my face looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, was skeptical on it&#x27;s claims on the box, but it really does deliver. My skin looks so smooth after one time using it. Definitely would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these.  I intended to give to my daughter&#x27;s friend, who is going through puberty and breaking out pretty bad and my 15 year old son, an athlete, who has terrible breakouts.  My tween didn&#x27;t want to gift to her friend, so as not to hurt her feelings.  I kept it for myself and my face is noticeably baby butt soft.  I already notice fewer explosions on my son&#x27;s face.  I&#x27;m already a neutrogena fan.  I spent hundreds on microderm abrasion treatments in the past.  Ever since I switched to meutrogena two years ago, my complexion is clear, acne free, and scars from past explosions are either gone or barely noticeable.  I am 46 and people always compliment my skin and ask what I use for my facial regimen.  They are surprised when I mention drug store brand that doesn&#x27;t cost hundreds and doesn&#x27;t irritate like Proactiv.  I recommend this microderm kit.  Save, save, save...</li>
            <li> Several months ago I paid $50 with a Groupon for a microdermabrason facial. The result was my face was very smooth, and soft. However, I have not been back for another one. When looking for a home machine, for the price this seemed to have above par reviews, so I tried it. After one use, my face was about 90% as soft as it was after the $50 professional facial. For $15, I think that is well worth it. After using it for a little over a week, about every other day, I find that about 80% of my blackheads, or clogged pores are cleared up and much reduced. These were not horrible to begin with, but I do wear make up everyday, so there were some. It is a visible improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to remember to use, because I am seeing results. It says to use for two minutes one each part of the face, but I just scrub around in different areas until the foam is drying out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this in about a month to talk about an difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many facial brushes advertised at exorbitant prices, this was a deal and decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did!  After my first treatment, I could feel and see the results - my skin was smoother to the touch, my facial creme absorbed instantly, and my skin tone was brighter.  I have used it every other day for the past week and I am still impressed!</li>
            <li> I love it.  My skin is so smooth after I used it.  It really works!!!  If you want to have smooth skin, give it a try.  I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> It makes my face very smooth &amp; is very easy to use, but my face has never been my problem. My legs have always been rough, bumpy &amp; dull so I thought I&#x27;d see if this would help. It did! My skin isn&#x27;t perfect after just one use on my legs, but I can already tell a huge difference. I plan to keep using it on my legs &amp; I&#x27;m really hoping to see continued results. Wish me luck! I&#x27;d highly recommend experimenting with this is other problem areas.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is probably the BEST thing I got for myself for Christmas! I absolutely LOVE it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used the brush (applicator?) I noticed my face felt amazingly smooth and my pores looked smaller. Then my husband (knowing I had used the kit) said he thought my face looked even better the next day. I have only used the darned thing 4 times and I LOVE it. I cannot say if my little tiny wrinkles will ever disappear BUT this brush is GREAT for gentle resurfacing and I&#x27;m hoping it will help me get rid of a little sun spot I have on my forehead. Just be sure to use it sparingly in the first few days if you have sensitive skin. I irritated my cheek in one spot on day 3 -- guess I was just a little overly excited at finding a product that actually does what it claims. And it&#x27;s much cheaper than these branded rotating face brushes that cost $100+. Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job, Neutrogena. I love it and plan to buy one for each of my sisters.</li>
            <li> I have been eyeing a competitive power face cleansing tool, and I could never figure out why so expensive?  I mean, it&#x27;s really just like an electric toothbrush only larger, right?  So when I saw this one at such a reasonable price I figured it was worth the risk.  I have been using it 3x a week since it arrived and I really love it.  My face feels really, really smooth after use and seems to be improving in appearance.</li>
            <li> Great product that really works.  It leaves my skin feeling very soft, and age spots have started fading after only a few uses.  Very reasonable compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Lost the other one. I have a lot of blemishes and scars from my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I use this 3 times a week and really helps smooth out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is better than using the sponge alone. I was thankful it came with the bonus pack, something extra to have.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it only 2 times, but I love how my face looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 10 years ago I had several professional microdermabrasion sessions for acne. I was younger at that time, and did not need it for line and wrinkles and pores. This is by no means a professional strength, but it does work to make the skin look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave good skin that usually glows, but alas time and my sometimes laziness was taking its toll. Sometime I have been careless to fall asleep with make up on. Unfortunately my skin was looking bad, dark, big pore, tired looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just using this twice has made a BIG difference in my skin. My face looks younger, feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant, don&#x27;t be, it&#x27;s the best $20 you can spend.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena best product for handling fine lines but results are very slow for visibility. 3-5 weeks can provide visibility</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was softer than ever after the first use. My skin isn&#x27;t red for too long after, and with my sensitive skin just washing it makes it red for a while. I noticed a slight improvement in my acne scars already.</li>
            <li> I was actually wanting the brush version and still may buy one of those but since using this my face has cleared up tremendously</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this.. I was going to buy a Clarisonic which is about $200 but this works just as good for a more reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my skin feels so soft &amp; clear. I get the replacement pads on subscription.</li>
            <li> After a couple of uses i noticed my face was much smoother. But if i used it everyday i would irritate my skin so skip every day. You can also use the pads atleast twice.</li>
            <li> So I used it for a few weeks ,but began to break out terrible all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i stop using it .</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the word \\&quot;microdermabrasion\\&quot; in the description. I saw this set before the holidays, at a pretty good price. The deal was made even better by the inclusion of a holiday \\&quot;bonus pack,\\&quot; which consisted of additional microdermabrasion pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a similar system from Dove, which is not described as \\&quot;microdermabrasion,\\&quot; but is a more gentle cleaning set of handle and disposable \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; pads. I&#x27;ve used it, satisfactorily, for some time, until I started having difficulty finding more disposable cleaning pads. I was told some ignorant users complained to Dove that the disposable pads came off the handle, causing their faces to become \\&quot;scratched.\\&quot; So, I understand Dove pulled this item from the market, with no advanced notice, and no time to stock up on pads, so I was left with a handle, and eventually, no pads. I found some on eBay, which I bought out of a little desperation, but the eBay shipping charges makes going back to eBay impractical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I found this on Amazon, and thought I&#x27;d try it. In my opinion, the handle is too wide and flat for a comfortable fit. And when the handle gets wet, as it will, it makes it difficult to change settings, or turn off the unit, because the button to do that doesn&#x27;t have enough of a \\&quot;grip,\\&quot; and is more recessed on the wide handle, making it too slippery to operate with a wet hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microdermabrasion pads are a lot rougher than my old Dove cleansing pads. Neutrogena&#x27;s instructions recommends using their set 3 times a week, as I recall, versus my being able to use the Dove product every day, if I wanted. Also, I didn&#x27;t find the Neutrogena set had very much sudsing action to it, compared to my trusty old Dove setup. FYI, IMO, the sudsing level would have offered some level of \\&quot;protection,\\&quot; so to speak, between your delicate face and the rough texture of the pad. I kept re-wetting it, hoping for at least *some* suds, like with my Dove unit, until I realized therejust really isn&#x27;t any to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I&#x27;ll continue using this Neutrogena product when my supply of disposable pads runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve just priced the refill pads for this system. Amazon currently sells a 24 pack for $10.79. That&#x27;s too pricey for me, for the results received. And keep in mind, while the initial price for this \\&quot;system\\&quot; may be reasonable, as it was in my case, it&#x27;s the refills that will get you. They are pricey, IMO, and like razors with disposable blades, you have to keep on buying these refill pads, as long as you want to keep using this system. And in case you&#x27;re wondering, I believe the intent is for ONE use per pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my doctor has commented on how nice my skin is (thanks, Mom!), I really didn&#x27;t need the \\&quot;microdermabrasion\\&quot; part so much as I just wanted the cleansing part, with a *little* texture. It&#x27;s now decided - once these refill pads run out, I&#x27;ll be on the lookout (again, at Amazon), for something else that will hopefully provide more of an invigorating cleansing, rather than a facial resurfacing.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  After having two children, my skin started to have recurring break outs.  I have tried almost every over the counter acne product and this is the only one that&#x27;s ever made a dent.  My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s significantly better than it&#x27;s been in ages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this two week and use it 3 times a week.  A couple of years ago, I had Microdermabrasion at a salon and paid dearly for it.  A few years ago, I didn&#x27;t see much difference after the salon treatment.  But now that I&#x27;m 63yo, I figured I needed Microdermabrasion.  And this Neutrogena works well for me.  I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference.  After use, my skin drinks up the lotion I apply.  There is a noticeable difference in the texture and look and touch of my skin.  It is very easy to use. I do wish that it came with a case for storage (guess I&#x27;ll have to pull out the sewing machine and make a case that can hang in my shower or near my sink).  The product works well and I like the rotary action and I like the pads that come with it.  The pads stay on the head the whole time.  I like that it is battery operating and I can use it in the shower.  The price is right and I will probably buy again when it breaks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit about a month ago.  I use it on a regular basis.  My skin looks AWESOME!!  I am 50 years old with some sun damage from being a rather silly teenager.  In the time since I have been using this, my skin has brightened and looks so much clearer.  I work with a bunch of salesmen and ALL of them have said something looks different about me.  One even said that for some strange reason, I look younger.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about!!  I have already went and got some refills and plan on using this on a regular basis for a long time to come.  I think I will even order another so I will have a spare!!</li>
            <li> I love this! it has made my face look smoother &amp; less breakouts....my face is a mess, so it&#x27;s a work in progress...still working on it!</li>
            <li> love it!  Really makes skin look and feel better.  I&#x27;m not into much beauty maintenance but this is pretty quick, easy and delivers results.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased the Neutrogena microdermabrasion system and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results. She says, and I confirm, that her skin looks noticeably smoother, softer and has fewer wrinkles than before. It&#x27;s a very simple to use device, requiring just 2 AA batteries, and really does what it says it will do. Her skin really does appear significantly younger looking than before using this product. It comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Has not yet begun, and is recommended by a friend.Should be pretty good.Does not stimulate taste very good, a cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> After just one use, I can already see and feel a difference in my skin. It is easy to operate, and the cleansing pads happily produce more foam/soap than I thought they possibly could.</li>
            <li> Everything came complete nothing broken and on time plus my girlfriend was very happy with it,she really noticed  a difference in her skin and how soft it left after a single use, Overall it was a great Purchase:) .</li>
            <li> So, I thought this would be a cheap way to clean and scrub my face. It didn&#x27;t change anything and I think I will go and check out the other ones with scrubbing brushes on them.</li>
            <li> My face is soft after use.</li>
            <li> I use this 1-2 times a month due to my face being so sensitive. It does turn my face really red so I recommend doing it at night and follow with moisturizer. DO NOT do this in the shower. I got an exfoilator bead in my eye and couldnt see out of my eyes for a whole day and a half just stick to over the sink. But it does it job.</li>
            <li> I used it but from the reviews it say it was similar to getting a microdermabrasion, which not true at all.&lt;br /&gt;It does make your skin feel softer but I did not notice anything else.</li>
            <li> This made my skin so much smoother. It works. You can also use it as a vibrator, without the abrasive pad of course.</li>
            <li> very pleased it was delivered before estimated date!</li>
            <li> Felt a positive difference after first use. Daughter uses everyday. I only use when I need to but great product to have around.</li>
            <li> vibrates to hard ......... not sure it does anything tried it for a couple weeks and didnt see any difference.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!...</li>
            <li> If you buy this and find that you can dicipline yourself to use it, then upgrade at a later date. But this was a good deal, its not the best, its a vibrator with the attachement, in other words it does not turn, it vibrates. But to get yourself motivated buy this, otherwise you can lose a lot of money if you buy one of the other and end up not using it, like so many people that buy excercise machines and then only use them for a clothes hanger...</li>
            <li> Wow! Do you have trouble with blackheads, big pores, rough skin, oily skin, or acne prone skin? If you answered &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; to any of those questions, then the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion tool will be one of the biggest lifesavers you&#x27;ve ever had! I bought the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Holiday Bonus Pack a month ago and have been using it 3 times a week (especially after intense workouts) and the results have been amazing! My skin is now noticeably smoother and my breakouts have been significantly reduced...so much that even one of my friends commented on my skin the other day, which was really encouraging! Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s skin is not entirely what they dream of it to be and being a bonus pack, you receive a 3 month supply for an extremely low price!</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth after using this product! Love it, I would recommend it to anyone! Coming with the bonus pack made it a sweet deal!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin right away after the first use. It was so much smoother than normal. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This product definitely makes my skin feel softer but the vibration makes me feel dizzy. I have to hold on to the sink. I see no one else has this problem so maybe it is me.</li>
            <li> This is ok. The vibration feels weird on your nose and upper lip. I think of something rotating when thinking of microdermabrasion brushes so the product wasn&#x27;t exactly as I expected but that was probably my own fault by reading the product description as closely as I should have. It does leave skin feeling softer and rejuvenated but I don&#x27;t see the results like I do when using the pretika brush.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week. Your skin is incredibly smooth after use. Let&#x27;s hope it takes years off my face.</li>
            <li> Love using this product - makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li> I rarely use the pads it comes with though, I&#x27;ve used one pad for 2 weeks every 4 days (4 times) and I don&#x27;t use them cuz of the chemicals in them which are bad. Instead I&#x27;ve been making my own sugar mask with honey and green tea and the results are decent. I use this for mild acne scars</li>
            <li> I bought these a xmas gifts for the girls at a great price. I hope they actually work well as we can all use a quick facial once in a while.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the price. My face is soooo smooth after the first try! Even my husband tried it and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Cleans my face and it leaves a great glow.. Love it!! I deffinetly recommend this product. I am very satisfied..</li>
            <li> My skin was always good, but in recent years, it started to deteriorate.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a suggestion from a friend and I&#x27;ve been using it about 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after the first scrub, your skin feels different.  It&#x27;s more smooth and feels so much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I match this with the Cetaphil facial moisturizer and changed the way my face feels and looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a little iffy about buying this because I already own a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;I am so, so glad I did. This puppy buffs away all the nasty dead skin and keep my face glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Twice a week is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I actually bought one of these for myself at Wal-Mart. I love the product, so I decided to buy one for my sister, also. I&#x27;m EXTREMELY happy with this purchase! I didn&#x27;t even get the bonus pack with the one I bought at Wal-MArt for the same price. Guess we&#x27;ll have to split the bonus!!! :)  I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 2x since I received it. I have had problems in the past with acne and scars along with dry skin. After uses, I have noticeably different (for the good) skin. I would recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is that the high setting on this does create a great vibration that does cause some tingling in your head for a few minutes after you finish. I could not use it on a day when I had a headache.</li>
            <li> I have used the kit a few times, but so far I like it!  My skin feels smooth and clean after using it. It makes it feel tight which I like and seems to be helping my large pores appear smaller and gives my skin an overall nicer appearance. For me it works!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! It feels so good on my skin. I have only used it 2x, but I can see the scarring on my face go significantly away.</li>
            <li> got this item for a little gift for my wife..was a little trepidatious about getting her this type of present, married men understand where i am coming from! she used it upon receiving (on time delivery as well!) and she was very happy with product. saying this, she hasnt used it but one time, so the results are still to be discovered. will update in a bit to letcha know how it worked for her....i would purchase from seller again and again b/c of their service and prices. the only thing about product, which doesnt take any stars away, is that it didnt come with any directions for usage! kinda had to fly by seat of her pants, but she figured it out quickly!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Holiday Bonus Pack is a great addition to your already established skin care regime. Even if you do not have one -- this is fantastic. I love it!</li>
            <li> It is very good as an exfoliating product in my opinion. My skin gets smoother after using it. I am very satisfied and will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> It is a great deal if you already like the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion, but if you have not yet tried it...I love the device. It exfoliates (as intended...again, thank you product for working as intended...so rare these days) BUT be careful if you have never used it. It WILL exfoliate. I will NOT cure all of your skin issues. Be careful around the eyes and use it on the low speed. But personally, I dig it. If you have any questions, just ask.</li>
            <li> Gave to Mother-n-law and she loves it. This was something she requested by name and I love when something I give is so well liked. Great gift idea!</li>
            <li> not bad product. its similar to the other face scrub brushes. also very use on elbows, and any other rough spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s product is amazing! When I scrubbed for about s good 2 minutes and then rinsed the suds off, I felt s huge difference! I would HIGHLY recommend this to evryone.  I got this when it was on sale for 19.99 but either way its sooooo worth your money! My skin feels like a baby&#x27;s butt it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> The product is OK. I really like the service and fast shipment. After some months using the product, it still is working properly. It is not the best tool out there but it is really nice for the price. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Neutrogena Microbrasion kit to help improve my skin and decrease breakouts.  I was very happy with the improved skin softness that I experienced after using this product. I noticed a decrease in red skin discolorations, soft skin, and an overall “glow”. The product did not help decrease my breakouts; however I would still say that the provided skin improvements made it worth the purchase. This holiday bundle is a great deal because the replacements pads alone can be very costly.</li>
            <li> very pleased with product.  comes with extra pads AND batteries and works well.  Neutrogena is a trusted name in beauty</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like much because can&#x27;t note the different at all you can get it a try cheap,,, Try it</li>
            <li> With the inclusion of the extra pads, this was a great deal when I purchased it. This leaves my skin very soft and does not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but thought it would do its job for the price, and it did.  I only wish there was no need to purchase more pads, but they gotta make money I guess.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last night and after trying it, I can say I already see a noticeable difference! My skin feels and looks much smoother and softer. I have always had great skin, but occasionally experience breakouts due to the hormones in my birth control; this seems to tame that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It makes your face feel like silk and gets it so clean!, I also used it on my legs!! Then I apply moisturizer, It keeps my skin soft all day long!! You won&#x27;t be dissapointed if you try it!!</li>
