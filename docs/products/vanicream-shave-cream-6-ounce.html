    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It works wonderfully!!</li>
            <li>The Aveeno no fragrance is still the best option I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year and am still very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Awesome for skin repair....</li>
            <li>This is the best shave cream I have ever used and great for the price.</li>
            <li>We also bought the bar soap for a face wash and are happy with it.</li>
            <li>It has made a great difference for me</li>
            <li>Regardless - a great shave.</li>
            <li>The tube is lightweight and great for packing.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Great cream -</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This product works great and leaves my legs smooth and moist.  </li>
            <li>and I do seem to use more of it to achieve a good cover for shaving.  </li>
            <li>While I prefer a tube to a can - it would be nice if they could rework the tube to access all of the product.</li>
            <li>and I have been super happy with it.</li>
            <li>There is no lather involved which is nice and the shave is clean and close with a good razor.</li>
            <li>Provides a good, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>There are other shave creams out there that do a good job - Neutrogena Gel for example is also excellent (and a better value based on cost and yield).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is a dud - not even sure it deserves the name \\&quot;Shave</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t smell it after you wash it off when you&#x27;re done, no lingering effects, but when it&#x27;s on your face you get a whiff of it, not terrible, just...</li>
            <li>Even my body wash works better.</li>
            <li>Just lathering with bar soap produces better results.</li>
            <li>love vanicream products</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I find most of the products from the company that makes Vanicream to be fairly good (great when I consider the fact that I don&#x27;t react to them with extreme itching).  </li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin, anyone with skin dermatitis and / or Allergies.</li>
            <li>Great cream for sensitive skin or eczema.</li>
            <li>Works great for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Vanicream and Free and Clear products are the best for people with sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>Provides a good smooth shave with no nicks in your skin or perfumes that aggravate my already sensitive skin</li>
            <li>AND FRAGRANCE FREE.</li>
            <li>A bar of soap is more useful than this product.</li>
            <li>It is also free of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream Shave Cream is THE product to use for smooth shaving without any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this one product that really works!</li>
            <li>This shaving cream leaves my legs soft and smooth and most importantly, my legs no longer itch.</li>
            <li>I dont really like the smell, but its not terrible.</li>
            <li>I only gave it two stars instead of one because EWG rated it as having safe ingredients, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because I have sensitive skin and love their Moisturizing Skin Cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll buy it again, works pretty good and leaves my face not red.</li>
            <li>I will keep using as its very good for the skin compared to the other commercial brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I really liked this product, but have since switched to Kiss My Face, sensitive shave cream.</li>
            <li>I let my wife try it, she said the same thing (good thing she normally wears slacks)...</li>
            <li>LOVE THE ENTIRE LINE OF VANICREAM.</li>
            <li>When I squeezed the first bit out to give it a try</li>
            <li>I also used Free and Clear hair products</li>
            <li>he says it smells funny</li>
            <li>While the cream is a bit on the thin side, it does form a nice protective barrier to the skin, and I get just about a good of a shave than using a typical chemical filled shaving cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that the Kiss my face shave cream is just as good, if not better, plus it doesnt have the toxins or chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t lather all that great and my skin is pretty irritated and dry after shaving due to it not lubricating very well.</li>
            <li>Now his skin is smooth and without red blotches...</li>
            <li>Its just very noticable.</li>
            <li>Seems to work really well, and he seems to like it.</li>
            <li>It is not irritating - but it really doesn&#x27;t help shaving.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Does a great job preventing breakouts, but the cream itself is incredibly thin and watery.</li>
            <li>It cannot really be used for shave jobs that take a bit of time.</li>
            <li>he really doesn&#x27;t like it much...</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really smell it</li>
            <li>but I love all the other Vanicream products.</li>
            <li>There are other kinds I like better.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I had to give it a 1 start rating as it did not perform in its main function.</li>
            <li>While I love all the other fragrance free Vanicream products, this one apparently falls a bit short.  </li>
            <li>I use the cream and lotion and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My guess is you toss 3-4 shaves worth in the trash unless you cut open the tube.</li>
            <li>I did notice that there is a strange smell, but its not bad.</li>
            <li>I never understood why my legs were always dry and chalky no matter how many \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; shaving creams I used from the local drugstore.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that really protects when shaving with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Vanicream&#x27;s shaving cream has the feel of a traditional shaving cream, which I really like.</li>
            <li>for the highly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling so soft that there&#x27;s no need to put on lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>With a cream you must rinse frequently</li>
            <li>This one left like a film that didn&#x27;t really wash off.</li>
            <li>But, since other products cause me to break out, this is well worth the trade-off for lather.</li>
            <li>usually no cuts on face when left on for one minute and shave with a 4 bladed razor.</li>
            <li>For years, I have suffered with itchy, dry patches on my legs and just recently discovered that this was most likely due to my fragrance allergy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Nivea for sensitive skin, but there is still something in that that makes my face really red after I get done shaving.  </li>
            <li>reduced it one star because it does smell kind of weird, not pungent, but like corn or something.  </li>
            <li>I have always been extremely allergic to a large number of skin products.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break her out like most products but it doesn&#x27;t really help with healing of areas that are broken out from contact with other things.</li>
            <li>If you are considering using this to shave your beard or other parts of your face, think again; it fails the first rule of shaving products; by not being soluble in water, it sticks to everything -- your face, your razor, and takes more time and effort to rinse it off than the shaving itself does.    </li>

            <li> Some of the ingredients are derived from coconut so it has a faint smell of coconut even though it is fragrance free</li>
            <li> Just using the Vanicream soap worked better and is less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very flat and neutral - absolutely no added fragrances to speak of.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected</li>
            <li> I know its free of all sorts of supposedly bad things but what your left with is just a below average shave cream.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it was way to light of a cream to form a slick surface to shave, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It has a thin, lotion type feel that despite this gives as close a shave as the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; shaving creams that foam, lather, smell great...and give you hives along with permanently dry, chalky legs.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the strength of their other hypo-allergenic products.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty expensive on a per use cost.</li>
            <li> ( in other words, they didn&#x27;t add a masking fragrance to cover the smell).</li>
            <li> I got this because other shaving creams and gels make me break out.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up like other creams</li>
            <li> A small amount stretches quite a way if you happen to shave daily.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it comes in such a small tube.</li>
            <li> Some of the other lotion-type shaving creams are really runny or difficult to spread on your face.</li>
            <li> It goes on thin but allows for a close shave and makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I have switched all my products to less toxic ones.</li>
            <li> This one is fairly firm in your hand, but still gives you the closer shave of a lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its because its missing ingredients or what</li>
            <li> Not very effective in delivering ALL of the product.</li>
            <li> Not able to shave using this cream.</li>
            <li> Sadly, while I had no negative reactions to this shaving cream,  I found it to be a really lousy shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> My husband always gets red bumps from shaving but using this stuff and shaving with the grain instead of against it has almost completely gotten rid of those awful bumps.  </li>
            <li> Also since its free of all types of things be prepared for the smell as its terrible.</li>
            <li> which seems to be the biggest complaint.</li>
            <li> I was really worried when it arrived because I had read the awful reviews</li>
            <li> After use it feels like it leaves a thin waxy coat on you.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my old shave cream had a ton of nasty chemicals in it, so I switched to this one.</li>
            <li> You just need to apply a very thin layer and then shave.</li>
            <li> but I was really desperate and sorry</li>
            <li> it goes (it&#x27;s that bad)...</li>
            <li> However I was a bit disappointed by the Shave Cream.</li>
            <li> , a bar of soap has never cut it for me unless I like bloody, scratched up</li>
            <li> If you have rosacea, then you know shaving is terrible.</li>
            <li> which is where my skin condition is the worst.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I bought this based on the strength of their other hypo-allergenic products.  This stuff is a dud - not even sure it deserves the name \\&quot;Shave Cream\\&quot;.  Water is also hypo-allergenic (and cheaper), and you&#x27;ll get about the same results.  I let my wife try it, she said the same thing (good thing she normally wears slacks)... so two uses (one guy, one gal) and into the trash it goes (it&#x27;s that bad)... that&#x27;s pretty expensive on a per use cost.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE ENTIRE LINE OF VANICREAM. USE ALL THE PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;GENTLE AND FRAGRANCE FREE. DERMOTOLOGIST RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Vanicream&#x27;s shaving cream has the feel of a traditional shaving cream, which I really like. Some of the other lotion-type shaving creams are really runny or difficult to spread on your face. This one is fairly firm in your hand, but still gives you the closer shave of a lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a shaving product that is neutral.  I&#x27;ve used the Nivea for sensitive skin, but there is still something in that that makes my face really red after I get done shaving.  When I squeezed the first bit out to give it a try I was concerned that it was way to light of a cream to form a slick surface to shave, but I was wrong.  While the cream is a bit on the thin side, it does form a nice protective barrier to the skin, and I get just about a good of a shave than using a typical chemical filled shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reduced it one star because it does smell kind of weird, not pungent, but like corn or something.  You can&#x27;t smell it after you wash it off when you&#x27;re done, no lingering effects, but when it&#x27;s on your face you get a whiff of it, not terrible, just...weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll buy it again, works pretty good and leaves my face not red.</li>
            <li> If you are considering using this to shave your beard or other parts of your face, think again; it fails the first rule of shaving products; by not being soluble in water, it sticks to everything -- your face, your razor, and takes more time and effort to rinse it off than the shaving itself does.    A bar of soap is more useful than this product.</li>
            <li> My husband always gets red bumps from shaving but using this stuff and shaving with the grain instead of against it has almost completely gotten rid of those awful bumps.  We also bought the bar soap for a face wash and are happy with it.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream has saved the skin on my legs. It works wonderfully!! For years, I have suffered with itchy, dry patches on my legs and just recently discovered that this was most likely due to my fragrance allergy. This shaving cream leaves my legs soft and smooth and most importantly, my legs no longer itch. My only complaint is that it comes in such a small tube. I wish it came in a lager tube/bottle.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I have sensitive skin and love their Moisturizing Skin Cream. However I was a bit disappointed by the Shave Cream. I know its free of all sorts of supposedly bad things but what your left with is just a below average shave cream. I don&#x27;t know if its because its missing ingredients or what but it doesn&#x27;t lather all that great and my skin is pretty irritated and dry after shaving due to it not lubricating very well. Also since its free of all types of things be prepared for the smell as its terrible. I would have given it one star but I love all the other Vanicream products. Stick with what you have if it works.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin, anyone with skin dermatitis and / or Allergies. It has made a great difference for me</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really protects when shaving with very sensitive skin. This product ishighly recommended though pricey.</li>
            <li> I have always been extremely allergic to a large number of skin products.  This is the best shave cream I have ever used and great for the price. I have ichthyosis vulgaris and this was so soothing that it left my skin feeling like silk with no itching afterwards whatsoever and no need for a moisturizer. I had no nicks and bumps afterwards either. Some of the ingredients are derived from coconut so it has a faint smell of coconut even though it is fragrance free ( in other words, they didn&#x27;t add a masking fragrance to cover the smell). I would buy this again and again as my shave cream.</li>
            <li> If you have rosacea, then you know shaving is terrible. Vanicream is too pricey, but it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my super-sensitive skin. My dermatologist introduced me to this product.</li>
            <li> I got this because other shaving creams and gels make me break out.  Although this did not make me break out, it did not work as a shaving cream.  It felt the same as if I was shaving without any cream or gel.  Because of this, I had to give it a 1 start rating as it did not perform in its main function.</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my legs - which is where my skin condition is the worst.  It doesn&#x27;t lather up like other creams and I do seem to use more of it to achieve a good cover for shaving.  But, since other products cause me to break out, this is well worth the trade-off for lather.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate in non-irritang shaving creams for men. The scent is very flat and neutral - absolutely no added fragrances to speak of. A small amount stretches quite a way if you happen to shave daily. There is no lather involved which is nice and the shave is clean and close with a good razor. There are other shave creams out there that do a good job - Neutrogena Gel for example is also excellent (and a better value based on cost and yield).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is the tube. Not very effective in delivering ALL of the product. While I prefer a tube to a can - it would be nice if they could rework the tube to access all of the product. My guess is you toss 3-4 shaves worth in the trash unless you cut open the tube. Regardless - a great shave.</li>
            <li> Even my body wash works better. This shave cream isn&#x27;t slippery enough. Use your body wash or shampoo instead and save yourself the money. I bought it months ago and now it&#x27;s just sitting in my shower...I only gave it two stars instead of one because EWG rated it as having safe ingredients, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> This is a dermatologist recommended product.  It does not &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; but leaves a moist skin after shaving&lt;br /&gt;The product gives a summer leg-shaving&lt;br /&gt;alternative for the highly sensitive.  I couldn&#x27;t make it through summer without it.</li>
            <li> This shave cream is unscented and hypoallergenic--great for senstivie skin. It goes on thin but allows for a close shave and makes your skin really soft. The tube is lightweight and great for packing.</li>
            <li> Prompt service.  Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My husband used to have a severely reddened face after shaving, even with the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; advertised shaving creams until Vanicream shave Cream....Now his skin is smooth and without red blotches...</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I have switched all my products to less toxic ones. I noticed that my old shave cream had a ton of nasty chemicals in it, so I switched to this one. I like it. I have noticed that I dont have razor burn anymore for starters. I also noticed that my arm pits dont seem to be as irritated. This product doesnt foam, but is rather a gel. You just need to apply a very thin layer and then shave. I did notice that there is a strange smell, but its not bad. Its just very noticable. I dont really like the smell, but its not terrible. I will keep using as its very good for the skin compared to the other commercial brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I really liked this product, but have since switched to Kiss My Face, sensitive shave cream. Kiss my face is a lot cheaper, and the product last longer. I found that the Kiss my face shave cream is just as good, if not better, plus it doesnt have the toxins or chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I find most of the products from the company that makes Vanicream to be fairly good (great when I consider the fact that I don&#x27;t react to them with extreme itching).  Sadly, while I had no negative reactions to this shaving cream,  I found it to be a really lousy shaving cream.  Just using the Vanicream soap worked better and is less expensive.  The Aveeno no fragrance is still the best option I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I never understood why my legs were always dry and chalky no matter how many \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; shaving creams I used from the local drugstore. When my dermatologist introduced me to Vanicream products, I discovered this shaving cream and I have been super happy with it. I was really worried when it arrived because I had read the awful reviews but I was really desperate and sorry, a bar of soap has never cut it for me unless I like bloody, scratched up legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving cream does not foam or lather which seems to be the biggest complaint. It has a thin, lotion type feel that despite this gives as close a shave as the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; shaving creams that foam, lather, smell great...and give you hives along with permanently dry, chalky legs. It leaves your skin feeling so soft that there&#x27;s no need to put on lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great cream - my husband gets red bumps all the time after shaving, so his dermatologist recommended that he use this as his shave cream. Seems to work really well, and he seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Provides a good, comfortable shave. With a cream you must rinse frequently</li>
            <li> It is not irritating - but it really doesn&#x27;t help shaving. Just lathering with bar soap produces better results. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Vinacream since every shave gel was causing me to break out.  I have not had any breakouts since  using Vanicream.  It has been life-changing!</li>
            <li> This product works great and leaves my legs smooth and moist.  It is also free of chemicals.  I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year and am still very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great cream for sensitive skin or eczema. I use the cream and lotion and highly recommend it. I also used Free and Clear hair products</li>
            <li> love vanicream products</li>
            <li> Vanicream Shave Cream is THE product to use for smooth shaving without any skin irritation.  Glad I found this one product that really works!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended the vanicream line for my daughter who has allergic dermatitis and eczema. It doesn&#x27;t break her out like most products but it doesn&#x27;t really help with healing of areas that are broken out from contact with other things.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really horrible. Not able to shave using this cream. I tried with brush and without brush and it doesn&#x27;t give close shave. I even tried safety razor as well as Gillette Mach 5 power.</li>
            <li> Works great for people with sensitive skin and you don&#x27;t need much. This bottle will last forever. Provides a good smooth shave with no nicks in your skin or perfumes that aggravate my already sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Love it. After use it feels like it leaves a thin waxy coat on you. doesn&#x27;t dry skin. use once a week. usually no cuts on face when left on for one minute and shave with a 4 bladed razor.</li>
            <li> Vanicream and Free and Clear products are the best for people with sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> There are other kinds I like better. This one left like a film that didn&#x27;t really wash off.</li>
            <li> Does a great job preventing breakouts, but the cream itself is incredibly thin and watery. It cannot really be used for shave jobs that take a bit of time. One turn in the shower and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Awesome for skin repair....eczema soothing!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband to try since all smells bother me...he really doesn&#x27;t like it much...he says it smells funny (I don&#x27;t really smell it but then I&#x27;m not as close to it as he is.  He says it also doesn&#x27;t foam which I explained to him that it&#x27;s a cream, not a foam.  While I love all the other fragrance free Vanicream products, this one apparently falls a bit short.  So I guess I have to search for another shave cream that I can tolerate.</li>
