            <li>Ordered for young woman and she loved colors.</li>
            <li>Wife loved them, good size if you don&#x27;t do your nails everyday.</li>
            <li>Colors are great,  love the small size as I rarely make it through a full sized bottle of nail polish.</li>

            <li>18 shades including  - variations from Hot Blue, Pastel Pistachio, Complex Purple, Coral, Perfect Gray, Teal, Nude Pink! ...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use this yet, but I did want everyone to know that this item is only $4.99 at Ulta Beauty website and with shipping +plus free gift the total is about $11... much cheaper than the price its sold for here...</li>

            <li> These bottles are super small.</li>
            <li> Just the packaging alone looks expensive and the colors are just fabulous.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t spill or anything, it was just empty.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it one star is because when I received my package, my Hunter&#x27;s Green polish was half way empty and the rest that was in the bottle was dried out.</li>
            <li> I guess that isn&#x27;t a bad thing since I can barely use a big bottle without it drying up on me.  </li>
            <li> It was really weird.</li>

            <li> These bottles are super small. They look like the kiddie nail polishes from the dollar store. The reason why I gave it one star is because when I received my package, my Hunter&#x27;s Green polish was half way empty and the rest that was in the bottle was dried out. It was really weird. It didn&#x27;t spill or anything, it was just empty. Also, the formula of the polish is really cheap. I had to put on three coats just to get a decent color.</li>
            <li> I like the nail polish and I tried it immediately.wonderful colors and very good texture.Thanks a lot</li>

            <li> Colors are great,  love the small size as I rarely make it through a full sized bottle of nail polish. This polish for me wears very well toes 1 month fingers 1 1/2 weeks sometimes 2.</li>
            <li> Tinier bottles that I realized but they polish seems to be good.  Nice selection of colors.</li>

            <li> Nice set of nail polish. I like the colors, the size is good and it lasts longer than the other brands I tried before.</li>
            <li> picture is misleading. its so tiny bottle. i was thinking it was the same size of a regular nail polish.</li>
