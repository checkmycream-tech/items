    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>have used for 60 years- best product for baby rash.and shaving use as a deodrent</li>
            <li>Cools, dries, and smells great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never dissatisfied with Ammens, it is the best!!</li>
            <li>This powder is great.  </li>
            <li>price is great for the product (2 pan)</li>
            <li>and I am 60, but don&#x27;t tell anyone lol).</li>
            <li>Ammens has always been the best, most effective medicated powder.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and it prevents chafing.</li>
            <li>, I check Amazon and there it is, and usually at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Has a good smell.</li>
            <li>The unscented is just as good.</li>
            <li>Am glad to have found it and am happy to have two bottles now.</li>
            <li>Yet, it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>We both enjoy the Fresh scent best.</li>
            <li>Both versions are miles better than Gold Bond, which is too &amp;#34;menthol-y&amp;#34; both in smell and feel---there are just some places on your body where you just do not want that kind of smell or feel, you know?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to go online and order it for him.  </li>
            <li>Most any time I can&#x27;t find a log-time favorite item in the stores</li>
            <li>I always make sure I don&#x27;t run out because not a lot of stores carry this product</li>
            <li>A much better product than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years and love it for  its fragrance...nice and light and a nice amount of medication without smelling like medicine.</li>
            <li>I love this powder to death.  </li>
            <li>My sister and I have used Ammens medicated powder for more than 20 years (she is 66</li>
            <li>It is ok to reapply, if needed.</li>
            <li>so by putting a light layer on my just cleansed skin, I can keep most rashes away.</li>
            <li>LOVE the fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the original fragrance for 4 years, now I&#x27;ll use this one instead.</li>
            <li>IT HELPS US WOMEN STAY FRESHER THAN FRESH.....!</li>
            <li>Its white, it smells good, its powdery fresh smell is refreshing.</li>
            <li>Ammens is very effective; my husband prefers the regular scent and I like this Ahower Fresh formula.  </li>
            <li>He particularly likes the nice shower fresh scent and the product does the job for him.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Instead of the Shower Fresh formula, I received the Original Medicated Formula</li>
            <li>I like the fresh scent</li>
            <li>It keeps you fresh without smelling odorous with a shower smell.  </li>
            <li>Good for other parts of the body too.</li>
            <li>Plus they deliver it right to our door.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, even for a full 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a lasting clean feeling long after your shower and after many, many heat flashes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who battles with hot, sticky weather.  </li>
            <li>After recently developing allergies to many of the ingredients in them..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t take much so</li>
            <li>The new scent is nice (the old one wasn&#x27;t bad, just a wee bit medicinal) and has a bright, fresh note to it.  </li>
            <li>Started using Ammens when pregnant and prone to topical yeast infections.  </li>
            <li>This product is hard to find in stores, but a high quality powder worth the effort to secure.  </li>
            <li>After much use, I can report total satisfaction with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have notoriously sensitive skin and will breakout by just perspiring,</li>
            <li>/&gt;We cannot find it in any stores near us, so by buying the multi-packs here at Amazon, it is also a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>We used to be able to find it at our local drug stores, but for the past several years, not so much.  </li>
            <li>Ammens Fresh Scent is the only scented product I can use, all other so-called sensitive skin products give me a rash.</li>

            <li> This powder is great.  I have used it for years, but lately local grocery stores have stopped carrying it.  It smells good and it prevents chafing.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN ITEM THAT I HAVE USED FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AFTER TURNING &#x27;40&#x27;....IT HELPS US WOMEN STAY FRESHER THAN FRESH.....!</li>
            <li> Ammens has always been the best, most effective medicated powder.  Both versions are miles better than Gold Bond, which is too &amp;#34;menthol-y&amp;#34; both in smell and feel---there are just some places on your body where you just do not want that kind of smell or feel, you know?

We used to be able to find it at our local drug stores, but for the past several years, not so much.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  Most any time I can&#x27;t find a log-time favorite item in the stores, I check Amazon and there it is, and usually at a good price.  Plus they deliver it right to our door.  Yay!</li>
            <li> Like this. Has a good smell. Helps to keep dry where my fat rolls tend to cause prespiration and breaking out. Don&#x27;t take much so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh scent and  it is a medicated powder without the medicated odor. I always make sure I don&#x27;t run out because not a lot of stores carry this product</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in stores, but a high quality powder worth the effort to secure.  After much use, I can report total satisfaction with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my feet.  It keeps them from itching, smelling, etc.  Good for other parts of the body too.</li>
            <li> LOVE the fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the original fragrance for 4 years, now I&#x27;ll use this one instead.</li>
            <li> Started using Ammens when pregnant and prone to topical yeast infections.  It works as well (if not better) than the prescription powder I had been given. The new scent is nice (the old one wasn&#x27;t bad, just a wee bit medicinal) and has a bright, fresh note to it.  My husband uses it, too.  I would recommend this to anyone who battles with hot, sticky weather.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A much better product than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. Works very well, even for a full 24 hours.  A little pricey, but this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is not sold in our stores in this area so my husband orders it from our local drug store.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to go online and order it for him.  He particularly likes the nice shower fresh scent and the product does the job for him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple. Not so fancy. Non specific to it&#x27;s usage or for who it&#x27;s made. Yet, it&#x27;s effective. I&#x27;ve used mainstream deoderant/antiperspirants almost all my life. After recently developing allergies to many of the ingredients in them..I made the switch. The allergic rxns are non existent now, and all that remains..long lasting comfort and freshness. Time to stockpile on this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and love it for  its fragrance...nice and light and a nice amount of medication without smelling like medicine.Am glad to have found it and am happy to have two bottles now.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to spray and rolll on deodorant and have used this product for years but can&#x27;t always find in stores&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Its white, it smells good, its powdery fresh smell is refreshing. price is great for the product (2 pan)</li>
            <li> have used before---would rec.to others  have used for 60 years- best product for baby rash.and shaving use as a deodrent</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every powder you can buy and nothing compares to this. Cools, dries, and smells great!  The unscented is just as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never dissatisfied with Ammens, it is the best!! the only negative thing about this particular order is I didn&#x27;t get the formula I ordered. Instead of the Shower Fresh formula, I received the Original Medicated Formula but I like that formula and it works the same, so I have no complaints.!!</li>
            <li> This powder has a scent but will not get in the way of doing what it is suppose to do!  It keeps you fresh without smelling odorous with a shower smell.  The scent is light and fresh.  I love this powder to death.  I will be using it until the company closes or I die!</li>
            <li> My sister and I have used Ammens medicated powder for more than 20 years (she is 66 and I am 60, but don&#x27;t tell anyone lol). We both enjoy the Fresh scent best. It gives you a lasting clean feeling long after your shower and after many, many heat flashes. I have notoriously sensitive skin and will breakout by just perspiring, so by putting a light layer on my just cleansed skin, I can keep most rashes away. It is ok to reapply, if needed. Ammens Fresh Scent is the only scented product I can use, all other so-called sensitive skin products give me a rash. I even have to use bar soaps as all liquid bodywashes make me itch and then breakout. My sister has diabetes and has to keep her skin dry and from irritation, so this is a win-win product for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We cannot find it in any stores near us, so by buying the multi-packs here at Amazon, it is also a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> For some reason the stores here in Michigan stopped selling this brand and this product and yet I want to continue using it.</li>
