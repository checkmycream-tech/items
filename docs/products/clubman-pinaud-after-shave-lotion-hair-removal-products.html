            <li>I was super pumped to buy this product because I felt like splashing on some Clubman Pinaud would be a great way to start the day, and you just feel awesome using it.</li>

            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Good smelling battery acid.  </li>

            <li>This has been around for decades, and for good reason.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>Does Clubman Pinaud attract gorgeous women like thirsty stampeding wildebeests to a life-saving watering hole?</li>
            <li>All good,</li>
            <li>Clubman aftershaveis good for me.</li>
            <li>lots, and lots of people I know have told me I smell good.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>purchased this on Amazon from Goodman&#x27;s, best price, quick delivery and good communications.</li>
            <li>Great product, great business to work with and very quick response.</li>
            <li>Excellent price, good quality lotion, and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This does a great job without being overwhelming or making me sneeze.</li>

            <li>Smells like a confident man should smell!</li>
            <li>This stuff will surely awake you in the morning!</li>
            <li>Gets the job done, best used in the winter months as it heats up the face a bit (versus menthol aftershave for summer months or hot weather).</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Even better, my wife likes it too!  </li>
            <li>but I always feel great post shave, its cheap, and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Amazing what you can find at clubman.com</li>
            <li>It does smell amazing like getting out from the barbershop.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and the price is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>nice smell, not overpowering and has that nice, ageless quality to it...</li>
            <li>This review regards the packaging not the aftershave itself, which I liked.  </li>
            <li>It is a warm tingle that basically says congratulations on being a man.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and not overpowering</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell and a tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>My favorite aftershave, refreshing scent and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent that resolves into a well-heeled talc scent.</li>
            <li>He started in Paris and then became popular in the U.S. Btw, that Lilac Vegetal that so scares me was the aftershave created for the Hungarian Calvary under Napoleon the III - who knew?</li>
            <li>IF YOU CUT YOUR OWN HAIR</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS NICE, GIVES YOU THAT NICE BURN WHEN APPLIED.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of what they use in the barber shops.</li>
            <li>I have always liked it</li>
            <li>Good product :)</li>
            <li>I have to say that though the aftershave was cooling and nice on the skin, the smell is lacking in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and all</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>I was wearing the cologne in a restaurant when a women, not realizing I was wearing the cologne, commented about the nice aroma describing the cologne.</li>
            <li>Excellent smell, excellent value and so much better than the other after shaves on the market.  </li>
            <li>you are a young fellow, looking for a great after shave at a great price, give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job for sensitive skin and smells great.</li>
            <li>The scent had settled into a wonderful masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>Mature and delightful smell that makes one think of times gone by.</li>
            <li>this has a nice strong smell...</li>
            <li>Better than your neighborhood barber product and cheaper.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>OK, so it&#x27;s like somebody threw battery acid in your face.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s potent stuff, but it does what it was intended to be designed for, to heal nicks &amp; cuts and to act as an antiseptic.  </li>
            <li>Simply, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>Sexy sophisticated scent, that isn&#x27;t too perfumy or stinky smelling.  </li>
            <li>However, it is great on nicks and stops bleeding fast.</li>
            <li>Ladies love it and so will you.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering nor does it have that &#x27;alcohol&#x27; smell to it, which many aftershaves do.</li>
            <li>It is truly soothing, healing and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I just love this smell...</li>
            <li>Clubman gave the definition to this smell many decades ago</li>
            <li>The scent gets better upon drying and lingers for hours.</li>
            <li>It works well as a aftershave though I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with them, I am satisfied with how my face feels after using it.</li>
            <li>ONE OF  MY FAVORITE ALL TIME</li>
            <li>My wife has started saying &amp;#34;You smell nice.&amp;#34; What more could I ask?</li>
            <li>So mostly I wear Mr. Pimms.</li>
            <li>After Shave Lotion for many years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always love Pinaud.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Clubman Pinaud for some 20 years or more off and on.</li>
            <li>love this after shave.</li>
            <li>If you like the Clubman scent you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty&#x27;s Barbershop is no longer there, as he passed away many years ago.  </li>
            <li>hmmm, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I almost wanted to rush out and buy a cane and top</li>
            <li>A favorite product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more refined and sophisticated scent</li>
            <li>I love it and my kids (14-21)</li>
            <li>What can I say Pinaud is my favorite after shave.</li>
            <li>, what more could I ask for.</li>
            <li>THIS one is better, much better, though the 6 oz is still a top notch one.</li>
            <li>Mostly I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is currently my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Good and has kind of a retro feel, but aftershave like this dries out your skin too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised.........almost becoming my favorite after shave.......</li>
            <li>But a very robust and extremely pleasant after shave</li>
            <li>Clean and simply the best!  </li>
            <li>and yes, it always smells like old timey barbershops, lol.</li>
            <li>It has the smell of an old barbershop and leaves you feeling like you just had a great shave.</li>
            <li>Great old time fragrance.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let its rather fancy name fool you, it&#x27;s readily available in most drug stores and here on Amazon, all at a price that seems frozen in the 1950s.  </li>
            <li>Great masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Great old school equality product.</li>
            <li>The smell of the old days at a great price</li>
            <li>Clean, refreshing but not over powering, Pinaud Clubman has become my lotion of choice.</li>
            <li>This is strong stuff.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not too light.  </li>
            <li>This has quickly become one of my favorite aftershaves.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for over 10 years, I&#x27;ve missed it.&lt;br /&gt;Never really used aftershave since I use electric and skin always broke out easily.</li>
            <li>The larger bottle is a great deal.</li>
            <li>I was also happy that it came in a larger size bottle.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap which is a plus.</li>
            <li>If you love a man smell fresh out the Barber Shop.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>so it will fit into the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Good to freshen up with after work, but requires more applications than the smaller size.</li>
            <li>far so good.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still selling in its original formula.</li>
            <li>OK, this was my first time with any of the Pinaud Clubman after shaves.  </li>
            <li>So if you want to know what I was talking about in my original post, go for that one.</li>
            <li>that is why we refill his smaller bottle with this more cost effective one.</li>
            <li>The lasting scent of this after shave is great, and my face feels clean and fresh when applied.  </li>
            <li>Amazing scent reminds me of the old fashioned barbers I went to growing up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than 3stars, but not by much.</li>
            <li>for a young man on date night or dad just trying to smell nice for mom.  </li>
            <li>Good overall experience with this brand.</li>
            <li>The Clubman products have a nice manly scent that you will remember from the old barbershop days.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it came at a good price for the size bottle</li>
            <li>I find it to be very soothing and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Definitely should add this to your &#x27;Smell Good&#x27; collection.</li>
            <li>It goes on strong and lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li>Great price for such a large bottle</li>
            <li>This smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>love the classic manly smell.....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.. : )</li>
            <li>It smells masculine, clean and sophisticated without being to pungent.</li>
            <li>I ordered Clubman after shave because I wanted to be able to smell like a stodgy old squash player who just came from the club without having to leave the house and guess what - it works!  </li>
            <li>I first splashed it on my face after shaving I thought... Medicine!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the new shaved areas just like in the good old days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still use my original, glass-bottle, Shulton made Old Spice for special occasions!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth its value.</li>
            <li>but I love this old fashioned stuff.  </li>
            <li>Smell good after shaving using Clubman Pinaud after shave, I got it almost empty time to buy another one.</li>
            <li>best critics, my wife and daughter, both give me regular compliments whenever I wear it... moreso than when I wear other aftershaves.</li>
            <li>Great smelling, classic scent that can be expected from Pinaud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic barbershop smell that brings back memories from my youth and just feels good to me.  </li>
            <li>the price was right cannot complain about the sale in any way</li>
            <li>#34;but the girls like it mom&amp;#34;... not bad for a classic man scent huh!  </li>
            <li>You get 16 full oz of Clubman for under $10 anywhere, and its smells and lasts like something that costs 5 times as much.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost and not easily found locally, Amazon Prime was my best option.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is very nice, feel like I just got out of the barber chair, back when barbers actually shaved your neck and slapped on the clubman!</li>
            <li>Not as potent as the smaller size.</li>
            <li>Takes me back to Andy&#x27;s Barber Shop of many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>This old-time aftershave, oft-used by barbershops since the beginning of time, uses imported French scent components to produce a lovely and bracing lime aura.</li>
            <li>She LOVES Pinaud Clubman (she calls it &amp;#34;Mister Pimms&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>problem with most aftershaves is that they simply do not last.</li>
            <li>I first opened the bottle I thought...  </li>
            <li>overall impression is that I love this after shave.  </li>
            <li>This has become my favorite go-to daily aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Actually encourages me to shave more often.</li>
            <li>Good everyday scent.</li>
            <li>Great subtle manly smell.</li>
            <li>I like the old time barber smell, and my skin likes the clean soothing feel.</li>
            <li>This is really the only after shave I will use any more.</li>
            <li>Good price, massive amount, will last forever.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like you&#x27;ve just had a straight razor shave with a hot towel in</li>
            <li>love it, my wife only likes it because she thinks it makes me smell like an older gentleman.</li>
            <li>it not too strong and fragrance does seem to last.  </li>
            <li>If you like a strong scented aftershave that is reminiscent of a barber shop feeling then this is for you.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a large size 16 oz.</li>
            <li>Smells okay, not something I would wear often, as it is a little strong for those around me who are sensitive to scented products.</li>
            <li>Classic barber shop, masculine, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>The first time I opened a bottle of Clubman Pinaud Original, all those memories came flooding back.</li>
            <li>I recently re discovered this great little after shave.  </li>
            <li>Quickly fades to nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll smell like your grandfather but it will make you feel like a real man.</li>
            <li>My wife says Bay Rum makes me smell like a &amp;#34;spiced gum drop&amp;#34;, so I refrain from wearing it too much.</li>
            <li>as it sits some of the alcohol will evaporate and wont burn as much.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this aftershave and it is not overpowering</li>
            <li>Very soothing after shave.</li>
            <li>THIS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD REALLY INVEST IN.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, yes it does do the job, BUT it is definitely a very oldman/barber-shop smell.</li>
            <li>Finally, Marty would dab a brush into a can filled with Clubman Pinaud Talc and powder</li>
            <li>This is a big bottle for cheap</li>
            <li>If you like the way you smell when you leave a real barbershop, you&#x27;ll like this product.</li>
            <li>Love it and will never use another after shave as long as i live-</li>
            <li>After receiving my haircut, Marty would dab some shaving cream on my neck with his thumb, then break out the straight razor and clean up the hairline on the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>The first morning I used it, I walked by my wife; she stood bolt upright and said, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>The Masters Lord and Master aftershave is probably as close to the original Pinaud 16oz as you can get, almost even the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>Stung like heck initially, but the sting would subside into a clean, manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, it starts off with a very alcohol type of smell, which did die down, but it still just doesn&#x27;t smell appealing to me, or my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how effective this is (nothing to compare too)</li>
            <li>This is the exact smell of the stuff old time barbers use to splash their customers with&lt;br /&gt;back</li>
            <li>If you are older, you probably already know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Which is the main reason I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s to say, a CLASSIC scent at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>My barber only used it upon those that he deemed \\&quot;worthy.\\&quot; Are you worthy?</li>
            <li>a classic and got it on time and</li>
            <li>I get a lot of people asking me if I wear some expensive cologne or if I import something unusual from Great Britian.</li>
            <li>Might seem a little strong to some at first</li>
            <li>The product is a classic stinging aftershave, high alcohol content.</li>
            <li>, you dont smell like a high school kid trying to act like a college kid.  </li>
            <li>the scent is a little more powdery.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long as most aftershaves don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I like it for a refreshing after shave lotion, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad after it begins to dry.</li>
            <li>Pinaud has never introduced a New or Improved version.</li>
            <li>Like the Citrus Musk, the Lime Sec, the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li>The smell is fairly recognizable and i have had several people ask about it already.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended there is no other scent as distinctive, masculine, or as classic as Clubman.</li>
            <li>Like so many have said before me, reminds me of my dad taking me down to the corner barbershop, with a guy in a flattop playing Elvis on his radio (that used vacuum tubes, of course) to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>The portion is large and should last for some time.  </li>
            <li>The scent is long lasting, and very pleasant, not fruity or pretentious like the more expensive aftershaves.</li>
            <li>you think the aroma of a one man old time barber shop is the bomb..</li>
            <li>But after leaving the cap off overnight, the bottle COMPLETELY drained all over my medicine cabinet and counter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s old school, gentleman.</li>
            <li>This is an old brand and that should tell you something.  </li>
            <li>For real men only.</li>
            <li>plus it drives my girlfriend wild.  </li>
            <li>To borrow from an old malt liquor ad campaign - &amp;#34;works</li>
            <li>just like the old barbershops used and probally still do.</li>
            <li>But my wife likes it and so do my three young boys and my \\&quot;know-it</li>
            <li>Old school consistency.</li>
            <li>Its slightly-sweet, masculine scent lasts through the work</li>
            <li>I smelled just like a gentleman that had just come from an old time barbershop.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;great seller, completely satisfied&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Old School, masculine and does the job.</li>
            <li>It was so good it forced me into trying all of the other scents offered by Clubman.</li>
            <li>I typically am not a fan of after shave products because they&#x27;re too perfumy and aggravate my allergies.</li>
            <li>Older men in overalls were always present.  </li>
            <li>this product has almost no scent, where the smaller bottles are highly scented.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I bought this based off of positive reviews not only about the product but about the overall company.</li>
            <li>I have received a few compliments on the smell (which is not bad for a cheaper pricetag).The one bit of caution</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the least expensive aftershave I ever used, and the one that get me the best compliments.  </li>
            <li>Timeless scent like no other.</li>
            <li>I considered using this product due to the stellar reviews and figured that I should try it.  </li>
            <li>A little more body than some of the other Clubman aftershaves I&#x27;ve used and</li>
            <li>The bottle is made of a cheap hard plastic with a seam joining two halves.  </li>
            <li>Solid dude smell, our 14 year old even likes sneaking it and says &amp;</li>
            <li>it the same stuff that the barber uses  its a masculine smell</li>
            <li>A red brick building built some time in the early 1900&#x27;s, a barber pole spinning out front, one would walk inside and see chairs lining one wall with a magazine rack in between for those waiting their turn.  </li>
            <li>The smell paired with a baby smooth shave is irresistible to women (by women, I mean my wife).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is a little bit more powdery and has a little different scent.</li>
            <li>I use it every single day, because I use my straight razor every single day.</li>
            <li>about memories at the old barber shop growing&lt;br /&gt;Bottle lasts a long time, soothes and refreshes.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies seem to like it too!</li>

            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Good smelling battery acid.  </li>

            <li> good stuff.</li>
            <li> Does Clubman Pinaud attract gorgeous women like thirsty stampeding wildebeests to a life-saving watering hole?</li>
            <li> All good,</li>
            <li> Clubman aftershaveis good for me.</li>
            <li> lots, and lots of people I know have told me I smell good.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>

            <li> Smells like a confident man should smell!</li>
            <li> This stuff will surely awake you in the morning!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, best used in the winter months as it heats up the face a bit (versus menthol aftershave for summer months or hot weather).</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Even better, my wife likes it too!  </li>
            <li> but I always feel great post shave, its cheap, and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Amazing what you can find at clubman.com</li>
            <li> It does smell amazing like getting out from the barbershop.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and the price is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> nice smell, not overpowering and has that nice, ageless quality to it...</li>
            <li> This review regards the packaging not the aftershave itself, which I liked.  </li>
            <li> It is a warm tingle that basically says congratulations on being a man.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and not overpowering</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell and a tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> My favorite aftershave, refreshing scent and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent that resolves into a well-heeled talc scent.</li>
            <li> He started in Paris and then became popular in the U.S. Btw, that Lilac Vegetal that so scares me was the aftershave created for the Hungarian Calvary under Napoleon the III - who knew?</li>
            <li> IF YOU CUT YOUR OWN HAIR</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS NICE, GIVES YOU THAT NICE BURN WHEN APPLIED.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of what they use in the barber shops.</li>
            <li> I have always liked it</li>
            <li> Good product :)</li>
            <li> I have to say that though the aftershave was cooling and nice on the skin, the smell is lacking in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and all</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> I was wearing the cologne in a restaurant when a women, not realizing I was wearing the cologne, commented about the nice aroma describing the cologne.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell, excellent value and so much better than the other after shaves on the market.  </li>
            <li> you are a young fellow, looking for a great after shave at a great price, give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job for sensitive skin and smells great.</li>
            <li> The scent had settled into a wonderful masculine smell.  </li>
            <li> Mature and delightful smell that makes one think of times gone by.</li>
            <li> this has a nice strong smell...</li>
            <li> Better than your neighborhood barber product and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> OK, so it&#x27;s like somebody threw battery acid in your face.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s potent stuff, but it does what it was intended to be designed for, to heal nicks &amp; cuts and to act as an antiseptic.  </li>
            <li> Simply, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Sexy sophisticated scent, that isn&#x27;t too perfumy or stinky smelling.  </li>
            <li> However, it is great on nicks and stops bleeding fast.</li>
            <li> Ladies love it and so will you.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering nor does it have that &#x27;alcohol&#x27; smell to it, which many aftershaves do.</li>
            <li> It is truly soothing, healing and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I just love this smell...</li>
            <li> Clubman gave the definition to this smell many decades ago</li>
            <li> The scent gets better upon drying and lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> It works well as a aftershave though I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with them, I am satisfied with how my face feels after using it.</li>
            <li> ONE OF  MY FAVORITE ALL TIME</li>
            <li> My wife has started saying &amp;#34;You smell nice.&amp;#34; What more could I ask?</li>
            <li> So mostly I wear Mr. Pimms.</li>
            <li> After Shave Lotion for many years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love Pinaud.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Clubman Pinaud for some 20 years or more off and on.</li>
            <li> love this after shave.</li>
            <li> If you like the Clubman scent you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty&#x27;s Barbershop is no longer there, as he passed away many years ago.  </li>
            <li> hmmm, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I almost wanted to rush out and buy a cane and top</li>
            <li> A favorite product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more refined and sophisticated scent</li>
            <li> I love it and my kids (14-21)</li>
            <li> What can I say Pinaud is my favorite after shave.</li>
            <li> , what more could I ask for.</li>
            <li> THIS one is better, much better, though the 6 oz is still a top notch one.</li>
            <li> Mostly I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is currently my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Good and has kind of a retro feel, but aftershave like this dries out your skin too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised.........almost becoming my favorite after shave.......</li>
            <li> But a very robust and extremely pleasant after shave</li>
            <li> Clean and simply the best!  </li>
            <li> and yes, it always smells like old timey barbershops, lol.</li>
            <li> It has the smell of an old barbershop and leaves you feeling like you just had a great shave.</li>
            <li> Great old time fragrance.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let its rather fancy name fool you, it&#x27;s readily available in most drug stores and here on Amazon, all at a price that seems frozen in the 1950s.  </li>
            <li> Great masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Great old school equality product.</li>
            <li> The smell of the old days at a great price</li>
            <li> Clean, refreshing but not over powering, Pinaud Clubman has become my lotion of choice.</li>
            <li> This is strong stuff.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, not too light.  </li>
            <li> This has quickly become one of my favorite aftershaves.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for over 10 years, I&#x27;ve missed it.&lt;br /&gt;Never really used aftershave since I use electric and skin always broke out easily.</li>
            <li> The larger bottle is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I was also happy that it came in a larger size bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap which is a plus.</li>
            <li> If you love a man smell fresh out the Barber Shop.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> so it will fit into the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Good to freshen up with after work, but requires more applications than the smaller size.</li>
            <li> far so good.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still selling in its original formula.</li>
            <li> OK, this was my first time with any of the Pinaud Clubman after shaves.  </li>
            <li> So if you want to know what I was talking about in my original post, go for that one.</li>
            <li> that is why we refill his smaller bottle with this more cost effective one.</li>
            <li> The lasting scent of this after shave is great, and my face feels clean and fresh when applied.  </li>
            <li> Amazing scent reminds me of the old fashioned barbers I went to growing up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than 3stars, but not by much.</li>
            <li> for a young man on date night or dad just trying to smell nice for mom.  </li>
            <li> Good overall experience with this brand.</li>
            <li> The Clubman products have a nice manly scent that you will remember from the old barbershop days.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it came at a good price for the size bottle</li>
            <li> I find it to be very soothing and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Definitely should add this to your &#x27;Smell Good&#x27; collection.</li>
            <li> It goes on strong and lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li> Great price for such a large bottle</li>
            <li> This smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> love the classic manly smell.....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.. : )</li>
            <li> It smells masculine, clean and sophisticated without being to pungent.</li>
            <li> I ordered Clubman after shave because I wanted to be able to smell like a stodgy old squash player who just came from the club without having to leave the house and guess what - it works!  </li>
            <li> I first splashed it on my face after shaving I thought... Medicine!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the new shaved areas just like in the good old days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use my original, glass-bottle, Shulton made Old Spice for special occasions!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth its value.</li>
            <li> but I love this old fashioned stuff.  </li>
            <li> Smell good after shaving using Clubman Pinaud after shave, I got it almost empty time to buy another one.</li>
            <li> best critics, my wife and daughter, both give me regular compliments whenever I wear it... moreso than when I wear other aftershaves.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, classic scent that can be expected from Pinaud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic barbershop smell that brings back memories from my youth and just feels good to me.  </li>
            <li> the price was right cannot complain about the sale in any way</li>
            <li> #34;but the girls like it mom&amp;#34;... not bad for a classic man scent huh!  </li>
            <li> You get 16 full oz of Clubman for under $10 anywhere, and its smells and lasts like something that costs 5 times as much.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost and not easily found locally, Amazon Prime was my best option.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is very nice, feel like I just got out of the barber chair, back when barbers actually shaved your neck and slapped on the clubman!</li>
            <li> Not as potent as the smaller size.</li>
            <li> Takes me back to Andy&#x27;s Barber Shop of many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> This old-time aftershave, oft-used by barbershops since the beginning of time, uses imported French scent components to produce a lovely and bracing lime aura.</li>
            <li> She LOVES Pinaud Clubman (she calls it &amp;#34;Mister Pimms&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> problem with most aftershaves is that they simply do not last.</li>
            <li> I first opened the bottle I thought...  </li>
            <li> overall impression is that I love this after shave.  </li>
            <li> This has become my favorite go-to daily aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Actually encourages me to shave more often.</li>
            <li> Good everyday scent.</li>
            <li> Great subtle manly smell.</li>
            <li> I like the old time barber smell, and my skin likes the clean soothing feel.</li>
            <li> This is really the only after shave I will use any more.</li>
            <li> Good price, massive amount, will last forever.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like you&#x27;ve just had a straight razor shave with a hot towel in</li>
            <li> love it, my wife only likes it because she thinks it makes me smell like an older gentleman.</li>
            <li> it not too strong and fragrance does seem to last.  </li>
            <li> If you like a strong scented aftershave that is reminiscent of a barber shop feeling then this is for you.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a large size 16 oz.</li>
            <li> Smells okay, not something I would wear often, as it is a little strong for those around me who are sensitive to scented products.</li>
            <li> Classic barber shop, masculine, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> The first time I opened a bottle of Clubman Pinaud Original, all those memories came flooding back.</li>
            <li> I recently re discovered this great little after shave.  </li>
            <li> Quickly fades to nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll smell like your grandfather but it will make you feel like a real man.</li>
            <li> My wife says Bay Rum makes me smell like a &amp;#34;spiced gum drop&amp;#34;, so I refrain from wearing it too much.</li>
            <li> as it sits some of the alcohol will evaporate and wont burn as much.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this aftershave and it is not overpowering</li>
            <li> Very soothing after shave.</li>
            <li> THIS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD REALLY INVEST IN.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, yes it does do the job, BUT it is definitely a very oldman/barber-shop smell.</li>
            <li> Finally, Marty would dab a brush into a can filled with Clubman Pinaud Talc and powder</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle for cheap</li>
            <li> If you like the way you smell when you leave a real barbershop, you&#x27;ll like this product.</li>
            <li> Love it and will never use another after shave as long as i live-</li>
            <li> After receiving my haircut, Marty would dab some shaving cream on my neck with his thumb, then break out the straight razor and clean up the hairline on the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> The first morning I used it, I walked by my wife; she stood bolt upright and said, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> The Masters Lord and Master aftershave is probably as close to the original Pinaud 16oz as you can get, almost even the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> Stung like heck initially, but the sting would subside into a clean, manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li> , it starts off with a very alcohol type of smell, which did die down, but it still just doesn&#x27;t smell appealing to me, or my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how effective this is (nothing to compare too)</li>
            <li> This is the exact smell of the stuff old time barbers use to splash their customers with&lt;br /&gt;back</li>
            <li> If you are older, you probably already know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Which is the main reason I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say, a CLASSIC scent at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> My barber only used it upon those that he deemed \\&quot;worthy.\\&quot; Are you worthy?</li>
            <li> a classic and got it on time and</li>
            <li> I get a lot of people asking me if I wear some expensive cologne or if I import something unusual from Great Britian.</li>
            <li> Might seem a little strong to some at first</li>
            <li> The product is a classic stinging aftershave, high alcohol content.</li>
            <li> , you dont smell like a high school kid trying to act like a college kid.  </li>
            <li> the scent is a little more powdery.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long as most aftershaves don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like it for a refreshing after shave lotion, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad after it begins to dry.</li>
            <li> Pinaud has never introduced a New or Improved version.</li>
            <li> Like the Citrus Musk, the Lime Sec, the Special Reserve.</li>
            <li> The smell is fairly recognizable and i have had several people ask about it already.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended there is no other scent as distinctive, masculine, or as classic as Clubman.</li>
            <li> Like so many have said before me, reminds me of my dad taking me down to the corner barbershop, with a guy in a flattop playing Elvis on his radio (that used vacuum tubes, of course) to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> The portion is large and should last for some time.  </li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting, and very pleasant, not fruity or pretentious like the more expensive aftershaves.</li>
            <li> you think the aroma of a one man old time barber shop is the bomb..</li>
            <li> But after leaving the cap off overnight, the bottle COMPLETELY drained all over my medicine cabinet and counter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s old school, gentleman.</li>
            <li> This is an old brand and that should tell you something.  </li>
            <li> For real men only.</li>
            <li> plus it drives my girlfriend wild.  </li>
            <li> To borrow from an old malt liquor ad campaign - &amp;#34;works</li>
            <li> just like the old barbershops used and probally still do.</li>
            <li> But my wife likes it and so do my three young boys and my \\&quot;know-it</li>
            <li> Old school consistency.</li>
            <li> Its slightly-sweet, masculine scent lasts through the work</li>
            <li> I smelled just like a gentleman that had just come from an old time barbershop.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;great seller, completely satisfied&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Old School, masculine and does the job.</li>
            <li> It was so good it forced me into trying all of the other scents offered by Clubman.</li>
            <li> I typically am not a fan of after shave products because they&#x27;re too perfumy and aggravate my allergies.</li>
            <li> Older men in overalls were always present.  </li>
            <li> this product has almost no scent, where the smaller bottles are highly scented.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off of positive reviews not only about the product but about the overall company.</li>
            <li> I have received a few compliments on the smell (which is not bad for a cheaper pricetag).The one bit of caution</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the least expensive aftershave I ever used, and the one that get me the best compliments.  </li>
            <li> Timeless scent like no other.</li>
            <li> I considered using this product due to the stellar reviews and figured that I should try it.  </li>
            <li> A little more body than some of the other Clubman aftershaves I&#x27;ve used and</li>
            <li> The bottle is made of a cheap hard plastic with a seam joining two halves.  </li>
            <li> Solid dude smell, our 14 year old even likes sneaking it and says &amp;</li>
            <li> it the same stuff that the barber uses  its a masculine smell</li>
            <li> A red brick building built some time in the early 1900&#x27;s, a barber pole spinning out front, one would walk inside and see chairs lining one wall with a magazine rack in between for those waiting their turn.  </li>
            <li> The smell paired with a baby smooth shave is irresistible to women (by women, I mean my wife).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is a little bit more powdery and has a little different scent.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day, because I use my straight razor every single day.</li>
            <li> about memories at the old barber shop growing&lt;br /&gt;Bottle lasts a long time, soothes and refreshes.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies seem to like it too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent if very close to Canoe, a much more expensive cologne that may last a little longer, but certainly smells no better.</li>
            <li> He had old western movies playing on his black &amp; white TV, and the place smelled of - guess what.  </li>
            <li> Scent lasts several hours, so that could be a positive or negative depending on your situation.</li>
            <li> Lasts just long enough.</li>
            <li> Nothing last a long time in the marketplace if it&#x27;s not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, though a lot of people don&#x27;t like it because it does remind some of old men, which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> or so it has settled to a subtle, very much masculine scent reminiscent of the old time barbershops.  </li>
            <li> I recently started wet shaving</li>
            <li> And the scent lasts a long time 6-8 hrs in my experience.</li>
            <li> This was labeled as a lotion, should be clear - this is not a lotion - this is after shave splash or liquid or just plain after shave.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have stated this aftershave brings back memories of barber shops that your dad or grandfather went to.</li>
            <li> Along the other side were two swivel chairs, though Marty was the only barber that worked there.  </li>
            <li> Anyone that doesn&#x27;t use a safety razor, double edge blade, badger brush, Arko stick and Clubman is missing out on one of the simple pleasures in life.</li>
            <li> Pinuad Clubman (country club size): SD Alcohol 40, Water, Fragrance, Yellow 5, Red 33, Green 5  </li>
            <li> Mine was loose on arrival, and some of the product had spilled into the package.</li>
            <li> Hate the bottle, but LOVE the clubman scent!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad smell or that I won&#x27;t continue to use it, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite smell either.</li>
            <li> Not to bad could could be better</li>
            <li> Never really used aftershave before, but now I use this everytime, and even sometimes when I dont shave.</li>
            <li> It does not make your hair stiff, but you can then brush it &amp; it will stay the way you brushed it.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other fragrances, but, eventually I&#x27;ll get to another.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount had leaked out, but I knew what it was immediately.  </li>
            <li> I admit I have tried other after shave lotions but always return to Clubman.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that the hair has left me, at least I can still have the smell.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of walking down to the barbershop with my grandad and getting a trim and a splash of it and feeling like a grown up.  </li>
            <li> The scent begins to settle down after about 15 minutes and within an hour</li>
            <li> The scent is there but not very strong so that is why I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing subtle about alcohol burning your recently shaved face.</li>
            <li> put a little in a bowl before you shave.  </li>
            <li> also if you want to use it as a cologne put some in a little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to for everyday use.</li>
            <li> that you know it&#x27;s there, but it let&#x27;s you lead, not follow its diaphanous essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my everyday after shave.</li>
            <li> This is not a cheap dollar store brand at all folks.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Old School Barbershop scent.  </li>
            <li> Nostalgic, old fashioned barbershop fragrance.</li>
            <li> The price is right for a product that feels somehow weak for its purpose, weak scent, weak refresh, just not very satisfying.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking this is the same as the 6 oz you would be wrong.  </li>
            <li> if you hate it - and you absolutely will not - your investment here is less than a lunch at a restaurant</li>
            <li> but it is sometimes hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a subtle citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t cut your breath or offend others.</li>
            <li> He had broken a glass bottle of it, so I found this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I poor this into an atomizer and spray my clothes in the closet and the fabric on my desk chair.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and you have to be close to smell it.  </li>
            <li> But there is also nothing really wrong with it either.</li>
            <li> Needless to the the imagery and fragrance of this has stayed with me.</li>
            <li> Works just perfectly by not being too overpowering</li>
            <li> Anyone that a gave Bad rating on this product is a troll .and should be ignored.</li>
            <li> Hate the bottle though, so does my husband,</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Clubman aftershave The best fragrance for men</li>
            <li> Better than your neighborhood barber product and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Ive been using the same shave lotion for years and yes, it always smells like old timey barbershops, lol.</li>
            <li> Great price!! Exactly as described!! Very satisfied!! Thanks</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, but the packaging may be a problem. Unlike the smaller 6 ounce bottles, the cap on this bottle has no seal to prevent it from loosening in transit. Mine was loose on arrival, and some of the product had spilled into the package.</li>
            <li> I typically am not a fan of after shave products because they&#x27;re too perfumy and aggravate my allergies. This does a great job without being overwhelming or making me sneeze. It&#x27;s a nice clean scent. The first morning I used it, I walked by my wife; she stood bolt upright and said, \\&quot;Wow! You smell like a MAN.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Looking for the barbershop scent? Clubman Pinaud is what you want.</li>
            <li> Smells like I just got out of the barber chair! Love It!!!</li>
            <li> Was actually cheaper than the smaller bottle on the Clubman website. Delivered on-time. Beats having to search for this product in-stores.</li>
            <li> For the price, the 16 oz. Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion is a good purchase. However, the scent does not last long...maybe an hour. The scent is identical to the Clubman Talc. It smells as if you just left the barber shop. I splash some on my hair after showering. It does not make your hair stiff, but you can then brush it &amp; it will stay the way you brushed it. I also use it as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> If you have a history of being a customer at the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; barber shops of days gone by, you will remember this aroma with fondness.  It&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> Barbershop quality and old-fashioned but great smell! I pair this with the hair tonic! Nice set to prepare for the day! I haven&#x27;t tried the other fragrances, but, eventually I&#x27;ll get to another. Worth the cost and not easily found locally, Amazon Prime was my best option.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Not overpowering. Smell reminiscent of yesteryears</li>
            <li> I am a man.&lt;br /&gt;I want to have a fragrance on my face that says..yep that&#x27;s a man.&lt;br /&gt;If this product came by the barrel I would buy that barrel.&lt;br /&gt;If you think the aroma of a one man old time barber shop is the bomb..&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, use this, be THAT GUY.</li>
            <li> This is really the only after shave I will use any more. It has that manly barber shop smell that I love and it is really great on the face after a shave. In my book Pinaud Clubman can&#x27;t be beat for great after shave.</li>
            <li> Great aftershave. Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t last long as most aftershaves don&#x27;t. Good price, massive amount, will last forever.</li>
            <li> OK, so it&#x27;s like somebody threw battery acid in your face.  Good smelling battery acid.  If you have any cuts or nicks on your face, they&#x27;re gone now!!!  Like so many have said before me, reminds me of my dad taking me down to the corner barbershop, with a guy in a flattop playing Elvis on his radio (that used vacuum tubes, of course) to cut my hair. He had old western movies playing on his black &amp; white TV, and the place smelled of - guess what.  The first time I opened a bottle of Clubman Pinaud Original, all those memories came flooding back. Sure, it&#x27;s potent stuff, but it does what it was intended to be designed for, to heal nicks &amp; cuts and to act as an antiseptic.  I use it every single day, because I use my straight razor every single day.</li>
            <li> Simply, this stuff is awesome. Never really used aftershave before, but now I use this everytime, and even sometimes when I dont shave. I recently started wet shaving so I&#x27;m not sure how effective this is (nothing to compare too) but I always feel great post shave, its cheap, and smells really nice. I stopped wearing $70 cologne and started wearing this when I go out.</li>
            <li> Hate the bottle, but LOVE the clubman scent!  We buy this through Amazon to refill my hubby&#x27;s regular sized bottle of &amp;#34;Clubman&amp;#34;.  Sexy sophisticated scent, that isn&#x27;t too perfumy or stinky smelling.  Smells like a confident man should smell! Not too strong, not too light.  Solid dude smell, our 14 year old even likes sneaking it and says &amp;#34;but the girls like it mom&amp;#34;... not bad for a classic man scent huh!  Hate the bottle though, so does my husband, that is why we refill his smaller bottle with this more cost effective one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who loves Clubman.  He had broken a glass bottle of it, so I found this on Amazon.  When I received it, it was leaking in the box.  Only a small amount had leaked out, but I knew what it was immediately.  Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is strong stuff. There&#x27;s nothing subtle about alcohol burning your recently shaved face. This stuff will surely awake you in the morning! You&#x27;ll smell like your grandfather but it will make you feel like a real man.</li>
            <li> This aftershave is excellent. It has the smell of an old barbershop and leaves you feeling like you just had a great shave. I have received a few compliments on the smell (which is not bad for a cheaper pricetag).The one bit of caution is that is stings a bit. However, it is great on nicks and stops bleeding fast. I used to use all different colognes ($40+) and aftershave balms. This aftershave is just as good for 1/8 the price.</li>
            <li> I recently re discovered this great little after shave.  It reminded me of walking down to the barbershop with my grandad and getting a trim and a splash of it and feeling like a grown up.  nice smell, not overpowering and has that nice, ageless quality to it...a man&#x27;s man smell.</li>
            <li> I never used aftershave before.  This feels great and relieves the burning.  It also make you smell great!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended there is no other scent as distinctive, masculine, or as classic as Clubman. Ladies love it and so will you. Not overpowering nor does it have that &#x27;alcohol&#x27; smell to it, which many aftershaves do. Timeless scent like no other.</li>
            <li> what a deal, smells great and feels good</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 50 years. I admit I have tried other after shave lotions but always return to Clubman.&lt;br /&gt;It has a subtle citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t cut your breath or offend others. It is truly soothing, healing and refreshing.  Pinaud has never introduced a New or Improved version. No need to. The product is consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a young fellow, looking for a great after shave at a great price, give it a try.  If you are older, you probably already know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this on Amazon from Goodman&#x27;s, best price, quick delivery and good communications.</li>
            <li> Classic barber shop, masculine, clean scent.  Excellent price.  It&#x27;s my go-to for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I just love this smell... I&#x27;d describe it as &amp;#34;Clubman Original,&amp;#34; because there is no aftershave that smells like this one. Clubman gave the definition to this smell many decades ago and it&#x27;s still selling in its original formula. The scent gets better upon drying and lingers for hours. It&#x27;s my go-to aftershave.</li>
            <li> Not as potent as the smaller size. Good to freshen up with after work, but requires more applications than the smaller size.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have stated this aftershave brings back memories of barber shops that your dad or grandfather went to. Which is the main reason I purchased this product. I love the smell, though a lot of people don&#x27;t like it because it does remind some of old men, which isn&#x27;t bad. The smell is fairly recognizable and i have had several people ask about it already. And the scent lasts a long time 6-8 hrs in my experience. The price is right and the bottle will last a long time. It works well as a aftershave though I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with them, I am satisfied with how my face feels after using it.</li>
            <li> ONE OF  MY FAVORITE ALL TIME</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Takes me back to Andy&#x27;s Barber Shop of many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fragrance. Lasts just long enough. Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love it and will never use another after shave as long as i live-Go Pinaud!  Do you have a colonge I could try</li>
            <li> My wife has started saying &amp;#34;You smell nice.&amp;#34; What more could I ask? If she likes it, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. So I like it too. It evokes very pleasant associations with a trip to the barber shop where I go in feeling grody and come out feeling great.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, classic scent that can be expected from Pinaud. The larger bottle is a great deal. I use a lot of Clubman products</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say, a CLASSIC scent at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I wish the scent could last longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than 3stars, but not by much. The price is right for a product that feels somehow weak for its purpose, weak scent, weak refresh, just not very satisfying. But there is also nothing really wrong with it either.</li>
            <li> This review regards the packaging not the aftershave itself, which I liked.  The bottle is made of a cheap hard plastic with a seam joining two halves.  After a few days of receiving it I noticed some lotion on the outside of the bottle, but didn&#x27;t think much of it at the time.  But after leaving the cap off overnight, the bottle COMPLETELY drained all over my medicine cabinet and counter.  It appears to have leaked through the seam on the bottom, but there are no visible holes, marks etc.  My advice: check the bottle thoroughly after receiving</li>
            <li> This old-time aftershave, oft-used by barbershops since the beginning of time, uses imported French scent components to produce a lovely and bracing lime aura.</li>
            <li> All my life, I have always worn only two after shaves: St. John&#x27;s Bay Rum and Pinaud Clubman. My wife says Bay Rum makes me smell like a &amp;#34;spiced gum drop&amp;#34;, so I refrain from wearing it too much. She LOVES Pinaud Clubman (she calls it &amp;#34;Mister Pimms&amp;#34;). So mostly I wear Mr. Pimms. And it does smell GREAT. It&#x27;s old school, gentleman. Guys, take my advice, you&#x27;ll be beatin&#x27; the ladies off with Mr. Pimms - er, Pinaud Clubman.</li>
            <li> Great price, product and shipping speed.  Very happy.  Will see me again.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> this product has almost no scent, where the smaller bottles are highly scented.  Why would they dilute the product and not the price?</li>
            <li> The product is a classic stinging aftershave, high alcohol content. Gets the job done, best used in the winter months as it heats up the face a bit (versus menthol aftershave for summer months or hot weather).</li>
            <li> I have used Clubman After Shave Lotion for many years but it is sometimes hard to find in stores. I was also happy that it came in a larger size bottle.  I have also given one bottle to my son for a gift.</li>
            <li> Totally unpretentious in scent and level of oil.  I look forward to splashing it on after every shave.  Just enough scent that you know it&#x27;s there, but it let&#x27;s you lead, not follow its diaphanous essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me all sizes of this product smell the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply wonderful.</li>
            <li> I grew up with Clubman. After a visit to our local barber he would splash us with the after shave. Needless to the the imagery and fragrance of this has stayed with me. Clean, refreshing but not over powering, Pinaud Clubman has become my lotion of choice.</li>
            <li> This has been around for decades, and for good reason. It&#x27;s a proven classic.&lt;br /&gt;My best critics, my wife and daughter, both give me regular compliments whenever I wear it... moreso than when I wear other aftershaves. I&#x27;ll continue to be a customer for the unforeseeable future. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i been looking for this for years.  it the same stuff that the barber uses  its a masculine smell, you dont smell like a high school kid trying to act like a college kid.  it not too strong and fragrance does seem to last.  but here is a tip.  put a little in a bowl before you shave.  as it sits some of the alcohol will evaporate and wont burn as much.  also if you want to use it as a cologne put some in a little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> An Oldie bot Goldie. I have received noting but rave reviews when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is perfection. The smell paired with a baby smooth shave is irresistible to women (by women, I mean my wife).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not burn like you fear aftershave would. It is a warm tingle that basically says congratulations on being a man.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday after shave. I remember being a kid and going into the barber shop for a hair cut and his was the stuff they had on tap. It smells masculine, clean and sophisticated without being to pungent. I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
            <li> Great old time fragrance. Not too flowery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call it Clubman because you have to beat the women off with a club!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and not overpowering</li>
            <li> Smells okay, not something I would wear often, as it is a little strong for those around me who are sensitive to scented products. Scent lasts several hours, so that could be a positive or negative depending on your situation. This was labeled as a lotion, should be clear - this is not a lotion - this is after shave splash or liquid or just plain after shave. Definitely not a lotion!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years,Barbers would splash this on you after a shave &amp; haircut</li>
            <li> I like the old time barber smell, and my skin likes the clean soothing feel. Very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Good and has kind of a retro feel, but aftershave like this dries out your skin too much.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell and a tingly feeling. Definitely worth its value.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this aftershave and it is not overpowering</li>
            <li> This is the real deal! When you open it up the lemon smell is there, but after you apply it the talcum smell starts to come out. Just like the Barber!  This smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.........almost becoming my favorite after shave.......love the classic manly smell.....would definitely recommend........great product from a great company......it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> This is an old brand and that should tell you something.  Nothing last a long time in the marketplace if it&#x27;s not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for a young man on date night or dad just trying to smell nice for mom.  Not one of those after shaves that has you checking to label to see if you picked up something for a girl.  For real men only.</li>
            <li> have used this product for years my wife likes the aroma</li>
            <li> I ordered Clubman after shave because I wanted to be able to smell like a stodgy old squash player who just came from the club without having to leave the house and guess what - it works!  Clubman has an enticing mix of smells and sensations.  Smells like a mix of eucalyptus, gin martini, leather and well-oiled wood.  Splash some on after a shave and whooooooo boy - will you feel exhilarated!  What a rush!  That, plus it drives my girlfriend wild.  To borrow from an old malt liquor ad campaign - &amp;#34;works every time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product, great business to work with and very quick response. A+</li>
            <li> good stuff. Does a great job for sensitive skin and smells great.Very soothing after shave.</li>
            <li> Probably my 5th revierw of this product but I love this old fashioned stuff.  Smells great, soothes well.  I probably use Clubman 4-5 times a week, solid for your aftershave rotation.</li>
            <li> Reminds me when barber shops had them on shelves.</li>
            <li> My favorite aftershave, refreshing scent and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> The scent is there but not very strong so that is why I give it 3 stars. It is cheap which is a plus. I would buy this over any store bought after shave. It does have that barber shop smell to it but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. It is soothing and doesn&#x27;t burn the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love Pinaud.  It&#x27;s the least expensive aftershave I ever used, and the one that get me the best compliments.  The scent is long lasting, and very pleasant, not fruity or pretentious like the more expensive aftershaves.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is very nice, feel like I just got out of the barber chair, back when barbers actually shaved your neck and slapped on the clubman! Only thing I don&#x27;t like, is the plastic bottle, wish it were glass, I believe the scent lasts longer in glass!</li>
            <li> I considered using this product due to the stellar reviews and figured that I should try it.  If you like a strong scented aftershave that is reminiscent of a barber shop feeling then this is for you.  The lasting scent of this after shave is great, and my face feels clean and fresh when applied.  The portion is large and should last for some time.  Good overall experience with this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Clubman Pinaud for some 20 years or more off and on. Don&#x27;t let its rather fancy name fool you, it&#x27;s readily available in most drug stores and here on Amazon, all at a price that seems frozen in the 1950s.  You get 16 full oz of Clubman for under $10 anywhere, and its smells and lasts like something that costs 5 times as much.  It&#x27;s scent if very close to Canoe, a much more expensive cologne that may last a little longer, but certainly smells no better. This is not a cheap dollar store brand at all folks.  But a very robust and extremely pleasant after shave that always has been, and seems destined to be the bargain of the century... Highly recommended.. : )</li>
            <li> love this after shave. just like the old barbershops used and probally still do.</li>
            <li> Does Clubman Pinaud attract gorgeous women like thirsty stampeding wildebeests to a life-saving watering hole? Do super-models lose control and suddenly throw themselves, quivering with unrestrained lust into your unsuspecting arms? No, not if they look like me. But my wife likes it and so do my three young boys and my \\&quot;know-it-all\\&quot; twenty something daughter. It has a nice scent that resolves into a well-heeled talc scent. My barber only used it upon those that he deemed \\&quot;worthy.\\&quot; Are you worthy? Are you???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. It was so good it forced me into trying all of the other scents offered by Clubman. Like the Citrus Musk, the Lime Sec, the Special Reserve. All good, but I didn&#x27;t like the Virgin Island Bay Rum - nooo. Also, I was scared away from the Lilac Vegetal, but maybe in the future I might want to smell like a lilac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.p.s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started in 1810 with Edouard Pinaud.  That&#x27;s why all the bottles have Ed. Pinaud. He started in Paris and then became popular in the U.S. Btw, that Lilac Vegetal that so scares me was the aftershave created for the Hungarian Calvary under Napoleon the III - who knew? Amazing what you can find at clubman.com</li>
            <li> Great quality. Great masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Anyone that a gave Bad rating on this product is a troll .and should be ignored. Great old school equality product. If you love a man smell fresh out the Barber Shop.</li>
            <li> I already have this in a smaller size. I liked it so much I ordered this larger one. I [[ASIN:B000053L6Y Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]]love Pinaud products! You can also find them at some drug stores.</li>
            <li> Great aftershave and it reminds me of going to the barber when I was a kid. Might seem a little strong to some at first but it&#x27;s not bad after it begins to dry.</li>
            <li> The best aftershave money can buy.  Clean and simply the best!  Say goodbye to the pricey stuff and hello to the best aftershave you&#x27;ll ever wear.  Momma likes too!!</li>
            <li> Great price for such a large bottle</li>
            <li> No problems.  Took awhile to get here.</li>
            <li> If you like the Clubman scent you&#x27;ll love this.  A little more body than some of the other Clubman aftershaves I&#x27;ve used and the scent is a little more powdery.  I love it!</li>
            <li> IF YOU CUT YOUR OWN HAIR THIS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD REALLY INVEST IN. IT SMELLS NICE, GIVES YOU THAT NICE BURN WHEN APPLIED.</li>
            <li> I was super pumped to buy this product because I felt like splashing on some Clubman Pinaud would be a great way to start the day, and you just feel awesome using it. HOWEVER, yes it does do the job, BUT it is definitely a very oldman/barber-shop smell. Some may like it, and I say :go for it. I personally do not like the smell, it starts off with a very alcohol type of smell, which did die down, but it still just doesn&#x27;t smell appealing to me, or my girlfriend. I just ordered some ck aftershave so we will see how that goes.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Old School Barbershop scent.  It goes on strong and lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li> This (Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion) is great, it&#x27;s kind of what they use in the barber shops. I have always liked it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;  Frank.</li>
            <li> Old school consistency. Good product :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It has the smell like when you&#x27;re leaving a barbershop&lt;br /&gt;a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Another long-standing scent of my husband.  This has been his go-to fragrance way before we met.</li>
            <li> Great subtle manly smell. Soothing after a shave. Good everyday scent. Incredibly affordable</li>
            <li> a classic and got it on time and the price was right cannot complain about the sale in any way</li>
            <li> Smell good after shaving using Clubman Pinaud after shave, I got it almost empty time to buy another one. It does smell amazing like getting out from the barbershop.</li>
            <li> Always Great with Clubman</li>
            <li> The Clubman products have a nice manly scent that you will remember from the old barbershop days.  I like it for a refreshing after shave lotion, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Overall, it came at a good price for the size bottle and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very good value smells like you were in the barbershop</li>
            <li> The scent harkens me back to the days of my youthe when my dad would take me to Marty&#x27;s Barbershop in Conroe, Texas.  A red brick building built some time in the early 1900&#x27;s, a barber pole spinning out front, one would walk inside and see chairs lining one wall with a magazine rack in between for those waiting their turn.  Older men in overalls were always present.  Along the other side were two swivel chairs, though Marty was the only barber that worked there.  After receiving my haircut, Marty would dab some shaving cream on my neck with his thumb, then break out the straight razor and clean up the hairline on the back of my neck.  Using a hand towel to wipe off the remaining shaving cream, he would then apply Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion.  Stung like heck initially, but the sting would subside into a clean, manly fragrance.  Finally, Marty would dab a brush into a can filled with Clubman Pinaud Talc and powder my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty&#x27;s Barbershop is no longer there, as he passed away many years ago.  But the memories of that youthful time when dad would take me to Marty&#x27;s come roaring back every time I open a bottle of Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion and splash it on.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become one of my favorite aftershaves. Try it and you&#x27;ll agree that the timless fragrance is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with most aftershaves is that they simply do not last. Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman is the exception. Its slightly-sweet, masculine scent lasts through the work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent does remind you of Ye Olde Barber Shoppe. Now that the hair has left me, at least I can still have the smell.</li>
            <li> OK, this was my first time with any of the Pinaud Clubman after shaves.  Here is a timeline of my experience with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bottle I thought...  Baby powder? and flowers?...hmmm, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first splashed it on my face after shaving I thought... Medicine!  It had that medicine/antiseptic/alcohol smell.  It also had a very nice sting / burn to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 or 15 mins after applying I thought...WOW!  What a manly scent!  The scent had settled into a wonderful masculine smell.  I smelled just like a gentleman that had just come from an old time barbershop.  I almost wanted to rush out and buy a cane and top hat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 hours after applying:  I can still detect the wonderful scent on my face and neck.  It is very subtle and you have to be close to smell it.  I find myself smelling the back of my hands all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression is that I love this after shave.  Even better, my wife likes it too!  It soothes and conditions my face after DE shaving.  The scent begins to settle down after about 15 minutes and within an hour or so it has settled to a subtle, very much masculine scent reminiscent of the old time barbershops.  This has become my favorite go-to daily aftershave.  I&#x27;ll still use my original, glass-bottle, Shulton made Old Spice for special occasions!</li>
            <li> A favorite product. It takes me back to childhood trips to the barbershop, and my barber uses it now.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;great seller, completely satisfied&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and the price is fabulous. I will use this for the rest of my life. Old School, masculine and does the job. Anyone that doesn&#x27;t use a safety razor, double edge blade, badger brush, Arko stick and Clubman is missing out on one of the simple pleasures in life. Keep your Fusion, canned gel slop and fancy after shaves.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time..........great product that you wont find anywhere in the stores these days!</li>
            <li> Again another great product by Clubman.  I keep one at the office and in my travel bag.  nice clean scent.  no justin bieber type girl smelling product.</li>
            <li> same barbershop smell from 50 years ago...</li>
            <li> I bought this based off of positive reviews not only about the product but about the overall company. I have to say that though the aftershave was cooling and nice on the skin, the smell is lacking in my opinion. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad smell or that I won&#x27;t continue to use it, but it isn&#x27;t my favorite smell either. I was hoping for a more refined and sophisticated scent but I guess the price to volume ratio should have spoken for itself.</li>
            <li> This is the best deal around...this has a nice strong smell...it does last for some time.  The bottle is a large size 16 oz. and has a shorter design to it..so it will fit into the medicine cabinet. BEST DEAL AROUND..</li>
            <li> I love it and my kids (14-21) love it, my wife only likes it because she thinks it makes me smell like an older gentleman. I have received a number of compliments and inquiries as to what cologne I&#x27;m wearing over the last month. I wear it daily. Great smell, great price, very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Amazing scent reminds me of the old fashioned barbers I went to growing up. Since I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for over 10 years, I&#x27;ve missed it.&lt;br /&gt;Never really used aftershave since I use electric and skin always broke out easily. For the price I risked seeing how I reacted.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. Quickly fades to nice and subtle. Face hasn&#x27;t reacted. Actually encourages me to shave more often. Wife likes it as well so it&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li> What can I say Pinaud is my favorite after shave. This is a big bottle for cheap, what more could I ask for.</li>
            <li> This is the exact smell of the stuff old time barbers use to splash their customers with&lt;br /&gt;back in the age just after the cavemen were around. I remember those times and remember the fragrance&lt;br /&gt;so I got me some. Works just perfectly by not being too overpowering AND it has that sting when it hits&lt;br /&gt;the new shaved areas just like in the good old days. Try some--you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Clubman is one of am all time favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Talk about memories at the old barber shop growing&lt;br /&gt;Bottle lasts a long time, soothes and refreshes.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies seem to like it too!</li>
            <li> Not to bad could could be better</li>
            <li> If you are thinking this is the same as the 6 oz you would be wrong.  The 6 oz: Alcohol Denat, water (Aqua, Eau), fragrance (parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Citral, Citronella, Limonene, Geraniol. Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Evernia Prunastri (Oak Moss) Extract, Evenia Furfuracea (Treemoss) Extract, Yellow 5, Yellow 6  Pinuad Clubman (country club size): SD Alcohol 40, Water, Fragrance, Yellow 5, Red 33, Green 5  So as you can see, they are different. Do they smell the same? Not quite. THIS one is better, much better, though the 6 oz is still a top notch one. This one is a little bit more powdery and has a little different scent. I was blown away.  I have made the switch for life.  EDIT: I have ordered this again (12/15/2015) and it seems the 16 oz ingredients are NOW the same as the 6 oz. It smells nice and all but it is not the same. The Masters Lord and Master aftershave is probably as close to the original Pinaud 16oz as you can get, almost even the same ingredients. So if you want to know what I was talking about in my original post, go for that one.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Nice smell.</li>
            <li> My father requested this for Christmas, so I had my daugher and step-daughter give it to him.  He has requested it again</li>
            <li> Clubman aftershaveis good for me. This is my second bottle and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like you&#x27;ve just had a straight razor shave with a hot towel in 1894.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent makes me happy, and lots, and lots of people I know have told me I smell good.  A lot of them ask me what scent I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;ll tell them.  Mostly I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is $11 for 16 ounces.  Licensing paid off 100 years ago.  Savings come to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you hate it - and you absolutely will not - your investment here is less than a lunch at a restaurant you&#x27;ll never return to.  And you can pawn it off on someone else if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you will - I guarantee - like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this aftershave for 30 years. I get a lot of people asking me if I wear some expensive cologne or if I import something unusual from Great Britian. Nope, just another great produck from Clubman!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months now.  It is currently my favorite aftershave.  It&#x27;s a classic barbershop smell that brings back memories from my youth and just feels good to me.  I find it to be very soothing and refreshing.  I bought this size bottle because I know I&#x27;ll be using it for quite a while.  And with the price, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to skimp.  If you like the way you smell when you leave a real barbershop, you&#x27;ll like this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, good quality lotion, and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The smell of the old days at a great price</li>
            <li> VERY REFRESHING ON THE SKIN after a shave or a hair cut! Definitely should add this to your &#x27;Smell Good&#x27; collection.</li>
            <li> Nostalgic, old fashioned barbershop fragrance.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell like a WWII-era Barbershop!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent smell, excellent value and so much better than the other after shaves on the market.  Mature and delightful smell that makes one think of times gone by.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Great barber shop aroma. I was wearing the cologne in a restaurant when a women, not realizing I was wearing the cologne, commented about the nice aroma describing the cologne. I poor this into an atomizer and spray my clothes in the closet and the fabric on my desk chair.</li>
