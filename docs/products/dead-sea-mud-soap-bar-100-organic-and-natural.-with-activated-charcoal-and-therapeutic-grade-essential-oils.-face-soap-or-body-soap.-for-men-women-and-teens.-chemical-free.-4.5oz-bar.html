            <li>The scent is wonderful and it bubbles up nicely, but it didn&#x27;t seem to cut the build-up of the previous day&#x27;s deodrant.  </li>

            <li>In addition to all of this their prices are great as well, in looking at other soap products of their kind Aspen Naturalâ€™s prices were the best of all the products I checked into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>felt soft on my skin, and had a nice lemon scent!</li>
            <li>saw &amp; felt a difference from the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an alternative to Lush&#x27;s Coalface, which made my face look wonderful but was too drying for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I could see a huge difference in my skin after about 2-3 washes.</li>
            <li>being said I also have an acne problem, body and face, and I have noticed a huge reduction in the frequency of breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can comfortably say it has probably a lot tyo do wtih it.  </li>
            <li>Initially i was nervous to try something with oils in it, but it&#x27;s reallu great - maybe give it a shot</li>
            <li>Enjoy your soap and don&#x27;t worry about feeling like a girly man.</li>
            <li>This stuff felt great on my skin -- deeply cleansing and purifying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not being paid or have I received this product for free.</li>
            <li>So happy I finally found something that works wonders.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mineral Mud is the third I&#x27;ve tried and it smells great and works great!</li>
            <li>The math is quite simple---natural ingredients equal GREAT results.</li>
            <li>and I just enjoy it.</li>
            <li>And the smell is light, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and fresh.</li>

            <li>It smells amazing and it works great - the dry skin problems I had were completely cleared up within days!</li>
            <li>Amazing natural product !</li>
            <li>my body acne cleared right up!</li>
            <li>but this particular brand really feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>The smell was very pleasant and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, works well, natural.</li>
            <li>Im aways searching for good facial soap</li>
            <li>and my skin is nice and soft as well.</li>
            <li>It gives you that super clean feeling.</li>
            <li>So far it has been a nice soap.</li>
            <li>The soap leaves my skin super soft and moisturized and has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe scent but it smells great too :)</li>
            <li>so I quickly arm-barred him then choked him out.</li>
            <li>and it dissipates so quickly that it doesn&#x27;t even matter.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a loyal customer from now on.</li>
            <li>By the way, I am lucky enough to also have another 8 soaps from the same company, in all sorts of flavors and smells, all of them awesome.</li>
            <li>So maybe it&#x27;s too mild for me?</li>
            <li>have always been a huge fan of dead sea products and this is definitely a great product.</li>
            <li>My wife used it for the first time tonight as well while we were having some bonding time in the outside shower,and she said that her face has never felt so good and clean.</li>
            <li>It left my skin - my body - being and feeling very clean, smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li>Very much recommended!</li>
            <li>The seller was wonderful to deal with and I will most definitely be buying from them in the near future.</li>

            <li>I know this is 100% money back guarantee, but I really, really want to give this soap a good college try before I return it.  </li>
            <li>Helped clear up my complexion and made my skin soft, smells good (fresh minty smell).  </li>
            <li>And I love how it makes my skin feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh but calming scent from the lemongrass and mint.</li>
            <li>I am no longer able to take hormones and for two years I have struggled with the tell tale adult acne around my chin and up my cheeks.</li>

            <li>It is worth the money that you pay for it.</li>
            <li>bought this soap hoping to clear up and moisturize my dry skin, it worked beautifully within days of first using it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a little unusual (in a good way)!.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully  it will clear my acne mostly for good as the other reviews had said.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited about this product, it works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, it  arrived right on time with no issues.</li>

            <li>really canâ€™t say enough great things about Aspen Naturalâ€™s products.  </li>
            <li>I actually cut it up in 2 peices, one for the shower and one near the sink for my face :) I would definitely love to buy another one when this runs out.</li>
            <li>In the first couple of washes my skin felt much healthier and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and much more affordable than Lush.</li>
            <li>I recently used the Dead Sea Mineral Mud soap bar from Aspen Naturals and I was, again, impressed at the results.</li>
            <li>Keeps it nice and dry, doesn&#x27;t stick to it.</li>
            <li>Aspen Naturals soaps not only helps greatly to sooth the constant itch these allergies create but also helps the healing process of the rashes as well</li>
            <li>Used it for only a few days, but it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy a few more for family as they were pretty jealous when I showed them:)</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend!</li>
            <li>its very gentle, and I have noticed a difference in the size of my psoriasis spots since I started using it.</li>
            <li>My daughter like it very much</li>
            <li>As one who tries most skin care products at least once, I was highly impressed that this awesomely-priced soap not only smells amazing (lemongrass, peppermint, and eucalyptus!), but made my skin feel really clean without feeling harsh at all.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more soap with these ingredients.</li>
            <li>It left my face fresh, glowing, healthy, and ready for organic moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I love the product and will continue to use it whenever it is time for a home facial.</li>
            <li>I love that it has essential oils, minerals and vitamins for my skin.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when we start running low.</li>
            <li>a real plus!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not crumbly, so I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;ll last me a while.</li>
            <li>and I will most likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I almost can&#x27;t believe they care so much!  </li>
            <li>Made her skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It has to be given that this is my first ever review.</li>
            <li>and I had to give it 5 stars after the first use my skin</li>
            <li>has been amazingly soft and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>My first time using this soap.</li>
            <li>It came fast as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order more in the future.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea Mud Bar of soap smells so good.</li>
            <li>Not only is my skin exceptionally soft after using the bar, I&#x27;m in love with the scent!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I actually just ordered the oatmeal and honey soap bar from this seller because I love this soap so much.</li>
            <li>I normally break out right before my monthly cycle</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>I broke out in hard bumps but it feels good on your face at first but doesn&#x27;t work for gentle skin and acne problems</li>
            <li>and I would certainly order from them again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days but it smells super good</li>
            <li>My skin has been feeing soft all day and this is my first day of using it!</li>
            <li>this soap is the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel fresh and clean even if I&#x27;ve had a long sweaty day at work.....</li>
            <li>I use this bar on my whole body because I have skin problems all over.</li>
            <li>and it REALLY helped her out.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face every night and have really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>But Didn&#x27;t Really Help With My Acne</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>also really appreciate not having to be concerned with what I am putting onto my skin.</li>
            <li>but it is such a light smell</li>
            <li>I like it so much, that I use it on my body as well.  </li>
            <li>together in the soap really thought it through.</li>
            <li>It did not really cleanse my skin any better or improve the condition.</li>
            <li>Just expected way more.</li>
            <li>When I received this soap, it smelled absolutely heavenly</li>
            <li>I REALLY want to like this soap</li>
            <li>It lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and timely arrival.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>bought as a gift, he loves the soap, and seems to be really helping with skin dryness/irritation</li>
            <li>(thanks, Dad)</li>
            <li>Soaps up very well.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, too.</li>
            <li>I recommend those with skin impurities to give this soap a try - after using it for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li>I use it for my whole body and face.</li>
            <li>and I feel the addition of this soap is REALLY helping.</li>
            <li>I also have had acne my whole life and this soap has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean, and it does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>I actually had to split it in two to fit in the soap dish I bought for it.</li>
            <li>Which wasn&#x27;t an issue, it wasn&#x27;t melting, and I appreciated not having to use a tool</li>
            <li>It is a really nice soap with mud from the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li>Love the cleanliness and will order again in the near future.</li>
            <li>So far this bar is a miracle worker!!!</li>
            <li>And delivered right to my doorstep, no less!  </li>
            <li>Definitely give this soap a try, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>Very similar to soap from Israel that a familiar.</li>
            <li>I looked at other charcoal bar soaps online too, but decided to order this one and fell in love with the scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I would like to say that this is pretty much a dupe for Lush&#x27;s Coalface soap.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to dry so easy</li>
            <li>I really recommend Aspen Naturals&#x27; Dead Sea Mineral Mud soap bar (as well as their other soap bars) to all you beautiful women out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with high quality ingredients, has a refreshing smell and isn&#x27;t cake-y like a lot of other mud soaps I have used.  </li>
            <li>My skin is looking clear and even, and feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>I have pretty clear (and sensitive) skin but had Pimple coming in when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>They last a really long time, and I love that I know exactly what&#x27;s in them,</li>
            <li>I washed my hands with it right away, and just wanted to share how nice it smells, and my hands felt soft, even with our hard water...</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this soap, my skin is very soft, my acne is clearing up, and the only negative I can think of is that your water bill will go up from wanting to take so many baths!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is clean and soft, and as I mentioned, gentle enough to be used on my face.</li>
            <li>But thats mainly what its purpose is.</li>
            <li>The actual owner emailed me several times to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>High quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The kind that could be compared to stripping your face of all natural oils, yet that doesn&#x27;t appear to be happening because my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry and cracked, just the opposite...</li>
            <li>It started to help a breakout on my back after first use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mainly been shopping at Farmers&#x27; Markets, but now that I&#x27;ve found this product on Amazon, it is that much simpler to get my natural and nourishing soap.  </li>
            <li>My face feels extremely clean and soft following use.</li>
            <li>It rinsed clean and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry.</li>
            <li>Really like this product so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue feeling and will thoroughly clean your skin of oil and dirt, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my face and whole body feel refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>It cleans really well and leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>These are just a few things she&#x27;s done throughout the years which have cost me more money than I care to remember.</li>
            <li>Well, I really don&#x27;t know what to think, because immediately following my first shower (using this soap)</li>
            <li>It does pretty much the same thing.</li>
            <li>I have used it top few times to write a review, but I will say that it washes off easily and does not have a dark color when it&#x27;s on the skin.</li>
            <li>I am 27 year old female with mild acne problems and this soap seems to help it.</li>
            <li>This bar is going to last a while as it is very large</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to soap.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of charcoal soaps on the market now, however most of them are filled with weird ingredients or too pricey.</li>
            <li>I usually do not try new things like this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very clear skin and have never struggled.</li>
            <li>Within 1 week my skin was almost completely clear!</li>
            <li>I love this Dead Sea Mineral Mud!  </li>
            <li>I love my dead sea mineral mud soap bar!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried proactive, antibiotics, topical creams, special face washing soap prescribed by Dermatologist, she&#x27;s changed her diet, and four years later still no results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it only three times (the dead sea mineral mud soap) but so far no new break outs, face feels clean when washed, refreshed, not overly dry or stepped, and the bar was a good size.</li>
            <li>My skin is a lot clearer in comparison to my recent years, but I deal with breakouts, discoloration, large pores, milia, and combo skin.</li>
            <li>We use only organic products, and this one is a very high quality.</li>
            <li>And it continues to stay clear day by day.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my face on the days I don&#x27;t exfoliate to help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>This seller offers a two pack of these soaps.</li>
            <li>I washed my face twice with it so far</li>
            <li>(my back has never broken out before).</li>
            <li>but so far no luck.</li>
            <li>I consider myself to have adult acne.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my adult acne, as I&#x27;ve tried a gazillion things, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will help with that.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a natural product to help clear up breakouts.</li>
            <li>I really have not had the product long enough to know if it really works for acne, but i can tell you that activated charcoal stopped my cystic acne!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this in combination with Skin Obsession 30% Glycolic Acid Chemical Peel after reading that the combination of the two helps a lot with adult acne, hormonal and generalized.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s only so much I can fight genetics</li>
            <li>almost every natural products contains rosamary extact)</li>
            <li>These natural things i mention decrease testosterone.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and thought it may help with that.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much of a difference yet, but it&#x27;s only been just over a week.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product I will definitely buy from you again!</li>
            <li>, I use organic and natural makeup</li>
            <li>As close to natural ingredients as one can get in a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>and they leave your skin so soft to boot.  </li>
            <li>This soap so far hasn&#x27;t helped my skin clear up that much, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough I use on my face too!</li>
            <li>Definitely purchasing more for everyday use!!!Thanks</li>
            <li>My skin is completely clear using this, and I have MAJOR adult acne problems.</li>
            <li>When I tone  afterwards of washing there is seriously no dirt left!</li>
            <li>Seems to be of high quality and does NOT leave that commercial &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; residue on skin.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with moderate hormonal acne and so far this new regimen seems to be improving things.</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin and was pleasantly surprised to like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>My tired and dull complexion is starting to look pretty great.</li>
            <li>The only this that I have to use moisturizer after I wash my face because it tends to be a little dry after I rinse it off; but other than that it is a great soap-and I will will definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li>He also joined a local dojo because he apparently hadnt been beat up since his junior year of high school.</li>
            <li>Although I will still be giving this bar of soap a another couple of tries, on a much smaller part of my body rather than my entire body ;-) to see if the itching continues, I REALLY appreciate your attention to this matter.  </li>
            <li>This has been a part of my new acne regime for the last three days and the pimples are already almost gone!</li>
            <li>I not only almost totally clear but also the discoloration has DRASTICALLY faded from old acne marks on my arms and back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with constant breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li>I would recommend putting it in a cool dry spot for a while if you don&#x27;t want to separate it into two pieces at least when ordering and your area is warmer than 75Â°, the bar was rather malleable (pliable) when I received it I was able to break in half with my hand instead of using a tool.</li>
            <li>I have used many dead sea soaps in the past and this one works really well.</li>
            <li>Still keeps my skin clear and I no longer use the facial scrub I used to use from St Ives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t believe after only using this soap for one week how much clear her face is.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft after use with no residual soap left on my skin.  </li>
            <li>you are sensitive to soaps, especially those with plant oils, this may not be the soap for you.</li>
            <li>Arrived yesterday, I&#x27;ve only used this soap once so far (on my face).</li>
            <li>I like the natural scent, reminds me of my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I have not only oily, acne-prone skin, but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was having some skin issues for a while and finally figured out that I am sensitive to soy and grain derivatives not just in food, but in my cosmetic products too.</li>
            <li>This price definitely beats Lush&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ll only be buying Aspen Naturals for my familyâ€™s natural soap needs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find products that clean my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Give this soap a solid try, at the very least you will smell lovely and it won&#x27;t break your bank.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin, cleans it well and removes makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin, this product is the answer to my prayers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking major, as in using hormonal treatments, topical treatments/medicines etc.</li>
            <li>will shrink it like no other soap I&#x27;ve used and this is only in like a weeks usage by just me.</li>
            <li>I recently had to ditch my baby-deterrent system and to my delight (read &amp;#34;delight&amp;#34; sarcastically) found that my skin still thinks it&#x27;s only 16 years old and that jr. prom is only days away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 33 yo guy and hardly buy any special personal hygeine products.</li>
            <li>but it cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t turn your sink black as you might think it would since it has activated charcoal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves your skin slightly tingly from the mint</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is addictive and the soap does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>but it was alot smaller than I thought it would be and way to much money for such a little bar.</li>

            <li> It has a nice lather and when I use it it makes my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent that permeates throughout the house after you use it, and helps invigorate you as well as get you clean.  </li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful and it bubbles up nicely, but it didn&#x27;t seem to cut the build-up of the previous day&#x27;s deodrant.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> In addition to all of this their prices are great as well, in looking at other soap products of their kind Aspen Naturalâ€™s prices were the best of all the products I checked into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> felt soft on my skin, and had a nice lemon scent!</li>
            <li> saw &amp; felt a difference from the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to Lush&#x27;s Coalface, which made my face look wonderful but was too drying for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I could see a huge difference in my skin after about 2-3 washes.</li>
            <li> being said I also have an acne problem, body and face, and I have noticed a huge reduction in the frequency of breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can comfortably say it has probably a lot tyo do wtih it.  </li>
            <li> Initially i was nervous to try something with oils in it, but it&#x27;s reallu great - maybe give it a shot</li>
            <li> Enjoy your soap and don&#x27;t worry about feeling like a girly man.</li>
            <li> This stuff felt great on my skin -- deeply cleansing and purifying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not being paid or have I received this product for free.</li>
            <li> So happy I finally found something that works wonders.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mineral Mud is the third I&#x27;ve tried and it smells great and works great!</li>
            <li> The math is quite simple---natural ingredients equal GREAT results.</li>
            <li> and I just enjoy it.</li>
            <li> And the smell is light, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and fresh.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money you will definitely be satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>

            <li> and my skin is nice and soft as well.</li>
            <li> It gives you that super clean feeling.</li>
            <li> So far it has been a nice soap.</li>
            <li> The soap leaves my skin super soft and moisturized and has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe scent but it smells great too :)</li>
            <li> so I quickly arm-barred him then choked him out.</li>
            <li> and it dissipates so quickly that it doesn&#x27;t even matter.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a loyal customer from now on.</li>
            <li> By the way, I am lucky enough to also have another 8 soaps from the same company, in all sorts of flavors and smells, all of them awesome.</li>
            <li> So maybe it&#x27;s too mild for me?</li>
            <li> have always been a huge fan of dead sea products and this is definitely a great product.</li>

            <li> I know this is 100% money back guarantee, but I really, really want to give this soap a good college try before I return it.  </li>
            <li> Helped clear up my complexion and made my skin soft, smells good (fresh minty smell).  </li>
            <li> And I love how it makes my skin feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh but calming scent from the lemongrass and mint.</li>

            <li> It is worth the money that you pay for it.</li>
            <li> bought this soap hoping to clear up and moisturize my dry skin, it worked beautifully within days of first using it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little unusual (in a good way)!.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully  it will clear my acne mostly for good as the other reviews had said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this product, it works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, it  arrived right on time with no issues.</li>

            <li> really canâ€™t say enough great things about Aspen Naturalâ€™s products.  </li>
            <li> I actually cut it up in 2 peices, one for the shower and one near the sink for my face :) I would definitely love to buy another one when this runs out.</li>
            <li> In the first couple of washes my skin felt much healthier and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and much more affordable than Lush.</li>
            <li> I recently used the Dead Sea Mineral Mud soap bar from Aspen Naturals and I was, again, impressed at the results.</li>
            <li> Keeps it nice and dry, doesn&#x27;t stick to it.</li>
            <li> Aspen Naturals soaps not only helps greatly to sooth the constant itch these allergies create but also helps the healing process of the rashes as well</li>
            <li> Used it for only a few days, but it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy a few more for family as they were pretty jealous when I showed them:)</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend!</li>
            <li> its very gentle, and I have noticed a difference in the size of my psoriasis spots since I started using it.</li>
            <li> My daughter like it very much</li>
            <li> As one who tries most skin care products at least once, I was highly impressed that this awesomely-priced soap not only smells amazing (lemongrass, peppermint, and eucalyptus!), but made my skin feel really clean without feeling harsh at all.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more soap with these ingredients.</li>
            <li> It left my face fresh, glowing, healthy, and ready for organic moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I love the product and will continue to use it whenever it is time for a home facial.</li>
            <li> I love that it has essential oils, minerals and vitamins for my skin.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when we start running low.</li>
            <li> a real plus!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not crumbly, so I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;ll last me a while.</li>
            <li> and I will most likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I almost can&#x27;t believe they care so much!  </li>
            <li> Made her skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It has to be given that this is my first ever review.</li>
            <li> and I had to give it 5 stars after the first use my skin</li>
            <li> has been amazingly soft and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> My first time using this soap.</li>
            <li> It came fast as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order more in the future.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Bar of soap smells so good.</li>
            <li> Not only is my skin exceptionally soft after using the bar, I&#x27;m in love with the scent!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I actually just ordered the oatmeal and honey soap bar from this seller because I love this soap so much.</li>
            <li> I normally break out right before my monthly cycle</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I broke out in hard bumps but it feels good on your face at first but doesn&#x27;t work for gentle skin and acne problems</li>
            <li> and I would certainly order from them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days but it smells super good</li>
            <li> My skin has been feeing soft all day and this is my first day of using it!</li>
            <li> this soap is the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel fresh and clean even if I&#x27;ve had a long sweaty day at work.....</li>
            <li> I use this bar on my whole body because I have skin problems all over.</li>
            <li> and it REALLY helped her out.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face every night and have really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> But Didn&#x27;t Really Help With My Acne</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> also really appreciate not having to be concerned with what I am putting onto my skin.</li>
            <li> but it is such a light smell</li>
            <li> I like it so much, that I use it on my body as well.  </li>
            <li> together in the soap really thought it through.</li>
            <li> It did not really cleanse my skin any better or improve the condition.</li>
            <li> Just expected way more.</li>
            <li> When I received this soap, it smelled absolutely heavenly</li>
            <li> I REALLY want to like this soap</li>
            <li> It lathers really well.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and timely arrival.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> bought as a gift, he loves the soap, and seems to be really helping with skin dryness/irritation</li>
            <li> (thanks, Dad)</li>
            <li> Soaps up very well.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, too.</li>
            <li> I recommend those with skin impurities to give this soap a try - after using it for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li> I use it for my whole body and face.</li>
            <li> and I feel the addition of this soap is REALLY helping.</li>
            <li> I also have had acne my whole life and this soap has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling clean, and it does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> I actually had to split it in two to fit in the soap dish I bought for it.</li>
            <li> Which wasn&#x27;t an issue, it wasn&#x27;t melting, and I appreciated not having to use a tool</li>
            <li> It is a really nice soap with mud from the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li> Love the cleanliness and will order again in the near future.</li>
            <li> So far this bar is a miracle worker!!!</li>
            <li> And delivered right to my doorstep, no less!  </li>
            <li> Definitely give this soap a try, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> Very similar to soap from Israel that a familiar.</li>
            <li> I looked at other charcoal bar soaps online too, but decided to order this one and fell in love with the scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that this is pretty much a dupe for Lush&#x27;s Coalface soap.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to dry so easy</li>
            <li> I really recommend Aspen Naturals&#x27; Dead Sea Mineral Mud soap bar (as well as their other soap bars) to all you beautiful women out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with high quality ingredients, has a refreshing smell and isn&#x27;t cake-y like a lot of other mud soaps I have used.  </li>
            <li> My skin is looking clear and even, and feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> I have pretty clear (and sensitive) skin but had Pimple coming in when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> They last a really long time, and I love that I know exactly what&#x27;s in them,</li>
            <li> I washed my hands with it right away, and just wanted to share how nice it smells, and my hands felt soft, even with our hard water...</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this soap, my skin is very soft, my acne is clearing up, and the only negative I can think of is that your water bill will go up from wanting to take so many baths!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is clean and soft, and as I mentioned, gentle enough to be used on my face.</li>
            <li> But thats mainly what its purpose is.</li>
            <li> The actual owner emailed me several times to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> High quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The kind that could be compared to stripping your face of all natural oils, yet that doesn&#x27;t appear to be happening because my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry and cracked, just the opposite...</li>
            <li> It started to help a breakout on my back after first use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mainly been shopping at Farmers&#x27; Markets, but now that I&#x27;ve found this product on Amazon, it is that much simpler to get my natural and nourishing soap.  </li>
            <li> My face feels extremely clean and soft following use.</li>
            <li> It rinsed clean and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> Really like this product so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue feeling and will thoroughly clean your skin of oil and dirt, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my face and whole body feel refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> It cleans really well and leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> These are just a few things she&#x27;s done throughout the years which have cost me more money than I care to remember.</li>
            <li> Well, I really don&#x27;t know what to think, because immediately following my first shower (using this soap)</li>
            <li> It does pretty much the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have used it top few times to write a review, but I will say that it washes off easily and does not have a dark color when it&#x27;s on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am 27 year old female with mild acne problems and this soap seems to help it.</li>
            <li> This bar is going to last a while as it is very large</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to soap.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of charcoal soaps on the market now, however most of them are filled with weird ingredients or too pricey.</li>
            <li> I usually do not try new things like this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very clear skin and have never struggled.</li>
            <li> Within 1 week my skin was almost completely clear!</li>
            <li> I love this Dead Sea Mineral Mud!  </li>
            <li> I love my dead sea mineral mud soap bar!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried proactive, antibiotics, topical creams, special face washing soap prescribed by Dermatologist, she&#x27;s changed her diet, and four years later still no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only three times (the dead sea mineral mud soap) but so far no new break outs, face feels clean when washed, refreshed, not overly dry or stepped, and the bar was a good size.</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot clearer in comparison to my recent years, but I deal with breakouts, discoloration, large pores, milia, and combo skin.</li>
            <li> We use only organic products, and this one is a very high quality.</li>
            <li> And it continues to stay clear day by day.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face on the days I don&#x27;t exfoliate to help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> This seller offers a two pack of these soaps.</li>
            <li> I washed my face twice with it so far</li>
            <li> (my back has never broken out before).</li>
            <li> but so far no luck.</li>
            <li> I consider myself to have adult acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my adult acne, as I&#x27;ve tried a gazillion things, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will help with that.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a natural product to help clear up breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really have not had the product long enough to know if it really works for acne, but i can tell you that activated charcoal stopped my cystic acne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in combination with Skin Obsession 30% Glycolic Acid Chemical Peel after reading that the combination of the two helps a lot with adult acne, hormonal and generalized.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s only so much I can fight genetics</li>
            <li> almost every natural products contains rosamary extact)</li>
            <li> These natural things i mention decrease testosterone.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and thought it may help with that.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much of a difference yet, but it&#x27;s only been just over a week.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this product I will definitely buy from you again!</li>
            <li> , I use organic and natural makeup</li>
            <li> As close to natural ingredients as one can get in a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> and they leave your skin so soft to boot.  </li>
            <li> This soap so far hasn&#x27;t helped my skin clear up that much, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough I use on my face too!</li>
            <li> Definitely purchasing more for everyday use!!!Thanks</li>
            <li> My skin is completely clear using this, and I have MAJOR adult acne problems.</li>
            <li> When I tone  afterwards of washing there is seriously no dirt left!</li>
            <li> Seems to be of high quality and does NOT leave that commercial &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; residue on skin.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with moderate hormonal acne and so far this new regimen seems to be improving things.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin and was pleasantly surprised to like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> My tired and dull complexion is starting to look pretty great.</li>
            <li> The only this that I have to use moisturizer after I wash my face because it tends to be a little dry after I rinse it off; but other than that it is a great soap-and I will will definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> He also joined a local dojo because he apparently hadnt been beat up since his junior year of high school.</li>
            <li> Although I will still be giving this bar of soap a another couple of tries, on a much smaller part of my body rather than my entire body ;-) to see if the itching continues, I REALLY appreciate your attention to this matter.  </li>
            <li> This has been a part of my new acne regime for the last three days and the pimples are already almost gone!</li>
            <li> I not only almost totally clear but also the discoloration has DRASTICALLY faded from old acne marks on my arms and back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with constant breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend putting it in a cool dry spot for a while if you don&#x27;t want to separate it into two pieces at least when ordering and your area is warmer than 75Â°, the bar was rather malleable (pliable) when I received it I was able to break in half with my hand instead of using a tool.</li>
            <li> I have used many dead sea soaps in the past and this one works really well.</li>
            <li> Still keeps my skin clear and I no longer use the facial scrub I used to use from St Ives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe after only using this soap for one week how much clear her face is.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft after use with no residual soap left on my skin.  </li>
            <li> you are sensitive to soaps, especially those with plant oils, this may not be the soap for you.</li>
            <li> Arrived yesterday, I&#x27;ve only used this soap once so far (on my face).</li>
            <li> I like the natural scent, reminds me of my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I have not only oily, acne-prone skin, but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was having some skin issues for a while and finally figured out that I am sensitive to soy and grain derivatives not just in food, but in my cosmetic products too.</li>
            <li> This price definitely beats Lush&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ll only be buying Aspen Naturals for my familyâ€™s natural soap needs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products that clean my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Give this soap a solid try, at the very least you will smell lovely and it won&#x27;t break your bank.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin, cleans it well and removes makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, this product is the answer to my prayers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking major, as in using hormonal treatments, topical treatments/medicines etc.</li>
            <li> will shrink it like no other soap I&#x27;ve used and this is only in like a weeks usage by just me.</li>
            <li> I recently had to ditch my baby-deterrent system and to my delight (read &amp;#34;delight&amp;#34; sarcastically) found that my skin still thinks it&#x27;s only 16 years old and that jr. prom is only days away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 33 yo guy and hardly buy any special personal hygeine products.</li>
            <li> but it cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t turn your sink black as you might think it would since it has activated charcoal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves your skin slightly tingly from the mint</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The scent is addictive and the soap does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> but it was alot smaller than I thought it would be and way to much money for such a little bar.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and like other soaps/body washes it did not break me out.</li>
            <li> cons are it probably won&#x27;t last long and you&#x27;ll probably have to have deep pockets to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I break out on my chest, back, face, and neck in blackheads, whiteheads, and painful cystic acne and the combination of dead sea salt and charcoal has so far done a good job of keeping it manageable.</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> I can tell it is going to last a long time, too, from the way lathers!</li>
            <li> Not only did it help me with my dry skin</li>
            <li> , dont know if it&#x27;s normal but will try it for one more week to give it a chance. :(</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face either, especially with this cold/windy winter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days once or twice a day and it seems to be helping my face clear up!</li>
            <li> After using for a few days, my skin was almost clear.</li>
            <li> It has definitely started clearing it up and making her skin softer and getting rid of the rough sandpaper feeling.</li>
            <li> There was an initial breakout period, which is expected with this type of soap.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> The bar is generous, and lasts a long time, even with two of us using it.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> And also if you follow the directions on the soap it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This is clearing up the area (lots of dry shedding skin) and moisturizing the area.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks cleaner, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to ANYTHING nor do I have dry skin, so what on earth is in the soap that is causing all this itching and dryness?  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t over dry</li>
            <li> I had a dry, itchy rash on my neck for about a month now.</li>
            <li> Random tip, I wrap mine up in a clean coffee filter between uses so</li>
            <li> it has also helped dry my blemishes quicker.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and what&#x27;s is in this</li>
            <li> After years of soap either causing me to break out or leaving my skin dry this soap does neither.</li>
            <li> I mean, I guess it&#x27;s at a decent size for the price but usage</li>
            <li> The bar of soap is tiny, smaller than the average and frankly &#x3D; Not worth it.</li>
            <li> but alas, while the mind is willing the body says &amp;</li>
            <li> I have a open place on my face my 5 previous surgeries in one spot (a misdiagnosed ruptured cyst).  </li>
            <li> I was planning to re purchase my previous mud soap brand on here, but I decided to search universally for all mud soaps</li>
            <li> Most of us had bad skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin just after a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> I went back to using vivo per lei, with their dead sea mud soap my face is glowing and smoother.</li>
            <li> Also, i give this product 5 stars because i expected some drying of the skin while using this soap like any soap would do</li>
            <li> No more patches of dry skin (which is a big acne culprit for me, I think).  </li>
            <li> I could actually get jiggy after a long hard day at work with confidence that my essence is not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have plaque psoriasis, and have trouble finding soaps that don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but this dead sea mud soap does the trick!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is subtle, natural and divine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar soaps in the past</li>
            <li> My only gripe about this soap is that it&#x27;s too damn small.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works for acne or other things</li>
            <li> C-R-A-Z-Y and my skin is excessively dry!!!  </li>
            <li> I was having some trouble with my skin and it cleared up shortly after using the Dead Sea Mud soap.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too harsh, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> I prefer the other black soap I get on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because the shape is rectangular, which is quite hard to grip until it smoothens out.</li>
            <li> The only negative part was shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> Will stick with my other black soap; Dudu Osun Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, and it is unlikely we will be switching to Amy other soap</li>
            <li> shipping was punctual and the seller answered all my questions less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> My skin looks less oily and I&#x27;ve been noticing less acne.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I don&#x27;t normally use bar soap like this</li>
            <li> So for those of us a little less opportune in life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about trying new things</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Soap for a few days now</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this soap a few days now and my skin just loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s summer time and my skin can get dried out from all the sun and wind</li>
            <li> have used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few days now.</li>
            <li> Have you ever been to the Dead Sea?</li>
            <li> there are products like this soap containing Dead Sea mud.  </li>
            <li> I had been hopeful that I left the years of zits behind me</li>
            <li> I have also been using the dead sea mud mask in tandem with the soap, leaving it on my trouble spots for 15 minutes once a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Dead Sea Mud soap for a month now, I use it to wash my hands and face, and the results are</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so frustrating that she is following Dr&#x27;s orders and her face is still breaking out.  </li>
            <li> The soap from the dead Sea had no sent.  </li>
            <li> I had some annoying back acne problems because I live in HI and sweat all the time under my shirt</li>
            <li> What a surprise this little bar of soap was!</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong purchasing form this company because THEY ROCK!!!  :-)  </li>
            <li> I suffer from both pet dander and gluten allergies, both of which produce painful and REALLY itchy rashes when they become aggravated.  </li>
            <li> And she has all kinds of expensive woman facial cleansers and whatnot.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this soap is going on autoship because it is a total life hack.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a combination of all three things that is helping.  </li>
            <li> So many skin products have nasty chemicals in them these days.</li>
            <li> I can see a small change in my skin after 2 days of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can use anything else.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t stand that the glycerin in soaps are usually from pig....  </li>
            <li> I usually use it for my face.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have small fragments spring off while dividing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become somewhat of a connoisseur of soaps lately...  </li>
            <li> At least he manned up.</li>
            <li> This soap is both affordable and not filled with unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> No more scaliness AND no Itch!.</li>
            <li> (On a slightly serious note: the smell.</li>
            <li> so I had these painful bumps on my shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> I dont waste my time reviewing mediocre non-lifechanging products.</li>
            <li> After using this soap for two days, I have had a pretty bad skin reaction, resulting in a painful rash on my ears, legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer afterwards which before this soap was making the inflammation worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing dramatic results and its day two.</li>
            <li> With the (expensive, supposedly hypo-allergenic) brand I was using before, I could use a toner after cleansing and the cotton ball would be dirty from remaining dead skin and makeup.</li>
            <li> We ran him a bath and bathed him using the Dead Sea Mud Soap Bar to help with his bad dog dandruff.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter has had horrible acne and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> I give the aroma a 5 stars and unfortunately the soap, 3 stars and here is why:  </li>
            <li> The rash is so bad that I cannot shave or apply any lotions or deodorant to the affected areas.</li>
            <li> This one leaves your skin feeling sticky and although the scent isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even so painful that it keeps me up at night.</li>
            <li> my skin tone just looked ugly.</li>
            <li> This product made me break out badly!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li> The picture of this product is terribly misleading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for a week now, and i think my acne is getting worst</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really liked this organic soap.  The smell was very pleasant and not overwhelming.  My skin felt soft after use with no residual soap left on my skin.  When I walk into my bathroom I can smell the soap and I feel like I just walked into a spa area.  I&#x27;m looking forward to my next bath!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a week and love it! I have pretty clear (and sensitive) skin but had Pimple coming in when I first started using it. Within 3 days my pimple was gone before it could even come to a head. It smells great and gives a tingling that leave skin feeling great. I will be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> We like it,skin seems to be really clean after you use this ,good product</li>
            <li> This is the 4th brand of bamboo charcoal soap I&#x27;ve tried.  Before this one, I had rated the DETOXIFY bar by Godess Verde as my favorite but the price was just too steep.  This bar by Aspen Naturals is just as good as the DETOXIFYING and the price is much better. Prime shipping is also always a really great selling point.</li>
            <li> Great soap! Feels like you&#x27;re getting a 2-in-1 cleaning and exfoliation. I can tell it is going to last a long time, too, from the way lathers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become somewhat of a connoisseur of soaps lately...  I stopped buying the junk sold in stores, loaded with chemicals and who knows what.  They were drying out my skin and offensive to my nose.  I&#x27;ve mainly been shopping at Farmers&#x27; Markets, but now that I&#x27;ve found this product on Amazon, it is that much simpler to get my natural and nourishing soap.  And delivered right to my doorstep, no less!  I love this Dead Sea Mineral Mud!  It smells mostly like lemongrass and eucalyptus, which is a very refreshing scent.  I&#x27;ve even been using this on my face - it&#x27;s not too harsh, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap after having great luck with the Yes To Tomatoes activated charcoal soap. This soap was a fraction of the price and had great product reviews so I thought it would be good to give it a try.  After using this soap for two days, I have had a pretty bad skin reaction, resulting in a painful rash on my ears, legs and underarms. The rash is so bad that I cannot shave or apply any lotions or deodorant to the affected areas. It&#x27;s even so painful that it keeps me up at night. I stopped using the soap immediately, and have gradually felt an improvement since (it&#x27;s been almost 48 hours), however, the area around my ears has become so irritated that I will probably need to visit a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to soaps, especially those with plant oils, this may not be the soap for you.</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and I&#x27;m in LOVE! Smells and feels amazing! Way better than I thought! :)&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Loved this soap. It rinsed clean and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry. Love the scent!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is solely responsibe for my absolutely perfect skin right now because I use it with my daily-disinfected Clarisonic at night along with a BB cream formulated for Acne but I can comfortably say it has probably a lot tyo do wtih it.  No more patches of dry skin (which is a big acne culprit for me, I think).  Initially i was nervous to try something with oils in it, but it&#x27;s reallu great - maybe give it a shot and it will work for you too.</li>
            <li> Great soap! I love the way it smells, lathers, feels on my skin, love.love.love.  My skin is completely clear using this, and I have MAJOR adult acne problems. I&#x27;m talking major, as in using hormonal treatments, topical treatments/medicines etc. do not work. I use this bar on my whole body because I have skin problems all over. My skin is great now. I was using a different charcoal soap before this one and my skin had cleared up a bit, but I do really think the combination of the dead sea mud and clay has made the difference. Will definitely be purchasing more soap with these ingredients. This seller offers a two pack of these soaps. I wish I could find them in a bigger bulk purchase for a lower price. That would be nice!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 33 yo guy and hardly buy any special personal hygeine products. I ran accross this soap while looking at shaving soaps to use with my manly Merkur safety razor. This stuff is awesome for many reasons.  I had some annoying back acne problems because I live in HI and sweat all the time under my shirt so I had these painful bumps on my shoulders and back. I washed my back and shoulders yesterday morning with this soap and an activated charcoal sponge I bought. By this evening, my shoulders and back have almost completely.cleared up and my skin feels great. I washed my face twice with it so far and it is NOTICEABLY clearer. My wife used it for the first time tonight as well while we were having some bonding time in the outside shower,and she said that her face has never felt so good and clean. And she has all kinds of expensive woman facial cleansers and whatnot. Needless to say, this soap is going on autoship because it is a total life hack. You don&#x27;t think you need it but you do. I only write reviews for excellent products that work...I dont waste my time reviewing mediocre non-lifechanging products. Enjoy your soap and don&#x27;t worry about feeling like a girly man. My buddy laughed at me when I told him about it so I quickly arm-barred him then choked him out. When he woke up, he apologized and ordered the soap too. He also joined a local dojo because he apparently hadnt been beat up since his junior year of high school. Whatever. At least he manned up.</li>
            <li> This stuff felt great on my skin -- deeply cleansing and purifying. It left my face fresh, glowing, healthy, and ready for organic moisturizers. I love the product and will continue to use it whenever it is time for a home facial. Wonderful to know there are no chemicals or other unwanted ingredients, and it smells lovely too.</li>
            <li> I broke out in hard bumps but it feels good on your face at first but doesn&#x27;t work for gentle skin and acne problems</li>
            <li> So far so good with this luscious and creamy soap.  I love how it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> This soap is so Awesome! !! It makes my skin super soft and glowing. Also...it does help with acne. The smell is wonderful it makes my bathroom smell so good. I am a forever customer...thank you!</li>
            <li> This product made me break out badly! I did not change my diet or exercise. I used this soap on my face and body and within a couple of days my face broke out as well as my back (my back has never broken out before). HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li> I love this soap so far.  I have a open place on my face my 5 previous surgeries in one spot (a misdiagnosed ruptured cyst).  This is clearing up the area (lots of dry shedding skin) and moisturizing the area.  It is also bringing impurities to the surface of the skin which is a good thing.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; after using and I don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer afterwards which before this soap was making the inflammation worse.  I will continue using.  This bar is going to last a while as it is very large and I think is an exceptional value.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SOAP! Works miracles on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this soap hoping to clear up and moisturize my dry skin, it worked beautifully within days of first using it! Still keeps my skin clear and I no longer use the facial scrub I used to use from St Ives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT TO MENTION!! It takes all of my makeup off at the end of the night! EVEN my caked on mascara, and eyeliner when I go out in costume for shows!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommended and gave some to my friend with eczema and it REALLY helped her out. (She has a severe case of it)</li>
            <li> I love my dead sea mineral mud soap bar! This soap makes my skin look amazing and I love the glow that it gives me. I will definitely be buying this bar again!</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT!  After 2 weeks of use my skin is looking and feeling so much better!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of charcoal soaps on the market now, however most of them are filled with weird ingredients or too pricey. This soap is both affordable and not filled with unnecessary chemicals. I purchased this as an alternative to Lush&#x27;s Coalface, which made my face look wonderful but was too drying for my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s gentle and much more affordable than Lush.</li>
            <li> If you need to clean you skin...BUY IT NOW!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!!! My daughter has severe acne so I decided to order the soap for her. Her skin has improved significantly. She still has the acne scars which may be permanent but the overall improvement is present. The amount of white/blackheads have been noticeably reduced. My daughter&#x27;s confidence has been restored and everyone who&#x27;s suffered from acne knows the feeling. The only negative part was shipping and delivery. The product works beyond well. This is a list of issues my daughter has with her skin &amp; maybe this will help you with your decision to purchase this item. 1.)Oily Skin 2.) Acne Cyst 3.)Severe acne scaring 4.) Ance started with puberty 5.) She&#x27;s used Proactive,  been prescribed oral acne medication,changed her diet &amp; drinks a gallon of water per day. These are just a few things she&#x27;s done throughout the years which have cost me more money than I care to remember. I&#x27;m not being paid or have I received this product for free. I&#x27;m just a HAPPY MOM who enjoys seeing her daughter smile again when she looks in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get my pregnancy breakouts under control and this is the only soap that has helped! All of the pregnancy acne washes did nothing compared to the results I get with this. Within 1 week my skin was almost completely clear! And it continues to stay clear day by day. So happy I finally found something that works wonders. Plus it last forever and smells amazing! I feel so refreshed and clean after using this. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This is a personable company.  As soon as I ordered, they wanted me to email them and tell them what shape my soap was in and let then know if I have any issues with the soap. I&#x27;ve been using this soap about a week and already the pores on my face have reduced. I will order more of this soap when the time comes !</li>
            <li> I have many of these soaps from Aspen Kay, and I love every one of them.  They last a really long time, and I love that I know exactly what&#x27;s in them, good ingredients for me and my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this soap so far.  I just started using it but it cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t turn your sink black as you might think it would since it has activated charcoal.  I started making my own acv toner and vitamin c serum also. I&#x27;m seeing great results on my skin so far but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a combination of all three things that is helping.  I do think the soap is working great and hope my skin continues to improve. I have struggled with moderate hormonal acne and so far this new regimen seems to be improving things.</li>
            <li> I was looking for soap that had no laurel sulfate and I found this. I love that it has essential oils, minerals and vitamins for my skin. It has a light fragrance. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> The picture of this product is terribly misleading. The bar of soap is tiny, smaller than the average and frankly &#x3D; Not worth it. I recommend that the seller redo their image as it does not  in any way reflect the product that is received by the customer.</li>
            <li> Thank you is wonderful :)</li>
            <li> There is no sticky/ not washing off feeling, good smell and lasts a while. Doesn&#x27;t break up into prices.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap.  I&#x27;ve been using as a facial cleanser for over a week. I&#x27;ve used similar soaps in the past but I&#x27;m getting better results with this one. My skin looks cleaner, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome product! Not only did it help me with my dry skin but it helped my dog too! We ran him a bath and bathed him using the Dead Sea Mud Soap Bar to help with his bad dog dandruff. It&#x27;s gotten rid of 50% of his doggie dandruff, can&#x27;t wait to order more!</li>
            <li> Will stick with my other black soap; Dudu Osun Black Soap.  This one leaves your skin feeling sticky and although the scent isn&#x27;t bad I prefer the other black soap I get on amazon.  Also my face broke out with this soap, OK for body.</li>
            <li> Cleared my skin somewhat ! Amazing natural product ! Better than soaps with chemicals</li>
            <li> Soap makes me itch. Feels like tiny shards of glass in my skin. Fiberglass.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. My skin is responding well to it plus the scent of the lemongrass is refreshing.</li>
            <li> Great soap! My skin has been feeing soft all day and this is my first day of using it! Smells great. Loving it. Definitely sticking to this brand from here on out!</li>
            <li> This soap is so awesome! It smells great too. I use it on my face every night and have really noticed a difference. It seems like a really great company and I would certainly order from them again.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for sensitive skin prone to acne. I love it, it makes your skin feel so smooth after every use.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days once or twice a day and it seems to be helping my face clear up! If so I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for almost a week and love it. I use it on body and face. It smells so good!</li>
            <li> felt soft on my skin, and had a nice lemon scent!</li>
            <li> Good Soap .. Leaves Face Clean But Didn&#x27;t Really Help With My Acne</li>
            <li> I like this facial soap. It&#x27;s chock full of natural oils and good skin ingredients. I go back &amp; forth between this and oil cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very clean. This has been a part of my new acne regime for the last three days and the pimples are already almost gone!</li>
            <li> Great soap! Skin feel great! Smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I&#x27;m always skeptical about trying new things but this soap was amazing. Smells great but not too strong, makes your skin so soft and smooth and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that after 5 years as soon as I started using this product my body acne cleared right up! The seller was wonderful to deal with and I will most definitely be buying from them in the near future. And also if you follow the directions on the soap it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Wow! This soap works great! I have used many dead sea soaps in the past and this one works really well. I love the way it leaves my skin feeling at the end. I even use this as face soap. I would recommend this to my friends and family. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times and my pores look great and it preps my skin nicely for the toner I use every night.  It&#x27;s made with high quality ingredients, has a refreshing smell and isn&#x27;t cake-y like a lot of other mud soaps I have used.  I will definitely purchase this soap again.</li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and it is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It is a really nice soap with mud from the Dead Sea.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves your skin slightly tingly from the mint I imagine</li>
            <li> saw &amp; felt a difference from the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li> Loving this soap.  It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of all its oil.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed. Bar was smaller than I thought and it smelled like pine sol. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a cheaper alternative to origins charcoal soap but so far no luck. It lasted about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This soap smells amazing, and I love that it is handmade with no harmful chemicals. It leaves an awesome cooling effect that makes me feel so clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Soap for a few days now and I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap in hopes of clearing up or helping my daughters eczema. It has definitely started clearing it up and making her skin softer and getting rid of the rough sandpaper feeling. It also has a wonderful scent. I will buy more when we start running low.</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Best Soap I ever used.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great soap. It started to help a breakout on my back after first use!</li>
            <li> I have only used it one day, but already like it and will probably Love it soon! It does smell very nice as soon as you take it out of package. I washed my hands with it right away, and just wanted to share how nice it smells, and my hands felt soft, even with our hard water...a real plus! Will be washing my face and report back in a week or so!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Does not dry out my skin, cleans it well and removes makeup.  Feels great on and the oils provide great moister.  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my skin!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> As one who tries most skin care products at least once, I was highly impressed that this awesomely-priced soap not only smells amazing (lemongrass, peppermint, and eucalyptus!), but made my skin feel really clean without feeling harsh at all. It&#x27;s not crumbly, so I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;ll last me a while. Definitely give this soap a try, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> Great soap.  I have sensitive and dry skin.  I loved the way this soap lathered, it made my skin feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap bar on my twin boys today. All over their bodies and did their hair. Their hair turned out really nice, no conditioner needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this soap a few days now and my skin just loves it. It&#x27;s summer time and my skin can get dried out from all the sun and wind but this soap seems to be helping to prevent that.&lt;br /&gt;It is nicely packaged and arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciate not having to be concerned with what I am putting onto my skin. So many skin products have nasty chemicals in them these days.</li>
            <li> Nice product and great seller.  Soap is of good quality.  It smells nice and lathers well.</li>
            <li> It is  a nice soap and I will most likely purchase it again. I am 27 year old female with mild acne problems and this soap seems to help it. I use the soap with my olay pro x cleansing brush once a day. The scent is very pleasant and my skin feels clean and refreshed after using it. It is not drying at all.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works well, natural. Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I have very dry and sensitive skin and was pleasantly surprised to like it as much as I do. This soap is soothing. It does not have the best of smells but it is such a light smell and it dissipates so quickly that it doesn&#x27;t even matter. Overall a great soap!</li>
            <li> I consider myself to have adult acne. My skin is a lot clearer in comparison to my recent years, but I deal with breakouts, discoloration, large pores, milia, and combo skin. I have tried almost every method, trick, tip, and product. I was planning to re purchase my previous mud soap brand on here, but I decided to search universally for all mud soaps and I found this one. This one is a winner! This is far by the best mud soap that i have tried for the face. I like it so much, that I use it on my body as well.  I&#x27;m seeing dramatic results and its day two.The essential oils doesn&#x27;t irritant my face and body.  I love the lingering after smell of the lemongrass scent. The soap is light, refreshing and detoxing. No filmy residue by the way. Whoever put all the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients together in the soap really thought it through. Great combo for the skin. Who knew activated activate charcoal and acne are enemies? It&#x27;s getting rid of them.  Overall,  the product details for this soap does what it say it will do. Though everyone&#x27;s skin is different, it can probably meet your expectations. It&#x27;s worth trying.  I know that I will no longer be investing in facials and enthesians recommendations. I found what works, all under 10 dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My  shipping was punctual and the seller answered all my questions less than 24 hours. I was impressed with the seller and their professionalism.</li>
            <li> I Have only been using this soap for about a week and  already tell a big difference in the softness and overall complection. My wife even noticed a difference and I didn&#x27;t even tell her I was using it!! Great product and great people selling it! I will shop again with them for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li> Works great and smells fresh and citrus-y. Great for face and body.</li>
            <li> The soap smells nice. But thats mainly what its purpose is. It did not really cleanse my skin any better or improve the condition. Just expected way more. Would return but I used it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap !!! It has a nice lather and when I use it it makes my skin feel clean and refreshed. I&#x27;ve had spots on my shoulders that have amazingly cleared up. I very highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days but it smells super good and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any crappy ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I give the aroma a 5 stars and unfortunately the soap, 3 stars and here is why:  When I received this soap, it smelled absolutely heavenly and I could not wait to try it.  Then I tried it.  Well, I really don&#x27;t know what to think, because immediately following my first shower (using this soap) I am itching (ALL OVER) like C-R-A-Z-Y and my skin is excessively dry!!!  I am not allergic to ANYTHING nor do I have dry skin, so what on earth is in the soap that is causing all this itching and dryness?  I have been slathering myself in coconut oil all morning trying to reduce the *itches* and dryness.  I REALLY want to like this soap and I do love the aroma a LOT.  I will try this soap a second and maybe third time to see if it gives me the same result and will update later.  I know this is 100% money back guarantee, but I really, really want to give this soap a good college try before I return it.  Has anyone else had this issue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Added another start because: This company is so extremely WONDERFUL I almost can&#x27;t believe they care so much!  THANK YOU Aspen Naturals for being SO attentive and caring towards your customers!  Although I will still be giving this bar of soap a another couple of tries, on a much smaller part of my body rather than my entire body ;-) to see if the itching continues, I REALLY appreciate your attention to this matter.  You will not go wrong purchasing form this company because THEY ROCK!!!  :-)  They get 5 stars for their WONDERFUL customer service!  I am a HAPPY customer for sure, even if the soap made me itch.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a week now and loving it. I normally break out right before my monthly cycle and I feel like this is helping.  Really like this product so far.</li>
            <li> The wife loved it.  Made her skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Great soap... But I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with how the lemongrass dominated this soap.</li>
            <li> Unique smell, lasts forever</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! I LOVE all her soaps, but this one I love the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this soap!!  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used and makes my skin feel soft and healthy.  It has a wonderfully clean fragrance.  Great to find a soap with pure, natural ingredients, and I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Arrived yesterday, I&#x27;ve only used this soap once so far (on my face). I like the natural scent, reminds me of my essential oils. Seems to be of high quality and does NOT leave that commercial &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; residue on skin. So far, so good! I bought this for my adult acne, as I&#x27;ve tried a gazillion things, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will help with that. Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase:)</li>
            <li> Amazing soap.  It smells great.  It lathers really well.  I could tell a difference with my skin after.  Felt better and softer.</li>
            <li> Love it. I feel like I am doing something healthy for my body when I use this soap. I bought a soap holder at Walmart for 98 cents to store it in, in the shower. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap - made the old fashioned way! It smells amazing and it works great - the dry skin problems I had were completely cleared up within days!</li>
            <li> This is the best bar soap I have ever used.  Everyone in my household uses and swears by it. You can really tell the difference on your skin between these bars and the cheap chemical bars sold at the supermarket.  Every bit of this product is quality. Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap!!! My skin is clear &amp; soft. Finally I found a soap that works!!!! Keep on making this great product!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and timely arrival.  Great customer service as well.  The soap leaves my skin super soft and moisturized and has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> Yes, this soap is amazing! It has to be given that this is my first ever review. I&#x27;ve suffered from &#x27;backne&#x27; for YEARS dammit, and this soap made all but the scabs (kinda actually going away) and scars go away in days. And my skin feels softer than ever and moisturized. My only gripe about this soap is that it&#x27;s too damn small. I mean, I guess it&#x27;s at a decent size for the price but usage will shrink it like no other soap I&#x27;ve used and this is only in like a weeks usage by just me. Other than that it&#x27;s really great. The smell is probably the freshest smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever smelt from a soap. So pros are this soap works wonders on your skin but cons are it probably won&#x27;t last long and you&#x27;ll probably have to have deep pockets to continue using it.</li>
            <li> One of the best soaps I have ever tried. The scent is addictive and the soap does not dry out your skin. I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This soap cleared up my cystic acne. That alone is enough to give it 5 stars. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Fast service and great product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! Makes my skin feel smooth and rejuvenated! Also has a calming affect on the skin. I have been trying to handle a folliculitis situation all over my skin and this soap have given me the best results in clearing it up. I love it on my face too! Just a great soap! My fav to date! Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I love Aspen Naturals soaps!  The Dead Sea Mineral Mud is the third I&#x27;ve tried and it smells great and works great! I use it for shaving my legs, and washing my face and body.  All around great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using Aspen Naturals soap bars for a while now and me and my skin absolutely love their products! I recently used the Dead Sea Mineral Mud soap bar from Aspen Naturals and I was, again, impressed at the results. It left my skin - my body - being and feeling very clean, smooth and refreshed! I really recommend Aspen Naturals&#x27; Dead Sea Mineral Mud soap bar (as well as their other soap bars) to all you beautiful women out there. And your men will enjoy it too! :-)</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Ive only had the soap about a week...have used it everyday. I am an industrial worker, and I get quite sweaty and stinky. This has an incredible scent that neutralizes any foul odors. I use it from head to toe...and shave with it. Works great all over. Will definitely buy again.  Update...I&#x27;m on bar #3, and still loving this product. My daughter also uses it for acne. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin just after a few days of use.  I really like this product</li>
            <li> bought as a gift, he loves the soap, and seems to be really helping with skin dryness/irritation</li>
            <li> I got it as a facial soap, I love the feel, love that it&#x27;s natural, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Both my girlfriend and I use this soap. The minty lemongrass scent is a perfect unisex smell. It just smells clean. I won&#x27;t speak for her on this, but I&#x27;ve also been washing my face with it and it keeps my pores clean without drying my skin out at all. I would highly recommend it, and it is unlikely we will be switching to Amy other soap</li>
            <li> Very unique product and quality that is processed quickly by an excellent seller.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have been using this along with the mud mask and am happy with both products. I was skeptical because I don&#x27;t normally use bar soap like this but I am pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my face and body. It&#x27;s hard to describe scent but it smells great too :)</li>
            <li> I got this soap thinking it would work like everyone said. It just didn&#x27;t work for me at all. It made me break out and my skin tone just looked ugly. I went back to using vivo per lei, with their dead sea mud soap my face is glowing and smoother.</li>
            <li> Im aways searching for good facial soap and ive found it.  Helped clear up my complexion and made my skin soft, smells good (fresh minty smell).  Will definately buy again great quality product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great after using this soap. My face, neck, chest and back break out from time to time so I was looking for a natural product to help clear up breakouts. This soap did the job. Great scent too.</li>
            <li> I really have not had the product long enough to know if it really works for acne, but i can tell you that activated charcoal stopped my cystic acne! Also, i give this product 5 stars because i expected some drying of the skin while using this soap like any soap would do but it seemed the more i used the soap.. the more hydrated my skin was!  The soap also has a really nice smell to it! I will update my review later on.</li>
            <li> Hi.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few days now. It is refreshing and not slimy and rinses off beautifully. My face feels extremely clean and soft following use. There is nothing drying about this soap. I actually look forward to washing my face. I am looking forward to using it on my back which still tends to break out from time to time.The smell is divine.  I&#x27;ll see how it helps my back before I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very courteous and professional. The actual owner emailed me several times to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase. Organic mud soap is an amazing product!! My face feels 10 years younger!! Their soap and mud mask will now be a permanent part of my daily regemin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for everything!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received it yesterday and I had to give it 5 stars after the first use my skin has been amazingly soft and smooth all day. Definitely purchasing more for everyday use!!!Thanks</li>
            <li> Okay ThIs was my first time ordering online I thought my bar would be bigger but all in all still Okay</li>
            <li> Excellent service!!  I absolutely love the soap.  It has a moisturizing lather and the most wonderful scent. It turns my bath into a spa!!!  It&#x27;s worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Immediate shipping. This soap smells heavenly!! And I love how it makes my skin feel so soft and silky. Definitely recommend, and will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> A lovely soap...soothing and aromatic.</li>
            <li> Love this. I&#x27;ve found that a combo of dead sea salt/mud and charcoal really works wonders for my skin. I break out on my chest, back, face, and neck in blackheads, whiteheads, and painful cystic acne and the combination of dead sea salt and charcoal has so far done a good job of keeping it manageable. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything. I particularly like aspen kay&#x27;s because it smells amazing. It doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue feeling and will thoroughly clean your skin of oil and dirt, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I&#x27;m using this in combination with Skin Obsession 30% Glycolic Acid Chemical Peel after reading that the combination of the two helps a lot with adult acne, hormonal and generalized. I&#x27;m really happy with the results. My confidence is coming back.</li>
            <li> this soap is my new favorite. i&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and my skin has never looked clearer. it doesn&#x27;t over dry and my skin is nice and soft as well. and it smells great. i&#x27;m a loyal customer from now on.</li>
            <li> Great soap! I lov how it smells and feels. Great choice</li>
            <li> I had a dry, itchy rash on my neck for about a month now. Impressively, after just one use of this soap, the dry patch of skin became smooth. No more scaliness AND no Itch!. After day 2, the rash is  still progressively healing! Along with this magic, the soap smells great, lathers great, and feels great on my skin. The math is quite simple---natural ingredients equal GREAT results. I recommend you buy this soap today!</li>
            <li> This soap has a beautiful lemongrass scent, I want to eat it lol. Smells like the lemongrass tea I had at a Thai restaurant.  Lathers well and I just enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This product is great! We use only organic products, and this one is a very high quality. Plus it smells very refreshing! Will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just love the soap. It makes my face and whole body feel refreshed and soft. I usually do not try new things like this and I am so glad I did. this is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap!!! I will never go back to the store bought brands.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 more bars to give as gifts and will continue to share my experience with others....this soap is the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel fresh and clean even if I&#x27;ve had a long sweaty day at work.....I don&#x27;t feel stinky or gross. I could actually get jiggy after a long hard day at work with confidence that my essence is not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good about this soap!!!</li>
            <li> Good product love the way my skin feels after using it !</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it! It does clean my face and it clears my acne very well. The only this that I have to use moisturizer after I wash my face because it tends to be a little dry after I rinse it off; but other than that it is a great soap-and I will will definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This is very effective! In the first couple of washes my skin felt much healthier and clean. I could see a huge difference in my skin after about 2-3 washes.</li>
            <li> Have you ever been to the Dead Sea? Awesome. I haven&#x27;t. So for those of us a little less opportune in life there are products like this soap containing Dead Sea mud.  I recently had to ditch my baby-deterrent system and to my delight (read &amp;#34;delight&amp;#34; sarcastically) found that my skin still thinks it&#x27;s only 16 years old and that jr. prom is only days away. This wasn&#x27;t the biggest problem at 16 though. Most of us had bad skin so I was among friends. However, now, in my thirties, it is a bit more of a problem. I had been hopeful that I left the years of zits behind me but alas, while the mind is willing the body says &amp;#34;Nope. Just a big tall glass of nope, missy.&amp;#34;   And so, taking matters into my own hands, I searched Amazon and landed upon this soap. I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, but I can tell you already that it&#x27;s keeping the monsters at bay. I have yet to obtain perfect skin but there&#x27;s only so much I can fight genetics (thanks, Dad) and I don&#x27;t expect the folks at Aspen Naturals to take up gene therapy. Just keep making this awesome soap!   (On a slightly serious note: the smell. I love herbal/medicinal smells so this soap is an aromatic treat for me but it may not be your cup of tea if you can&#x27;t stand or handle such a scent.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is not the best soap but it is the best mens soap. why? no tee tree oil, no lavender oil, no ROSEMARY EXTRACT ( almost every natural products contains rosamary extact) These natural things i mention decrease testosterone.</li>
            <li> The size of standard bar soap. There was an initial breakout period, which is expected with this type of soap. My skin looks and feels amazing. The smell is lovely. My new favorite soap.</li>
            <li> Great smell and soft skin.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected. But overall, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This soap is my official go-to bar. It gives you that super clean feeling. The kind that could be compared to stripping your face of all natural oils, yet that doesn&#x27;t appear to be happening because my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry and cracked, just the opposite... This bar leaves me with the perfect balance of a clean, smooth, and soft feeling face. I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled across this gem! My tired and dull complexion is starting to look pretty great.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap!  Soaps up very well. Pleasant smelling. Works great for acne which is why I bought it for.</li>
            <li> So far it has been a nice soap. I have adult acne and thought it may help with that. I have not seen much of a difference yet, but it&#x27;s only been just over a week.</li>
            <li> Product feels great on my skin. The lemon scent smells great and refreshing. This is my second day using the product.  Hopefully  it will clear my acne mostly for good as the other reviews had said.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face on the days I don&#x27;t exfoliate to help clear up my acne. My acne is not 100% gone but I definitely did see improvement! I will continue using it!</li>
            <li> One of the best soaps I have ever used. I have not only oily, acne-prone skin, but sensitive skin. It&#x27;s hard to find products that clean my skin without drying it out. This soap is wonderful. And the smell is light, not too overpowering. It leaves your skin clean, refreshed (from the wonderful mint), smooth and radiant! This has definitely become a regular in my household.</li>
            <li> This soapbar literally gets all the dirt off your face!! When I tone  afterwards of washing there is seriously no dirt left! This bar smells great and leaves your skin feeling refreshed, I have rosacea and truly sensitive skin but this soap bar does not irritate it at all!! Great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap! It smells great, and feels fantastic on my skin. I have plaque psoriasis, and have trouble finding soaps that don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but this dead sea mud soap does the trick! its very gentle, and I have noticed a difference in the size of my psoriasis spots since I started using it. I have also been using the dead sea mud mask in tandem with the soap, leaving it on my trouble spots for 15 minutes once a day. The difference is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I also have an acne problem, body and face, and I have noticed a huge reduction in the frequency of breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap I love it and shipping was very fast. Thank you so much for this product I will definitely buy from you again! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My daughter like it very much</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  This has a nice scent that permeates throughout the house after you use it, and helps invigorate you as well as get you clean.  The essential oils and mint will burn if you get it in your eyes, but it livens and wakes you up, leaving you feeling refreshed after you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this soap! It smells so fresh and clean! I love how natural it is! My skin feels great! I plan to buy a few more for family as they were pretty jealous when I showed them:)</li>
            <li> Smells great and lathers well. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Dead Sea Mud soap for a month now, I use it to wash my hands and face, and the results are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is subtle, natural and divine. My skin is clean and soft, and as I mentioned, gentle enough to be used on my face. By the way, I am lucky enough to also have another 8 soaps from the same company, in all sorts of flavors and smells, all of them awesome.</li>
            <li> I was having some skin issues for a while and finally figured out that I am sensitive to soy and grain derivatives not just in food, but in my cosmetic products too. I was looking for something all natural to help calm my skin and clean out the toxins, and this has worked great. It has a fresh but calming scent from the lemongrass and mint. My skin is looking clear and even, and feeling super soft. It cleans very well, too. With the (expensive, supposedly hypo-allergenic) brand I was using before, I could use a toner after cleansing and the cotton ball would be dirty from remaining dead skin and makeup. When using this soap, the cotton ball looks clean afterward, so it is getting everything off, which is great!</li>
            <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin and like other soaps/body washes it did not break me out. Smells amazing and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great soap! High quality and it smells wonderful. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This may be the only soap I will ever use for the rest of my life - medicinally this soap does wonders on the skin, especially for those prone to acne. I recommend those with skin impurities to give this soap a try - after using it for 2 weeks straight I not only almost totally clear but also the discoloration has DRASTICALLY faded from old acne marks on my arms and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are feeling hopeless - there is hope! Give this soap a solid try, at the very least you will smell lovely and it won&#x27;t break your bank.</li>
            <li> I like the soap but it was alot smaller than I thought it would be and way to much money for such a little bar. I would like to buy again but probably won&#x27;t because of the price.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It smells clean and refreshing. I use it for my whole body and face. Very much recommended!</li>
            <li> I received my product right on time and the seller was excellent. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I love it. I am no longer able to take hormones and for two years I have struggled with the tell tale adult acne around my chin and up my cheeks. I&#x27;ve always had very clear skin and have never struggled. I&#x27;ve switched up my diet, I use organic and natural makeup and I feel the addition of this soap is REALLY helping. My skin looks less oily and I&#x27;ve been noticing less acne. The soap suds up nicely and smells lovely like lemongrass, which I really enjoy. Random tip, I wrap mine up in a clean coffee filter between uses so my cats don&#x27;t get to it. Keeps it nice and dry, doesn&#x27;t stick to it. I will be making this purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Highly recommend. Great seller.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Bar of soap smells so good. It seems as tho it has also helped dry my blemishes quicker.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Works great!</li>
            <li> I got this to use with Konjac Sponge (3 Pack) I love the smell of the mint and it feels nice on your skin. It feels refreshing and soft.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, and it smells wonderful. It leaves your skin feeling so nice and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love this charcoal soap! I have been diligently washing my face with it for 4 weeks and have noticed improvements in the firmness of my skin; in the diminished size of my pores; and, in the reduction of acne. I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Great soap for acne. Use witch hazel afterwards</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it smells great and leaves my skin feeling very clean. I have some acne on my shoulders and back and it&#x27;s clearing it up already. As close to natural ingredients as one can get in a bar of soap. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that this is pretty much a dupe for Lush&#x27;s Coalface soap. I used up all of my coalface soap and it was suuper clarifying, the only problem was the price difference between coalface and this bar. I suffer from acne and this has helped control it, but even if I didn&#x27;t have acne I would still use this soap. It does pretty much the same thing. This price definitely beats Lush&#x27;s and you get more.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good! I don&#x27;t have any issues with my skin so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works for acne or other things but I really love how it smells and how soft and smooth my skin feels after I use it!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! My 14 year old daughter has had horrible acne and nothing has worked. We&#x27;ve tried proactive, antibiotics, topical creams, special face washing soap prescribed by Dermatologist, she&#x27;s changed her diet, and four years later still no results. It&#x27;s been so frustrating that she is following Dr&#x27;s orders and her face is still breaking out.  I finally convinced her to try this soap because I thought what have we got to lose? I also have had acne my whole life and this soap has done wonders for me. I just can&#x27;t believe after only using this soap for one week how much clear her face is. I can tell she is feeling more confident about her complexion and happy to finally see the acne clearing up. If you suffer with acne you need to get this soap!</li>
            <li> I love it!! I wish there was a toner &amp; moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It makes me skin feel clean and the oils are stipped from my face! I will contiue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It smells wonderful.  It leaves me feeling clean, and it does not dry out my skin.  The bar is generous, and lasts a long time, even with two of us using it.  I plan to keep buying this!</li>
            <li> This soap is really amazing. This is what a mans soap should be made. Nice and not so harsh on the skin, the scent is amazing and it is really soothing. This is my kind of soap.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and fresh. I can see a small change in my skin after 2 days of use. I am looking forward to seeing how my skin improves over a week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for a week now, and i think my acne is getting worst, dont know if it&#x27;s normal but will try it for one more week to give it a chance. :(</li>
            <li> So far this bar is a miracle worker!!! Cleared up my skin in days and has kept it glowing!!!</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Don&#x27;t know if it has effect on acne, but smells awesome and leaves skin feeling clean</li>
            <li> Omg this is by far the best soap I have ever used and it smells incredible. I&#x27;m not sure if I can use anything else. I have seen real results in just a few weeks and I definitely will purchase again. It is well worth the money you will definitely be satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this soap 3 times now and I am so glad I did!  I have found that not only can I use this on my body, but also on my face.  This soap rinses clean and makes my skin feel so good.  Bye bye itchy skin - yay!  The smell of this soap is good, it&#x27;s not like perfume and it&#x27;s a little unusual (in a good way)!.  This is my new go-to soap.  I have no plan to change. A very happy customer :)</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good</li>
            <li> Very similar to soap from Israel that a familiar. This soap has a great sent.  The soap from the dead Sea had no sent.  But this soap had the same effect on my skin.  Cleans and removes oil. Will be purchasing more of this soap soon.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Aspen Naturals products to any person in need of some exceptional natural soap products.  I suffer from both pet dander and gluten allergies, both of which produce painful and REALLY itchy rashes when they become aggravated.  Aspen Naturals soaps not only helps greatly to sooth the constant itch these allergies create but also helps the healing process of the rashes as well and they leave your skin so soft to boot.  In addition to all of this their prices are great as well, in looking at other soap products of their kind Aspen Naturalâ€™s prices were the best of all the products I checked into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly outside of the soaps wonderful functionality, the soaps themselves are so beautiful and have such a lovely sent to them that they make an excellent decorative soap piece for your guest bathroom as well, theyâ€™re a perfect match of artistry and craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really canâ€™t say enough great things about Aspen Naturalâ€™s products.  Iâ€™ll only be buying Aspen Naturals for my familyâ€™s natural soap needs and Iâ€™ve no doubt that you will be extremely happy with the products as well.  MP</li>
            <li> It is OK and I like it. Cleans pores well. Last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  I was having some trouble with my skin and it cleared up shortly after using the Dead Sea Mud soap.  And I love the way my skin feels.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and I love what it does for my skin. This product is a great, from the scent (very light, I have alergies and this does not effect them) to clearing my pores. I am beyond satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, my skin has stayed nice and clear of breakouts and it&#x27;s not too drying.</li>
            <li> So many products out there may seem equivalent to this soap, but they are not. I love this product for my face and better yet because it is a vegetable based soap. Some people may say &amp;#34;so what, you&#x27;re not eating it&amp;#34;, but I can&#x27;t stand that the glycerin in soaps are usually from pig....  So how can I use it on my skin. Yuck!</li>
            <li> Great Soap! It smells wonderful and has cleared up the dermatitis on my face. I love that it has all natural ingredients. Also, it  arrived right on time with no issues. I will definitely re-order. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt; -Nicole</li>
            <li> Seems good. This business actually cares if you have received your purchases or not. Only four stars for now as I have only bathed once with it.</li>
            <li> I use it for showering and as a facial bar. It works really well!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I only gave it 4 stars because the shape is rectangular, which is quite hard to grip until it smoothens out.</li>
            <li> This soap is FABULOUS!!! I love the smell! It works so well and I will definitely be purchasing more products!!!!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and feels so great going on!</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. I use it for my body and face... I have dry skin and what&#x27;s is in this doesn&#x27;t make my skin too oily after a wash. Feels smooth and clean! Good quality and service too. Def worth a try... Enjoy</li>
            <li> I really love this soap bar! I usually use it for my face. It takes off all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling so refreshed. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face either, especially with this cold/windy winter! I actually cut it up in 2 peices, one for the shower and one near the sink for my face :) I would definitely love to buy another one when this runs out.</li>
            <li> My first time using this soap.So far so good. I love it. My skin tends to dry so easy so I have to used liquid soap, bar soap dries my skin but this particular brand really feels good on my skin.I will continue to use this product its really gentle and very mild to your skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap! It has a nice scent and makes my skin feel really good. It came fast as well!</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful and it bubbles up nicely, but it didn&#x27;t seem to cut the build-up of the previous day&#x27;s deodrant.  So maybe it&#x27;s too mild for me?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this product, it works really well with my skin. I do enjoy this soap bar!! I hope that as a proud customer I&#x27;m looking forward to get one of your soap bar free as a complement!</li>
            <li> Great product and plan to use again in the future. Thanks,</li>
            <li> Very good product,as described. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only three times (the dead sea mineral mud soap) but so far no new break outs, face feels clean when washed, refreshed, not overly dry or stepped, and the bar was a good size. I actually had to split it in two to fit in the soap dish I bought for it. I would recommend putting it in a cool dry spot for a while if you don&#x27;t want to separate it into two pieces at least when ordering and your area is warmer than 75Â°, the bar was rather malleable (pliable) when I received it I was able to break in half with my hand instead of using a tool. Which wasn&#x27;t an issue, it wasn&#x27;t melting, and I appreciated not having to use a tool so I didn&#x27;t have small fragments spring off while dividing.</li>
            <li> This soap so far hasn&#x27;t helped my skin clear up that much, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different. What it has helped me with is razorburn. I use it for my body as well as to shave my legs. I haven&#x27;t gotten razorburn after shaving when using it, and my legs almost feel smoother for longer. It&#x27;s a great, natural soap with a refreshing scent from natural oils. I&#x27;m glad I got two bars! I&#x27;ll order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my skin feel so smooth. Love using all natural products!</li>
            <li> Made my skin breakout more</li>
            <li> Cleared up my complexion in a week! will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel, and how good it smells! Feel like my skin is clean and not clogged! Gentle enough I use on my face too!</li>
            <li> Great soap. I have been using this for more than a week and my skin is clearer, softer and looks better. It smells great and its soft. I love this product and I will definalelly buy it again.</li>
            <li> What a surprise this little bar of soap was! I have never used a soap like this, but wanted to try. I can honestly say, I am a true fan now!  Not only is my skin exceptionally soft after using the bar, I&#x27;m in love with the scent! I will definitely be reordering for myself, and plan on buying bars as gifts for friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, this product is the answer to my prayers. After years of soap either causing me to break out or leaving my skin dry this soap does neither. It lathers well and lasts a long time. It is worth the money that you pay for it. I also find the scent very soothing and nice. I have already put in another order for more.</li>
            <li> just make sure you don&#x27;t keep the paper on it like i did- stuck to it</li>
            <li> Just recently received my order and I absolutely love this soap! Has a nice creamy lather, a refreshing lemony scent. It cleans really well and leaves my skin soft and supple. Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is gentle and rinses off easily. I have very sensitive skin with constant breakouts on my face. After using for a few days, my skin was almost clear.</li>
            <li> I have used it top few times to write a review, but I will say that it washes off easily and does not have a dark color when it&#x27;s on the skin. I have a feeling I am going to really be glad I bought this. This is something that has to be used for a while to see results.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this on Wednesday and by Friday the acne on her back was drying up not as red and starting to take affect it&#x27;s now Saturday.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this soap, my skin is very soft, my acne is clearing up, and the only negative I can think of is that your water bill will go up from wanting to take so many baths!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a huge fan of dead sea products and this is definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Used it for only a few days, but it smells wonderful. I use it with my konjac charcoal sponge and I noticed my skin is getting clearer. I looked at other charcoal bar soaps online too, but decided to order this one and fell in love with the scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne prone skin. Love the cleanliness and will order again in the near future. Thank you!  I actually just ordered the oatmeal and honey soap bar from this seller because I love this soap so much. ;)</li>
