            <li> Great tanning pad.Very natural color that lasts for a few days. Does not stain your hands while applying.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service!</li>
            <li> I liked the color, but it didn&#x27;t go on evenly.  It streaked after just one shower and looked pretty bad.</li>
            <li> It left my skin smelling like a baked potato and blotchy.</li>
            <li> Looks totally natural!!!</li>
            <li> I love this self tanner.  The color looks great after just one application.  I usually apply, let it dry for about 10 minutes, and then add moisturizer over it.  It helps rub in and even out any streaks or missed spots and doesn&#x27;t take away any of the color.</li>
            <li> These are a bit pricey, so I use them twice.  Just quickly coat my arms and legs, then put the towlette back in the package and fold it up.  Next day use it again and darkens the tan.  I only use this on arms and legs and maybe a little below the neck.  Gives a beautiful natural- looking tan with almost NO SMELL.  Very important to me.  A few hours after using apply body lotion for amazing results.</li>
            <li> These work great! One body pad covers both arms, both legs and most of the body. No fake orange look either. After using them people often ask where I&#x27;ve been because I look so tan.</li>
            <li> I am not happy w/this product because it says in the picture shown with Vitamin D &amp; the order I received is different and does not say that it contains Vitamin D..</li>
            <li> I love these and use them on my legs that don&#x27;t tan as easily and especially in the winter months.  Apply all over, let it dry for a couple minutes, then apply lotion.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Beats to tanning booth and I always get such glowing remarks about my tan!</li>
            <li> very good price for the product and seems to be high standard.</li>
            <li> Natural looking tan all the time. This is my favorite product year round.</li>
            <li> I love these sheets better than any lotion I have ever tried.  Great color, hands don&#x27;t show it on palms, and it seems to last longer.  Also, the color shows up pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> I love these pads. They do a fairly good job. Beats sunbathing.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin look like you just jad a facial with a warm glow</li>
            <li> Simply amazing and natural!  I feel comfortable wearing my suits/dresses to work without hose/tights because of the natural &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; I get from this product.  It provides a sweet glow and just looks like I was out in the sun last weekend. In reality, I do not sunbathe and wear sunscreen because I value my skin. You can have your cake and eat it too with the Dr. Gross skin care body glow pads. It&#x27;s important to follow the instructions and use lotion with it.?</li>
