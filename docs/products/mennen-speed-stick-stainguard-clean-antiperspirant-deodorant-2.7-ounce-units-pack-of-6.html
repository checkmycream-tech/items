            <li>Happy that they are selling it here!!!!</li>
            <li>Keeps him happy!</li>
            <li>I got these for an excellent price.</li>
            <li>I received this on time and it was package very good.</li>
            <li>so I was very happy to find it online and for a great deal.</li>
            <li>This one does a great job of both handling the stain and perspiration issue.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>The 10% this product has works just great for me</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>BUT it works great</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as non-stainguard version</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Target quit carrying my &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ve ordered it twice from Amazon and been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with Adidas t-shirt safe deodorant, but I can&#x27;t find it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still nice</li>
            <li>At first, this product seemed great.  </li>
            <li>but luckily Amazon caries a bulk pack at a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well, that&#x27;s a huge bonusto me!</li>
            <li>As many well know, virtually all anti-antiperspirants use Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly, which block pores temporarily, thereby preventing sweat.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more</li>
            <li>This is my son&#x27;s favorite deoderant.  </li>
            <li>Glad I can buy it online.</li>
            <li>I just had to share what I love about this deodorant though.</li>
            <li>Since &amp;#34;Alzheimer&#x27;s-proof&amp;#34; deodorant doesn&#x27;t sell too well, Mennen came up with this &amp; marketed it as &amp;#34;Stainguard&amp;#34; hoping savvy consumers (like you &amp; I :) will add 2 &amp; 2.</li>
            <li>If you use deodorant every day, you don&#x27;t need the 18-22% aluminum zirconium most &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; deodorants have.</li>
            <li>The more it has, the better the product deactivates your sweat glands (in theory anyway).</li>
            <li>Again, used daily, this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>the deodorant was able to permanently stain my shirts.</li>
            <li>, it mostly comes out.</li>
            <li>name said everything I wanted to hear - that this antiperspirant would help prevent the stains that had plagued all my favorite shirts for years.  </li>
            <li>This was my favorite deodorant, until they stopped selling it in the stores.</li>
            <li>I used this deodorant for many years.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind using the chemicals, this was my favorite, but I do recommend the homemade option for anyone who is concerned about their health.</li>
            <li>It is the best deodorant in my opinion, I have used several brands and forms but none works fine for me.</li>
            <li>This product suits me fine, since in healthcare can&#x27;t wear perfumes ,and love knowing , not offending anyone .</li>
            <li>I have been using this for quite some time now, and I am happy to report that I do not have any buildup on my shirts like I have had for decades with the old &amp;#34;Sport Talc&amp;#34; version of Speed Stick.</li>
            <li>However, I started making my own homemade deodorant at home with coconut oil, baking soda and arrowroot powder which is far more effective and lacking all of the chemicals that are found in these commercially available deodorants.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll quickly see that there are many credible scientific studies linking it to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</li>
            <li>This item is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>I bought underwear from Hanes and got 9 free samples...</li>
            <li>Wish the unscented version were available.</li>
            <li>Also great for my big family.</li>
            <li>big plus! LOL</li>
            <li>and I have learned a couple of important things that might help people prevent underarm stains.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, but they take a whole lot longer to turn that grey/white gross color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(But I&#x27;d venture to guess that even the &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; stuff with more than twice the alum zirconium doesn&#x27;t help you either right?</li>
            <li>He enjoys the scent of Fresh product , more then the Clean version.</li>
            <li>However, I have had zero problems with staining, but that wasn&#x27;t even why I bought the product originally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d originally purchase this product for my husband , who loves this deodorant  for his problem with underarm stain issue.</li>
            <li>Really does seem to reduce pit stains, has a nice fresh scent and works well as an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it really doesn&#x27;t stain your shirt.</li>
            <li>I still get some underarm staining on my T-shirts and outer shirts; but, stains are greatly reduced from my previous brand.</li>
            <li>Honestly I could care less if this product causes stains because the lower ingredient strength is what matters most to me.</li>
            <li>This works well and has a nice scent, but it isn&#x27;t super strong and overpowering like some other scents.</li>
            <li>I purchase his Fresh scent version and ended up with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review if they provide anything worth posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and item was exactly as described in factory sealed carton.</li>
            <li>like most how it simply smells clean, not perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will prolong the life of your undershirts, while smelling good and blocking sweat - really a no brainer!</li>
            <li>I get this for my husband because the scent is very light and barely noticeable (&amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when eveluating Stainguard were the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>, which is exactly what the person buying the Stain Guard product DIDN&#x27;T want in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, assuming it would be better for my shirts.</li>
            <li>and I work outside most of the day.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, more doesn&#x27;t necessarily equal &amp;#34;less&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have a history of staining the armpits of shirts, and this product was exactly what I&#x27;d been looking for.  </li>
            <li>First, stain treat the underarm areas of your shirts as soon as you put your shirts in the laundry:</li>
            <li>The local stores quit carrying this product, so I was pleased to find it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, and offers good protection as well.</li>
            <li>I am a heavy sweater, and stinker, without good protection, and I am very happy with this products performance.</li>
            <li>, it works as an anti-perspirate/deodorant, and if I happen to be lucky enough to get on up there in age to enjoy my great-grandchildren- and remember their names too-</li>
            <li>As far as commercial deodorants go, I found it quite effective.</li>
            <li>do not know if people claiming they still have staining problems are from this product not being strong enough for them to not sweat.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t buy a cure for Alzheimer&#x27;s when exposed to too much aluminum over a lifetime, so</li>
            <li>The whole &amp;#34;Stainguard&amp;#34; thing does not matter to me at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want to do that with all of my colored</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really love this kind and would recommend it to others who want to smell good but not have that horribly overpowering musky smell.</li>
            <li>Yes, it will stain shirts if you use too much of it.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has dealt with underarm stain problems for years, I was excited to see someone finally addressing the issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I found I sweat about 50% more with this product than against other leading anti-antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>The reason it protects against stains is because it has about half the aluminum zirconium that most deodorants have.</li>
            <li>Second, don&#x27;t iron your shirts (and especially your underarm areas) until you&#x27;re sure that any stains are gone.  </li>
            <li>Not only did this product work for me but also my old pit stained shirts came clean after a few washes, it does leave a darker tint on some shirts but that goes away a lot easier than the crusty yellow stains with a stain removal stick, I was also excited that I&#x27;m not allergic to it as most deodorants causes a rash,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>honestly I am more than a little pissed that no one carries it</li>
            <li>I had to throw a couple out and several were saved after many long soaks/washes.  </li>
            <li>You can buy a new shirt</li>
            <li>Had to throw out a dozen shirts and spend money I didn&#x27;t want to on new clothes.</li>
            <li>this is very clearly a product</li>
            <li>Works better than other similar products in fighting against stains on the underarms of t-shirts.</li>
            <li>Although the negative health affects of long term exposure to aluminum zirconium are still not proven, I think it&#x27;s better to not take any chances if you don&#x27;t need such a strong antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Some of the other scents of Speedstick are so strong that they actually compete with his cologne.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to find so many bad reviews, as I love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing we have tried so far has gotten it out.</li>
            <li>This really works fighting yellow stains on t-shirts!</li>
            <li>Every shirt I wore developed stains within 5 wearings.</li>
            <li>It does not produce the dreaded yellow stains on undershirts -- good news, but you trade that for a far worse issue, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The fact that this product has less aluminum in it than many other antiperspirants was also great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like others, I was drawn to the new Speed Stick based on the promise that it will stop yellow staining on my t-shirts.  </li>
            <li>you Spray and Wash the pit stains, and run the shirts through on extra hot, on a long cycle</li>
            <li>It is not as noticeable on white shirts, but clearly shows up on any colored shirt.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sweating problems , but to those people suffering from extreme issues , no products will work on them and for others certain products will work.</li>
            <li>I may get underarm stains on my shirts, but at least I&#x27;ll smell fresh all day!  </li>
            <li>Sorry, but I can&#x27;t recommend this product from my own personal experience.</li>
            <li>saw some photos of me recently, and the dark pit stains are very noticeable.</li>

            <li> this is very clearly a product</li>
            <li> Works better than other similar products in fighting against stains on the underarms of t-shirts.</li>
            <li> Although the negative health affects of long term exposure to aluminum zirconium are still not proven, I think it&#x27;s better to not take any chances if you don&#x27;t need such a strong antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Some of the other scents of Speedstick are so strong that they actually compete with his cologne.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to find so many bad reviews, as I love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing we have tried so far has gotten it out.</li>
            <li> This really works fighting yellow stains on t-shirts!</li>
            <li> Every shirt I wore developed stains within 5 wearings.</li>
            <li> It does not produce the dreaded yellow stains on undershirts -- good news, but you trade that for a far worse issue, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The fact that this product has less aluminum in it than many other antiperspirants was also great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like others, I was drawn to the new Speed Stick based on the promise that it will stop yellow staining on my t-shirts.  </li>
            <li> you Spray and Wash the pit stains, and run the shirts through on extra hot, on a long cycle</li>
            <li> It is not as noticeable on white shirts, but clearly shows up on any colored shirt.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sweating problems , but to those people suffering from extreme issues , no products will work on them and for others certain products will work.</li>
            <li> I may get underarm stains on my shirts, but at least I&#x27;ll smell fresh all day!  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but I can&#x27;t recommend this product from my own personal experience.</li>
            <li> saw some photos of me recently, and the dark pit stains are very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Dang, the negative reviews were right.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that this deodorant caused black stains on my dress shirts.</li>
            <li> till then it&#x27;s back to dry, but stained shirts.</li>
            <li> This product has enough alum zirconium to keep me dry</li>
            <li> use Shout or another product that can be used and allowed to dry before you actually wash your clothes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to stop using this product, and I&#x27;m afraid that I will have to throw out most of my short-sleeve shirts.</li>
            <li> I might be tripping but its actually harder to remove in the shower, feels like a wax layer over my armpits, never noticed with before with regular deoderant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Speed Stick regular for years and never really had a problem with stains.</li>
            <li> It works just fine for me and the benefit is I&#x27;m exposing myself to a lot less aluminum zirconium than I would be wearing unnecessary stronger antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> I bought 6 and won&#x27;t have to worry about restocking for a long time!</li>
            <li> how it goes on mostly dry.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is only 10% Alumnium Z.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that has such a low amount.</li>
            <li> I have workout shirts that I wore for years without a single pit stain that are now ruined because of \\&quot;Stainguard\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I should have done the laundry sooner because by the time I figured out that this deodorant was causing the dark underarm stains, my husband had ten ruined polo shirts.</li>
            <li> stuff leaves big greasy, waxy dark marks in your shirt arm pits.</li>
            <li> Still have the yellow stain after a little while, even using Oxyclean.</li>
            <li> I have noticed this product is getting harder to find in stores, so I am now looking for it online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the Stainguard variety, which is what is getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s harder to find in stores for some reason)</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you want no stains... absolutely no aluminum..</li>
            <li> No Thanks!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;clean\\&quot; version is not offensive to my wife like other scents.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this for my BF anywhere in CVS or other drugstores.</li>
            <li> so i can always have some and not go a day without due to  not having backup.</li>
            <li> Colgate also sent me a check for $4 to cover the cost of that product, as well as a bevy of coupons for other Colgate products.  </li>
            <li> So basically they cut the active ingredient in half to reduce staining.  </li>
            <li> There seem to be two problems people have that may be due to the product not exactly designed for heavy</li>
            <li> However, after a couple months, I noted greasy stains on my dark or colored clothes.  </li>
            <li> Dark / colored clothes will get discolored.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about 50% less than almost every other antiperspirant on the market!  </li>
            <li> Now, every shirt that I&#x27;ve been wearing this summer has dark, stiff, waxy build up in the arm pits.</li>
            <li> Well, do a little research on aluminum zirconium.</li>
            <li> Well you might as well protect your noggin neurons and use as little as you can with this).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product twice now and a few hours after applying, I start smelling body odor.  </li>
            <li> Speed Stick is one of the few deodorants that do work for me, and the anti-stain formula works.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is actually worse than regular</li>
            <li> After destroying half my husband and sons&#x27; shirts, I am now throwing the Speed Stick Stain Guard products away!  </li>
            <li> The main reason I turned to this product actually turned out to be completely wrong, and it seemed to make my armpit stains worse!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when mixed with our oils/ sweat, this stains shirts.  </li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> Ironing stains can, and usually will, make the stains permanent.</li>
            <li> Usually deodorants ruin my cloths within a year.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to be the least yellowing / staining \\&quot;white\\</li>
            <li> but they are the WORST at creating yellow/gray stains on light clothing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s what I expected to happen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually, I would prefer unscented, but this isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to remove without stain-treating it</li>
            <li> I can see a class action law suit coming with this horrible</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Mennen&#x27;s Speed Stick products have never worked well for me at preventing body odor.  </li>
            <li> That is a silly complaint.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Quick delivery and item was exactly as described in factory sealed carton. This item is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> As someone who has dealt with underarm stain problems for years, I was excited to see someone finally addressing the issue.  Unfortunately, Mennen&#x27;s Speed Stick products have never worked well for me at preventing body odor.  I&#x27;ve tried this product twice now and a few hours after applying, I start smelling body odor.  The product may help prevent underarm stains on my shirts, but if it doesn&#x27;t control body odor, it&#x27;s of no use to me.  I&#x27;m going back to Suave, which has worked well for me for years.  I may get underarm stains on my shirts, but at least I&#x27;ll smell fresh all day!  Sorry, but I can&#x27;t recommend this product from my own personal experience.</li>
            <li> Like others, I was drawn to the new Speed Stick based on the promise that it will stop yellow staining on my t-shirts.  As many well know, virtually all anti-antiperspirants use Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly, which block pores temporarily, thereby preventing sweat.  Unfortunately, when mixed with our oils/ sweat, this stains shirts.  The first thing I noticed when eveluating Stainguard were the ingredients.  The active ingredient is only 10% Alumnium Z.  That&#x27;s about 50% less than almost every other antiperspirant on the market!  So basically they cut the active ingredient in half to reduce staining.  But that&#x27;s also the same ingredient that stops sweat, essentially reducing the effectiveness of the product by 50% as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I found I sweat about 50% more with this product than against other leading anti-antiperspirants.  Therefore I immediately stopped using it, as I don&#x27;t care about it&#x27;s effectiveness against staining if it doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration.  Hope in the future they find the silver bullet, till then it&#x27;s back to dry, but stained shirts.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick is one of the few deodorants that do work for me, and the anti-stain formula works.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> This anti-perspirant makes a coating on the inside of the shirt like a waxy film, making fabric colors get darker in the underarm area.  Very hard to remove without stain-treating it, which is exactly what the person buying the Stain Guard product DIDN&#x27;T want in the first place.  I bought underwear from Hanes and got 9 free samples... After destroying half my husband and sons&#x27; shirts, I am now throwing the Speed Stick Stain Guard products away!  A freebie that destroyed their clothing!  No Thanks!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as non-stainguard version but it&#x27;s still nice</li>
            <li> I have noticed this product is getting harder to find in stores, so I am now looking for it online. I&#x27;m surprised to find so many bad reviews, as I love it. There seem to be two problems people have that may be due to the product not exactly designed for heavy sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Ingredient Strength:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the antiperspirant only has 10% aluminum zirconium. This is one of the few products that has such a low amount. This may not be enough for people that sweat a lot, but what about for those that don&#x27;t? It works just fine for me and the benefit is I&#x27;m exposing myself to a lot less aluminum zirconium than I would be wearing unnecessary stronger antiperspirants. Although the negative health affects of long term exposure to aluminum zirconium are still not proven, I think it&#x27;s better to not take any chances if you don&#x27;t need such a strong antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staining problems:&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if people claiming they still have staining problems are from this product not being strong enough for them to not sweat. However, I have had zero problems with staining, but that wasn&#x27;t even why I bought the product originally. Honestly I could care less if this product causes stains because the lower ingredient strength is what matters most to me. You can buy a new shirt but you can&#x27;t buy a cure for Alzheimer&#x27;s when exposed to too much aluminum over a lifetime, so I will take a product that prevents the latter even if it did cause shirt stains (which it doesn&#x27;t even cause for me).</li>
            <li> Simply put, I like the smell and how it goes on mostly dry. The whole &amp;#34;Stainguard&amp;#34; thing does not matter to me at all.</li>
            <li> Still have the yellow stain after a little while, even using Oxyclean.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Target quit carrying my &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ve ordered it twice from Amazon and been very pleased.  Really does seem to reduce pit stains, has a nice fresh scent and works well as an antiperspirant.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d originally purchase this product for my husband , who loves this deodorant  for his problem with underarm stain issue. He enjoys the scent of Fresh product , more then the Clean version. I&#x27;d used the product on a whim and like it . I purchase his Fresh scent version and ended up with this product. I don&#x27;t have sweating problems , but to those people suffering from extreme issues , no products will work on them and for others certain products will work. This product suits me fine, since in healthcare can&#x27;t wear perfumes ,and love knowing , not offending anyone .</li>
            <li> It is the best deodorant in my opinion, I have used several brands and forms but none works fine for me. Another thing, do not hurt me shirts.</li>
            <li> At first, this product seemed great.  However, after a couple months, I noted greasy stains on my dark or colored clothes.  With dress shirts, this was very obvious.  I had to throw a couple out and several were saved after many long soaks/washes.  It does not produce the dreaded yellow stains on undershirts -- good news, but you trade that for a far worse issue, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more but luckily Amazon caries a bulk pack at a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the Stainguard variety, which is what is getting harder and harder to find.  The Stainguard means that your white undershirt will stay white under the armpits.  It isn&#x27;t perfect, but they take a whole lot longer to turn that grey/white gross color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will prolong the life of your undershirts, while smelling good and blocking sweat - really a no brainer!</li>
            <li> I should have done the laundry sooner because by the time I figured out that this deodorant was causing the dark underarm stains, my husband had ten ruined polo shirts.</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite deoderant.  It&#x27;s not sold in any stores in our area.  Glad I can buy it online.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by my neighbor. I had always had a problem with my antiperspirant staining my shirts after being used for awhile. This one does a great job of both handling the stain and perspiration issue.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> Stops my problem perspiration &amp; odor.  Does not stain like others.  The \\&quot;clean\\&quot; version is not offensive to my wife like other scents.  Wish the unscented version were available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, assuming it would be better for my shirts. Now, every shirt that I&#x27;ve been wearing this summer has dark, stiff, waxy build up in the arm pits. Nothing we have tried so far has gotten it out. I&#x27;ve decided to stop using this product, and I&#x27;m afraid that I will have to throw out most of my short-sleeve shirts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually writing a review about deodorant, I know! I just had to share what I love about this deodorant though. The reason it protects against stains is because it has about half the aluminum zirconium that most deodorants have. It&#x27;s the aluminum that stains your clothes. Why does that make it 5 stars? Well, do a little research on aluminum zirconium. You&#x27;ll quickly see that there are many credible scientific studies linking it to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Since &amp;#34;Alzheimer&#x27;s-proof&amp;#34; deodorant doesn&#x27;t sell too well, Mennen came up with this &amp; marketed it as &amp;#34;Stainguard&amp;#34; hoping savvy consumers (like you &amp; I :) will add 2 &amp; 2. If you use deodorant every day, you don&#x27;t need the 18-22% aluminum zirconium most &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; deodorants have. The alum zirconium is actually the anti-perspirate. The more it has, the better the product deactivates your sweat glands (in theory anyway). In reality, everyone is different. The 10% this product has works just great for me and I work outside most of the day. Some guys break a sweat taking a shower though. Truthfully, more doesn&#x27;t necessarily equal &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; (sweat). We all sweat. The stuff we smear on under there just helps to curb it so we don&#x27;t embarrass ourselves with water on our shirts when we reach for the sky. This product has enough alum zirconium to keep me dry so I&#x27;m stuck on it. If you bead up while lathering up, well, this may not be the deo for you. (But I&#x27;d venture to guess that even the &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; stuff with more than twice the alum zirconium doesn&#x27;t help you either right? Well you might as well protect your noggin neurons and use as little as you can with this). Again, used daily, this stuff is great! It smells great (I prefer the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; scent but it&#x27;s harder to find in stores for some reason), it works as an anti-perspirate/deodorant, and if I happen to be lucky enough to get on up there in age to enjoy my great-grandchildren- and remember their names too- well, that&#x27;s a huge bonusto me!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this for my BF anywhere in CVS or other drugstores. Happy that they are selling it here!!!! Keeps him happy!</li>
            <li> The product worked well as a deodorant but then a while later I realized all my shirts were ruined! Even threw (through?) undershirts the deodorant was able to permanently stain my shirts. Had to throw out a dozen shirts and spend money I didn&#x27;t want to on new clothes. I should have sent Mennen the bill!</li>
            <li> Bought the big pack so i can always have some and not go a day without due to  not having backup. Also great for my big family.</li>
            <li> I used to use regular deodorant, and got a lot of brown stains from the metal powders in them. I was happy with Adidas t-shirt safe deodorant, but I can&#x27;t find it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff leaves big greasy, waxy dark marks in your shirt arm pits. After washing the shirts, you can rub your fingernail on these patches and wax comes off as it would a candle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you Spray and Wash the pit stains, and run the shirts through on extra hot, on a long cycle, it mostly comes out. I don&#x27;t really want to do that with all of my colored shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some photos of me recently, and the dark pit stains are very noticeable. This stuff is actually worse than regular deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for 6 months. No more.</li>
            <li> This product helps reduce yellow stains on white undershirts, and provides all day protection from armpit odor. I would recommend this product to anyone that regular deodorant doesn&#x27;t seem to work for.</li>
            <li> I still get some underarm staining on my T-shirts and outer shirts; but, stains are greatly reduced from my previous brand.</li>
            <li> Not only did this product work for me but also my old pit stained shirts came clean after a few washes, it does leave a darker tint on some shirts but that goes away a lot easier than the crusty yellow stains with a stain removal stick, I was also excited that I&#x27;m not allergic to it as most deodorants causes a rash, big plus! LOL</li>
            <li> This product seems to be the least yellowing / staining \\&quot;white\\&quot; deodorant I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ll use \\&quot;clear\\&quot; or \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; with darks but they are the WORST at creating yellow/gray stains on light clothing. I&#x27;m online now purchasing b/c our local Meijer&#x27;s stopped carrying it!! PS re: odor / wetness: I&#x27;m a sweat-er. yes I will still sweat using this, and by the end of the day I&#x27;d like to change into something \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;bad\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I have a history of staining the armpits of shirts, and this product was exactly what I&#x27;d been looking for.  It&#x27;s name said everything I wanted to hear - that this antiperspirant would help prevent the stains that had plagued all my favorite shirts for years.  The fact that this product has less aluminum in it than many other antiperspirants was also great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the Stainguard antiperspirant has not worked out for me. The main reason I turned to this product actually turned out to be completely wrong, and it seemed to make my armpit stains worse! I am completely disappointed because my hopes were so high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve contacted Mennen (actually, Colgate) to see what they have to say about my experience.  I&#x27;ll update my review if they provide anything worth posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;26 May 2013:  After contacting Colgate and complaining about my experience with the Stainguard, Colgate responded with an explanation of how the product is supposed to work, and a recommendation for a product to remove the armpit stains. Colgate also sent me a check for $4 to cover the cost of that product, as well as a bevy of coupons for other Colgate products.  I have since tried several stain removal products, including the one that Colgate recommended, and none of them worked.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s what I expected to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve had to replace several shirts, I&#x27;ve done some research and I have learned a couple of important things that might help people prevent underarm stains.  First, stain treat the underarm areas of your shirts as soon as you put your shirts in the laundry: use Shout or another product that can be used and allowed to dry before you actually wash your clothes.  Second, don&#x27;t iron your shirts (and especially your underarm areas) until you&#x27;re sure that any stains are gone.  Ironing stains can, and usually will, make the stains permanent.</li>
            <li> Works better than other similar products in fighting against stains on the underarms of t-shirts. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Usually deodorants ruin my cloths within a year.  This product doesn&#x27;t.  I like the scent of &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;.  Actually, I would prefer unscented, but this isn&#x27;t bad.  The local stores quit carrying this product, so I was pleased to find it at Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Local stores are not carrying my fav brand and type: Speed Stick Stainguard so I was very happy to find it online and for a great deal. I bought 6 and won&#x27;t have to worry about restocking for a long time!</li>
            <li> I received this on time and it was package very good. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20</li>
            <li> Dang, the negative reviews were right. Dark / colored clothes will get discolored. So only wear with whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it feels different.  I might be tripping but its actually harder to remove in the shower, feels like a wax layer over my armpits, never noticed with before with regular deoderant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i wouldnt recommend you wear except at the gym while you wear a white tshirt during workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want no stains... absolutely no aluminum.. le sigh</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;StainGuard\\&quot; Speedstick stains every dress shirt that I have worn while using this product.  It is not as noticeable on white shirts, but clearly shows up on any colored shirt.  I can see a class action law suit coming with this horrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: I don&#x27;t even sweat at work, so this is very clearly a product defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from \\&quot;StainGuard\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This really works fighting yellow stains on t-shirts!</li>
            <li> This works well and has a nice scent, but it isn&#x27;t super strong and overpowering like some other scents. I really love this kind and would recommend it to others who want to smell good but not have that horribly overpowering musky smell.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Since switching to this I no longer get stains on my shirts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite some time now, and I am happy to report that I do not have any buildup on my shirts like I have had for decades with the old &amp;#34;Sport Talc&amp;#34; version of Speed Stick. It lasts a long time, and offers good protection as well. I am a heavy sweater, and stinker, without good protection, and I am very happy with this products performance.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite deodorant, until they stopped selling it in the stores. I love this stuff and it really doesn&#x27;t stain your shirt. I got these for an excellent price. Hopefully, they&#x27;ll restock!</li>
            <li> No, it is not yellow proof.  Yes, it will stain shirts if you use too much of it.  BUT it works great and I can no longer find it in any store.</li>
            <li> There is no such thing as stain preventer.... That is a silly complaint.&lt;br /&gt;I like most how it simply smells clean, not perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;And honestly I am more than a little pissed that no one carries it anymore!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that this deodorant caused black stains on my dress shirts. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Speed Stick regular for years and never really had a problem with stains. When Speed Stick Unscented became unavailable, I decided to give Stainguard a try. Big mistake. Every shirt I wore developed stains within 5 wearings. I have workout shirts that I wore for years without a single pit stain that are now ruined because of \\&quot;Stainguard\\&quot;. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this deodorant for many years. As far as commercial deodorants go, I found it quite effective. However, I started making my own homemade deodorant at home with coconut oil, baking soda and arrowroot powder which is far more effective and lacking all of the chemicals that are found in these commercially available deodorants.  If you don&#x27;t mind using the chemicals, this was my favorite, but I do recommend the homemade option for anyone who is concerned about their health.</li>
            <li> I get this for my husband because the scent is very light and barely noticeable (&amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;).  It also seems to work well.  (Some of the other scents of Speedstick are so strong that they actually compete with his cologne.)</li>
