            <li>I find these toothbrushes awesome, the bent handle is a nice touch for better brushing and they do a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Plus they look good--their colors are bright and their style is sleek.</li>
            <li>Peer review was good, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>All around good buy.</li>
            <li>But they feel good on tender gums.</li>
            <li>I found these toothbrushes on Amazon, and the price is really good, because I saw these in a store somewhere</li>
            <li>Good to know I can get them from Amazon</li>
            <li>They hold up well and do a really good job</li>
            <li>That in and of itself is a great reason to purchase these, but there is more.    </li>
            <li>have told people about this toothbrush so many times and have even asked for them for Christmas, they are great and everyone should try them.</li>
            <li>All in all, it is a very good product with benefits beyond clean teeth.</li>
            <li>(btw, why are these more $$ on amazon?!)</li>
            <li>I was pleased that they were made out of recycled material, and even the packaging is a travel container!</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every brand of toothbrush and this one is outstanding!  </li>

            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>The Preserve Toothbrush is fabulous, and causes no pain around the gums!!  </li>
            <li>When I first saw these toothbrushes, I thought, What a great idea!  </li>
            <li>The design, construction and effectiveness of results,&lt;br /&gt;Is outstanding !</li>
            <li>You will love it !</li>
            <li>So this really is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>They come in a handy postage-paid return envelope for recycling.</li>
            <li>It is nice that they don&#x27;t overdo it with the packaging.</li>
            <li>&amp; if if I liked it.  </li>
            <li>These are nice brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel nice, not abrasive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that each toothbrush comes in it&#x27;s own travel</li>
            <li>but I kind of miss the plastic shells to use as toothbrush cases.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I liked the fact that I could recycle it.</li>
            <li>Great at keeping those peril whites nice and clean.</li>
            <li>They give a great clean without hurting your gums.  </li>
            <li>AMZN has the BEST price for this item as it is considerably cheaper than Trader Joes&#x27;, like 6 for the price of 2!</li>
            <li>The best soft brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and my gums are happy after a cleaning :) The handle allows ease when trying to get to those tricky spots</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth or gums, this is the perfect toothbrush for you!  </li>
            <li>These are the best toothbrushes for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>Easy peasy way to help ol Mama Earth!</li>
            <li>I bought these because they said that they were ultra soft and they were a very good price.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I have turn on a bunch of my friends to these fabulous toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>Glad to get the pack of six and save money.</li>
            <li>On top of that he has bridge work &amp; the bristles</li>
            <li>I know the electric brushes are supposed to do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Best of all, when you&#x27;ve worn it out, simply put it in its case and send it off (postage is prepaid!)</li>
            <li>What I love the most is the angle of the handle/bristles (which are ultra-soft).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>How many toothbrushes do that?</li>
            <li>For the person who said there was more \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on their teeth with flossing after brushing with these...</li>
            <li>so, I&#x27;m pleased about that too.</li>
            <li>(yes, I considered it) or spending a lot of money to see if electric might work better</li>
            <li>I also love that these are recyclable.  </li>
            <li>I love the angle of the handle</li>
            <li>Those two features make me ok with the price.  </li>
            <li>They are comfortable to use and come with a handy reusable case.</li>
            <li>My husband loves them too and always makes sure I buy this brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What could be better.</li>
            <li>They provide an envelope for used brushes and then send you more.</li>
            <li>and I feel better about</li>
            <li>Hubby rarely brushes or flosses and dentists exclaim over his pristine mouth, with nary a cavity or exposed root.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are good for my sort.</li>
            <li>I love that these Preserve toothbrushes can reach every area of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Life is too short not to use the best toothbrush available!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>These tooth brushes are extremely easy on the gums, but still provide a good clean.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t cost more than regular toothbrushes but are made from 100% recycled plastic; awesome!</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I love that they&#x27;re made from recycled materials and are themselves fully recyclable.</li>
            <li>I like them better than any you find in the stores.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that they can be recycled.</li>
            <li>Recycled plastic, teaming up with another Enviro-friendly company (Stoneybrook, to recycle their yogurt containers) and the best thing is that they provide packaging to send back the toothbrushes to be recycled when you are done!  </li>
            <li>I now use the Kids version for my kids and they love them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2 1/16/2011:</li>
            <li>The angle takes some getting used to, but I realized that I was brushing more thoroughly because of this difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they all love it too.</li>
            <li>but I love them.  </li>
            <li>I use to be able to find in the store, but now I order on line as can&#x27;t find in store.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to recycle.</li>
            <li>The curve handle actually is OK.</li>
            <li>and I love the angle of the handle.  </li>
            <li>that was called Sensodyne, I think, and they were much better.</li>
            <li>Not one of my favorite Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>I plan to make more purchases.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>And they are environmentally friendly to boot!</li>
            <li>....AND they&#x27;re environmentally friendly!</li>
            <li>Many towns &amp; cities won&#x27;t recycle #5 plastics, so the fact that this brush is made from #5 and can be recycled again is phenomenally cool!</li>
            <li>I love that Preserve takes into account the life cycle of its products while making it easy on the customer.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it is good build quality</li>
            <li>Great for the environment and the nylon bristles are ultra soft!</li>
            <li>They are great for people like me with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I also use a sanatizer light for my toothbrushes and most toothbrushes do not work in them because they have the rubber grips on the handle.</li>
            <li>I loved them so much I bought my husband</li>
            <li>For some reason, the size/shape/curve of the handle make it so easy to get the hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are great because they are soft and cheap.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to reach every tooth easily.</li>
            <li>So many toothbrushes that are \\&quot;soft\\&quot; start that way, but the bristles quickly harden with use.  </li>
            <li>I prefer very soft bristles and the ultra soft is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>The fact that they&#x27;re recycled is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>so I thought these would fit the bill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BPA free and</li>
            <li>I finally ordered these and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>If you are a USA product buff like me :) these are made right here in the states.</li>
            <li>It is true that the angle is better for cleaning and the brushes are nice n soft.</li>
            <li>The ultra softness that does not harm my gums, the very economical price, and the recyclability are all worth while attributes!</li>
            <li>They are ultra soft, comfortable, recycled and recycle-able and they come in these great travel ready cases.    </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really excited about these.  </li>
            <li>I originally found this brand of toothbrushes when I started looking for eco-friendly ones that were made in USA.  </li>
            <li>In summary:  Pros:   1) Echo friendly product.  </li>
            <li>I did not like the handle shape at first but now love it-being made of recycled materials is also a plus-</li>
            <li>I would raise my original critique to 4 stars now.</li>
            <li>We also like that they are environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>Add quality construction and environmentally friendly plastics</li>
            <li>I bought these because they&#x27;re made from recycled plastic &amp; I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more for an environmentally friendly product.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and the size is just perfect for those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>He says his teeth are not getting clean either.  </li>
            <li>ultra-soft bristles are no exaggeration, yet they clean</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll poke your eye out instead of clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Also, the bristles didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel clean, so I had to brush them twice, owing for a rediculous amount of time in the bathroom just brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise the toothbrush is great, and the extra $$$ -- quite a markup, even by save-the-earth standards -- is worth it to expand the market for recycled plastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and these really are the best.</li>
            <li>I need soft toothbrushes anyway, and I found these to be very soft, comfortable on my teeth and to hold the brush, and the bristles have held up great over 3months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anything small we can do to treat the planet better is a great idea</li>
            <li>I really took a chance, ordering a brand I&#x27;ve never tried, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>the bristles are nice and soft, yet efficient.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is not quite as good as the ones I get at the dentist office, but those must only be for dentist to buy.</li>
            <li>They are truly ultra soft, yet effective and get the job done.</li>
            <li>we ran out, I used another brand that I had and really noticed the difference on how much better</li>
            <li>He recommended this very toothbrush which I love.</li>
            <li>We love the brush and find we brush longer as the bristles are so gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>I purchased them for travel alone, and quickly converted to using them at home as well.</li>
            <li>The super soft bristles are gentle on gums, while still giving a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>You have to replace them every two weeks or so, depending on use, as they tarnish quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Pop it in a Postage Paid Mailer available at Trader Joe&#x27;s and many coops and natural food</li>
            <li>Wears out quickly</li>
            <li>chose this product because I liked how it&#x27;s environmentally sound by being made 100% of recycled yogurt cups and the entire toothbrush and plastic container</li>
            <li>Since it is recommended to throw away toothbrushes and use a new one every 4-6 months (because of germs and bristles start to fray), you can feel better about wasting toothbrushes since these can just be recycled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But kind of cool that you can actually have your toothbrush recycled.</li>
            <li>These are basic toothbrushes, not the latest technology, yet they have significantly higher prices than the better polyester-bristle toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>They are so nice &amp; soft for sensitive teeth &amp; gums, and easy to brush with.</li>
            <li>Its a great product and its made in the USA (finally something thats not made in China) as far as the enviroment goes</li>
            <li>My gums are in much better shape because of this, and I have never had a problem with my teeth feeling unclean because it is so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many so-called ultra soft toothbrushes in my 58 years of life, and in my opinion The Preserve toothbrush stands alone.</li>
            <li>I love the soft bristles on these brushes.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it though it feels nice in your hand, and the angle helps get into the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the colors are pretty too!</li>
            <li>My teeth actually stay clean longer when i use this toothbrush and my favorite</li>
            <li>The curve of the handle is ergonomic, the bristles are comfortable but effective, and the fact that it is made from recycled materials (and that they encourage users to send old products back for further recycling) is even better!  </li>
            <li>The bristles fall apart in my mouth within the first uses, sometimes the very first use.</li>
            <li>but they rubbed right off.</li>
            <li>These are just right</li>
            <li>I had been looking for these in stores for a year, perfect for sensitive teeth or small mouths.</li>
            <li>It makes it easier to reach everything in my mouth when brushing and seems to make it less likely I&#x27;ll bash myself in my gums (which isn&#x27;t very good for them!).  </li>
            <li>I needed a new toothbrush, and saw the fantastic $2 price, and the eye-catching design, and was hooked.</li>
            <li>I love that these are made from recycled plastic and can go right back in my recycle bin when I&#x27;m done with them.</li>
            <li>Not only, [do I think that] they are more comfortable than most other toothbrushes, they&#x27;re also recycled and recyclable.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are great quality and ultrasoft for the person who has a tendancy to brush too hard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that a lot of tooth brushes leave gunk on my teeth, but this left a wee more.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I first found this brush about two years ago(?) and fell in love with them, then I haven&#x27;t been able to find them the past year at all, so I&#x27;ve been using the toothbrush that my dentist gives me at each cleaning.</li>
            <li>really, really like these!  </li>
            <li>I had to throw away the Preserve toothbrush after the first use: it just does not do the job a toothbrush should.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Many of them, multiple times over.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrushes that doesn&#x27;t cause my gum to bleed every time I brush my teeth like a lot of the common toothbrushes do.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, I found an unlimited supply on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>The Ultra Soft is a bit softer than I remembered, but I&#x27;ve gotten used it and can ince again brush comfortably.</li>
            <li>He used it at home, liked it, thought it would work fine, but agreed ultra soft was softer than extra soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and easy on the teeth and the curve of the brush makes it easy to reach the way back of the mouth!</li>
            <li>Great toothbrushes if you have receding gums, especially if you tend to brush harder than you should.</li>
            <li>They work better than any regular toothbrush with their rounded handle to get to back teeth easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a super soft toothbrush that&#x27;s not abrasive on my gums and this is it!  </li>
            <li>However, make sure you buy the Preserve Ultrasoft toothbrush as the Preserve Soft toothbrush is surprisingly much harsher on sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>I think my title pretty much sums</li>
            <li>this soft brush has made brushing so much better that regular bleeding gum is rarely bleeding gum.</li>
            <li>have tried other ultra soft brushes but none as good as these.</li>
            <li>how soft and gentle it is, yet you still feel like you&#x27;re getting everything clean.</li>
            <li>makes for easy reach back teeth.</li>
            <li>but the angle of the handle makes it easy to get all the way back to them (</li>
            <li>Not lasting as long as I had hoped but they are extra soft which I need and they are beautifully made with rounded tips on the bristles and comfortable house.</li>
            <li>is unfortunately becoming more common in the brands we all know so well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certain it boosted their sales.</li>
            <li>Now how smart do I feel?  </li>
            <li>Luckily, both extra soft toothbrush brands are available on Subscribe and Save, so I will be switching my subscription.</li>
            <li>But other brands last remarkably longer.  </li>
            <li>I find it hard to get good soft-bristled toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I compared it to a normal straight brush (while looking in the mirror) and sure enough you bend your wrist a lot more with conventional straight handled brushes.</li>
            <li>gave them the stars that I did because they are environmentally responsible &amp; that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>The angle of the neck makes it much much easier to brush the way my periodontist has told me to.</li>
            <li>Simple and comfortable to hold -</li>
            <li>But the bristles really are extra-soft and don&#x27;t \\&quot;harden with time\\&quot;, as some others have mentioned happen with some brands.</li>
            <li>My dentist has noticed my gums are much healthier.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(that Safeway brand one has fallen apart, while this one has held up very well).  </li>
            <li>They seem to be very well made also.</li>
            <li>I get these for my whole family.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness I am able to carry over my love of recycling and reducing waste to the very last thing I do each day!  </li>
            <li>Preserve is not a poor toothbrush, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>These have an unusual curved shape that works well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle cleaning.  </li>
            <li>and this is a real winner.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re ready to retire.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL .GOOD</li>
            <li>Since buying a Preserve toothbrush at Whole Foods I have been raving about it to anyone who will listen.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve got a real winner.  </li>
            <li>simply because many of the ultra soft toothbrushes are pretty expensive--with these I would use them and feel no guilt throwing them out and grabbing a new one when I needed to (about every 2-3 months, as recommended).</li>
            <li>The Mail Back Pack is available at Whole Foods, Target and increasingly in many other locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Substantial enough to clean (I use Peroxicare with them) but gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li>When I floss there is way more food matter than when I used other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>whole family has commented on how much they like the new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still repetitive, but what this toothbrush does to make it so nice is</li>
            <li>First use not that soft.  </li>
            <li>Ultra soft toothbrushes are very hard to find and these have worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>As a toothbrush, preserve is fine, not great but not horrible.  </li>
            <li>The exact description was  &amp;#34;Packaging is reusable travel case with ventilation holes&amp;#34; However the packaging was a flexible piece of plastic with directions to open the top then send back your old toothbrush as part of the gimme 5 program.</li>
            <li>I try to support organic, local, &amp; environmental products in as many purchases as possible</li>
            <li>Although this is truly soft, and feels like it&#x27;s doing a great job cleaning your teeth, it does leave a lot behind.</li>
            <li>Sure the handle takes getting used to, but it&#x27;s a green product and goes very well</li>
            <li>One thing I particularly like about this brand is the tilted toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for tree huggers and cynics alike.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft enough not to do damage even with vigorous brushing, yet they get our teeth clean.</li>
            <li>liked the product because it is well made, the bristles are perfectly extra soft, and I like the unique design where the upper part of the handle is positioned opposite of regular brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like these ultra soft toothbrushes,  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles but curved handles which I didn&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li>besides being really soft, and the angle making it easier to reach those pesky teeth, the angle on this brush I noticed keeps your wrist straight</li>
            <li>I love that these toothbrushes are recycled yogurt cups and that they&#x27;re recyclable after I&#x27;ve used them for a few months.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the only super soft brushes I can find.</li>
            <li>The arch of the toothbrush also makes brushing easy, especially in the way back.  </li>
            <li>right in the middle of the toothbrush head?????  </li>
            <li>Funny how such a little change of angle can make brushing so much more</li>
            <li>The envelopes are available next to the toothbrushes at local retailers that sell this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I only purchase this product from Amazon when it is sold by Amazon at a price lower than my local retailers and with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in need of a gum graft, so my gums are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive teeth then this for you...</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are very soft.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush if you have sensitive gums or teeth.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY SOFT, CLEANS MY TEETH</li>
            <li>Rather than run around trying to find the right, extra soft, compact head toothbrush, I decided to find what I prefer on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Who knew that putting a little bend into a toothbrush would make it so much easier to clean all surfaces of your teeth?</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is just the right size for my mouth, and the bristles are just right for me because I was previously using a toothbrush that advertised a whitening feature that made my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This tooth brush didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my sensitive gums at all!    </li>
            <li>I noticed more than usual on my floss.    </li>
            <li>I love these, am paranoid that the next time I&#x27;m due to reorder them, Amazon won&#x27;t carry them again,,,,,,,PLUS</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Ultra soft toothbrushes are the bomb!  </li>
            <li>I finally found one (and the last one at that) a few months ago and it reconfirmed everything that I loved about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color assortment in the bundle from Amazon was good for me and my husband - blue, white, green, purple.</li>
            <li>After thouching the soft bristles of my new Preserve Toothbrush, I threw out my old&lt;br /&gt;tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I love these because I brush hard</li>
            <li>If you like extra soft bristles, you&#x27;ve hit the jackpot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying the brushes, I noticed my Whole Foods has a \\&quot;Gimme 5\\&quot; recycling bin where you can drop off your #5 plastics for recycling.</li>
            <li>The Extra Soft are so gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li>You can conveniently recycle your old Preserve toothbrushes in the \\&quot;Gimme 5\\&quot; bins at your local Whole Foods!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am old.</li>
            <li>You know your gums don&#x27;t get beaten, but still get strengthened by the action of brushing.</li>
            <li>I dont think there is anything that is as completely enviromently friend as this product.</li>
            <li>a truly ultra soft toothbrush, will buy again</li>
            <li>I decided to get the ultra soft brushes because the dental hygienist said to use the softest I can get.  </li>
            <li>This is a TRULY soft brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, with a compact head.  </li>
            <li>use the Ultra Soft because it is just that, Ultra Soft.</li>
            <li>Even the \\&quot;extra-soft\\&quot; toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used before hurt my sensitive gums</li>
            <li>like the soft and ultra soft the best---easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>They are not ultra soft.</li>
            <li>I suffer from toothbrush abrasion (brush too hard/fast, &amp; over the years my tooth enamel has worn away to expose sensitive roots).</li>
            <li>They have wonderfully soft...</li>
            <li>I like how they feel in my hand, and I like that the bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for bulk toothbrushes on Amazon.com and found the Preserve Toothbrushes, Ultra Soft Bristles.  </li>
            <li>They are soft on gums.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ULTRA soft.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old also uses these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Unlike \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought in my supermarket or pharmacy and then had to discard, these actually are gentle on gums.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are indeed uber soft.</li>
            <li>I wanted just a normally soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought an Ultra Soft Preserve toothbrush years ago at Walmart and it WAS Ultra Soft.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any one looking for a soft toothbrush</li>
            <li>Soft..perfect for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I always looked for these in the grocery store but never found ultra soft.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and I had no gum bleeding since I started using them.</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>These bristles stay soft and they don&#x27;t scratch up my gums.  </li>
            <li>I will switch to the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soft bristle and see whether the problem is restricted to the ultra-soft design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushing head size seems to be in between the child and adult sizes.  </li>
            <li>After using these for a couple of years I used one, supposedly soft, from my dentist.</li>
            <li>I touched the bristles of my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>These are actually soft, as soft as the ones I get from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>It is difficult to find an ultra-soft toothbrush for adults, so I was delighted to discover this one.  </li>
            <li>However, since they are echo-friendly, i will try the medium strength bristles, and if they do not work, I will be forced back to the Oral-B kind.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a little odd at first, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li>Not only can you send these back for more recycling in a mailer provided, these are long lasting toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Preserve Toothbrushes (Ultra Soft is my personal preference).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if anyone is looking for an extra soft bristle.</li>
            <li>The Preserve bristles are soft, the handle is smooth and I like the angle, but the bristles began bending within two weeks, so the supply I bought to last 6 months lasted half that.</li>
            <li>But these are more like medium-soft bristles and not good for my sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>know why this is such a challange to find a normal soft bristle</li>
            <li>Handling this toothbrush is a little odd at first because of its shape but its easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality high enough that I&#x27;ve started using as my travel brush.  </li>
            <li>And my dentist has always given me new extra soft when I come in for a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I use sensitive toothpaste/mouth rinse products and this works well as to comfort and general use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been using the only other extra soft bristle brush out there, when I visited Amazon to find them online, because they are not always available in stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weird that it&#x27;s not easier to find more ultra-soft brushes, they are much better for health than stiff bristles.</li>
            <li>I wish this brush came in \\&quot;extra soft, soft, medium &amp; firm\\&quot; bristles.</li>
            <li>gums are receding a tiny bit &amp; some of my teeth have become very sensitive because of this.  </li>
            <li>First, let me say that I have extremely sensitive teeth, I brush slowly, about 4 to 5 minutes, using  the \\&quot;wiggle\\&quot; technique my dentist advised: hold the brush gently between the thumb and pointer fingers, like a pencil, no pressure, and wiggle the bristles in a downward motion.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, the soft nylon bristles are new -- only the handle (90% of the total material used) is recycled.</li>
            <li>The long and steady curve on the brush help enhance the brushing experience.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes really are ultra soft and work well, but they also are not true adult sized.  </li>
            <li>The Preserve brush does the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>It is only $15 &amp; you can get ultra soft heads.  </li>
            <li>Softer than my \\&quot;Extra Soft Colgate 360\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li>These bristles are extra soft - the softest I have found on the market.  </li>
            <li>The bristles seem softer than a regular soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My dentist didn&#x27;t have EXTRA soft.  </li>
            <li>EXTRA soft bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can not find extra soft in stores.</li>
            <li>Yet despite their robustness, the bristles are soft enough for tender gums.  </li>
            <li>dentist is very big on ultra soft bristles to preserve gum health and these bristles are quite</li>
            <li>Our dentist recommends extra soft brushes and gives us one after every checkup.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are actually ultra soft too.</li>
            <li>I could never find one with soft enough bristles in the stores.  </li>
            <li>You need to compensate for this angle to bring the head to your teeth by uncomfortably bending your wrist more so than you would a normal brush.</li>
            <li>I typically use an Oral B brush first thing in the morning, but I brush again after eating and use this brush for</li>
            <li>The bristle is indeed soft, but there is too little of it for a normal adult mouth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find those ones online anywhere, so I tried these Preserve ones, and they are ok, but they go bad quite quickly -- they just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>The only way it is reusable is to send back your old toothbrush for recycling.</li>
            <li>However, drugstores and the big box stores never seem to have extra soft in any brand.  </li>
            <li>They are simple, do the intended job well, come in a variety of colors &amp; the curved handle allows me to clean hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li>Also, their swooped handle and smallish brush head make it easier to clean the hard to reach back parts of your mouth.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B extra soft was sold out at Target and the only other adult extra soft toothbrush was the Preserve.    </li>
            <li>Oh, well, you can find the ultra soft toothbrushes sometimes, but they either have a child size toothbrush head, or they have some strange circular plastic thingy</li>
            <li>I love these-I really like a tooth brush that has extra soft bristles which are almost impossible to find in local stores-</li>
            <li>Dentist told me and my significant other that I needed to use a extra/ultra soft toothbrush and to stop brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why, but the ultra soft toothbrushes are extremely hard to find in ANY store.  </li>

            <li> They hold up well and do a really good job</li>
            <li> That in and of itself is a great reason to purchase these, but there is more.    </li>
            <li> have told people about this toothbrush so many times and have even asked for them for Christmas, they are great and everyone should try them.</li>
            <li> All in all, it is a very good product with benefits beyond clean teeth.</li>
            <li> (btw, why are these more $$ on amazon?!)</li>
            <li> I was pleased that they were made out of recycled material, and even the packaging is a travel container!</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every brand of toothbrush and this one is outstanding!  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t tear my gums apart and glad it&#x27;s recycled!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> The Preserve Toothbrush is fabulous, and causes no pain around the gums!!  </li>
            <li> When I first saw these toothbrushes, I thought, What a great idea!  </li>
            <li> The design, construction and effectiveness of results,&lt;br /&gt;Is outstanding !</li>
            <li> You will love it !</li>
            <li> So this really is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> They come in a handy postage-paid return envelope for recycling.</li>
            <li> It is nice that they don&#x27;t overdo it with the packaging.</li>
            <li> &amp; if if I liked it.  </li>
            <li> These are nice brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel nice, not abrasive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that each toothbrush comes in it&#x27;s own travel</li>
            <li> but I kind of miss the plastic shells to use as toothbrush cases.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I liked the fact that I could recycle it.</li>
            <li> Great at keeping those peril whites nice and clean.</li>
            <li> They give a great clean without hurting your gums.  </li>
            <li> AMZN has the BEST price for this item as it is considerably cheaper than Trader Joes&#x27;, like 6 for the price of 2!</li>
            <li> The best soft brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and my gums are happy after a cleaning :) The handle allows ease when trying to get to those tricky spots</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth or gums, this is the perfect toothbrush for you!  </li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> Easy peasy way to help ol Mama Earth!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they said that they were ultra soft and they were a very good price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I have turn on a bunch of my friends to these fabulous toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Glad to get the pack of six and save money.</li>
            <li> On top of that he has bridge work &amp; the bristles</li>
            <li> I know the electric brushes are supposed to do a better job.  </li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Best of all, when you&#x27;ve worn it out, simply put it in its case and send it off (postage is prepaid!)</li>
            <li> What I love the most is the angle of the handle/bristles (which are ultra-soft).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> How many toothbrushes do that?</li>
            <li> For the person who said there was more \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on their teeth with flossing after brushing with these...</li>
            <li> so, I&#x27;m pleased about that too.</li>
            <li> (yes, I considered it) or spending a lot of money to see if electric might work better</li>
            <li> I also love that these are recyclable.  </li>
            <li> I love the angle of the handle</li>
            <li> Those two features make me ok with the price.  </li>
            <li> They are comfortable to use and come with a handy reusable case.</li>
            <li> My husband loves them too and always makes sure I buy this brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What could be better.</li>
            <li> They provide an envelope for used brushes and then send you more.</li>
            <li> and I feel better about</li>
            <li> Hubby rarely brushes or flosses and dentists exclaim over his pristine mouth, with nary a cavity or exposed root.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are good for my sort.</li>
            <li> I love that these Preserve toothbrushes can reach every area of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Life is too short not to use the best toothbrush available!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes are extremely easy on the gums, but still provide a good clean.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t cost more than regular toothbrushes but are made from 100% recycled plastic; awesome!</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I love that they&#x27;re made from recycled materials and are themselves fully recyclable.</li>
            <li> I like them better than any you find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that they can be recycled.</li>
            <li> Recycled plastic, teaming up with another Enviro-friendly company (Stoneybrook, to recycle their yogurt containers) and the best thing is that they provide packaging to send back the toothbrushes to be recycled when you are done!  </li>
            <li> I now use the Kids version for my kids and they love them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2 1/16/2011:</li>
            <li> The angle takes some getting used to, but I realized that I was brushing more thoroughly because of this difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> but I love them.  </li>
            <li> I use to be able to find in the store, but now I order on line as can&#x27;t find in store.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to recycle.</li>
            <li> The curve handle actually is OK.</li>
            <li> and I love the angle of the handle.  </li>
            <li> that was called Sensodyne, I think, and they were much better.</li>
            <li> Not one of my favorite Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> I plan to make more purchases.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> And they are environmentally friendly to boot!</li>
            <li> ....AND they&#x27;re environmentally friendly!</li>
            <li> Many towns &amp; cities won&#x27;t recycle #5 plastics, so the fact that this brush is made from #5 and can be recycled again is phenomenally cool!</li>
            <li> I love that Preserve takes into account the life cycle of its products while making it easy on the customer.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it is good build quality</li>
            <li> Great for the environment and the nylon bristles are ultra soft!</li>
            <li> They are great for people like me with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I also use a sanatizer light for my toothbrushes and most toothbrushes do not work in them because they have the rubber grips on the handle.</li>
            <li> I loved them so much I bought my husband</li>
            <li> For some reason, the size/shape/curve of the handle make it so easy to get the hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great because they are soft and cheap.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to reach every tooth easily.</li>
            <li> So many toothbrushes that are \\&quot;soft\\&quot; start that way, but the bristles quickly harden with use.  </li>
            <li> I prefer very soft bristles and the ultra soft is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> The fact that they&#x27;re recycled is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> so I thought these would fit the bill.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BPA free and</li>
            <li> I finally ordered these and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> If you are a USA product buff like me :) these are made right here in the states.</li>
            <li> It is true that the angle is better for cleaning and the brushes are nice n soft.</li>
            <li> The ultra softness that does not harm my gums, the very economical price, and the recyclability are all worth while attributes!</li>
            <li> They are ultra soft, comfortable, recycled and recycle-able and they come in these great travel ready cases.    </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m really excited about these.  </li>
            <li> I originally found this brand of toothbrushes when I started looking for eco-friendly ones that were made in USA.  </li>
            <li> In summary:  Pros:   1) Echo friendly product.  </li>
            <li> I did not like the handle shape at first but now love it-being made of recycled materials is also a plus-</li>
            <li> I would raise my original critique to 4 stars now.</li>
            <li> We also like that they are environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Add quality construction and environmentally friendly plastics</li>
            <li> I bought these because they&#x27;re made from recycled plastic &amp; I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more for an environmentally friendly product.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and the size is just perfect for those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> He says his teeth are not getting clean either.  </li>
            <li> ultra-soft bristles are no exaggeration, yet they clean</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll poke your eye out instead of clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, the bristles didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel clean, so I had to brush them twice, owing for a rediculous amount of time in the bathroom just brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise the toothbrush is great, and the extra $$$ -- quite a markup, even by save-the-earth standards -- is worth it to expand the market for recycled plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and these really are the best.</li>
            <li> I need soft toothbrushes anyway, and I found these to be very soft, comfortable on my teeth and to hold the brush, and the bristles have held up great over 3months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anything small we can do to treat the planet better is a great idea</li>
            <li> I really took a chance, ordering a brand I&#x27;ve never tried, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> the bristles are nice and soft, yet efficient.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is not quite as good as the ones I get at the dentist office, but those must only be for dentist to buy.</li>
            <li> They are truly ultra soft, yet effective and get the job done.</li>
            <li> we ran out, I used another brand that I had and really noticed the difference on how much better</li>
            <li> He recommended this very toothbrush which I love.</li>
            <li> We love the brush and find we brush longer as the bristles are so gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> I purchased them for travel alone, and quickly converted to using them at home as well.</li>
            <li> The super soft bristles are gentle on gums, while still giving a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> You have to replace them every two weeks or so, depending on use, as they tarnish quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Pop it in a Postage Paid Mailer available at Trader Joe&#x27;s and many coops and natural food</li>
            <li> Wears out quickly</li>
            <li> chose this product because I liked how it&#x27;s environmentally sound by being made 100% of recycled yogurt cups and the entire toothbrush and plastic container</li>
            <li> Since it is recommended to throw away toothbrushes and use a new one every 4-6 months (because of germs and bristles start to fray), you can feel better about wasting toothbrushes since these can just be recycled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But kind of cool that you can actually have your toothbrush recycled.</li>
            <li> These are basic toothbrushes, not the latest technology, yet they have significantly higher prices than the better polyester-bristle toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> They are so nice &amp; soft for sensitive teeth &amp; gums, and easy to brush with.</li>
            <li> Its a great product and its made in the USA (finally something thats not made in China) as far as the enviroment goes</li>
            <li> My gums are in much better shape because of this, and I have never had a problem with my teeth feeling unclean because it is so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many so-called ultra soft toothbrushes in my 58 years of life, and in my opinion The Preserve toothbrush stands alone.</li>
            <li> I love the soft bristles on these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it though it feels nice in your hand, and the angle helps get into the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the colors are pretty too!</li>
            <li> My teeth actually stay clean longer when i use this toothbrush and my favorite</li>
            <li> The curve of the handle is ergonomic, the bristles are comfortable but effective, and the fact that it is made from recycled materials (and that they encourage users to send old products back for further recycling) is even better!  </li>
            <li> The bristles fall apart in my mouth within the first uses, sometimes the very first use.</li>
            <li> but they rubbed right off.</li>
            <li> These are just right</li>
            <li> I had been looking for these in stores for a year, perfect for sensitive teeth or small mouths.</li>
            <li> It makes it easier to reach everything in my mouth when brushing and seems to make it less likely I&#x27;ll bash myself in my gums (which isn&#x27;t very good for them!).  </li>
            <li> I needed a new toothbrush, and saw the fantastic $2 price, and the eye-catching design, and was hooked.</li>
            <li> I love that these are made from recycled plastic and can go right back in my recycle bin when I&#x27;m done with them.</li>
            <li> Not only, [do I think that] they are more comfortable than most other toothbrushes, they&#x27;re also recycled and recyclable.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great quality and ultrasoft for the person who has a tendancy to brush too hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a lot of tooth brushes leave gunk on my teeth, but this left a wee more.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I first found this brush about two years ago(?) and fell in love with them, then I haven&#x27;t been able to find them the past year at all, so I&#x27;ve been using the toothbrush that my dentist gives me at each cleaning.</li>
            <li> really, really like these!  </li>
            <li> I had to throw away the Preserve toothbrush after the first use: it just does not do the job a toothbrush should.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Many of them, multiple times over.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes that doesn&#x27;t cause my gum to bleed every time I brush my teeth like a lot of the common toothbrushes do.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, I found an unlimited supply on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> The Ultra Soft is a bit softer than I remembered, but I&#x27;ve gotten used it and can ince again brush comfortably.</li>
            <li> He used it at home, liked it, thought it would work fine, but agreed ultra soft was softer than extra soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and easy on the teeth and the curve of the brush makes it easy to reach the way back of the mouth!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes if you have receding gums, especially if you tend to brush harder than you should.</li>
            <li> They work better than any regular toothbrush with their rounded handle to get to back teeth easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a super soft toothbrush that&#x27;s not abrasive on my gums and this is it!  </li>
            <li> However, make sure you buy the Preserve Ultrasoft toothbrush as the Preserve Soft toothbrush is surprisingly much harsher on sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> I think my title pretty much sums</li>
            <li> this soft brush has made brushing so much better that regular bleeding gum is rarely bleeding gum.</li>
            <li> have tried other ultra soft brushes but none as good as these.</li>
            <li> how soft and gentle it is, yet you still feel like you&#x27;re getting everything clean.</li>
            <li> makes for easy reach back teeth.</li>
            <li> but the angle of the handle makes it easy to get all the way back to them (</li>
            <li> Not lasting as long as I had hoped but they are extra soft which I need and they are beautifully made with rounded tips on the bristles and comfortable house.</li>
            <li> is unfortunately becoming more common in the brands we all know so well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m certain it boosted their sales.</li>
            <li> Now how smart do I feel?  </li>
            <li> Luckily, both extra soft toothbrush brands are available on Subscribe and Save, so I will be switching my subscription.</li>
            <li> But other brands last remarkably longer.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to get good soft-bristled toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I compared it to a normal straight brush (while looking in the mirror) and sure enough you bend your wrist a lot more with conventional straight handled brushes.</li>
            <li> gave them the stars that I did because they are environmentally responsible &amp; that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> The angle of the neck makes it much much easier to brush the way my periodontist has told me to.</li>
            <li> Simple and comfortable to hold -</li>
            <li> But the bristles really are extra-soft and don&#x27;t \\&quot;harden with time\\&quot;, as some others have mentioned happen with some brands.</li>
            <li> My dentist has noticed my gums are much healthier.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (that Safeway brand one has fallen apart, while this one has held up very well).  </li>
            <li> They seem to be very well made also.</li>
            <li> I get these for my whole family.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I am able to carry over my love of recycling and reducing waste to the very last thing I do each day!  </li>
            <li> Preserve is not a poor toothbrush, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> These have an unusual curved shape that works well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle cleaning.  </li>
            <li> and this is a real winner.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re ready to retire.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL .GOOD</li>
            <li> Since buying a Preserve toothbrush at Whole Foods I have been raving about it to anyone who will listen.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve got a real winner.  </li>
            <li> simply because many of the ultra soft toothbrushes are pretty expensive--with these I would use them and feel no guilt throwing them out and grabbing a new one when I needed to (about every 2-3 months, as recommended).</li>
            <li> The Mail Back Pack is available at Whole Foods, Target and increasingly in many other locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Substantial enough to clean (I use Peroxicare with them) but gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li> When I floss there is way more food matter than when I used other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> whole family has commented on how much they like the new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still repetitive, but what this toothbrush does to make it so nice is</li>
            <li> First use not that soft.  </li>
            <li> Ultra soft toothbrushes are very hard to find and these have worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> As a toothbrush, preserve is fine, not great but not horrible.  </li>
            <li> The exact description was  &amp;#34;Packaging is reusable travel case with ventilation holes&amp;#34; However the packaging was a flexible piece of plastic with directions to open the top then send back your old toothbrush as part of the gimme 5 program.</li>
            <li> I try to support organic, local, &amp; environmental products in as many purchases as possible</li>
            <li> Although this is truly soft, and feels like it&#x27;s doing a great job cleaning your teeth, it does leave a lot behind.</li>
            <li> Sure the handle takes getting used to, but it&#x27;s a green product and goes very well</li>
            <li> One thing I particularly like about this brand is the tilted toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for tree huggers and cynics alike.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft enough not to do damage even with vigorous brushing, yet they get our teeth clean.</li>
            <li> liked the product because it is well made, the bristles are perfectly extra soft, and I like the unique design where the upper part of the handle is positioned opposite of regular brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like these ultra soft toothbrushes,  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles but curved handles which I didn&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li> besides being really soft, and the angle making it easier to reach those pesky teeth, the angle on this brush I noticed keeps your wrist straight</li>
            <li> I love that these toothbrushes are recycled yogurt cups and that they&#x27;re recyclable after I&#x27;ve used them for a few months.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the only super soft brushes I can find.</li>
            <li> The arch of the toothbrush also makes brushing easy, especially in the way back.  </li>
            <li> right in the middle of the toothbrush head?????  </li>
            <li> Funny how such a little change of angle can make brushing so much more</li>
            <li> The envelopes are available next to the toothbrushes at local retailers that sell this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I only purchase this product from Amazon when it is sold by Amazon at a price lower than my local retailers and with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in need of a gum graft, so my gums are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive teeth then this for you...</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are very soft.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush if you have sensitive gums or teeth.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY SOFT, CLEANS MY TEETH</li>
            <li> Rather than run around trying to find the right, extra soft, compact head toothbrush, I decided to find what I prefer on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Who knew that putting a little bend into a toothbrush would make it so much easier to clean all surfaces of your teeth?</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is just the right size for my mouth, and the bristles are just right for me because I was previously using a toothbrush that advertised a whitening feature that made my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my sensitive gums at all!    </li>
            <li> I noticed more than usual on my floss.    </li>
            <li> I love these, am paranoid that the next time I&#x27;m due to reorder them, Amazon won&#x27;t carry them again,,,,,,,PLUS</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Ultra soft toothbrushes are the bomb!  </li>
            <li> I finally found one (and the last one at that) a few months ago and it reconfirmed everything that I loved about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Color assortment in the bundle from Amazon was good for me and my husband - blue, white, green, purple.</li>
            <li> After thouching the soft bristles of my new Preserve Toothbrush, I threw out my old&lt;br /&gt;tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I love these because I brush hard</li>
            <li> If you like extra soft bristles, you&#x27;ve hit the jackpot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying the brushes, I noticed my Whole Foods has a \\&quot;Gimme 5\\&quot; recycling bin where you can drop off your #5 plastics for recycling.</li>
            <li> The Extra Soft are so gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li> You can conveniently recycle your old Preserve toothbrushes in the \\&quot;Gimme 5\\&quot; bins at your local Whole Foods!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am old.</li>
            <li> You know your gums don&#x27;t get beaten, but still get strengthened by the action of brushing.</li>
            <li> I dont think there is anything that is as completely enviromently friend as this product.</li>
            <li> a truly ultra soft toothbrush, will buy again</li>
            <li> I decided to get the ultra soft brushes because the dental hygienist said to use the softest I can get.  </li>
            <li> This is a TRULY soft brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, with a compact head.  </li>
            <li> use the Ultra Soft because it is just that, Ultra Soft.</li>
            <li> Even the \\&quot;extra-soft\\&quot; toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used before hurt my sensitive gums</li>
            <li> like the soft and ultra soft the best---easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> They are not ultra soft.</li>
            <li> I suffer from toothbrush abrasion (brush too hard/fast, &amp; over the years my tooth enamel has worn away to expose sensitive roots).</li>
            <li> They have wonderfully soft...</li>
            <li> I like how they feel in my hand, and I like that the bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for bulk toothbrushes on Amazon.com and found the Preserve Toothbrushes, Ultra Soft Bristles.  </li>
            <li> They are soft on gums.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ULTRA soft.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old also uses these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Unlike \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought in my supermarket or pharmacy and then had to discard, these actually are gentle on gums.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are indeed uber soft.</li>
            <li> I wanted just a normally soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought an Ultra Soft Preserve toothbrush years ago at Walmart and it WAS Ultra Soft.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any one looking for a soft toothbrush</li>
            <li> Soft..perfect for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I always looked for these in the grocery store but never found ultra soft.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and I had no gum bleeding since I started using them.</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> These bristles stay soft and they don&#x27;t scratch up my gums.  </li>
            <li> I will switch to the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soft bristle and see whether the problem is restricted to the ultra-soft design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushing head size seems to be in between the child and adult sizes.  </li>
            <li> After using these for a couple of years I used one, supposedly soft, from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I touched the bristles of my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> These are actually soft, as soft as the ones I get from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find an ultra-soft toothbrush for adults, so I was delighted to discover this one.  </li>
            <li> However, since they are echo-friendly, i will try the medium strength bristles, and if they do not work, I will be forced back to the Oral-B kind.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a little odd at first, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li> Not only can you send these back for more recycling in a mailer provided, these are long lasting toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Preserve Toothbrushes (Ultra Soft is my personal preference).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if anyone is looking for an extra soft bristle.</li>
            <li> The Preserve bristles are soft, the handle is smooth and I like the angle, but the bristles began bending within two weeks, so the supply I bought to last 6 months lasted half that.</li>
            <li> But these are more like medium-soft bristles and not good for my sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> know why this is such a challange to find a normal soft bristle</li>
            <li> Handling this toothbrush is a little odd at first because of its shape but its easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality high enough that I&#x27;ve started using as my travel brush.  </li>
            <li> And my dentist has always given me new extra soft when I come in for a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I use sensitive toothpaste/mouth rinse products and this works well as to comfort and general use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using the only other extra soft bristle brush out there, when I visited Amazon to find them online, because they are not always available in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird that it&#x27;s not easier to find more ultra-soft brushes, they are much better for health than stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> I wish this brush came in \\&quot;extra soft, soft, medium &amp; firm\\&quot; bristles.</li>
            <li> gums are receding a tiny bit &amp; some of my teeth have become very sensitive because of this.  </li>
            <li> First, let me say that I have extremely sensitive teeth, I brush slowly, about 4 to 5 minutes, using  the \\&quot;wiggle\\&quot; technique my dentist advised: hold the brush gently between the thumb and pointer fingers, like a pencil, no pressure, and wiggle the bristles in a downward motion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, the soft nylon bristles are new -- only the handle (90% of the total material used) is recycled.</li>
            <li> The long and steady curve on the brush help enhance the brushing experience.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes really are ultra soft and work well, but they also are not true adult sized.  </li>
            <li> The Preserve brush does the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> It is only $15 &amp; you can get ultra soft heads.  </li>
            <li> Softer than my \\&quot;Extra Soft Colgate 360\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> These bristles are extra soft - the softest I have found on the market.  </li>
            <li> The bristles seem softer than a regular soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist didn&#x27;t have EXTRA soft.  </li>
            <li> EXTRA soft bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can not find extra soft in stores.</li>
            <li> Yet despite their robustness, the bristles are soft enough for tender gums.  </li>
            <li> dentist is very big on ultra soft bristles to preserve gum health and these bristles are quite</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommends extra soft brushes and gives us one after every checkup.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are actually ultra soft too.</li>
            <li> I could never find one with soft enough bristles in the stores.  </li>
            <li> You need to compensate for this angle to bring the head to your teeth by uncomfortably bending your wrist more so than you would a normal brush.</li>
            <li> I typically use an Oral B brush first thing in the morning, but I brush again after eating and use this brush for</li>
            <li> The bristle is indeed soft, but there is too little of it for a normal adult mouth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find those ones online anywhere, so I tried these Preserve ones, and they are ok, but they go bad quite quickly -- they just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The only way it is reusable is to send back your old toothbrush for recycling.</li>
            <li> However, drugstores and the big box stores never seem to have extra soft in any brand.  </li>
            <li> They are simple, do the intended job well, come in a variety of colors &amp; the curved handle allows me to clean hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, their swooped handle and smallish brush head make it easier to clean the hard to reach back parts of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B extra soft was sold out at Target and the only other adult extra soft toothbrush was the Preserve.    </li>
            <li> Oh, well, you can find the ultra soft toothbrushes sometimes, but they either have a child size toothbrush head, or they have some strange circular plastic thingy</li>
            <li> I love these-I really like a tooth brush that has extra soft bristles which are almost impossible to find in local stores-</li>
            <li> Dentist told me and my significant other that I needed to use a extra/ultra soft toothbrush and to stop brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why, but the ultra soft toothbrushes are extremely hard to find in ANY store.  </li>
            <li> I mean, they&#x27;re fine, and they do the job, but I prefer the other brand.</li>
            <li> Also the bristles are basically flat, which didn&#x27;t give me the feeling that they were cleaning along the gumline, unless I were to push harder, which, with my sensitive teeth, I was loathe to do.</li>
            <li> Even the ones listed as soft feel sharp to me.</li>
            <li> I am also using Sensodyne again because I thought my teeth had become sensitive overnight and didn&#x27;t even think to attribute it to the other toothbrush I had just started using.  </li>
            <li> My teeth get clean without unnecessary abrasion.</li>
            <li> The extreme bend on the actual brush also makes it easy to get behind and reach.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long either.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is I&#x27;m accustomed to a more rubbery grip; this toothbrush handle is nicely simple but rather slick when wet and covered with toothpaste foam.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get used to the feeling of brushing with such soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Just a regular plain ultra soft toothbrush for adults?  </li>
            <li> I searched for years before I found this eco-friendly, smartly angled brush with delicate bristles that won&#x27;t irritate my recessed gums.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical of the curved handle but as it turned out I really enjoy the ergonomics.  </li>
            <li> six toothbrushes came in the following colors: pink (1), white (2), baby blue (1), dark navy/black (2).</li>
            <li> Ultra soft recommended by my dentist to prevent harsh gum damage.</li>
            <li> Will purchase these as long as they keep making them.</li>
            <li> In grocery/department/drug stores around here, &#x27;soft&#x27; tooth brushes are really stiff.  </li>
            <li> the single to week long use these bushes often receive.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for extra soft toothbrushes, which are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> least in the stores now, the packaging is different and it now comes in plastic sleeves so you can actually mail your toothbrush back to be recycled (with prepaid shipping for the consumer)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Package says invented by dentists, handle is recycle material, bristles all new materials (not recycled), &amp; brush curve is for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Very soft so not abrasive or hard on gums but cleans well.</li>
            <li> At first glance, I thought the ergonomic handle looked weird, but as soon as I tried brushing with it my mind was instantly changed.</li>
            <li> The odd shape of these toothbrushes makes them difficult to hold securely while brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> The curve of the handle takes a little getting used to but seems to help in cleaning the back teeth.</li>
            <li> If it was made just a little bigger, I would probably be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have indicated that the bristles on the Preserve toothbrushes are either too soft or too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find really soft tooth brushes in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have to use an ultra soft toothbrush and they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> But my mouth continues to deteriorate at an alarming speed,Thanks, Dad!&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> I use sensitive toothpaste daily, but require the softest bristles to prevent worse erosion (enamel will never return).  </li>
            <li> What is so difficult about manufacturing an adult sized ultra soft toothbrush?  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, they did not clean my teeth well, especially between them.  </li>
            <li> My dentist says medium is too stiff and harsh a texture for anybody to use on their teeth--no-one should use any toothbrush harder than soft.  </li>
            <li> I like the design, softness, and may eventually try the ultra soft due to gum erosion from years of using a hard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to find extra soft or ultra soft toothbrushes in stores.  </li>
            <li> teeth/remove plaque just as well as other soft/medium bristled brushes i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> With other toothbrushes I often found that I would keep using them way longer than I should be (even if the brush ends were getting messed up and frayed)</li>
            <li> I specifically bought these toothbrushes instead of other brands based on the description saying it came with a travel case.</li>
            <li> The shape is whacky and not exactly helpful.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> These are made in the USA which is a big priority for us and cost no more than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first the angle seems a bit weird, and you have to pay attention</li>
            <li> Love the angle, but the bristles have been falling out? :-(</li>
            <li> Preserve sells other products online, too, make from recycled yogurt containers.</li>
            <li> This product is just like any other toothbrush with one exception.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Other options to recycle your Preserve</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Recycle it in our Preserve Gimme 5 bins (along with all other Preserve products).</li>
            <li> We were looking for extra-soft toothbrushes and had a really hard time finding them in our local grocery and drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I only have one complaint, and it was mentioned in another review.</li>
            <li> The brush head is not super fancy, but I think the multilevel, multicolored bristles are a bit of a gimmick anyway.    </li>
            <li> Plus, they also come in black.</li>
            <li> Less waste.</li>
            <li> Do not clean between teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush, it just takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> at least 1 or 2 bristles come loose.  </li>
            <li> I needed extra soft toothbushes and their impossible to find in any retail store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hands down !  </li>
            <li> picked up a soft Safeway brand toothbrush that isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles.  </li>
            <li> I watch the Sundance channel&#x27;s green program every Tuesday.</li>
            <li> Handles are not comfortable on the hands.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find truly soft bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li> Since we began using them a few years ago, we have been hooked.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find that in any other toothbrush brand.    </li>
            <li> I replace my brush each month to avoid stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> Oral B stopped selling their standard extra soft toothbrush &amp; Colgate&#x27;s \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; came with \\&quot;tongue cleaner\\&quot; which felt terrible in my mouth.</li>
            <li> If you have hard water, sometimes the ribs ends up collecting a little scale.    </li>
            <li> (I have a small mouth--perhaps this makes a difference.)  </li>
            <li> On top of that is the outrageous shipping charge.  </li>
            <li> and these are softer than your usual &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I will use it, but it is small, like made for a childs mouth.</li>
            <li> The dentist says my mouth is small.</li>
            <li> They feel as hard as a Hard toothbrush to me.</li>
            <li> This has a hard plastic handle and works well in my sanitizor.  </li>
            <li> These are such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> At least it does not go into the landfill.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  quite tedious and repetitive.</li>
            <li> They did come in one cardboard box inside another, which is totally unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> and behind them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t brush well with it, it was crazy hard.</li>
            <li> It will be hard for us to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Ecofriendly too!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> But it is a bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a month now and not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I now have toothbrushes for a year, so I&#x27;ll never be stuck with the decision of having to run to a health food store or use an uncomfortable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> False advertising!</li>
            <li> The angle of it makes it impossible for me to brush too hard!</li>
            <li> The angle is awkward.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid being recycled plastic that the toothbrush would be flimsy</li>
            <li> ; cuz I&#x27;m crazy about Amazon too.</li>
            <li> The handle does not allow to reach in all parts of the mouth because it is very uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Also, they come with a postage-paid bad to put the used toothbrushes in so you can recycle them!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are terrible.  </li>
            <li> Not so!&lt;br /&gt;Genetics has dealt me a cruel hand, teeth-wise.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE these toothbrushes. They are ultra soft, comfortable, recycled and recycle-able and they come in these great travel ready cases.    I have turn on a bunch of my friends to these fabulous toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> I started purchasing this brand of toothbrush because they are recycled and they provide postage paid envelopes to return used toothbrushes and cases for recycling.  The envelopes are available next to the toothbrushes at local retailers that sell this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I only purchase this product from Amazon when it is sold by Amazon at a price lower than my local retailers and with free shipping.  And I only buy the soft bristle toothbrushes because my dentist told me that any harder bristles can cause gums to recede.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical of the curved handle but as it turned out I really enjoy the ergonomics.  Have reordered.</li>
            <li> I am old. I have tender gums, but all of my teeth. These toothbrushes are awesome...even though I do not like to describe anything as awesome. I will order these again.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review for a toothbrush. But here I go anyway. So this really is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I personally tend to look at brushing my teeth as a bit of a chore. It&#x27;s  quite tedious and repetitive. It&#x27;s still repetitive, but what this toothbrush does to make it so nice is how soft and gentle it is, yet you still feel like you&#x27;re getting everything clean. You know your gums don&#x27;t get beaten, but still get strengthened by the action of brushing. The extreme bend on the actual brush also makes it easy to get behind and reach.</li>
            <li> I just started using the product. I like the curve and colors. Its a great product and its made in the USA (finally something thats not made in China) as far as the enviroment goes I dont think there is anything that is as completely enviromently friend as this product. Its comes from recycled parts and u get to send it back to get recycled again. Its a win win situation for the enviroment, country and consumer.</li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely uncomfortable to use. Take a look at any toothbrush and you&#x27;ll notice that the head either has no angle or is angled toward the face when brushing. The Preserve brush does the complete opposite. The head of the toothbrush is angled back and away from the face when held. You need to compensate for this angle to bring the head to your teeth by uncomfortably bending your wrist more so than you would a normal brush. IMO, these brushes are unusable. And they definitely should not be used by anyone with any wrist conditions.</li>
            <li> Substantial enough to clean (I use Peroxicare with them) but gentle on the gums.  The only brush I know of that fits this bill.   Glad to get the pack of six and save money.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth or gums, this is the perfect toothbrush for you!  I searched for years before I found this eco-friendly, smartly angled brush with delicate bristles that won&#x27;t irritate my recessed gums.  My teeth are actually cleaner now because it doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush them with this ultrasoft toothbrush.  However, make sure you buy the Preserve Ultrasoft toothbrush as the Preserve Soft toothbrush is surprisingly much harsher on sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> a truly ultra soft toothbrush, will buy again</li>
            <li> I think my title pretty much sums it up.&lt;br /&gt;My gums are receding a tiny bit &amp; some of my teeth have become very sensitive because of this.  I decided to get the ultra soft brushes because the dental hygienist said to use the softest I can get.  I try to support organic, local, &amp; environmental products in as many purchases as possible so I thought these would fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;My husband hates the brushes.  He says his teeth are not getting clean either.  On top of that he has bridge work &amp; the bristles actually come out of the toothbrush.  I brush my teeth forever or so it feels.  I rinse.  I look in the mirror &amp; I can scrape foot bits off my teeth.  When I floss there is way more food matter than when I used other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to order an electric Oral B toothbrush on amazon.  It is only $15 &amp; you can get ultra soft heads.  I know the electric brushes are supposed to do a better job.  My teeth need help.  I take excellent care of them, but I think these toothbrushes are fighting my best efforts at a healthy mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend them at all.&lt;br /&gt;I gave them the stars that I did because they are environmentally responsible &amp; that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. Great use of recycled materials. They are simple, do the intended job well, come in a variety of colors &amp; the curved handle allows me to clean hard to reach teeth. Best of all, when you&#x27;ve worn it out, simply put it in its case and send it off (postage is prepaid!) to the manufacturer to be recycled again into future toothbrushes. Don&#x27;t worry, the soft nylon bristles are new -- only the handle (90% of the total material used) is recycled. Easy peasy way to help ol Mama Earth!</li>
            <li> this soft brush has made brushing so much better that regular bleeding gum is rarely bleeding gum.</li>
            <li> These are such a disappointment.  The bristles fall apart in my mouth within the first uses, sometimes the very first use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for extra soft toothbrushes, which are hard to find in stores. But these are more like medium-soft bristles and not good for my sensitive teeth and gums.  On the positive side, it is good build quality and I like the angled handle.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these babies at Target today. I needed a new toothbrush, and saw the fantastic $2 price, and the eye-catching design, and was hooked. (btw, why are these more $$ on amazon?!) I was pleased that they were made out of recycled material, and even the packaging is a travel container! Which is great for me, because I travel all the time, and always lose mine.    This is a TRULY soft brush. Softer than my \\&quot;Extra Soft Colgate 360\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve been using for years. The angle of the neck makes it much much easier to brush the way my periodontist has told me to. I&#x27;m in need of a gum graft, so my gums are very sensitive. This tooth brush didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my sensitive gums at all!    I only have one complaint, and it was mentioned in another review. Although this is truly soft, and feels like it&#x27;s doing a great job cleaning your teeth, it does leave a lot behind. I&#x27;ve found that a lot of tooth brushes leave gunk on my teeth, but this left a wee more. I noticed more than usual on my floss.    I&#x27;m going to continue with this product for a bit though. The ultra softness that does not harm my gums, the very economical price, and the recyclability are all worth while attributes!</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes! I really took a chance, ordering a brand I&#x27;ve never tried, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. My dentist recommended extra-soft bristles, which I can&#x27;t get here locally. These were on sale, and I thought they looked neat, so I went for it. I was a tiny bit bummed by the color assortment, but as I&#x27;m a grown-up, I can deal. What I love the most is the angle of the handle/bristles (which are ultra-soft).</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are terrible.  Everytime I brush, at least 1 or 2 bristles come loose.  Really a gross feeling.    They don&#x27;t last long either.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush. The box it comes in doubles as a travel case (and actually works well for that purpose). The product is made of recycled material and imminently recyclable... and it is a great, well-designed toothbrush. BPA free and everything else you would expect.  I purchased them for travel alone, and quickly converted to using them at home as well.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these toothbrushes for myself as well as given them to others.  Everyone has LOVED them!  Simple and comfortable to hold - I highly recommend Preserve Toothbrushes (Ultra Soft is my personal preference).</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s soft, with a compact head.  For some reason, the size/shape/curve of the handle make it so easy to get the hard-to-reach places.  I absolutely love this toothbrush.  (I have a small mouth--perhaps this makes a difference.)  I cannot find a toothbrush that compares.</li>
            <li> I find these toothbrushes awesome, the bent handle is a nice touch for better brushing and they do a great job of cleaning my teeth. I love the fact they are made from yogurt cups and that I can recycle them again!!!     I loved them so much I bought my husband one and a couple of the kids one for my son!</li>
            <li> I watch the Sundance channel&#x27;s green program every Tuesday. This product was shown on there a while ago and I&#x27;m certain it boosted their sales. AMZN has the BEST price for this item as it is considerably cheaper than Trader Joes&#x27;, like 6 for the price of 2! I like the design, softness, and may eventually try the ultra soft due to gum erosion from years of using a hard toothbrush. Sure the handle takes getting used to, but it&#x27;s a green product and goes very well w/ Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste.</li>
            <li> ultra-soft bristles are no exaggeration, yet they clean teeth/remove plaque just as well as other soft/medium bristled brushes i&#x27;ve used. makes for easy reach back teeth. recommended!</li>
            <li> If you are a USA product buff like me :) these are made right here in the states. You&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find that in any other toothbrush brand.    That in and of itself is a great reason to purchase these, but there is more.    I find it hard to get good soft-bristled toothbrushes. Even the ones listed as soft feel sharp to me. Preserve ultra-soft does the trick. The brush head is not super fancy, but I think the multilevel, multicolored bristles are a bit of a gimmick anyway.    They come in a handy postage-paid return envelope for recycling. In fairness, all toothbrushes are recyclable. Cut off the head and drop the handle in your recycling bin. You&#x27;ll save energy by not shipping back to the manufacturer.    It is nice that they don&#x27;t overdo it with the packaging. Less waste. There is a perforated line where you open the package, however, when I used to purchase these in a big-box store, sometimes the package would be split already on the ones on the rack. Haven&#x27;t had that problem yet with mail order, but I suppose it is something to consider.    The handle is ribbed for aesthetics and grip. If you have hard water, sometimes the ribs ends up collecting a little scale.    All in all, it is a very good product with benefits beyond clean teeth.</li>
            <li> These bristles are extra soft - the softest I have found on the market.  And they are environmentally friendly to boot!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these toothbrushes. Not only, [do I think that] they are more comfortable than most other toothbrushes, they&#x27;re also recycled and recyclable. Plus, they also come in black. How many toothbrushes do that? ;)</li>
            <li> I first found this brush about two years ago(?) and fell in love with them, then I haven&#x27;t been able to find them the past year at all, so I&#x27;ve been using the toothbrush that my dentist gives me at each cleaning. I finally found one (and the last one at that) a few months ago and it reconfirmed everything that I loved about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Ultra Soft because it is just that, Ultra Soft. My gums are in much better shape because of this, and I have never had a problem with my teeth feeling unclean because it is so soft. My teeth actually stay clean longer when i use this toothbrush and my favorite toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have told people about this toothbrush so many times and have even asked for them for Christmas, they are great and everyone should try them. For the person who said there was more \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on their teeth with flossing after brushing with these... Your suppose to floss BEFORE brushing, it breaks up plaque, food bits, etc. making your teeth be cleaner for longer.</li>
            <li> Even the \\&quot;extra-soft\\&quot; toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used before hurt my sensitive gums so I&#x27;m really excited about these.  I don&#x27;t have to dread brushing my teeth anymore.    Also, they come with a postage-paid bad to put the used toothbrushes in so you can recycle them!  I&#x27;ll be buying these again and recommending them to friends.</li>
            <li> Peer review was good, so I tried it. Just as advertised and received it before promised date. Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> The odd shape of these toothbrushes makes them difficult to hold securely while brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> Dentist told me and my significant other that I needed to use a extra/ultra soft toothbrush and to stop brushing too hard. These toothbrushes are great because they are soft and cheap. With other toothbrushes I often found that I would keep using them way longer than I should be (even if the brush ends were getting messed up and frayed) simply because many of the ultra soft toothbrushes are pretty expensive--with these I would use them and feel no guilt throwing them out and grabbing a new one when I needed to (about every 2-3 months, as recommended).</li>
            <li> Excellent cost for an excellent product and you can&lt;br /&gt;send the package + toothbrushes in for recycling.&lt;br /&gt;I like the soft and ultra soft the best---easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes if you have receding gums, especially if you tend to brush harder than you should.</li>
            <li> Thank you for offering these!  They&#x27;re great -- the bristles are nice and soft, yet efficient.  My teeth feel clean and my gums are happy after a cleaning :) The handle allows ease when trying to get to those tricky spots so, I&#x27;m pleased about that too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every brand of toothbrush and this one is outstanding!  It is difficult to find an ultra-soft toothbrush for adults, so I was delighted to discover this one.  The curve of the handle is ergonomic, the bristles are comfortable but effective, and the fact that it is made from recycled materials (and that they encourage users to send old products back for further recycling) is even better!  Forget all the others---buy these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought these toothbrushes instead of other brands based on the description saying it came with a travel case. The exact description was  &amp;#34;Packaging is reusable travel case with ventilation holes&amp;#34; However the packaging was a flexible piece of plastic with directions to open the top then send back your old toothbrush as part of the gimme 5 program. There are no ventilation holes anywhere. The only way it is reusable is to send back your old toothbrush for recycling. I can appreciate the recycling program and I&#x27;m all for it. BUT I bought this product instead of others because of the travel case. False advertising!</li>
            <li> The bristles seem softer than a regular soft toothbrush. The curve of the handle takes a little getting used to but seems to help in cleaning the back teeth. My only minor complaint is I&#x27;m accustomed to a more rubbery grip; this toothbrush handle is nicely simple but rather slick when wet and covered with toothpaste foam. I&#x27;d still use this over store-bought toothbrushes because it&#x27;s easier on my receding gums.</li>
            <li> These are basic toothbrushes, not the latest technology, yet they have significantly higher prices than the better polyester-bristle toothbrushes.  On top of that is the outrageous shipping charge.  They did come in one cardboard box inside another, which is totally unnecessary.  Toothbrushes are not fragile, will survive being dropped from a ten story building, and will even survive being stepped on.</li>
            <li> I really like these ultra soft toothbrushes,  It is nearly impossible to find extra soft or ultra soft toothbrushes in stores.  My dentist says medium is too stiff and harsh a texture for anybody to use on their teeth--no-one should use any toothbrush harder than soft.  And my dentist has always given me new extra soft when I come in for a cleaning.  These ultra are even softer.  I gave one of these I got from Amazon to my dentist to sample. He used it at home, liked it, thought it would work fine, but agreed ultra soft was softer than extra soft.  One thing I particularly like about this brand is the tilted toothbrush head.  It makes it easier to reach everything in my mouth when brushing and seems to make it less likely I&#x27;ll bash myself in my gums (which isn&#x27;t very good for them!).  I give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they said that they were ultra soft and they were a very good price. They are not ultra soft.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B extra soft was sold out at Target and the only other adult extra soft toothbrush was the Preserve.    The shape is whacky and not exactly helpful. But the bristles really are extra-soft and don&#x27;t \\&quot;harden with time\\&quot;, as some others have mentioned happen with some brands. Postage-paid sleeve means I don&#x27;t have to toss it. All around good buy.</li>
            <li> I suffer from toothbrush abrasion (brush too hard/fast, &amp; over the years my tooth enamel has worn away to expose sensitive roots). I use sensitive toothpaste daily, but require the softest bristles to prevent worse erosion (enamel will never return).  My dentist didn&#x27;t have EXTRA soft.  Oral B stopped selling their standard extra soft toothbrush &amp; Colgate&#x27;s \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; came with \\&quot;tongue cleaner\\&quot; which felt terrible in my mouth. In the stores, my only remaining options were tiny kiddie toothbrushes (yes, I considered it) or spending a lot of money to see if electric might work better &amp; if if I liked it.  Before taking either of those options, I searched the Internet &amp; Amazon with this product came to the rescue.  I bought these after reading the other reviews.  I like these...really, really like these!  They have wonderfully soft...EXTRA soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package says invented by dentists, handle is recycle material, bristles all new materials (not recycled), &amp; brush curve is for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> The bristle is indeed soft, but there is too little of it for a normal adult mouth. The handle does not allow to reach in all parts of the mouth because it is very uncomfortable to hold. I had to throw away the Preserve toothbrush after the first use: it just does not do the job a toothbrush should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many so-called ultra soft toothbrushes in my 58 years of life, and in my opinion The Preserve toothbrush stands alone. For the last 2 years I have been using Preserve. It is truly the best for comfort and good dental hygiene. My dentist has noticed my gums are much healthier.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t tear my gums apart and glad it&#x27;s recycled!</li>
            <li> I love the soft bristles on these brushes.  I&#x27;m doing Invisalign &amp; so brush my teeth often each day.  I also love that these are recyclable.  I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is not quite as good as the ones I get at the dentist office, but those must only be for dentist to buy. I love the angle of the handle and I can not find extra soft in stores.</li>
            <li> The super soft bristles are gentle on gums, while still giving a good cleaning. Color assortment in the bundle from Amazon was good for me and my husband - blue, white, green, purple. I love that these are made from recycled plastic and can go right back in my recycle bin when I&#x27;m done with them. I will continue buying these!</li>
            <li> I originally found this brand of toothbrushes when I started looking for eco-friendly ones that were made in USA.  I like how they feel in my hand, and I like that the bristles are soft.  You can recycle them by mailing them back to the manufacturer, or by using them as cleaning tools at home.</li>
            <li> Not only can you send these back for more recycling in a mailer provided, these are long lasting toothbrushes.  Yet despite their robustness, the bristles are soft enough for tender gums.  Highly recommended for tree huggers and cynics alike.</li>
            <li> I was looking for bulk toothbrushes on Amazon.com and found the Preserve Toothbrushes, Ultra Soft Bristles.  Immediately I noticed two things: 1) they felt great on my gums!  2) On the other hand, they did not clean my teeth well, especially between them.  However, since they are echo-friendly, i will try the medium strength bristles, and if they do not work, I will be forced back to the Oral-B kind.  In summary:  Pros:   1) Echo friendly product.  2) They are soft on gums.  3) Product comes with a pre-paid envelope for recycling.  Cons:  1) Do not clean between teeth.  2) You have to replace them every two weeks or so, depending on use, as they tarnish quickly.  3) Handles are not comfortable on the hands.</li>
            <li> As a toothbrush, preserve is fine, not great but not horrible.  I&#x27;ll buy them again because I like the fact that they&#x27;re made from 100% recycled plastic and I like the travel case container.  Those two features make me ok with the price.  I would like to see them have ones with a medium bristle in the future.</li>
            <li> I always buy the softest bristle toothbrushes I can find, as I want to avoid causing any receding gumline issues. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and these really are the best. They are truly ultra soft, yet effective and get the job done. They are comfortable to use and come with a handy reusable case. My husband loves them too and always makes sure I buy this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also draw the line at toothbrushes that are made in China, which you will find is unfortunately becoming more common in the brands we all know so well. These are made in the USA which is a big priority for us and cost no more than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we ran out, I used another brand that I had and really noticed the difference on how much better these Preserve toothbrushes work and feel. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love these-I really like a tooth brush that has extra soft bristles which are almost impossible to find in local stores-I did not like the handle shape at first but now love it-being made of recycled materials is also a plus-</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes. At first the angle seems a bit weird, and you have to pay attention or you&#x27;ll poke your eye out instead of clean your teeth. Once you get the hang of it though it feels nice in your hand, and the angle helps get into the back of your mouth. The bristles feel nice, not abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;The whole family has commented on how much they like the new toothbrushes. It will be hard for us to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Ecofriendly too!! What could be better. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am soooo pleased with these-the best toothbrushes I have ever come across,  They&#x27;re perfect,  Everything about them is so well planned.  The handle, the angle, the softness of the brushes,  I love these, am paranoid that the next time I&#x27;m due to reorder them, Amazon won&#x27;t carry them again,,,,,,,PLUS, they&#x27;re recyclable,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best!</li>
            <li> I love that Preserve takes into account the life cycle of its products while making it easy on the customer. They provide an envelope for used brushes and then send you more. Handling this toothbrush is a little odd at first because of its shape but its easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, I tried writing names on these with a Sharpie but they rubbed right off.</li>
            <li> Started subscribing to these toothbrushes for guests at my houses.  The eco-friendly aspect helps my guest and I feel better about the single to week long use these bushes often receive.  Quality high enough that I&#x27;ve started using as my travel brush.  The long and steady curve on the brush help enhance the brushing experience.  Great at keeping those peril whites nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Every procedure you can name dentist-wise, I&#x27;ve had it. Many of them, multiple times over. Hubby rarely brushes or flosses and dentists exclaim over his pristine mouth, with nary a cavity or exposed root.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are good for my sort. The sort who when the dentist looks in my mouth, he sighs and shakes his head and assumes I am a slacker about my teeth. Not so!&lt;br /&gt;Genetics has dealt me a cruel hand, teeth-wise. I&#x27;m a brusher. I&#x27;m a floss-er. I  eat lots of vegetables. But my mouth continues to deteriorate at an alarming speed,Thanks, Dad!&lt;br /&gt;These brushes won&#x27;t change your tooth DNA. But they feel good on tender gums.</li>
            <li> ....AND they&#x27;re environmentally friendly! Yahooo! I love these because I brush hard and these are softer than your usual &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; bristled brush from the store. They&#x27;re ULTRA soft. Totally dig that they&#x27;re made of yogurt cups as well. My 5 year old also uses these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I love that these Preserve toothbrushes can reach every area of my mouth.  I have wisdom teeth but the angle of the handle makes it easy to get all the way back to them (and behind them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist is very big on ultra soft bristles to preserve gum health and these bristles are quite soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use preserve toothbrushes from now on.</li>
            <li> Life is too short not to use the best toothbrush available!&lt;br /&gt;The handle, shape, and brush are the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Love the angle, but the bristles have been falling out? :-(</li>
            <li> Not lasting as long as I had hoped but they are extra soft which I need and they are beautifully made with rounded tips on the bristles and comfortable house.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes are extremely easy on the gums, but still provide a good clean. The handle is comfortable and the size is just perfect for those hard to reach areas. These don&#x27;t cost more than regular toothbrushes but are made from 100% recycled plastic; awesome!</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive teeth then this for you...</li>
            <li> I love these! Unlike \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought in my supermarket or pharmacy and then had to discard, these actually are gentle on gums. Also, their swooped handle and smallish brush head make it easier to clean the hard to reach back parts of your mouth. Plus they look good--their colors are bright and their style is sleek. They&#x27;re made from recycled plastic, and can be recycled again when you&#x27;re done with them.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is just the right size for my mouth, and the bristles are just right for me because I was previously using a toothbrush that advertised a whitening feature that made my teeth sensitive.  It must have been the material of the star bristles that irritated my teeth coupled with the fact that I brush way too vigorously according to my dentist. I immediately noticed the difference when I started brushing with this product. I am also using Sensodyne again because I thought my teeth had become sensitive overnight and didn&#x27;t even think to attribute it to the other toothbrush I had just started using.  Some reviewers have indicated that the bristles on the Preserve toothbrushes are either too soft or too hard. I guess it depends on your history with toothbrushes. I find the bristles perfect for me and my brushing habits.</li>
            <li> I will use it, but it is small, like made for a childs mouth. The angle is awkward.  If it was made just a little bigger, I would probably be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a soft Safeway brand toothbrush that isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles.  Between the 2 of them, I&#x27;ll get by.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know why this is such a challange to find a normal soft bristle, it&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update&lt;br /&gt;I have grown  to like it.  It is true that the angle is better for cleaning and the brushes are nice n soft. I would raise my original critique to 4 stars now. (that Safeway brand one has fallen apart, while this one has held up very well).  I would recommend this brush, it just takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth.  These are the only toothbrushes I have found that don&#x27;t harm my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other ultra soft brushes but none as good as these. They seem to be very well made also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find really soft tooth brushes in stores.  These are great.  I&#x27;ve ordered them several times.  My teeth get clean without unnecessary abrasion.</li>
            <li> The dentist says my mouth is small. He recommended this very toothbrush which I love. Also, these toothbrushes are made from recycled yogurt containers. Preserve sells other products online, too, make from recycled yogurt containers. They are excellent in quality.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they&#x27;re made from recycled plastic &amp; I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more for an environmentally friendly product. Well, my good deed paid off because I discovered this awesome toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My six toothbrushes came in the following colors: pink (1), white (2), baby blue (1), dark navy/black (2). At first glance, I thought the ergonomic handle looked weird, but as soon as I tried brushing with it my mind was instantly changed. Wow! Funny how such a little change of angle can make brushing so much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that each toothbrush comes in it&#x27;s own travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are indeed uber soft. For me personally, this was not a plus. I wanted just a normally soft toothbrush. It took a few days to get used to the feeling of brushing with such soft bristles. I wish this brush came in \\&quot;extra soft, soft, medium &amp; firm\\&quot; bristles. But that&#x27;s just me. If you like extra soft bristles, you&#x27;ve hit the jackpot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying the brushes, I noticed my Whole Foods has a \\&quot;Gimme 5\\&quot; recycling bin where you can drop off your #5 plastics for recycling. Many towns &amp; cities won&#x27;t recycle #5 plastics, so the fact that this brush is made from #5 and can be recycled again is phenomenally cool!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes that doesn&#x27;t cause my gum to bleed every time I brush my teeth like a lot of the common toothbrushes do. But it is a bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought an Ultra Soft Preserve toothbrush years ago at Walmart and it WAS Ultra Soft. These are not. They feel as hard as a Hard toothbrush to me. Either Preserve has changed their softness measurements for their toothbrush bristles or they labeled these incorrectly. Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> I get these for my whole family. They&#x27;re soft enough not to do damage even with vigorous brushing, yet they get our teeth clean. The fact that they&#x27;re recycled is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> Best brushes ever. Very soft so not abrasive or hard on gums but cleans well.My hygienist says I can come to her only every 12 instead of 6 months because I&#x27;m doing such a thorough job.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I am able to carry over my love of recycling and reducing waste to the very last thing I do each day!  I love that these toothbrushes are recycled yogurt cups and that they&#x27;re recyclable after I&#x27;ve used them for a few months.  Furthermore, my kids can get in on this with their kid sized brushes.  Oh, and they&#x27;re made in the USA!  GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is, I love using the brush itself!  It&#x27;s so soft and easy on the teeth and the curve of the brush makes it easy to reach the way back of the mouth!</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.  The Extra Soft are so gentle on the gums.  Great product at a great price.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> These are so great! They&#x27;re the only super soft brushes I can find. I love that they&#x27;re made from recycled materials and are themselves fully recyclable.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was as described and great value for money. I would recommend it to any one looking for a soft toothbrush</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great. Soft..perfect for sensitive gums. I would highly recommend if anyone is looking for an extra soft bristle.</li>
            <li> I opened for myself and my hubby was looking over my shoulder and showed interest.  We love the brush and find we brush longer as the bristles are so gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great quality and ultrasoft for the person who has a tendancy to brush too hard. I like them better than any you find in the stores.</li>
            <li> This product is just like any other toothbrush with one exception.  It is relatively \\&quot;green\\&quot;  It is made from recycled products and after one is done with it, it just goes in a reply envelope to be recycled again.  At least it does not go into the landfill.  (I do not know the energy cost of the recycling, tho).</li>
            <li> First use not that soft.  I have been using them for a month now and not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> These are the softest toothbrushes on the market.  They give a great clean without hurting your gums.  Also you can feel great buying them knowing they are made from #5 plastic...aka yogurt containers!  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Does anybody know what size these tootbrushes are?  I personally like the larger brushes.  I have checked everywhere and I can&#x27;t find a size.  I am currently using 35, but I prefer the bigger brushes.  Please let me know if you are using this tootbrush.  Thank you for your help.</li>
            <li> Ultra soft toothbrushes are the bomb!  I always looked for these in the grocery store but never found ultra soft.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find truly soft bristle brushes.  These are excellent.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and I had no gum bleeding since I started using them. Very happy with them!</li>
            <li> I had been using the only other extra soft bristle brush out there, when I visited Amazon to find them online, because they are not always available in stores. I saw the Preserve toothbrushes and thought I&#x27;d try them since they offer the benefit of recycling. First, let me say that I have extremely sensitive teeth, I brush slowly, about 4 to 5 minutes, using  the \\&quot;wiggle\\&quot; technique my dentist advised: hold the brush gently between the thumb and pointer fingers, like a pencil, no pressure, and wiggle the bristles in a downward motion. I replace my brush each month to avoid stiff bristles. The Preserve bristles are soft, the handle is smooth and I like the angle, but the bristles began bending within two weeks, so the supply I bought to last 6 months lasted half that. Also, the bristles didn&#x27;t make my teeth feel clean, so I had to brush them twice, owing for a rediculous amount of time in the bathroom just brushing my teeth. Also the bristles are basically flat, which didn&#x27;t give me the feeling that they were cleaning along the gumline, unless I were to push harder, which, with my sensitive teeth, I was loathe to do. Luckily, both extra soft toothbrush brands are available on Subscribe and Save, so I will be switching my subscription. Preserve is not a poor toothbrush, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Rather than run around trying to find the right, extra soft, compact head toothbrush, I decided to find what I prefer on Amazon.  Sure enough, I found an unlimited supply on Amazon!  Now how smart do I feel?  I have what I want and didn&#x27;t have to drain my gas tank.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes as I have used them before. Ultra soft recommended by my dentist to prevent harsh gum damage. Recycle to&lt;br /&gt;save the planet. it&#x27;s a win/win. Will repeat with this buyer.</li>
            <li> So soft. I love these.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles but curved handles which I didn&#x27;t really like.  I wish that that would have been included in the description.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothbrush that I will use. The angle of it makes it impossible for me to brush too hard!</li>
            <li> These are amazing! Since we began using them a few years ago, we have been hooked. They are so nice &amp; soft for sensitive teeth &amp; gums, and easy to brush with. I wish you would try them. I also love the fact that they can be recycled.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are very soft.  Our dentist recommends extra soft brushes and gives us one after every checkup.  However, drugstores and the big box stores never seem to have extra soft in any brand.  These have an unusual curved shape that works well.  They look like they&#x27;re dancing in the toothbrush holder!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are the best around!  I will never buy anything different.  Great for the environment and the nylon bristles are ultra soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a super soft toothbrush that&#x27;s not abrasive on my gums and this is it!  So many toothbrushes that are \\&quot;soft\\&quot; start that way, but the bristles quickly harden with use.  These bristles stay soft and they don&#x27;t scratch up my gums.  The arch of the toothbrush also makes brushing easy, especially in the way back.  The price was right and the colors are pretty too!</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes for my sensitive gums.  They work better than any regular toothbrush with their rounded handle to get to back teeth easily.</li>
            <li> I typically use an Oral B brush first thing in the morning, but I brush again after eating and use this brush for it&#x27;s gentle cleaning.  It does not irritate the gums.</li>
            <li> Ultra soft toothbrushes are very hard to find and these have worked great for me.  They&#x27;ve helped my over brushing problem a lot.  And the fact that they&#x27;re made from recycled materials is an added bonus.  It&#x27;s also neat that you can send them back in at no cost so that they can be recycled again!</li>
            <li> The ultra-soft bristles are ultra-non-durable.  At ~$4 per toothbrush, \\&quot;tri-level virgin nylon\\&quot; bristles should last longer than two weeks.  In fairness, I do brush vigorously.  But other brands last remarkably longer.  I will switch to the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soft bristle and see whether the problem is restricted to the ultra-soft design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the toothbrush is great, and the extra $$$ -- quite a markup, even by save-the-earth standards -- is worth it to expand the market for recycled plastic.</li>
            <li> Will purchase these as long as they keep making them.</li>
            <li> Have looked for quite some time for the perfect toothbrush as my teeth endured some trauma years ago.  The Preserve Toothbrush is fabulous, and causes no pain around the gums!!  I highly recommend this toothbrush if you have sensitive gums or teeth.</li>
            <li> I prefer very soft bristles and the ultra soft is perfect for me.  I use sensitive toothpaste/mouth rinse products and this works well as to comfort and general use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least in the stores now, the packaging is different and it now comes in plastic sleeves so you can actually mail your toothbrush back to be recycled (with prepaid shipping for the consumer) but I kind of miss the plastic shells to use as toothbrush cases.  But kind of cool that you can actually have your toothbrush recycled.</li>
            <li> Very good likened them</li>
            <li> The best soft brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> When I first saw these toothbrushes, I thought, What a great idea!  Recycled plastic, teaming up with another Enviro-friendly company (Stoneybrook, to recycle their yogurt containers) and the best thing is that they provide packaging to send back the toothbrushes to be recycled when you are done!  So I thought I&#x27;d try them.  I need soft toothbrushes anyway, and I found these to be very soft, comfortable on my teeth and to hold the brush, and the bristles have held up great over 3months.  Since it is recommended to throw away toothbrushes and use a new one every 4-6 months (because of germs and bristles start to fray), you can feel better about wasting toothbrushes since these can just be recycled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything small we can do to treat the planet better is a great idea and this is a real winner.  Plus, Amazon makes it even easier by saving some \\&quot;green\\&quot; in our wallets, offering lower prices for buying in bulk, and then an extra 15% if you use \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - still using over a year later and I am still happy with these brushes!  I now use the Kids version for my kids and they love them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2 1/16/2011: You can conveniently recycle your old Preserve toothbrushes in the \\&quot;Gimme 5\\&quot; bins at your local Whole Foods!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Other options to recycle your Preserve Toothbrush(from the Preserve Website):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When you buy your next toothbrush, simply use the package it comes in as the return mailer for the toothbrush you&#x27;re ready to retire. The Mail Back Pack is available at Whole Foods, Target and increasingly in many other locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pop it in a Postage Paid Mailer available at Trader Joe&#x27;s and many coops and natural food stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Recycle it in our Preserve Gimme 5 bins (along with all other Preserve products). go to [...]  for a list of locations.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Ultra-soft. Wears out quickly but I&#x27;d rather replace the brush than my gums. It&#x27;s weird that it&#x27;s not easier to find more ultra-soft brushes, they are much better for health than stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> An excellent product ! The design, construction and effectiveness of results,&lt;br /&gt;Is outstanding ! This toothbrush is the best ... Hands down !  Try it... You will love it !</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why, but the ultra soft toothbrushes are extremely hard to find in ANY store.  What&#x27;s up with that?  Oh, well, you can find the ultra soft toothbrushes sometimes, but they either have a child size toothbrush head, or they have some strange circular plastic thingy right in the middle of the toothbrush head?????  What is so difficult about manufacturing an adult sized ultra soft toothbrush?  Just a regular plain ultra soft toothbrush for adults?  I found these toothbrushes on Amazon, and the price is really good, because I saw these in a store somewhere and they were about twice the cost.  These toothbrushes really are ultra soft and work well, but they also are not true adult sized.  The brushing head size seems to be in between the child and adult sizes.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the 6 count of Preserve Toothbrushes twice. They are great for people like me with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are the softest i have ever found.  They feel wonderful with tender gums.  I am totally impressed with these brushes.</li>
            <li> We were looking for extra-soft toothbrushes and had a really hard time finding them in our local grocery and drug stores.  These were a great price and had good reviews, so we decided to take a chance, even though we had never heard of the brand.  So far, so good!  The handle is a little odd at first, but now I love it.  We also like that they are environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> My favorite!! Good for my teeth, and good for the earth!!</li>
            <li> Hey! besides being really soft, and the angle making it easier to reach those pesky teeth, the angle on this brush I noticed keeps your wrist straight no matter which way you hold it while brushing various areas.  I compared it to a normal straight brush (while looking in the mirror) and sure enough you bend your wrist a lot more with conventional straight handled brushes. I have carpal tunnel and sometimes will get tingling while brushing so this should help!</li>
            <li> Perfectly as described. Great quality</li>
            <li> I had been looking for these in stores for a year, perfect for sensitive teeth or small mouths. Excellent product</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used. After using these for a couple of years I used one, supposedly soft, from my dentist. I couldn&#x27;t brush well with it, it was crazy hard. I finally ordered these and am so happy I did. The Ultra Soft is a bit softer than I remembered, but I&#x27;ve gotten used it and can ince again brush comfortably. I now have toothbrushes for a year, so I&#x27;ll never be stuck with the decision of having to run to a health food store or use an uncomfortable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I needed extra soft toothbushes and their impossible to find in any retail store.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this product because I liked how it&#x27;s environmentally sound by being made 100% of recycled yogurt cups and the entire toothbrush and plastic container it comes in can be sent back to the compay to be recycled. Also, the plastic container it comes in can be used for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product because it is well made, the bristles are perfectly extra soft, and I like the unique design where the upper part of the handle is positioned opposite of regular brushes. The angle takes some getting used to, but I realized that I was brushing more thoroughly because of this difference.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this toothbrush to everyone.  I am so impressed with the product that I bought them for all of my family member&#x27;s Christmas stockings and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> I have to use an ultra soft toothbrush and they are hard to find. I was afraid being recycled plastic that the toothbrush would be flimsy but I love them.  I use to be able to find in the store, but now I order on line as can&#x27;t find in store.  I like being able to recycle. Anything I can do for the enviroment.  I also use a sanatizer light for my toothbrushes and most toothbrushes do not work in them because they have the rubber grips on the handle. This has a hard plastic handle and works well in my sanitizor.  I would recommend these toothbrushes to everyone.</li>
            <li> BEST TOOTHBRUSH EVER !!  IT IS VERY SOFT, CLEANS MY TEETH VERY WELL .GOOD FOR MY GUM&#x27;S. WE LOVE IT !! ;o)</li>
            <li> Since buying a Preserve toothbrush at Whole Foods I have been raving about it to anyone who will listen. I bought it because I liked the fact that I could recycle it. But the design of the thing is what has me raving about it.. Who knew that putting a little bend into a toothbrush would make it so much easier to clean all surfaces of your teeth? The dentists who designed it, obviously. The bristles are actually ultra soft too. Good to know I can get them from Amazon; cuz I&#x27;m crazy about Amazon too.</li>
            <li> I touched the bristles of my old toothbrush.  After thouching the soft bristles of my new Preserve Toothbrush, I threw out my old&lt;br /&gt;tooth brush.  The difference in the touch is like night and day.</li>
            <li> Maybe the best toothbrush I have ever used. The curve handle actually is OK. Also company uses recycled products to help with enviromental concerns.</li>
            <li> If you have any gum issue these are the trick.They hold up well and do a really good job&lt;br /&gt;on cleaning your chops.I use these regularly to ease the bleeding issue I sometimes have&lt;br /&gt;with my gums. Dentist approved</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found these toothbrushes.  I could never find one with soft enough bristles in the stores.  These are just right and I love the angle of the handle.  It makes it easy to reach every tooth easily.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best ultra-soft bristled toothbrushes going. (I have to use ultra-soft bristled toothbrushes.) There was another brand I used to get (at shops, not online) that was called Sensodyne, I think, and they were much better. I can&#x27;t seem to find those ones online anywhere, so I tried these Preserve ones, and they are ok, but they go bad quite quickly -- they just don&#x27;t last. So, yeah. Not one of my favorite Amazon purchases. I mean, they&#x27;re fine, and they do the job, but I prefer the other brand.</li>
            <li> In grocery/department/drug stores around here, &#x27;soft&#x27; tooth brushes are really stiff.  These are actually soft, as soft as the ones I get from my dentist.  The curved handle makes reaching parts of my mouth easier.  Add quality construction and environmentally friendly plastics and you&#x27;ve got a real winner.  I plan to make more purchases.</li>
