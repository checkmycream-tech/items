            <li>This deodorant has the best fragrance of any I have tried.</li>
            <li>So if you are one of those no-nonsense, no smell type guys, this antiperspirant is perfect!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is not the best...</li>

            <li>The Axe worked great, and the smell of it is pleasant, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies; best of all he likes it too.</li>
            <li>Good</li>

            <li>This is a nice smelling Deoderant, my friend tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>really do love having him wear this scent!</li>
            <li>The scent isnt too strong and smells great.</li>
            <li>He doesn’t wear a cologne of aftershave of any kind, so any fragrance that uses comes from deodorant.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>it has a minty smell, kind of medicinal.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective antiperspirant/ deodorant that helps with sweat and odor.</li>
            <li>It is an effective product.</li>
            <li>Axe Peace Antiperspirant has a strong and pleasant smell that keeps sweat at bay all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent at keeping me dry all day, and smells really great as well.  </li>
            <li>Some Axe products can smell very strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has to smell OK if you like the scented kind.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the Axe Peace Antiperspirant as much as I liked the scent of Axe Harmony, which had a pleasant scent that reminded of fresh laundry.</li>
            <li>think you&#x27;ll be pleased with this product&#x27;s smell and performance.</li>
            <li>There are many scents of deodorants out there.</li>
            <li>It lasts throughout most days, without having to be reapplied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been trying the deodorant version of this Axe Peace model but this antiperspirant version is so much better than the deodorant version.</li>
            <li>It has a potent scent that I find appealing.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>Axe makes some pretty good products.</li>
            <li>If you can get over the smell, this deodorant/antiperspirant is actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>Many of the products he&#x27;s brought home smell much to strong and irritate my allergies giving me head aches.  </li>
            <li>and it is successful at that too (for a normal work day).</li>
            <li>I like to wear something without it being too strong and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>Yes, for some it seems to be a bit strong, but not to me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too strongly scented, and it works.</li>
            <li>It will keep you dry and fresh for about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good amount of product- 2.7 ounces and seems a good value-</li>
            <li>for light use days&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>just a simple bar!&lt;br /&gt;Works great if you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy&lt;br</li>
            <li>must say that even I enjoy the scent.  </li>
            <li>I could definitely smell it on him, but the odor was pleasant.</li>
            <li>But it is special when I can get a deodorant that makes me want to go on a date with my husband and makes me feel like a teenager again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some kids really go way over the top with Axe body spray</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, in fact, I like the smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells pleasant, and it keeps me dry for</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wifie says the fragrance is TOO mild</li>
            <li>This rather strong aroma comes straight out of the container and works with one&#x27;s natural body oils to become effective.  </li>
            <li>It keeps odors from developing and lasts most of the day, which makes the high price worth it.  </li>
            <li>Its not the overly strong obvious scent that I associate with most AXE products.</li>
            <li>Axe calls it intriguing and it is.</li>
            <li>Personally, I’m not crazy about the Peace fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a lightly-scented deodorant; not overpowering but gives him that freshly showered scent.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking at shopping for a young boy, I think the deodorants are a better choice than the body sprays.</li>
            <li>This antiperspirant has a fresh, herbal ,woody scent.</li>
            <li>This smells nice enough -it&#x27;s masculine but not overly strong.  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong, but just has this &#x60;masculine&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li>He thought he might get some more in the future.</li>
            <li>This product has a great scent and the protection last all day long.</li>
            <li>The first day he wore this, we were in the car for about 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We received both Peace and Harmony for review, and he definitely likes Peace better.  </li>
            <li>ok i have teen boys who i got this product for&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you can, see if you like the smell first, and if you do, I&#x27;d say order it.  </li>
            <li>While that goes away a little too quickly, the antiperspirant is effective at 18.2%.</li>
            <li>The peace scent, lightly woodsy with a bit of spice is unique in that both my 23 year old son and my 65 year old dad like it.</li>
            <li>it compares well in price and effectiveness to other popular brands.  </li>
            <li>it is easy becaue they actually like to use it&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but not great - the price is also kind of high, so for the same cost I&#x27;d rather buy Harmony.</li>
            <li>All in all, I like it and really grew to like it over about one week.</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished on that front.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the past couple weeks and am very pleased by it.</li>
            <li>This lasts me practically the whole day.</li>
            <li>I have a very love/hate relationship with AXE.  </li>
            <li>again not happening so much with this brand</li>
            <li>I really like the Axe line and the Peace Antiperspirant</li>
            <li>So my dad uses the straight deodorant, and my son uses the antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>So an antiperspirant that really works is a benefit to everyone.</li>
            <li>All 3 of my family members tried it - man, woman, 18 year old active teen - and it has worked great for all of us.  </li>
            <li>It is quite refreshing and does not rub off on the clothes much due to the talc content.  </li>
            <li>the product allows for as many applications as other products with comparable packaging.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the scent or not is obviously a matter of personal opinion, and you might want to sniff a few bars in a physical store to figure out what &#x27;flavors&#x27; you like before you place orders, but otherwise I really haven&#x27;t experienced anything with their products that&#x27;s objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said that this product kept him dry throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating it 3 stars because of the extremely strong scent.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms and lasts easily for an entire day.  </li>
            <li>Between lawn mowing, hedge clipping, and raking, my husband was a sore sweaty mess - but he was blissfully dry and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a matter of personal taste, can&#x27;t really rate on that, right?  </li>
            <li>While I typically don&#x27;t like strong scents, the smell didn&#x27;t appeal to me even though it was much milder -</li>
            <li>And unlike other AXE brand items, the fragrance is very mild.  </li>
            <li>The container is wide so it fits the hand comfortably.</li>
            <li>and I think moderation imposes itself a little more naturally with something like this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the scent is too strong or oddly combined.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutral fragrance isn&#x27;t very masculine</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>All do the same thing with more or less effectiveness.</li>
            <li>on easily, no stupid little holes...</li>
            <li>, that doesn&#x27;t seem like something you can/should completely cover yourself with.</li>
            <li>A lot of their products, like their hair pomade and such, work very well.  </li>
            <li>So far no skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li>My husband is sensitive to a lot of antiperspirants but this one doesn&#x27;t bother him.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely high-priced to go along with the sheer amount that they&#x27;re spending on marketing, but the scents are pretty nice, the deodorants work fine, and they don&#x27;t leave any kind of heavy residue that messes up clothes terribly.</li>
            <li>However, it is a little too strong for my personal taste.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this again and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a product for heavy sweaters with strong body odor.</li>
            <li>fragrances which really could be male or female.  </li>
            <li>Of course the main purpose is to keep you dry</li>
            <li>This is a good &amp;#34;entry level&amp;#34; antiperspirant for those days that you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy.  </li>
            <li>My wife complained that it didn&#x27;t smell strong enough.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re going to meet someone you like to swab on a little bit to hide the daily build up of smell and give off that fresh out of the shower scent.  </li>
            <li>particular one is not too overpowering like other name brands on the market</li>
            <li>He is a very heavy sweater, and frequently complains that certain antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for him.  </li>

            <li> They&#x27;re definitely high-priced to go along with the sheer amount that they&#x27;re spending on marketing, but the scents are pretty nice, the deodorants work fine, and they don&#x27;t leave any kind of heavy residue that messes up clothes terribly.</li>
            <li> However, it is a little too strong for my personal taste.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a product for heavy sweaters with strong body odor.</li>
            <li> fragrances which really could be male or female.  </li>
            <li> Of course the main purpose is to keep you dry</li>
            <li> This is a good &amp;#34;entry level&amp;#34; antiperspirant for those days that you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy.  </li>
            <li> My wife complained that it didn&#x27;t smell strong enough.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re going to meet someone you like to swab on a little bit to hide the daily build up of smell and give off that fresh out of the shower scent.  </li>
            <li> particular one is not too overpowering like other name brands on the market</li>
            <li> He is a very heavy sweater, and frequently complains that certain antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for him.  </li>
            <li> major complaint is, like many deodorants this will leave white marks on any dark shirt that you pull over your head unless you are very very careful.</li>
            <li> and my dad is fond of classic, heavy, back to the 70s male scents.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unusual, my son usually likes incense-like oil scents</li>
            <li> thees products usually do not last as long as they should&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can, however, give a rating for the strength and long lasting power of this antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> It claims it lasts for 24 hours, but after an 18 long day and night I did find its strength</li>
            <li> , I have to agree, since I can&#x27;t smell him, even after he&#x27;s done working out in the yard/heat all day long.  </li>
            <li> My son is one of those young men who breaks a sweat bending straws, much less hiking, mowing the lawn and doing other summer things.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of outdoor gardening, lawn care and pet walking daily, and this stands up to the stress and sweat of everyday.</li>

            <li> Axe has a stronger scent than the other Unilever product brands.</li>

            <li> work well for men who need something high powered or if you are sweating or working real hard</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt, it does what a deodorant should do- prevent or significantly lessen bad odor.  </li>
            <li> After using this three days in a row my armpit started to itch a little</li>

            <li> the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rounded lid is a bit lame, though, as it sometimes requires a firm grip to remove the lid without pulling and having it slip through my hand.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I am happy with the performance of my Axe Peace antiperspirant. It smells pleasant, and it keeps me dry for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rounded lid is a bit lame, though, as it sometimes requires a firm grip to remove the lid without pulling and having it slip through my hand.</li>
            <li> Axe Peace Antiperspirant has a strong and pleasant smell that keeps sweat at bay all day.  It is quite refreshing and does not rub off on the clothes much due to the talc content.  Nevertheless, the Axe does not show up when arms are lifted up and nobody would know it was worn, as it cannot be seen.  It contains aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly to obstruct pores in the skin and prevent sweat from leaving the body.  The Axe contains also cyclopentasiloxane (reduces evaporation), dipropylene glycol (perfume solvent), stearyl alcohol (emulsion stabilizer), PPG-14 (polypropylene glycol) butyl ether (reduces skin flaking/restors skin suppleness), hydrogenated castor oil (resists moisture), talc (prevents rashes ), PEG-8 Distearate (helps water to mix with oil and dirt so that they can be rinsed away), BHT/butylated hydroxytoluene/butylhydroxytoluene (prevents oxidation).</li>
            <li> Some Axe products can smell very strong.  This is one of them.  Not a bad smell, in fact, I like the smell.  However, it is a little too strong for my personal taste. Of course, this is a personal opinion and my wife says she likes the smell and strength of the smell.  Without a doubt, it does what a deodorant should do- prevent or significantly lessen bad odor.  It lasts about 12 hours and fades gradually. All in all, I like it and really grew to like it over about one week.</li>
            <li> Lots of things go into judging an anti-perspirant and deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It has to smell OK if you like the scented kind.  This one does that.&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t cause a lot of itching due to some allergy to a chemical it might contain.  No problem with that here.&lt;br /&gt;Of course it has to work in preventing sweatting.  Mission accomplished on that front.&lt;br /&gt;And finally,  if it&#x27;s after lunch and you&#x27;re coming back to work or say 4 o&#x27;clock and you&#x27;re going to meet someone you like to swab on a little bit to hide the daily build up of smell and give off that fresh out of the shower scent.  Axe performs that task with flying colors.&lt;br /&gt;I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with this product&#x27;s smell and performance.</li>
            <li> My husband’s deodorant of choice is Axe. He doesn’t wear a cologne of aftershave of any kind, so any fragrance that uses comes from deodorant. Axe has a stronger scent than the other Unilever product brands. Personally, I’m not crazy about the Peace fragrance. I am not so opposed to it that I won’t let him finish the pack, but I won’t purchase this fragrance.</li>
            <li> The Axe anti-perspirant got a workout this weekend. Between lawn mowing, hedge clipping, and raking, my husband was a sore sweaty mess - but he was blissfully dry and pleasant smelling. The Axe worked great, and the smell of it is pleasant, not overpowering. It&#x27;s definitely a product my husband will buy when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling Deoderant, my friend tried it and loved it. He thought he might get some more in the future. Nice product.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has the best fragrance of any I have tried. It is not too strong, but just has this &#x60;masculine&#x27; smell. Axe calls it intriguing and it is. Of course the main purpose is to keep you dry and it is successful at that too (for a normal work day). It claims it lasts for 24 hours, but after an 18 long day and night I did find its strength fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My major complaint is, like many deodorants this will leave white marks on any dark shirt that you pull over your head unless you are very very careful.</li>
            <li> This is a good &amp;#34;entry level&amp;#34; antiperspirant for those days that you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy.  It does the job well. And unlike other AXE brand items, the fragrance is very mild.  My wife complained that it didn&#x27;t smell strong enough.  So if you are one of those no-nonsense, no smell type guys, this antiperspirant is perfect!  The fragrance is not the best... it&#x27;s one of those neutral &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; fragrances which really could be male or female.  Good if you are the cologne wearing type I suppose and don&#x27;t want conflicting smells going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance not obnoxiously strong&lt;br /&gt;Good for light use days&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easily, no stupid little holes... just a simple bar!&lt;br /&gt;Works great if you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wifie says the fragrance is TOO mild&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t work well for men who need something high powered or if you are sweating or working real hard&lt;br /&gt;Neutral fragrance isn&#x27;t very masculine</li>
            <li> There are many scents of deodorants out there. All do the same thing with more or less effectiveness. But it is special when I can get a deodorant that makes me want to go on a date with my husband and makes me feel like a teenager again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love having him wear this scent! Two thumbs up - from his wife!</li>
            <li> This is a lightly-scented deodorant; not overpowering but gives him that freshly showered scent. It lasts throughout most days, without having to be reapplied. He likes that it glides on like a liquid...and I appreciated that it doesn&#x27;t leave clumpy white crap on his shirts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the Axe Peace Antiperspirant as much as I liked the scent of Axe Harmony, which had a pleasant scent that reminded of fresh laundry. While I typically don&#x27;t like strong scents, the smell didn&#x27;t appeal to me even though it was much milder - it has a minty smell, kind of medicinal.  In terms of performance, it kept my armpits from stinking up my clothes for about 7 hours, not 24 as indicated.  It&#x27;s good but not great - the price is also kind of high, so for the same cost I&#x27;d rather buy Harmony.</li>
            <li> Axe makes some pretty good products. They&#x27;re definitely high-priced to go along with the sheer amount that they&#x27;re spending on marketing, but the scents are pretty nice, the deodorants work fine, and they don&#x27;t leave any kind of heavy residue that messes up clothes terribly. Enjoying the scent or not is obviously a matter of personal opinion, and you might want to sniff a few bars in a physical store to figure out what &#x27;flavors&#x27; you like before you place orders, but otherwise I really haven&#x27;t experienced anything with their products that&#x27;s objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at shopping for a young boy, I think the deodorants are a better choice than the body sprays. Some kids really go way over the top with Axe body spray and I think moderation imposes itself a little more naturally with something like this, that doesn&#x27;t seem like something you can/should completely cover yourself with.</li>
            <li> This product has a great scent and the protection last all day long. I don&#x27;t think the scent is too strong or oddly combined. the product allows for as many applications as other products with comparable packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past couple weeks and am very pleased by it. I&#x27;ve also been trying the deodorant version of this Axe Peace model but this antiperspirant version is so much better than the deodorant version. This lasts me practically the whole day. The scent isnt too strong and smells great. I would definitely buy this again and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant has a fresh, herbal ,woody scent. Its not the overly strong obvious scent that I associate with most AXE products. This is an effective antiperspirant/ deodorant that helps with sweat and odor.</li>
            <li> I have a very love/hate relationship with AXE.  A lot of their products, like their hair pomade and such, work very well.  However, I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  It always is so overpowering with frat boy aroma.  If you can get over the smell, this deodorant/antiperspirant is actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is targeted at men who are actively playing sports or doing manual work. It has a potent scent that I find appealing. While that goes away a little too quickly, the antiperspirant is effective at 18.2%. The container is wide so it fits the hand comfortably. It is a solid which men prefer unless they like an aerosol spray. So far no skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I received this Axe Peace Antiperspirant through the Amazon Vine review program.  My husband tested the product.  He is a very heavy sweater, and frequently complains that certain antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for him.  He said that this product kept him dry throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating it 3 stars because of the extremely strong scent.  The first day he wore this, we were in the car for about 45 minutes.  The smell of it actually made me nauseous, and we had to open all of the windows in the car.  He finished using it up while he was traveling for work, so I didn&#x27;t have to smell it anymore.  Even though the product performed well, we definitely won&#x27;t be buying the Peace scent again.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for my husband who is physically active in his job and needs something that works for hours. I could definitely smell it on him, but the odor was pleasant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant from Axe did the job it was supposed to do, kept my underarms from getting stinky.&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent too.</li>
            <li> This rather strong aroma comes straight out of the container and works with one&#x27;s natural body oils to become effective.  It doesn&#x27;t clump or leave stains on clothing. It does overpower any cologne.  It keeps odors from developing and lasts most of the day, which makes the high price worth it.  This is definitely a product for heavy sweaters with strong body odor.</li>
            <li> My son only likes to use Axe deodorant, some scents he likes, others not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received both Peace and Harmony for review, and he definitely likes Peace better.  He says it works great, I have to agree, since I can&#x27;t smell him, even after he&#x27;s done working out in the yard/heat all day long.  Also keeps him dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that even I enjoy the scent.  The teen is happy, the parents are happy and we&#x27;ll continue to use Axe products because they work great!</li>
            <li> ok i have teen boys who i got this product for&lt;br /&gt;it is a chore at times to remind them to use any underarm product usually&lt;br /&gt;however the AXE brand it is easy becaue they actually like to use it&lt;br /&gt;this particular one is not too overpowering like other name brands on the market&lt;br /&gt;and being on the younger end of the teen spectrum they often forget to close caps&lt;br /&gt;thus thees products usually do not last as long as they should&lt;br /&gt;however again not happening so much with this brand&lt;br /&gt;so anything that they will use is a great product in my book lo</li>
            <li> Axe products are typically great and this Peace Antiperspirant does not disappoint. I like to wear something without it being too strong and this fits the bill.  After using this three days in a row my armpit started to itch a little but I have very sensitive skin. Axe also has a anti-deodorant version of this scent too.</li>
            <li> I personally like the smell of this product.  Yes, for some it seems to be a bit strong, but not to me.  That&#x27;s a matter of personal taste, can&#x27;t really rate on that, right?  I can, however, give a rating for the strength and long lasting power of this antiperspirant.  I am a woman who will use any product that works for me, I don&#x27;t buy into the male/female marketing issues.  I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms and lasts easily for an entire day.  I do a lot of outdoor gardening, lawn care and pet walking daily, and this stands up to the stress and sweat of everyday.</li>
            <li> My teen has used Axe products for several years.  He uses the deodorant and combination body wash/shampoo.  Many of the products he&#x27;s brought home smell much to strong and irritate my allergies giving me head aches.  I requested the Peace scent and gave it the smell test before letting him know I had it.  I love this scent.  It&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies; best of all he likes it too.</li>
            <li> I really like the Axe line and the Peace Antiperspirant hasn&#x27;t let me down.  It&#x27;s excellent at keeping me dry all day, and smells really great as well.  It&#x27;s the perfect combination of practical and smelling good.</li>
            <li> This smells nice enough -it&#x27;s masculine but not overly strong.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate skin or cause itching.  My husband is sensitive to a lot of antiperspirants but this one doesn&#x27;t bother him.  All 3 of my family members tried it - man, woman, 18 year old active teen - and it has worked great for all of us.  It will keep you dry and fresh for about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good amount of product- 2.7 ounces and seems a good value- it compares well in price and effectiveness to other popular brands.  If you can, see if you like the smell first, and if you do, I&#x27;d say order it.  It is an effective product.</li>
            <li> The peace scent, lightly woodsy with a bit of spice is unique in that both my 23 year old son and my 65 year old dad like it. That&#x27;s unusual, my son usually likes incense-like oil scents and my dad is fond of classic, heavy, back to the 70s male scents. So my dad uses the straight deodorant, and my son uses the antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s not too strongly scented, and it works. It really works well. My son is one of those young men who breaks a sweat bending straws, much less hiking, mowing the lawn and doing other summer things. So an antiperspirant that really works is a benefit to everyone.</li>
