    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a great find for the price!  </li>
            <li>These are great to make the caviar nail art manicure!</li>
            <li>excellent service, product charm me</li>
            <li>was happy with the product</li>
            <li>Good sized bottles.</li>
            <li>But this works great for doing stud designs where you don&#x27;t use as many beads.</li>
            <li>So very adorable.</li>
            <li>I sure wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this &amp;#34;12 Colors Attractive Lady Bead Bottles&amp;#34; by 350buy.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s assuming you don&#x27;t use very many beads.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>And they are just AMAZING</li>
            <li>honestly i haven&#x27;t use these yet.</li>
            <li>Nice colors just wish there was more :)</li>
            <li>Just wish they packaged it better</li>
            <li>and some of them aren&#x27;t even filled all the way!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute for gifts for anyone that&#x27;s loves to play with the nails</li>
            <li>The bottles are super cute them selves.</li>
            <li>Need top coat, but top coat takes color off leaving them all to be silver bead and they come off super quickly .</li>
            <li>My colors weren&#x27;t the same as pictured, but are bright and lovely.</li>
            <li>The colors are great, and the miniature bottles can be used for future craft projects.</li>
            <li>You can maybe get 2 uses out of 1 color if you use them lightly.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li>These are a great starter kit or to get color ideas, but not much to work with.</li>
            <li>These make for a cute and unusual design on nails.</li>
            <li>Thought the bottles would be bigger.. but still good.</li>
            <li>Item arrived rather quickly considering it was from China.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still pleased with it, especially for the price! :)</li>
            <li>The colours are very shiny and metallic and stay looking good under a coat of clear polish.</li>
            <li>The beads are very pretty colors</li>
            <li>Fun to play with</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how anyone could complete any type of project more than once...</li>
            <li>It is true that THESE BEADS ARE VERY VERY TINY, but in my opinion they are even better than the bigger ones because you can feet more and it looks nicer!</li>
            <li>Great variety of color choices and just enough product to satisfy my need for something different on my finger nails</li>
            <li>You get 12 small vials of 12 very nice colours.</li>
            <li>I expected more than what i got!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I added a photo of the beads in comparison to a quarter so future buyers will be more prepared.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t only adorable and tiny, this product contains a plentiful amount of  micro marbles, a lot of colors to choose from, and an easy removable cap.</li>
            <li>This is meant more for doing studded designs (where you apply individual beads to make a pattern) rather than covering a whole nail in beads for the caviar manicure.</li>
            <li>Next time, I think it would be great to put how much beads (oz) come in a tiny jar so people don&#x27;t get too surprised by what comes in the mail!</li>
            <li>absolutely love caviar beads, these are just like pictured, although my clear coat slightly turned some of the colors, they actually made them look even better, thank you!</li>
            <li>they make these bottles look huge in the picture compared to what you get they are TINY</li>
            <li>I do not plan on using them to cover my whole name but rather to add some depth and detail to my nail design.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased that my item came quicker than expected!  </li>
            <li>Ok for decorating, but you won&#x27;t be doing all your nails with these, the vials are half the size of a AAA battery.</li>
            <li>Super cute, but not enough per little bottle.</li>
            <li>Also, I applied a top coat over it and the color of the beads faded, so in the end they were little silver balls.</li>
            <li>These colorful beads are great, but the bottles they come in are way too small :/</li>
            <li>they agreed to send me a new package that I would receive within 15 days.</li>
            <li>They are cute if you like small novelty items but this is all that this is.</li>
            <li>are really small but product was ok</li>
            <li>this item took nearly two months for me to receive.</li>
            <li>Considering how far they had to travel - I&#x27;m surprised more didn&#x27;t get broken.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to receive these in just nine days (China to Virginia) as I expected it to take much longer.</li>
            <li>Had the most frustrating time opening the package with the micro marbles and glass EVERYWHERE and savaging what I could save..</li>
            <li>but I must mention that three of the colors sent containing half the product, pretty colors ..</li>
            <li>The size of the vials was about what I expected after reading other reviews, and for my purposes is adequate.</li>
            <li>They fell off within days and its super hard to move around.</li>
            <li>Came in a little package and was very neatly in plastic wrap.  </li>
            <li>lots of pretty colors but very little in the bottles</li>

            <li> this way they Stay seperated and less likely to spill all over the place</li>
            <li> These are just the teeny tiny little jars.</li>
            <li> but you hardly get enough beads to do even 2 nails if you wanted to use the same color.</li>
            <li> I will just go buy a kit next time because I feel I wasted my 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> absolutely not worth waiting so long for.</li>
            <li> It came in a thin layer of bubble wrap and when it came in the mail, one of the side seams were open, and 4 of the 12 bottles were shattered and glass was mixed in with the micro marbles...</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> I mean so TINY</li>
            <li> When I recieved the package at least half of the glass bottles were shattered inside the envelope, and beads were spilling everywhere.</li>
            <li> Bottles are small, which I didnt expect because of the picture.</li>
            <li> Yes, the vials are small but what do you expect for a $1.99 and for a $1.99 you get a lot of colour selection.</li>
            <li> The beads are tremendously small and one of my beads spilled and one broke.  </li>
            <li> Really small bottles though.</li>
            <li> That plus the fact that my green bead bottle had broken and all the beads were floating around inside the plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> The quantity of beads you get with these teensy bottles---and I&#x27;m serious; they&#x27;re like DOLL HOUSE MINATURE BOTTLES</li>
            <li> The only thing I was disappointed with was the packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid of the mess i will make when i do use them.</li>
            <li> Had to chase and cleanup about a zillion of these itty bitty things because the package was leaking out the ones that had been broken.</li>
            <li> Got in the mail and all the bottles was broken.</li>
            <li> I was literally SHOCKED at how MICROSCOPIC these bottles were.  </li>
            <li> Sorely disappointed with this purchase.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> the colors don´t last</li>
            <li> Item arrived rather quickly considering it was from China. These are a great starter kit or to get color ideas, but not much to work with. Ok for decorating, but you won&#x27;t be doing all your nails with these, the vials are half the size of a AAA battery.</li>
            <li> I was expecting these to be tiny...but they were smaller than anticipated!  I do not plan on using them to cover my whole name but rather to add some depth and detail to my nail design.  I like the variety of colors and I&#x27;m pleased that my item came quicker than expected!  This is a great find for the price!  Next time, I think it would be great to put how much beads (oz) come in a tiny jar so people don&#x27;t get too surprised by what comes in the mail!</li>
            <li> Good sized bottles. Were just what I needed. Didn&#x27;t take as long to get as I thought. 2 of the bottles were destroyed in transit. Had to chase and cleanup about a zillion of these itty bitty things because the package was leaking out the ones that had been broken. Considering how far they had to travel - I&#x27;m surprised more didn&#x27;t get broken. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted!! I was looking for them EVERYWHERE at stores did not find them so I decided to order these for now. And they are just AMAZING</li>
            <li> Super cute, but not enough per little bottle. Also, I applied a top coat over it and the color of the beads faded, so in the end they were little silver balls. They fell off within days and its super hard to move around. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product..</li>
            <li> These make for a cute and unusual design on nails.</li>
            <li> tiny but thats what you get for that price.  Came in a little package and was very neatly in plastic wrap.  The bottles are super cute them selves.</li>
            <li> lots of pretty colors but very little in the bottles and they don&#x27;t stick like the ones you get with the nail art kits. no matter what we tried we couldn&#x27;t get them to work</li>
            <li> These are great to make the caviar nail art manicure! It is true that THESE BEADS ARE VERY VERY TINY, but in my opinion they are even better than the bigger ones because you can feet more and it looks nicer!</li>
            <li> Nice colors just wish there was more :)</li>
            <li> When I recieved the package at least half of the glass bottles were shattered inside the envelope, and beads were spilling everywhere. Bottles are small, which I didnt expect because of the picture. I will just go buy a kit next time because I feel I wasted my 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> excellent service, product charm me but I must mention that three of the colors sent containing half the product, pretty colors ..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! The colors are great, and the miniature bottles can be used for future craft projects. The only thing I was disappointed with was the packaging. It came in a thin layer of bubble wrap and when it came in the mail, one of the side seams were open, and 4 of the 12 bottles were shattered and glass was mixed in with the micro marbles... Had the most frustrating time opening the package with the micro marbles and glass EVERYWHERE and savaging what I could save.. Not fun. Just wish they packaged it better especially cause it is glass. But I&#x27;m still pleased with it, especially for the price! :)</li>
            <li> they make these bottles look huge in the picture compared to what you get they are TINY and when I say TINY I mean so TINY</li>
            <li> Thought the bottles would be bigger.. but still good.</li>
            <li> You get 12 small vials of 12 very nice colours. Yes, the vials are small but what do you expect for a $1.99 and for a $1.99 you get a lot of colour selection. This is meant more for doing studded designs (where you apply individual beads to make a pattern) rather than covering a whole nail in beads for the caviar manicure. You&#x27;d probably need to buy something like the Martha Stewart micro beads in bigger bottles (also more expensive) for that. But this works great for doing stud designs where you don&#x27;t use as many beads. You can use these beads for the caviar manicure but you will run out of them a lot quicker. The colours are very shiny and metallic and stay looking good under a coat of clear polish.</li>
            <li> this item took nearly two months for me to receive. I ordered it on march 24th and when the may 3rd deadline of shipping came I emailed the seller. they agreed to send me a new package that I would receive within 15 days. which I received today may 17th. now I understand how inexpensive the product was and the picture clearly shows small vials of the beads but MY GOSH I didn&#x27;t know how tiny they would be! they&#x27;re barely as tall as a quarter is wide! and some of them aren&#x27;t even filled all the way! absolutely not worth waiting so long for.</li>
            <li> Great variety of color choices and just enough product to satisfy my need for something different on my finger nails</li>
            <li> Got in the mail and all the bottles was broken. Glass was all over the place.</li>
            <li> These colorful beads are great, but the bottles they come in are way too small :/ I expected more than what i got! I also saw the same bottles at the dollar store!</li>
            <li> Need top coat, but top coat takes color off leaving them all to be silver bead and they come off super quickly . Fun to play with</li>
            <li> Were as advertised, the only reason I gave 4 stars was because one came broke in the package.</li>
            <li> I brought the wheel before and all of my colors mixed together..this way they Stay seperated and less likely to spill all over the place</li>
            <li> The beads are tremendously small and one of my beads spilled and one broke.  I wasn&#x27;t intending for a caviar nails just studded so i give it 5 stars for designs</li>
            <li> BOTTLES ARE SO SMALL THAT YOU CANNOT COMPLETE BOTH HANDS WITH ONE COLOR!!!!</li>
            <li> These are just the teeny tiny little jars. So very adorable. Plenty of beads. It&#x27;s really cute for gifts for anyone that&#x27;s loves to play with the nails</li>
            <li> I ordered this item 2 weeks ago and it just came in the mail today. I was very disappointed at my purchase. The \\&quot;jars\\&quot; are as big as a charm for a necklace I kid you not. You can maybe get 2 uses out of 1 color if you use them lightly. The beads are very pretty colors but you hardly get enough beads to do even 2 nails if you wanted to use the same color. I won&#x27;t be buying these again. They are cute if you like small novelty items but this is all that this is. BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> I sure wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this &amp;#34;12 Colors Attractive Lady Bead Bottles&amp;#34; by 350buy.  I was literally SHOCKED at how MICROSCOPIC these bottles were.  That plus the fact that my green bead bottle had broken and all the beads were floating around inside the plastic bag.  The quantity of beads you get with these teensy bottles---and I&#x27;m serious; they&#x27;re like DOLL HOUSE MINATURE BOTTLES---I don&#x27;t see how anyone could complete any type of project more than once... and that&#x27;s assuming you don&#x27;t use very many beads.  Sorely disappointed with this purchase.  Like someone else said, BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> honestly i haven&#x27;t use these yet. I&#x27;ll update when i do. Really small bottles though. I&#x27;m afraid of the mess i will make when i do use them.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t only adorable and tiny, this product contains a plentiful amount of  micro marbles, a lot of colors to choose from, and an easy removable cap.</li>
            <li> was happy with the product it just looks a lot bigger in the picture bottle are really small but product was ok</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to receive these in just nine days (China to Virginia) as I expected it to take much longer. The size of the vials was about what I expected after reading other reviews, and for my purposes is adequate. My colors weren&#x27;t the same as pictured, but are bright and lovely. I added a photo of the beads in comparison to a quarter so future buyers will be more prepared.</li>
            <li> these are a must have for nails. absolutely love caviar beads, these are just like pictured, although my clear coat slightly turned some of the colors, they actually made them look even better, thank you!</li>
