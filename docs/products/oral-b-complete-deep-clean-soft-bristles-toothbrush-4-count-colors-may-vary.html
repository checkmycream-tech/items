            <li>These are obviously not Oral-B&#x27;s best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use them, but the problem is that there just aren&#x27;t that many bristles.  </li>
            <li>Will be getting more soon.good deal.</li>

            <li>Ok their tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE BUYING ONLINE</li>
            <li>Good items for the right price</li>
            <li>But the toothbrush itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I go through a lot of toothbrushes, as my braces tear them up, but these hold up great and clean my teeth really well.</li>
            <li>I like a soft brush and these work great for me.</li>
            <li>The best part of this deal is getting it every three months like clockwork so that the old ones can be replaced with new ones that do a much better job on cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>Reliable, long-lasting, easy on the enamel.</li>
            <li>Nothing will take the place of good dental floss, but these are a nice component to my daily dental hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>Soft means soft, it cleans great and, the colors are bright.</li>
            <li>These are not the top of the line in tooth care, however for how long the are used, these do a great job.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Got a great price and always can use extra.</li>
            <li>Nice price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although soft bristled, these toothbrushes are well-made and keep their head shape after a good amount of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>they want to keep clean.</li>
            <li>And I have to say, these really clean well.</li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>Nice, soft toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with the quality and the price and will only look to switch if these are no longer available.</li>
            <li>they are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles are nice on the teeth and gums, not causing your gums to recede.</li>
            <li>Super value for $.</li>
            <li>I can brush my teeth all right, but I hope they change the design soon, because these toothbrushes fall apart pretty easily</li>
            <li>Nice to have a new toothbrush ready when I need it.</li>
            <li>I would not call the head on these soft or &amp;#34;compact,&amp;#34; but they&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li>Packages may say soft but their brushes are more soft-medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bit hard still good!</li>
            <li>But at about $1.50 each brush, it&#x27;s easy to replace them with new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They clean very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried some more expensive brushes over the last year and the Oral-B offer better value than most and have given me good service.</li>
            <li>GENTLE BUT CLEAN</li>
            <li>My biggest issue with toothbrushes is typically that they lack good grip.</li>
            <li>and I like them very much.</li>
            <li>So when I&#x27;m brushing my back molars, the toothbrush hits my top molars.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes; replace them regularly.</li>
            <li>and they are very soft and safe to use when you brush your gum and sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>The material is like almost any other brush on the market, and even has the nice rubber handle for grip.</li>
            <li>Have used these in the past and they are good.</li>
            <li>Oral B has always been a very decent brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I find it scratches my gums a bit much.</li>
            <li>So, its a tooth brush... how much is there to review and discuss.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>I go through toothbrushes much faster with my braces.</li>
            <li>Not the ones I purchased before but are very close.</li>
            <li>what else can I really say?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think that they are the nicest toothbrushes either, but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Set provides one each for the whole family.</li>
            <li>The title description of this product is very misleading/false advertising.  </li>
            <li>It does a very thorough job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Really gets teeth and mouth</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERLY.....</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>I suggest to get the SOFT one first and then get the medium.</li>
            <li>The array of bristles are good for reaching difficult place in the mouth and keeping that sparkling smile.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, and yet it feels like they&#x27;re doing a very thorough job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>But I gave the least offensive color a try---and to my surprise, I rather liked it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price is good, and product last at least 4 Months, instead of normal 6 Months</li>
            <li>Durable, and the brushes come in lively colors.</li>
            <li>Plus, they&#x27;re bright neon colors, like florescent green, pink, orange, and turquoise.</li>
            <li>Brushes are a little too soft but it will work fine.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re too soft to just use it as a brush tongue.</li>
            <li>These brushes are truly soft.  </li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive teeth and gum problems like I do, this product is not for you.  </li>
            <li>soft bristles, as recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li>The Oral-B has a really wide use of rubbery grip that pretty much allows a solid hold no matter how you brush.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular Oral-B design in the future.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t open super wide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been testing various toothbrushes as my gums and teeth lately have become more sensitive.</li>
            <li>These soft bristles are especially recommend for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>toothbrush might soft, but it is definitely not 100% soft bristles toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Both the soft and medium Oral-B work quite well, soft enough not to produce any irritation.</li>
            <li>I have several soft bristles toothbrush</li>
            <li>When I first received these, I was a little upset, because they aren&#x27;t the same as my old Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have two natural bristle brushes, a Colgate one, a different Oral B, a generic one my dentist gave me...and this.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing various toothbrushes as my gums and teeth lately have become more sensitive.</li>
            <li> These soft bristles are especially recommend for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> toothbrush might soft, but it is definitely not 100% soft bristles toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Both the soft and medium Oral-B work quite well, soft enough not to produce any irritation.</li>
            <li> I have several soft bristles toothbrush</li>
            <li> When I first received these, I was a little upset, because they aren&#x27;t the same as my old Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have two natural bristle brushes, a Colgate one, a different Oral B, a generic one my dentist gave me...and this.</li>
            <li> and you can use a new toothbrush everyday</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t last very long at this rate.</li>
            <li> By any means, this product is nothing close to previous soft bristles toothbrush that I have.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a minor problem, and one that I&#x27;m used</li>
            <li> I am using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is not soft bristles toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They also seem to last longer than other brushes I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Have not started using，Should be looked at, toothbrushes little big, I prefer the smaller brush head。If</li>
            <li> FYI, it is designed a little big.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, haven&#x27;t used to brush my teeth yet</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tooth brush and did the job as expected.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to get used to them, due to the placement of high/low rows of bristles, but once I got the knack of it, I like the way my teeth and gums feel after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy any other brand because it works so well.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this tooth brush is how wide the bristle pattern is.</li>
            <li> Yup these are the ones i can use to get back behind my last tooth and side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I do have a little trouble with the toothbrush bumping against my teeth, because my mouth is smaller than average</li>
            <li> Not exactly my bathroom&#x27;s color scheme!</li>
            <li> These were skimpier than I expected, the heads and bristles weren&#x27;t comparable to the other Oral B brushes I usually use.</li>
            <li> The handle is slightly curved, and it has a textured rubbery grip, plus a thumb-rest, so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my grasp while I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li> , I notice much less stuff stuck between teeth needing to be flossed/scraped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this style for quite some time now because it is a little wider than the previouse style</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product through Amazon due to the cost, which was less than Walmart&#x27;s price.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately every time I brush my teeth, the toothbrush loses one or two bristles.</li>
            <li> (Why, oh why, don&#x27;t they make designer colors, like lavender, purple, or sage green?)</li>
            <li> From my wanderings, it&#x27;s actually difficult to find soft bristle toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Brush heads are too narrow for my liking.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh.</li>
            <li> you want a small brush, this is not for you</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, a little softer than what I can get in the store and the brisles come out one at a time after a few uses of brush, about every third day another one comes out.  </li>
            <li> so i replace toothbrushes often to minimize gum scrapes which are slow to heal.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I take a 10x magnifier and look and, after using this one</li>
            <li> however, the package had broken.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m afraid to use them as they were scattered throughout the box.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A bit hard still good!</li>
            <li> I would not call the head on these soft or &amp;#34;compact,&amp;#34; but they&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, haven&#x27;t used to brush my teeth yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> When I first received these, I was a little upset, because they aren&#x27;t the same as my old Oral B toothbrush. Plus, they&#x27;re bright neon colors, like florescent green, pink, orange, and turquoise. Not exactly my bathroom&#x27;s color scheme! But I gave the least offensive color a try---and to my surprise, I rather liked it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a pack of four toothbrushes. The bristles are soft, and yet it feels like they&#x27;re doing a very thorough job of cleaning my teeth. The handle is slightly curved, and it has a textured rubbery grip, plus a thumb-rest, so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my grasp while I&#x27;m brushing. I do have a little trouble with the toothbrush bumping against my teeth, because my mouth is smaller than average and I can&#x27;t open super wide. So when I&#x27;m brushing my back molars, the toothbrush hits my top molars. But it&#x27;s a minor problem, and one that I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this toothbrush. The colors are hideous!  (Why, oh why, don&#x27;t they make designer colors, like lavender, purple, or sage green?) But the toothbrush itself is pretty good. Oral B has always been a very decent brand. Four stars and recommended to anyone with teeth they want to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes and a great price</li>
            <li> These are great, two packs a week and you can use a new toothbrush everyday</li>
            <li> Received as scheduled. Bought to keep on shelf. Have not opened but expect them to be usable as advertised.</li>
            <li> Oral-B is always a good choice.</li>
            <li> Good items for the right price</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrushes.  Work well.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase.  Like oral b . Great value.</li>
            <li> Good prices and good quality. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Oral B toothbrushes are the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Good soft bristles, that really get to the gum line, where that awful plaque likes to take hold.  Took me a while to get used to them, due to the placement of high/low rows of bristles, but once I got the knack of it, I like the way my teeth and gums feel after brushing.  Nothing will take the place of good dental floss, but these are a nice component to my daily dental hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Brushes are a little too soft but it will work fine.</li>
            <li> The heads are very big for me and I find it scratches my gums a bit much. But they&#x27;re too soft to just use it as a brush tongue.</li>
            <li> So, its a tooth brush... how much is there to review and discuss. The best part of this deal is getting it every three months like clockwork so that the old ones can be replaced with new ones that do a much better job on cleaning teeth. These are not the top of the line in tooth care, however for how long the are used, these do a great job. The material is like almost any other brush on the market, and even has the nice rubber handle for grip. The array of bristles are good for reaching difficult place in the mouth and keeping that sparkling smile. I have been getting these for over a year now and I am very satisfied with the quality and the price and will only look to switch if these are no longer available.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush... My dentist always gives me an Oral B when I see him every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush, excellent if you are having gum issues</li>
            <li> These brushes are truly soft.  From my wanderings, it&#x27;s actually difficult to find soft bristle toothbrushes.  Packages may say soft but their brushes are more soft-medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although soft bristled, these toothbrushes are well-made and keep their head shape after a good amount of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying these teeth cleaners again.</li>
            <li> My 3rd purchase! will be back! Super value for $. Keep it up! Amazon.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a bit too big.  Otherwise, a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> good product, ok price</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They clean very well.  They also seem to last longer than other brushes I have tried.  These will be brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are too narrow for my liking.</li>
            <li> Great if you wear braces. I go through toothbrushes much faster with my braces. Nice to have a new toothbrush ready when I need it. Sturdy product.</li>
            <li> they are nice and soft. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! I will order again...</li>
            <li> perfect quality and perfect performance. best value for money</li>
            <li> Works fine. Not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for a long time. I would say for a decade. I tried various types and brands, but this was the one I stick to for a while. I suggest to get the SOFT one first and then get the medium. ORAL-B always made good brushes. Consistently good quality.</li>
            <li> This is the brand that my dental hygienist gives me after a tooth cleaning. Reliable, long-lasting, easy on the enamel.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good brushes but they tend to flay really quick.</li>
            <li> Price is good, and product last at least 4 Months, instead of normal 6 Months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B for many years because they make a nice product. I&#x27;ve been using this style for quite some time now because it is a little wider than the previouse style I used.&lt;br /&gt;I like to change out my toothbrush often, but if I forget to get some on order, there&#x27;s no worries. Even if you&#x27;re someone who gets attached to their toothbrush, it&#x27;s a brush that will last.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this tooth brush is how wide the bristle pattern is. Other than that I love it. Soft means soft, it cleans great and, the colors are bright.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes!  These are basically the same brushes that your dentist gives after an appointment. The soft bristles are nice on the teeth and gums, not causing your gums to recede. These soft bristles are especially recommend for people with sensitive teeth. Durable, and the brushes come in lively colors. Good brushes!</li>
            <li> Not the ones I purchased before but are very close. I have always bought Oral B since my dentist gave me a sample way back when. They are excellent toothbrushes and I would use nothing else.</li>
            <li> what else can I really say? I don&#x27;t really think that they are the nicest toothbrushes either, but they get the job done.  That, and I think I got what I payed for.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price</li>
            <li> My biggest issue with toothbrushes is typically that they lack good grip. The Oral-B has a really wide use of rubbery grip that pretty much allows a solid hold no matter how you brush. Until they stop making these, I won&#x27;t be using anything else.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and good quality! Set provides one each for the whole family. We buy this set every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping - a pleasure</li>
            <li> These are obviously not Oral-B&#x27;s best.  I&#x27;ll use them, but the problem is that there just aren&#x27;t that many bristles.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular Oral-B design in the future.</li>
            <li> According to my dentist I need to change my toothbrush every couple of months, so having a multipackage works for me.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best toothbrushes on the market.  I&#x27;ve tried perhaps a dozen different kinds some costing $5.25 each.</li>
            <li> Got to keep&#x27;em pearly white!!</li>
            <li> Have not started using，Should be looked at, toothbrushes little big, I prefer the smaller brush head。If you want a small brush, this is not for you</li>
            <li> I have tried a CVS knock off of this tooth brush. Biggest Mistake of my life! The CVS brand cut up my gums! I will never cheat on you again Oral B!</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes; replace them regularly.</li>
            <li> The title description of this product is very misleading/false advertising.  This is not soft bristles toothbrush.  If you have a sensitive teeth and gum problems like I do, this product is not for you.  I have several soft bristles toothbrush and they are very soft and safe to use when you brush your gum and sensitive teeth.  By any means, this product is nothing close to previous soft bristles toothbrush that I have.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush might soft, but it is definitely not 100% soft bristles toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can brush my teeth all right, but I hope they change the design soon, because these toothbrushes fall apart pretty easily and I don&#x27;t like having bristles in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I think oral B makes some of the best dental products.  This is a good price for 4 of their brushes.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  It does a very thorough job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Nice size toothbrush. The handle is easy to grip, nice feeling bristles and quality seems to be good.</li>
            <li> I go through a lot of toothbrushes, as my braces tear them up, but these hold up great and clean my teeth really well. Love them and the 4-pack is a great deal</li>
            <li> Nice, soft toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Will be getting more soon.good deal.</li>
            <li> OK, they weren&#x27;t kidding. I have several different toothbrushes in my bathroom. I have two natural bristle brushes, a Colgate one, a different Oral B, a generic one my dentist gave me...and this. I alternate them and use different ones with different toothpastes. And I have to say, these really clean well. I mean, I take a 10x magnifier and look and, after using this one, I notice much less stuff stuck between teeth needing to be flossed/scraped. (I brush, floss, brush). These are great.</li>
            <li> showed up in timely manner. however, the package had broken. now I&#x27;m afraid to use them as they were scattered throughout the box.</li>
            <li> Yup these are the ones i can use to get back behind my last tooth and side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tooth brush and did the job as expected.</li>
            <li> They arrived, they work.</li>
            <li> Just replacement toothbrushes just like the ones I use.</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  Have used these in the past and they are good.</li>
            <li> We have been using this kind of toothbrush for many years.  Really gets teeth and mouth clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing various toothbrushes as my gums and teeth lately have become more sensitive. Both the soft and medium Oral-B work quite well, soft enough not to produce any irritation. The bristles stay intact and hold their effectiveness for about a month. But at about $1.50 each brush, it&#x27;s easy to replace them with new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried some more expensive brushes over the last year and the Oral-B offer better value than most and have given me good service. But with their slim handles, they don&#x27;t quite give my fingers the grip I like in the morning.</li>
            <li> I thought these had the tongue scrapper on the back. They don&#x27;t, otherwise Oral-B is always a good bet.</li>
            <li> FYI, it is designed a little big. But it works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, a little softer than what I can get in the store and the brisles come out one at a time after a few uses of brush, about every third day another one comes out.  These won&#x27;t last very long at this rate.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothbrush for myself and family. Don&#x27;t buy any other brand because it works so well.</li>
            <li> simply good price for good product</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product through Amazon due to the cost, which was less than Walmart&#x27;s price.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately every time I brush my teeth, the toothbrush loses one or two bristles. Then I&#x27;m trying to&lt;br /&gt;remove the bristles from my mouth while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth. Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Oral-B is always the best tooth brush.</li>
            <li> great toothbrushes at a great price.</li>
            <li> I like a soft brush and these work great for me.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING NOTHING BUT ORAL B FOR YEARS, POWER &amp; MANUAL BRUSHES WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> soft bristles, as recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li> good price.  great brushes.  like having several in one package.  i am diabetic so i replace toothbrushes often to minimize gum scrapes which are slow to heal.  these are very nice.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE MY FAVORITE. GENTLE BUT CLEAN WELL AND HAVE A NON-STAB YOURSELF IN THE GUMS GRIP!!</li>
            <li> Ok their tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Got a great price and always can use extra. Tried the generic ones and they and after one use bristles are falling out.</li>
            <li> Nice price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These brushes work about one time; then you might as well toss them.  I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> I LOVE BUYING ONLINE THIS FOUR PACK OF TOOTHBUSHES WAS A AWESOME PRICE. FAST DELIVERLY.....</li>
            <li> This is very good quality toothbrushes and I like them very much.</li>
            <li> Meh. These were skimpier than I expected, the heads and bristles weren&#x27;t comparable to the other Oral B brushes I usually use.</li>
            <li> Second purchase for these toothbrushes. They are a great buy and work well.</li>
            <li> oral b a name I&#x27;ve trusted since 1980</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
