            <li>and this is the first cleanser I have ever bought again and again.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I love Cellex C products overall.  </li>
            <li>I have difficult skin; a delightful blend of acne and wrinkles, etc.  </li>
            <li>Good for normal to slightly oily skin.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily, foams lightly and generally I use it every day, so obviously I am a fan.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh and leaves my skin soft and without redness.</li>

            <li>It seems to work and has high ratings.  </li>
            <li>This is the only cleanser that really removes all my make-up in the first cleansing.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this years ago for my daughter who has extremely sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>So overall this is just a good face cleanser and a little goes a long way</li>

            <li>so far ever going from drugstore brands to shiseido etc.</li>
            <li>My skin can become sensitive since I use glycolic acid on it.</li>
            <li>I think face wash is very subjective, and highly personal choice.  </li>

            <li>It worked well, and I completely used the entire bottle.  </li>
            <li>I try other cleansers (some more expensive and some less expensive) but Cellex-C is by far the best.  </li>

            <li> I between using my obagi products, I use this product. This product is very gentle on the skin and it smells great! I will continue to order from this company and use the product.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for years. it&#x27;s extremely gentle (just like the name implies! sensitive skin rejoice.), removes dirt/oil like no other i have tried &amp; has a nice neutral scent. there is not one thing i dislike about it except well, it is a bit pricy. but i have to give compliments to this merchant for offering the best price i&#x27;ve found taking into consideration i also got free shipping, it got shipped to hawaii FAST, the package arrived undamaged/completely intact (really good for that kind of distance), &amp; it performs just like it should! so i&#x27;m a happy customer, will buy again &amp; would not hesitate to recommend this to you. a great buy!</li>
            <li> I have been using Cellex-C for 2 years and have found it to work best on my problem, break out skin. Cleanses the skin better than any other product I have tried.   Marie</li>
            <li> Second bottle and really is gentle yet well cleansing. I recommend using something else to remove eye make up and leaving this to remove the residue. I think it&#x27;s my favorite cleanser so far ever going from drugstore brands to shiseido etc. And has that cucumber smell that i find refreshing. It&#x27;s brightened up my face and doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. I say it&#x27;s worth the try</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love that it is one of the only cleansers that will not leave makeup residue on the wash cloth and yet is very gentle and PH balanced.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial cleanser for oily skin.  gentle, no fragrance, from a wonderful line of organic skin products.</li>
            <li> I used this and have used many face cleaning products and this is the first cleanser I have ever bought again and again.&lt;br /&gt;You can even wash your eyelashes with this it is so gentle and mild. Gets rid of Bacteria on eyelashes. Face feels clean and fresh, never dry.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this once, you will never use another face cleanser aagin.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fresh and leaves you soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since it is a Cellex-C product. The Serum I am using works so well so I wanted to gradually change my skin care routine to Cellex-C line. This foam cleanser does not lather up at all, and does not feel like it cleaned my face. I wanted to know if it was a problem with the one I used so I sent it back to exchange for another one but they gave me a refund instead. If you are looking for a product that lathers up real well, try Chanel&#x27;s cleanser, it&#x27;s only $45 dollars and it lasts at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have !! Helps with acne and wrinkles I look like I&#x27;m 22 but I&#x27;m 32 shhhh... Lol I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li> I love Cellex C products overall.  They are all very light feeling and are made with great products.  This does smell a little weird for me.  I like the results though.</li>
            <li> The cucumber scent alone is enough to sell this cleanser, but it also does an excellent job of cleaning.  Up there with the best.</li>
            <li> This is my Go-To cleanser.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I try other cleansers (some more expensive and some less expensive) but Cellex-C is by far the best.  I even give it as gifts and stocking-stuffers!!!</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser with my Clairsonic. Its really gentle and leaves a nice clean feeling on my face.  It has a nice very lite fragrance that&#x27;s not strong at all.  I hate heavy perfume face cleaners, especially before bedtime.  I originally purchased this years ago for my daughter who has extremely sensitive and dry skin.  Strong cleaners would leave her face itchy and irritated.  She liked this cleanser so well I decided to start using it myself and I have oily skin and it works great with me as well.  So overall this is just a good face cleanser and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Have used this for years....very good for my skin, mild and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> My skin can become sensitive since I use glycolic acid on it. This cleanser cleans so well yet it does not strip your skin. I already ordered it again.</li>
            <li> Good for normal to slightly oily skin. My skin feels very refreshed and smooth after using this product.  If you have combination skin this might dry out the dry areas a little too much.</li>
            <li> great product, great delivery</li>
            <li> I have already reviewed this product and will keep using this product as it gives a clean feeling to your face when used every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Service is good &amp; reliable from the seller too!</li>
            <li> I have been super happy with this product. It smells fresh and leaves my skin soft and without redness. It is wonderful</li>
            <li> It seems to work and has high ratings.  It removes makeup and dirt well but I just don&#x27;t like its smell.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get too excited about the cleanser.  I&#x27;m male, and this seems like it was designed for women.  It worked well, and I completely used the entire bottle.  I think face wash is very subjective, and highly personal choice.  This may be perfect for some people, it just didn&#x27;t make my \\&quot;must have\\&quot; list.</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser that really removes all my make-up in the first cleansing.</li>
            <li> When in France I went to a pharmacy and they recommended this for my child. It really works and helps keep acne away. It is also mild to the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this ever since my dermatologist recommended it.  I have difficult skin; a delightful blend of acne and wrinkles, etc.  I am convinced the only things that work, really work, are dermatologists...(no, I am not a dermatologist...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here is the bottom line -- it smells great, especially if you are a fan of cucumber scent.  It washes off easily, foams lightly and generally I use it every day, so obviously I am a fan.  I recognize that it isn&#x27;t inexpensive, so to be clear ....I am not sure that using it results in any miracle changes to my skin.  However, my husband loves the scent and says it reminds him of me...so what can I say...I&#x27;m not giving it up any time soon.</li>
