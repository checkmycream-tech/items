            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the original Amarige Perfume!</li>

            <li> This fragrance is not too heavy but fragrant.  It is sometimes \\&quot;comforting\\&quot;.  It also lasts and still smells great at the end of the day.</li>

The price of $10.00 for this little bottle is a bit expensive.  The perfume is a little strong smelling, so you need a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will purchase Amarige, again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite all time fragrances.  I like to keep am mini of all my favorites on display on my dresser.  This fragrance is different from any other fragrance I know of and I love it.  It almost smells like a mild bit of cedar--I had a cedar closet growing up and it reminds of that wonderful time :-0</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t worn this perfume in a while, but it still smells great, and you don&#x27;t need much. It lasts all day, and you can still smell it the next and longer on your clothes. The seller also provided perfect packaging, there was no spillage.</li>
            <li> smells great for my girfriend</li>
            <li> I was looking for the fragrance of the mimosa blossom.  Even though it was advertised as this, it wasn&#x27;t at all the same aroma.  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but I didn&#x27;t find the fragrance pleasing at all.</li>
            <li> The perfume is great - I just didn&#x27;t realize the bottle was so small.  It will however be a nice size for traveling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite fragrances - have worn it for years&amp;#62;  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not loving this........definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, it is marked on the box that it is a sample and not for sale, yet I paid 10.00 for each bottle. The scent is so weak I find it hard to believe it&#x27;s actually any brand of perfume.</li>
            <li> I swear to god this is a knock off bottle.. just does not have the lasting power of the perfume I would buy in Macy&#x27;s etc.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite smelling fragrances to this date. For anyone ready to make a splash on the town.This is the one that grabs all noses around! A must get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author - In spirituality, Meditation, Metaphysics, Ascension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! :D</li>
            <li> I have loved this scent since I was a teenager.  It&#x27;s a wonderful blend of sweet and sophistication in a bottle.</li>

            <li> I have a full size of this perfume, I have been using is for the last 10 years, I needed a little one for travel.  I compared both and this scent is different also the color of the perfume differs.  It&#x27;s not the original Amarige Perfume!</li>
            <li> I was shocked. I Wasn&#x27;t, Please with mini size. Delivery time was excellent. Thought it was a spray bottle.</li>
