            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that cheap &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; look at all, almost like glass.  </li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, organizers are primarily about the characteristics of the stuff being organized.  </li>
            <li>It was orginally going to be a gift for my sister, but after I opened it, I liked it so much</li>
            <li>I had to go vertical as a solution to having products handy yet not taking up too much counter space.</li>
            <li>love it,, u can keep lipsticks, brushes,bottles and there is space to keep eyeshadow palettes ,so useful piece</li>
            <li>I purchased this acrylic storage item for sundries and personal supplies and it has worked out great.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great organizer.</li>

            <li>So much room for the price!!!</li>
            <li>VERY WELL MADE!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have a small shelf, and these fit perfectly and keeps everything organized.  </li>
            <li>I measured my drawer first to be sure it would fit, then ordered, got it, and popped it in.</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a small quibble on an otherwise great organizer!</li>
            <li>I neatly tuck everything into the compartments and they are easily accessible while eliminating the clutter.</li>
            <li>i was really excited to receive this box i use this for storage.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size for my needs, and not over organized as far as compartments, and the sides are tall enough so that things don&#x27;t lean out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can pick up those tubes and bottles stored in the organizer all at once to clean under them, saving time, effort, and removing one petty annoyance from my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice enough to put on top of vanity.</li>
            <li>Check out The Container Store and this item would be more than double even if they had one 1/2 as nice.</li>

            <li>This is sturdy and looks clean on the table.</li>
            <li>After getting this organizer, my stuff is so clean and organized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll sum up my review by saying it&#x27;s another fantastic find thanks to my favorite place to shop that never lets me</li>
            <li>Looks nice enough to leave out on top.</li>
            <li>so I can clean the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I like to keep them in an organizer so that it is portable, and also to keep the counter or cabinet clean.  </li>
            <li>I managed to fit all my daily essentials and more and be able to tuck it in as easily as pulling it out.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful with all the other acrylic organizers.</li>
            <li>I purchased the clear cube, and of course love it!  </li>
            <li>The size is just right for many things - and everything is right at your fingertips.  </li>
            <li>I love the large compartment.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t love this as much as the others because there&#x27;s nothing particularly special about it.</li>
            <li>I thought what a great place for all our remote, tablets, etc.</li>
            <li>I found it more suitable to larger cosmetic or hairbrush organizer.</li>
            <li>and it really made the bathroom look a lot better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that I&#x27;m considering purchasing a second one to help line up all the lotions and bottles I have on the counter.  </li>
            <li>husband has to habit of keeping more product out than he needs and thanks to this</li>
            <li>I thought these five compartments would be bigger, but it is a sturdy organizer and I have put it to good use.  </li>
            <li>Every morning can get ready 4 work in a speed of light!</li>
            <li>It makes the vanity top so much neater.  </li>
            <li>This item was bigger than I thought but that was a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good quality, solid and ridged.</li>
            <li>I really could use 3  or 4 of these:)</li>
            <li>Love that it organizes everything and makes our bathroom look much nicer.</li>
            <li>Love to organize everything,so I can find it fast.</li>
            <li>For me, I am happy to finally have the 4 remote controllers in one handy easy to use corral.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more products from this company because if this is representative of their offerings, they have amazing acrylic organizer products that will help me tame my cosmetic chaos. :-)</li>
            <li>They fit a surprising amount of stuff and helped us double our storage and keep everything right where we can see and reach it quickly.</li>
            <li>But other than that it is nice and was able to fit my hair products.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I had been looking for and it is easy to find everything when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li>Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have to really say much about this product.  </li>
            <li>It might be luck of the draw.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone who needs quick organization.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone, plus there are many styles to choose from.  </li>

            <li>It is very pretty on my vanity..</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the sturdiness and the deep sides</li>
            <li>It holds a lot of my bathroom items and looks pretty on the shelf as well  !</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed to get my makeup drawer in order!  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This is a great little organizer for your taller, bulkier beauty items that seem to float around your drawers/cabinets.</li>
            <li>This product is useful and great for sorting, but I was hoping it would look a little classier than it does.</li>
            <li>Love the clear acrylic so that I can locate exactly what I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li>More importantly, it&#x27;s a little bigger than I had pictured and serves as an ideal size for my more frequently used hair styling products, deodorant, perfume, and hair brush.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy, does not look cheap and works very well for my hair products.</li>
            <li>The acrylic is very sturdy and it fit a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li>Nice big sections to keep things in.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This acrylic organizer is handy because it holds multiple items in each compartment.</li>
            <li>My husband made fun of me when I ordered it, but now he likes it</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money for the quality and organization.  </li>
            <li>The latter items are handy because out cats jump in my wife&#x27;s lap when she watches TV</li>
            <li>I love it really made my vanity organized thanks</li>
            <li>It has some larger compartments, which is nice.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE MONEY</li>

            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR EASY AND NEAT ORGANIZATION IN ANY ROOM OF A HOME OR AN OFFICE.</li>

            <li>Pretty and practical organizer.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This organizer is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and really helps keep the sink area organized!</li>
            <li>I love this, a lot bigger than what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, for the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Most are too short for hairbrushes and combs.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what we needed to help organize our bathroom drawers.  </li>
            <li>i was pretty dissapointed</li>
            <li>Very nice, thick acrylic.</li>
            <li>Nice size and allows me to keep my toiletries, makeup brushes, and other miscellaneous items.</li>
            <li>It looks nice up against all my other acrylic up on my vanity.</li>
            <li>The clear acrylic gives it an updated and clean look.</li>
            <li>, i actually could of used a couple more compartments i have so much stuff.</li>
            <li>When it gets dirty, a good rinse and wipe with warm water&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do own another acrylic toothbrush holder that only has holes on the top side - a very impractical design because the brushes tend to slide down and around</li>
            <li>Able to separate different items which is very useful instead of one larger organizer.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this design, so it&#x27;s OK but not especially attractive.</li>
            <li>Definitely isn&#x27;t going in most medicine cabinets or on a shallow shelf, and it would not make a good looking toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li>but keep in mind that it&#x27;s quite large.</li>
            <li>Holds my medium to large size products.</li>
            <li>I read the description, but still didn&#x27;t realize just how large this organizer is.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, clear acrylic.</li>
            <li>A lot bigger than I had estimated, but looks strong, does the job, and is very convenient.</li>
            <li>and I have to throw it into trash can and make sure there&#x27;s no small piece left on my vanity.</li>
            <li>Very high quality acrylic.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Very high quality materials and construction.</li>
            <li>Product is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice quality little organizer.  </li>
            <li>Nice little organizer.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I found that doesn&#x27;t fit is my large volumizer spray.  </li>
            <li>I  fit 10 bottles and tubes of hair products, 2 paddle brushes and an extra large bottle of earring cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much sturdier than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The 5 compartments hold my lipliners, eyeliners, brushes and two big eyeshadow pallets comfortably.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear too much makeup</li>
            <li>The quality of the acrylic is better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and has lots of room for storing my foundations and skincare.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t accommodate as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really confines the clutter.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This organizer is very well made and almost looks like glass .</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spacious, durable, and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I used to keep my husbands toiletry items from overtaking the whole bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>we have company, I just hide the filled  organizer underneath the sink, and put it back up when&lt;</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to use again.</li>
            <li>Really do like this one.  </li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy, well made organizer.</li>
            <li>It is very well made</li>
            <li>More than I expected.</li>
            <li>He is very roomy, all my makeup now in order.</li>
            <li>Acrylic is not thin and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful for organizing bathroom.</li>
            <li>AND I REALLY LIKE ACRYLIC.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>I really needed it thanks to my growing skincare products.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>This really helps organize items so they&#x27;re not all falling over.</li>
            <li>, I have so much to organize-Brushes, tools, etc.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t matter so much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy and won&#x27;t tip over.  </li>
            <li>Handy and convenient;  sits nicely on back of the commode....holds all that stuff that I use on a regular basis at close reach;  </li>
            <li>I HOPE THE FUTURE BRINGS OUT MORE ACRYLIC ITEMS INSTEAD OF THE OLD TUBBERWARE THAT STAINS AND YOU CAN NOT SEE THRU</li>
            <li>Being that it is clear it makes my bathroom seem more open and airy!</li>
            <li>Smaller compartments seem to be a bit too big for items that I wanted to store, but nice looking product.</li>
            <li>It was large enough for all of my hair products and also looks quite nice on my toilet.</li>
            <li>simple and very useful</li>
            <li>Looks fantastic and has deeper, larger compartments than many other acrylic vanity or makeup organizers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size &amp; because it&#x27;s clear, it doesn&#x27;t seem as obtrusive as it could.  </li>
            <li>Good quality not sure if it&#x27;s the best price out there but not too bad.</li>
            <li>The four smaller and one large compartment handle many different shapes and sizes, and it is weighty enough not to tip over when filled.  </li>
            <li>I fixed that aspect by putting crystals in the compartments so they&#x27;re higher up now</li>
            <li>Received this today and am very pleased with the transparent but thick and sturdy quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>Would be better if one side was a little lower than the other, but it is OK</li>
            <li>wait to get my new organizer!</li>
            <li>It is  bigger than I expected, which is nice.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high, compared to some similar items I saw at a local chain store, but I was able to select a size and shape I wanted via Amazon.</li>
            <li>My bathroom is definitely more organized now and not a cluttered mess</li>
            <li>Had to return it because it was too high for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>high end quality.</li>
            <li>it is clear!); a better replacement for my cloth box/divider I had previously used.</li>
            <li>I mention my older one because it still looks brand new, not scuffed or scratched.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend getting this if you don&#x27;t have much storage space in your bathroom and frequently have items all over your counter.</li>
            <li>Overall met my expectations and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I still find it useful and use it to hold my larger body lotions and hair brushes instead.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a second because I like the first one so much.</li>
            <li>It is thick and the compartments are nice sized.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice, thick acrylic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deep and sturdy, really well made, ordering more for other things.</li>
            <li>It has areas large enough to hold a large bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li>It was a little wider than I estimated it to be, based on viewing the pictures, so you may want to measure if you want to fit it into a certain spot.</li>
            <li>i can now find it all really fast and easy now, and i dont knock half of it over once a week anymore!</li>
            <li>Very substantial organizer with large enough compartments.  </li>
            <li>It was totally filled with shower stuff, makeup stuff, hair stuff, and other stuff for two girls.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a new one here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>need to put hair accessories in a small compact area and this works pretty good, wish it was a little more narrow.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s big enough to fit my bottles of lotion, sunscreen, lip gloss, etc.</li>
            <li>quick dry with a paper towel or whatever</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough and light weighted.</li>
            <li>Holds many 8 0z spray bottles and there are small dividers that keep them in place.</li>
            <li>I meant to purchase an organizer for small makeup brushes, lotions, primers, et cetra that come in tubes, however I should&#x27;ve payed more attention to the measurements listed.  </li>
            <li>is that it is pretty bulky and on the deep side.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>How refreshing since not many things are made here anymore.</li>
            <li>I also have a little shelf on the bathroom counter, and I slide this organizer under that shelf and then pull the organizer out for easy access.</li>
            <li>I use round brushes in my hair and it easily hold all 6 plus three hair brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is heavy clear acrylic, very strong and well suited for larger things on your bathroom counter or vanity table like bottles of hairspray, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, heavier acrylic and features just the right size slots and compartments to hold bottles and lotions of large to small size.  </li>
            <li>clear acrylic is less bulky looking, which in a small space looks more clean and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great way to get rid of the mess of little items or multiple containers.  </li>
            <li>This IS a fairly large item, and I actually do not keep it out on the counter -</li>
            <li>This organizer has large deep compartments.  </li>
            <li>Each compartment is large enough.</li>
            <li>The shape of the vanity organizer is fine but the size of the compartments are not big enough to put big sized bottles and containers.</li>
            <li>This organizer is sturdy, made of clear acrylic, and has ample-sized compartments.  </li>
            <li>Everything is at your fingertips and because it&#x27;s clear you can see what&#x27;s in each section.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I opened I was completely surprised.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one for another bathroom, I like it so much.  </li>
            <li>Front 4 and back 1 compartments really make it convenient to put all your stuffs-in.</li>
            <li>The front section is all open and holds almost a whole bag of cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>Really like that it has different</li>
            <li>I need a few more, but I will have to buy them later.</li>
            <li>My wife and I now have a grown up bathroom and this keeps her crap organized perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size for holding my minimal makeup.</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering a second one as soon as I saw how well my hairbrushes and other beauty accessories fit.  </li>
            <li>Finally no mess in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Probably look for something more shallow.</li>
            <li>Looks more expensive and pretty than what you think.</li>
            <li>I especially like the height of the sides, which are sufficiently high to keep items from falling out.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Big enough for large size contact lense cleaner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful for my small bathroom.</li>
            <li>Thick acrylic that seems quite strong.</li>
            <li>I was also very surprised at how big it was compared to the picture.</li>
            <li>I have been having this for months now and looks clean and slick on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>Very thick acrylic with many spaces for bottles, brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>I wish that at least one of the compartments were a bit wider, so I can fit in my bottle of contacts solution.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why they use \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot; in the name above, it&#x27;s clearly a bathroom vanity product.</li>
            <li>I made my purchase based on the scale of products in the picture and when it arrived I was a bit surprised to find it is way bigger than I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I was also surprised with the quality because it is so solid and sturdy</li>
            <li>Smears are barely visible.</li>
            <li>seems that the transportation of the product, I get hurt and broken, I would love to have it.</li>
            <li>It holds everything in place very well, the inside compartments are wide to hold cologne, after shave balm etc and the acrylic is very sturdy unlike other flimsy product.</li>
            <li>My bathroom vanity is fairly small and has always looked like a mess with my various products scattered all over it since I never have time to keep it neat and tidy.</li>
            <li>I needed a small organizer to fit on my limited space bathroom countertop.</li>
            <li>In general, I think I&#x27;ll stay away from acrylic materials as much as possible for a variety of health and aesthetic reasons.</li>
            <li>recieved this not long after ordering this from the Amazon site.</li>
            <li>It is  very compact and I would recommend this to anyone who needs to clear  a small space of clutter.</li>
            <li>For my use (makeup) the compartments are a little too large, so the pencils, brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>had it for a few weeks and noticed a large crack on the bottom of the plastic.</li>
            <li>Acrylic around the outside is not flat</li>

            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, organizers are primarily about the characteristics of the stuff being organized.  </li>
            <li> It was orginally going to be a gift for my sister, but after I opened it, I liked it so much</li>
            <li> I had to go vertical as a solution to having products handy yet not taking up too much counter space.</li>
            <li> love it,, u can keep lipsticks, brushes,bottles and there is space to keep eyeshadow palettes ,so useful piece</li>
            <li> I purchased this acrylic storage item for sundries and personal supplies and it has worked out great.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great organizer.</li>

            <li> So much room for the price!!!</li>
            <li> VERY WELL MADE!!!</li>
            <li> Very useful, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a small shelf, and these fit perfectly and keeps everything organized.  </li>
            <li> I measured my drawer first to be sure it would fit, then ordered, got it, and popped it in.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a small quibble on an otherwise great organizer!</li>
            <li> I neatly tuck everything into the compartments and they are easily accessible while eliminating the clutter.</li>
            <li> i was really excited to receive this box i use this for storage.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size for my needs, and not over organized as far as compartments, and the sides are tall enough so that things don&#x27;t lean out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can pick up those tubes and bottles stored in the organizer all at once to clean under them, saving time, effort, and removing one petty annoyance from my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice enough to put on top of vanity.</li>
            <li> Check out The Container Store and this item would be more than double even if they had one 1/2 as nice.</li>
            <li> delivered on time, product as described, I love it, ease to fit in to my cabinet and organaze your things,  still using , thanks</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and looks clean on the table.</li>
            <li> After getting this organizer, my stuff is so clean and organized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sum up my review by saying it&#x27;s another fantastic find thanks to my favorite place to shop that never lets me</li>
            <li> Looks nice enough to leave out on top.</li>
            <li> so I can clean the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I like to keep them in an organizer so that it is portable, and also to keep the counter or cabinet clean.  </li>
            <li> I managed to fit all my daily essentials and more and be able to tuck it in as easily as pulling it out.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful with all the other acrylic organizers.</li>
            <li> I purchased the clear cube, and of course love it!  </li>
            <li> The size is just right for many things - and everything is right at your fingertips.  </li>
            <li> I love the large compartment.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t love this as much as the others because there&#x27;s nothing particularly special about it.</li>
            <li> I thought what a great place for all our remote, tablets, etc.</li>
            <li> I found it more suitable to larger cosmetic or hairbrush organizer.</li>
            <li> and it really made the bathroom look a lot better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good that I&#x27;m considering purchasing a second one to help line up all the lotions and bottles I have on the counter.  </li>
            <li> husband has to habit of keeping more product out than he needs and thanks to this</li>

            <li> very strudy and useful</li>
            <li> Storage space is enough for all my products and fits nicely on top on the sink counter.</li>
            <li> The look is also appealing and matches the white bathroom tile.</li>
            <li> Pretty and practical organizer.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This organizer is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and really helps keep the sink area organized!</li>
            <li> I love this, a lot bigger than what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, for the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Most are too short for hairbrushes and combs.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed to help organize our bathroom drawers.  </li>
            <li> i was pretty dissapointed</li>
            <li> Very nice, thick acrylic.</li>
            <li> Nice size and allows me to keep my toiletries, makeup brushes, and other miscellaneous items.</li>
            <li> It looks nice up against all my other acrylic up on my vanity.</li>
            <li> The clear acrylic gives it an updated and clean look.</li>
            <li> , i actually could of used a couple more compartments i have so much stuff.</li>
            <li> When it gets dirty, a good rinse and wipe with warm water&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do own another acrylic toothbrush holder that only has holes on the top side - a very impractical design because the brushes tend to slide down and around</li>
            <li> Able to separate different items which is very useful instead of one larger organizer.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this design, so it&#x27;s OK but not especially attractive.</li>
            <li> Definitely isn&#x27;t going in most medicine cabinets or on a shallow shelf, and it would not make a good looking toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li> but keep in mind that it&#x27;s quite large.</li>
            <li> Holds my medium to large size products.</li>
            <li> I read the description, but still didn&#x27;t realize just how large this organizer is.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, clear acrylic.</li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I had estimated, but looks strong, does the job, and is very convenient.</li>
            <li> and I have to throw it into trash can and make sure there&#x27;s no small piece left on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Very high quality acrylic.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Very high quality materials and construction.</li>
            <li> Product is very high quality.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice quality little organizer.  </li>
            <li> Nice little organizer.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I found that doesn&#x27;t fit is my large volumizer spray.  </li>
            <li> I  fit 10 bottles and tubes of hair products, 2 paddle brushes and an extra large bottle of earring cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much sturdier than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The 5 compartments hold my lipliners, eyeliners, brushes and two big eyeshadow pallets comfortably.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear too much makeup</li>
            <li> The quality of the acrylic is better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and has lots of room for storing my foundations and skincare.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t accommodate as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really confines the clutter.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This organizer is very well made and almost looks like glass .</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spacious, durable, and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I used to keep my husbands toiletry items from overtaking the whole bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> we have company, I just hide the filled  organizer underneath the sink, and put it back up when&lt;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to use again.</li>
            <li> Really do like this one.  </li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy, well made organizer.</li>
            <li> It is very well made</li>
            <li> More than I expected.</li>
            <li> He is very roomy, all my makeup now in order.</li>
            <li> Acrylic is not thin and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful for organizing bathroom.</li>
            <li> AND I REALLY LIKE ACRYLIC.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> I really needed it thanks to my growing skincare products.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> This really helps organize items so they&#x27;re not all falling over.</li>
            <li> , I have so much to organize-Brushes, tools, etc.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t matter so much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and heavy and won&#x27;t tip over.  </li>
            <li> Handy and convenient;  sits nicely on back of the commode....holds all that stuff that I use on a regular basis at close reach;  </li>
            <li> I HOPE THE FUTURE BRINGS OUT MORE ACRYLIC ITEMS INSTEAD OF THE OLD TUBBERWARE THAT STAINS AND YOU CAN NOT SEE THRU</li>
            <li> Being that it is clear it makes my bathroom seem more open and airy!</li>
            <li> Smaller compartments seem to be a bit too big for items that I wanted to store, but nice looking product.</li>
            <li> It was large enough for all of my hair products and also looks quite nice on my toilet.</li>
            <li> simple and very useful</li>
            <li> Looks fantastic and has deeper, larger compartments than many other acrylic vanity or makeup organizers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size &amp; because it&#x27;s clear, it doesn&#x27;t seem as obtrusive as it could.  </li>
            <li> Good quality not sure if it&#x27;s the best price out there but not too bad.</li>
            <li> The four smaller and one large compartment handle many different shapes and sizes, and it is weighty enough not to tip over when filled.  </li>
            <li> I fixed that aspect by putting crystals in the compartments so they&#x27;re higher up now</li>
            <li> Received this today and am very pleased with the transparent but thick and sturdy quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> Would be better if one side was a little lower than the other, but it is OK</li>
            <li> wait to get my new organizer!</li>
            <li> It is  bigger than I expected, which is nice.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit high, compared to some similar items I saw at a local chain store, but I was able to select a size and shape I wanted via Amazon.</li>
            <li> My bathroom is definitely more organized now and not a cluttered mess</li>
            <li> Had to return it because it was too high for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> high end quality.</li>
            <li> it is clear!); a better replacement for my cloth box/divider I had previously used.</li>
            <li> I mention my older one because it still looks brand new, not scuffed or scratched.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend getting this if you don&#x27;t have much storage space in your bathroom and frequently have items all over your counter.</li>
            <li> Overall met my expectations and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I still find it useful and use it to hold my larger body lotions and hair brushes instead.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a second because I like the first one so much.</li>
            <li> It is thick and the compartments are nice sized.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice, thick acrylic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deep and sturdy, really well made, ordering more for other things.</li>
            <li> It has areas large enough to hold a large bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> It was a little wider than I estimated it to be, based on viewing the pictures, so you may want to measure if you want to fit it into a certain spot.</li>
            <li> i can now find it all really fast and easy now, and i dont knock half of it over once a week anymore!</li>
            <li> Very substantial organizer with large enough compartments.  </li>
            <li> It was totally filled with shower stuff, makeup stuff, hair stuff, and other stuff for two girls.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a new one here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> need to put hair accessories in a small compact area and this works pretty good, wish it was a little more narrow.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s big enough to fit my bottles of lotion, sunscreen, lip gloss, etc.</li>
            <li> quick dry with a paper towel or whatever</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough and light weighted.</li>
            <li> Holds many 8 0z spray bottles and there are small dividers that keep them in place.</li>
            <li> I meant to purchase an organizer for small makeup brushes, lotions, primers, et cetra that come in tubes, however I should&#x27;ve payed more attention to the measurements listed.  </li>
            <li> is that it is pretty bulky and on the deep side.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> How refreshing since not many things are made here anymore.</li>
            <li> I also have a little shelf on the bathroom counter, and I slide this organizer under that shelf and then pull the organizer out for easy access.</li>
            <li> I use round brushes in my hair and it easily hold all 6 plus three hair brushes.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy clear acrylic, very strong and well suited for larger things on your bathroom counter or vanity table like bottles of hairspray, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made, heavier acrylic and features just the right size slots and compartments to hold bottles and lotions of large to small size.  </li>
            <li> clear acrylic is less bulky looking, which in a small space looks more clean and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great way to get rid of the mess of little items or multiple containers.  </li>
            <li> This IS a fairly large item, and I actually do not keep it out on the counter -</li>
            <li> This organizer has large deep compartments.  </li>
            <li> Each compartment is large enough.</li>
            <li> The shape of the vanity organizer is fine but the size of the compartments are not big enough to put big sized bottles and containers.</li>
            <li> This organizer is sturdy, made of clear acrylic, and has ample-sized compartments.  </li>
            <li> Everything is at your fingertips and because it&#x27;s clear you can see what&#x27;s in each section.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I opened I was completely surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one for another bathroom, I like it so much.  </li>
            <li> Front 4 and back 1 compartments really make it convenient to put all your stuffs-in.</li>
            <li> The front section is all open and holds almost a whole bag of cotton balls.  </li>
            <li> Really like that it has different</li>
            <li> I need a few more, but I will have to buy them later.</li>
            <li> My wife and I now have a grown up bathroom and this keeps her crap organized perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size for holding my minimal makeup.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering a second one as soon as I saw how well my hairbrushes and other beauty accessories fit.  </li>
            <li> Finally no mess in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Probably look for something more shallow.</li>
            <li> Looks more expensive and pretty than what you think.</li>
            <li> I especially like the height of the sides, which are sufficiently high to keep items from falling out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Big enough for large size contact lense cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful for my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Thick acrylic that seems quite strong.</li>
            <li> I was also very surprised at how big it was compared to the picture.</li>
            <li> I have been having this for months now and looks clean and slick on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> Very thick acrylic with many spaces for bottles, brushes, etc.</li>
            <li> I wish that at least one of the compartments were a bit wider, so I can fit in my bottle of contacts solution.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why they use \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot; in the name above, it&#x27;s clearly a bathroom vanity product.</li>
            <li> I made my purchase based on the scale of products in the picture and when it arrived I was a bit surprised to find it is way bigger than I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I was also surprised with the quality because it is so solid and sturdy</li>
            <li> Smears are barely visible.</li>
            <li> seems that the transportation of the product, I get hurt and broken, I would love to have it.</li>
            <li> It holds everything in place very well, the inside compartments are wide to hold cologne, after shave balm etc and the acrylic is very sturdy unlike other flimsy product.</li>
            <li> My bathroom vanity is fairly small and has always looked like a mess with my various products scattered all over it since I never have time to keep it neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> I needed a small organizer to fit on my limited space bathroom countertop.</li>
            <li> In general, I think I&#x27;ll stay away from acrylic materials as much as possible for a variety of health and aesthetic reasons.</li>
            <li> recieved this not long after ordering this from the Amazon site.</li>
            <li> It is  very compact and I would recommend this to anyone who needs to clear  a small space of clutter.</li>
            <li> For my use (makeup) the compartments are a little too large, so the pencils, brushes, etc.</li>
            <li> had it for a few weeks and noticed a large crack on the bottom of the plastic.</li>
            <li> Acrylic around the outside is not flat</li>
            <li> The older one is at least five years old, maybe ten.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy and the acrylic is clear with no imperfections or weird seams, and the walls are high enough to make it not awkward for taller product bottles.</li>
            <li> Also, the vertical walls of my older one are plain where these are paneled.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful organizer for small items (nail polish, lotien bottles, tweezers, etc.)</li>
            <li> I realize they are a bit spendy, but they will last a long time</li>
            <li> There are 4 in front and one long compartment in the back.</li>
            <li> There is one long compartment the length of the organizer, then 4 smaller compartments.</li>
            <li> These items are heavy and tall, and normally would fall over if I moved or shifted the container I had them in.  </li>
            <li> I needed something to hold hair products such as hair sprays, dry shampoo, straightening sprays and flat iron protection sprays.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid and stable enough that I often used the center compartment for a beverage without concern that it would topple from my bed to the floor and spill.  </li>
            <li> ; wide, 7&amp;#34; from front to back, and 4&amp;#34; deep.  </li>
            <li> For about ten years now, I&#x27;ve had all my hair products shoved awkwardly into a big blue plastic shower caddy, which I stick on the top of my toilet for lack of any other place for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you want a little order in your bathroom drawers!</li>
            <li> Actually nicer than I expected</li>
            <li> Stuff gets taken in and out of them daily, they shift back and forth as we open and close drawers - after a month of heavy use, no cracks.</li>
            <li> After searching all over, we settled on this acrylic organizer to house the multiple remote controllers we have.  </li>
            <li> but the convenience far outweighs a few scratches.</li>
            <li> Larger than expected and holds a lot.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this organizer unfortunately it came damaged with white streaks that don&#x27;t come off even after trying to wipe it with a wet towel.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these to organize my bathroom drawer for my make-up, combs and other personal items.  </li>
            <li> Larger than expected!  </li>
            <li> I use it for my small bathroom since I like to keep a lot of stuff I use near my sink.</li>
            <li> Especially like the ridged bottom, allowing lipsticks and other items to stand upright!</li>
            <li> I really like it keeps all my makeup seperated and clean verses being shoved in a bad thats Not organized and messy.</li>
            <li> just bought this to replace my previous version, which was identical except for having four compartments rather than five, the middle two front compartments being combined into one.  </li>
            <li> - it has a slight wave to it creating an overall prism type effect.  </li>
            <li> I have 4 electric toothbrushes and associated toothpastes for 4 different family members in the four small sections and a stack of paper cups + a bottle of mouthwash in the larger section.</li>
            <li> US Acrylic has so many different sizes and configurations that you will not be disappointed when you order these organizers.</li>
            <li> This organizer sits on my bathroom counter because I have a double sink and needed a way to sort my mess of products.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> It came as described, but I wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t have that very very short little separator on the front sections.</li>
            <li> one of the compartments was a little bigger</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might be cheap flimsy plastic</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The acrylic is clear and thick, giving this organizer the look of polished glass or crystal.  </li>
            <li> It fits my giant hair spray bottles (I was concerned they might not fit</li>
            <li> We just purchased a loveseat set with a center console.</li>
            <li> A lot nicer then expected.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my everyday essential, like mouthwash, deodorant, etc.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our mom who is in assisted living and has minimal counter space.</li>
            <li> which I did in this case by replacing the shower caddy (which had slanted sides, so it was impossible for me to keep any product straight) with this clear organizer.</li>
            <li> The plastic is extremely sturdy and not cheap-looking at all.  </li>
            <li> Extremely sturdy and clean-looking.</li>
            <li> No more pawing through the drawer to find a smaller item.</li>
            <li> The smaller compartments holds my brushes and small make up items.</li>
            <li> POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS.</li>
            <li> I have limited counter space on bathroom counter, so this organizer helped me get my everyday essentials stored in a compact way.</li>
            <li> Its a  little chunky looking and to wide for my bathroom sink</li>
            <li> down~</li>
            <li> Its&#x27; hard to tell from the picture, but there are little dividers inside each compartment to hold various items in place.</li>
            <li> I got a few of these type orgranizers for her make up and other bathroom items.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit bigger than I expected, but very thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> No more mess, no more multiple bags of makeup.  </li>
            <li> My vanity was a mess...</li>
            <li> This organizer keeps my desk, which doubles as a work desk/vanity table (due to having a small room), from being swamped in beauty products.</li>
            <li> I like the big and small compartments and how there&#x27;s a small ridge in between each small compartment to separate 2 products.</li>
            <li> that helps a little</li>
            <li> Once I attempt to place my items in it I was a little disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also was a little price e&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not cheap looking or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these to organize my hair products, makeup and  face creams.  </li>
            <li> Searched in a few stores but nothing was what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This five-compartment vanity organizer is made of a heavy, durable acrylic.  </li>
            <li> Organizes the items I use everyday.</li>
            <li> so I needed something small to keep everything together.</li>
            <li> I use it for my brushes and foundations and i literally have to go into the compartments to get what I need plus small brushes get lost on the bottom.</li>
            <li> i thought is small but isnt ..</li>
            <li> No more searching everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thick and extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li> It is made of plastic, but it is very heavy and sturdy and looks as if it was made of glass.</li>
            <li> It held up through much hard use.</li>
            <li> I am a skincare fanatic</li>
            <li> My one complaint is there didn&#x27;t seem to be any slots specifically for brushes.</li>
            <li> This is so sturdy and thick, even my husband commented on the quality.  </li>
            <li> but when I took it out of the box it was broken.  </li>
            <li> Not flimsy thin acrylic.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I hated moving each item individually off the tray they were on, or moving the tray and having everything fall over.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed about that</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for years.  Fits perfectly on double vanity.  Tall enought so bottles, etc. are secure.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 different styles of these organizers and very pleased with all of them. They are just as described. Very sturdy plastic, with good weight to them, do not feel cheap at all. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much sturdier than I was expecting. Nice big sections to keep things in. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Holds quite a lot of stuff.From powder to hairspray Keeps thing neat and tidy</li>
            <li> So much room for the price!!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t what I expected.  It&#x27;s somewhat larger than I anticipated for holding different makeups, etc. I will use it.  It&#x27;s nice quality..</li>
            <li> I really love this organizer.  I was afraid it might be cheap flimsy plastic but it&#x27;s not.  Sturdy and all the compartments are wisely sized.  Sits on my bathroom vanity and now I&#x27;m not \\&quot;all over the place\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have bought several different acrylic organizers. My favorites are the boxes and cosmetic organizers, which are really attractively designed. There is nothing special about this design, so it&#x27;s OK but not especially attractive. The acrylic is OK, clear, reasonably sturdy. I just don&#x27;t love this as much as the others because there&#x27;s nothing particularly special about it. But it does seem pretty well made and accommodates most products fairly well.</li>
            <li> The size is just right for many things - and everything is right at your fingertips.  It makes being organized a breeze and simplifies life immeasurably!</li>
            <li> Very high quality acrylic.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size for my needs, and not over organized as far as compartments, and the sides are tall enough so that things don&#x27;t lean out.</li>
            <li> This product holds quite a bit of every day bathroom supplies. I wish that at least one of the compartments were a bit wider, so I can fit in my bottle of contacts solution.</li>
            <li> It was just perfect for what the person I ordered them for needed. Sturdy &amp; versatile.</li>
            <li> Bice acrylic organizer. It is sturdy, does not look cheap and works very well for my hair products. Very pleased with quality, price and size.</li>
            <li> Which is a bedside organizer.  It holds four remotes, notepads and sticky notes, pen and stylus, phone, lip balm, and my Kindle and Nexus.  It sits right on the far side of the bed within easy reach.  It&#x27;s nicely made--substantial and nicely finished with rounded edges.  It doesn&#x27;t have that cheap &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; look at all, almost like glass.  Besides being practical, it is part attractive and part unobtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this to replace my previous version, which was identical except for having four compartments rather than five, the middle two front compartments being combined into one.  Also, the vertical walls of my older one are plain where these are paneled.  The two are otherwise so close that they must have come from the same manufacturer.  The older one is at least five years old, maybe ten.  I bought it from The Container Store, which no longer carries it.  I was happy to find this one because the five compartments better suit its contents.  I mention my older one because it still looks brand new, not scuffed or scratched.  It&#x27;s solid and stable enough that I often used the center compartment for a beverage without concern that it would topple from my bed to the floor and spill.  I expect the same from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, organizers are primarily about the characteristics of the stuff being organized.  If the dimensions suit your needs, this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> I bought 2. For a woman that loves beauty products they are great. I need a few more, but I will have to buy them later. No problems with the 2 I purchased. I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Stout</li>
            <li> I love this and it is perfect for me. I can see at a glance what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed by the quality of this organizer. Nice heft, and looks great. I bought it because I hated moving each item individually off the tray they were on, or moving the tray and having everything fall over. This works very nicely to keep things upright and in place when you need to move it, or when you just want to place something nearby without knocking everything over. It was a little wider than I estimated it to be, based on viewing the pictures, so you may want to measure if you want to fit it into a certain spot. It was wider than I wanted, but no way am I sending this back. I love it. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being disappointed in this. It is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the icing on the cake, the cherry on top is - it is made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Love this organizer!  Just the right size and holds everything.  Very pretty, clear acrylic. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> such a nice and elegant way to organize my tiny bottles of beauty.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and exactly as described. Good product. Cheaper than in stores and still we&#x27;ll made.</li>
            <li> Crystal clear, smooth, 10&amp;#34; wide, 7&amp;#34; from front to back, and 4&amp;#34; deep.  I use it to hold lots of Crayola markers, felt tip pins, and magic markers.  It&#x27;s nice and heavy and won&#x27;t tip over.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for someone else, but the unit looks like it will hold everything she has.  Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This acrylic organizer is handy because it holds multiple items in each compartment. I can put bottles and tubes of face cream, lotions, hairspray, and so on, all in one organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Items can sit out for accessibility while looking neater than if I just laid them out on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can pick up those tubes and bottles stored in the organizer all at once to clean under them, saving time, effort, and removing one petty annoyance from my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metal cans and bottles stored in the organizer do not stain the counter. Woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compartments are tall enough to keep items standing upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear acrylic is less bulky looking, which in a small space looks more clean and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This organizer is not thin and flimsy, but nice and solid.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, &amp; just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This is a really well made, heavy acrylic organizer. Crystal clear and looks good on my bathroom counter. It&#x27;s compartments are roomy and can hold my cleansers and moisturizers with room to spare.</li>
            <li> This is a nice organizer for one&#x27;s bathroom counter.  Easily holds about 15 items.  The plastic is extremely sturdy and not cheap-looking at all.  It was orginally going to be a gift for my sister, but after I opened it, I liked it so much, I kept it for myself! :)</li>
            <li> I have several of these in different drawers.  I love the stand up ability for my taller bottles and brushes.  It definitely helps.</li>
            <li> I put this in a duffel bag to make a &#x27;hotel bathroom bag&#x27; for a four month vacation. It was totally filled with shower stuff, makeup stuff, hair stuff, and other stuff for two girls. It held up through much hard use. When we got back I put it on the top rack of the dishwasher, put the the cycle on light, and the thing came out like new. It&#x27;s in my (big) bathroom cabinet now- but keep in mind that it&#x27;s quite large. Definitely isn&#x27;t going in most medicine cabinets or on a shallow shelf, and it would not make a good looking toothbrush holder. But it&#x27;s great for products like the full size items shown.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer!  My husband made fun of me when I ordered it, but now he likes it</li>
            <li> I brought two for my bathroom with no drawers.  The look of the organizer is like glass.  Nice enough to put on top of vanity.</li>
            <li> Great way to get rid of the mess of little items or multiple containers.  Really organized!  Love the clear acrylic so that I can locate exactly what I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li> The acrylic is clear and thick, giving this organizer the look of polished glass or crystal.  It will hold a variety of items depending on your preference. I have used mine to organize my various colors of eye shadow, liner, and makeup to make them easier to find and use.</li>
            <li> Handy organizer. I have limited counter space on bathroom counter, so this organizer helped me get my everyday essentials stored in a compact way. I also have a little shelf on the bathroom counter, and I slide this organizer under that shelf and then pull the organizer out for easy access. I had to go vertical as a solution to having products handy yet not taking up too much counter space.</li>
            <li> I needed to fix  up my bathroom.  I purchased this and it really made the bathroom look a lot better.  It&#x27;s so good that I&#x27;m considering purchasing a second one to help line up all the lotions and bottles I have on the counter.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> this organizer is great.. I put it on the bathroom counter and all the items are at hands reach. I plan on oredering another one..</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.Holds a lot.Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Extremely sturdy and clean-looking. It holds all of my stuff perfectly.</li>
            <li> Actually nicer than I expected</li>
            <li> I have always liked acrylic &amp;#34;organizers,&amp;#34; for both the bathroom and kitchen, and even for my home office.  They go with just about any sort of &amp;#34;decor,&amp;#34; and I have always washed them in the top rack of my dishwashers without any damage.  This IS a fairly large item, and I actually do not keep it out on the counter - I use it in a cabinet.  I like that the compartments are like &amp;#34;boxes,&amp;#34; with the acrylic around all sides - kinda like tubes, but rectangular :).  I do own another acrylic toothbrush holder that only has holes on the top side - a very impractical design because the brushes tend to slide down and around (I&#x27;m using that one for a completely different purpose).</li>
            <li> They are perfect for what I wanted them for!!</li>
            <li> I love my product.  I have been having this for months now and looks clean and slick on my bathroom counter.  Holds my cleansers and hair products.  Would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> These are great organizers &amp; were just what I was looking for to organize all my products....they are so great that I purchased 4 of them! Perfect to organize make-up, hair tools &amp; hair products, hand &amp; body lotions, ect. They are just the right size. Very happy!</li>
            <li> My mom loved this.  I got a few of these type orgranizers for her make up and other bathroom items.  Now she can see what shes using instead of having it all thrown into a big box.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love, Love, Love.   Beautiful with all the other acrylic organizers. Looks great with the cube.          Sara B. in NC</li>
            <li> This vanity organizer is great because it&#x27;s good quality, sturdy/heavy, has more storage space than it looks, and doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space. Contents in my Vanity Organizer: 2 hair brushes, a comb, face cream, body lotion, face wipes, hair ties, hair pins, hair spray, toner, and body spray. My bathroom now looks more organized.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Very thick acrylic with many spaces for bottles, brushes, etc. The picture does not show how versatile and roomy this is. Holds many 8 0z spray bottles and there are small dividers that keep them in place. The price ia a bargain. Check out The Container Store and this item would be more than double even if they had one 1/2 as nice. It is  very compact and I would recommend this to anyone who needs to clear  a small space of clutter. The best I&#x27;ve seen. Can be used on a desk also. LOVE IT!!!  Fast shipping and excellent packaging. Comes in it&#x27;s own box so it can be given as a welcome gift.</li>
            <li> Acrylic Vanity Organizer - 5 Compartments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this not long after ordering this from the Amazon site. I am very happy with the durability and size..will order another in the future :)</li>
            <li> I love it and its affordable</li>
            <li> This organizer keeps my desk, which doubles as a work desk/vanity table (due to having a small room), from being swamped in beauty products. I am a skincare fanatic so I have a lot of products. I keep them in my room instead of the bathroom b/c there isn&#x27;t enough surface area for me to place it without the sink looking cluttered. I like the big and small compartments and how there&#x27;s a small ridge in between each small compartment to separate 2 products. It helps keep it looking organized within the tray itself. You can also use the organizer for pencils, pens etc. Recommended for anyone looking to de-clutter their vanity table, bathroom sink or desk. Recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have to really say much about this product.  The lines are clean and elegant.  The quality of the lucite is top notch.  It is sizable and holds a lot while looking great on the vanity.  I am well pleased with this purchase. Don&#x27;t know why they use \\&quot;kitchen\\&quot; in the name above, it&#x27;s clearly a bathroom vanity product.</li>
            <li> This organizer is study, attractive and does the job - keeps my vanity looking neat and clean.  It holds everything that used to be cluttering the countertop.</li>
            <li> It really is a nice size piece and holds a lot especially deodorant cans and my body spray bottles and looks really nice on the vanity</li>
            <li> This product is well made and the size is perfect. The 5 compartments hold my lipliners, eyeliners, brushes and two big eyeshadow pallets comfortably. I will be ordering another one of these and more from this company.</li>
            <li> It is a very well made and an attractive looking organizer. Had to return it because it was too high for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I love the depth and the quality of the material.</li>
            <li> Perfect for jewelry making tools.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality!! Not cheap looking or anything. I want QUALITY in a product, regardless of price, so I was really happy with this organizer. It fits my giant hair spray bottles (I was concerned they might not fit but they do) so I would definitely recommend this. It is spacious, effective, and looks great!</li>
            <li> This was actually better than what I thought. I can put most of my make ups in it. I would be more happy if it&#x27;s larger though. But still, I love it!</li>
            <li> Got this to organize my husband&#x27;s toiletries. It holds everything in place very well, the inside compartments are wide to hold cologne, after shave balm etc and the acrylic is very sturdy unlike other flimsy product. Am going to get one for myself too!!</li>
            <li> great for organization.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect companion piece to the make-up organizer with smaller compartments that I already have.  This one corrals my hairspray, styling pastes, and misc. medium-sized bottles. My countertop looks so much neater with this!  The quality is very good; it&#x27;s sturdy and the acrylic is very clear and clean-looking.</li>
            <li> My bathroom has never looked better!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my makeup. I don&#x27;t wear too much makeup so I needed something small to keep everything together. This was the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for somebody looking for a counter top organizer for things like cleansers, lotions, cosmetics, and even larger brushes. It is heavy and the acrylic is clear with no imperfections or weird seams, and the walls are high enough to make it not awkward for taller product bottles. It is maybe not the best for smaller brushes and tweezers that fall from one side to the other and can be a pain to fish out. The smaller compartments have a ridge running across the bottom halfway to catch smaller items and help them stay upright that helps a little but I might end up getting a supplemental container for my smaller brushes and tweezers and mascara. Overall met my expectations and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy and made well!</li>
            <li> We just purchased a loveseat set with a center console. I thought what a great place for all our remote, tablets, etc. but they got lost in the 10&amp;#34; depth of the console. Acrylic vanity organizer to the rescue!! I popped this beauty in there and all the remotes have a slot, the tablet stands in the larger slot and there is still room next to it for tissues, etc. Sturdy product.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product.  I use it to organize my bathroom products.</li>
            <li> I purchased the clear cube, and of course love it!  I needed something to put hair brushes and other items that were too large for my clear cube and the Acrylic Vanity Organizer-5 was perfect for those items.  It is very pretty on my vanity..[[ASIN:B001B11ZV0 Acrylic Vanity Organizer - 5 Compartments]]</li>
            <li> It is bigger and thicker than the picture appears.  Well-made but too deep for makeup.</li>

            <li> I was excited to receive this organizer unfortunately it came damaged with white streaks that don&#x27;t come off even after trying to wipe it with a wet towel. Idk if I would order from us acrylic again. But other than that it is nice and was able to fit my hair products.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I was looking for something like this to stack on top of my Muji drawers and the fit is perfect.  It is very sturdy and has lots of room for storing my foundations and skincare.  I highly recommend.</li>

            <li> It fits my needs. I like the various compartments.</li>
            <li> nice product, sturdy, well designed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to get organized</li>
            <li> Its plenty big, i actually could of used a couple more compartments i have so much stuff. All my perfumes, moisturizers, face stuff, tubes of stuff....i can now find it all really fast and easy now, and i dont knock half of it over once a week anymore! Idk how ive gone so long without organizers, and my sink area is so clean my husband is very proud of me ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> LOVE!  Just got this order, hurried and opened the box and fell in love immediately.  This organizer has large deep compartments.  It will fit so many products including my brushes and skin care products.  So happy with this purchase.  Will definitely buy more once I get my beauty room put together.  Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> got this item to organize my bathroom . it works and my home looks much better from now on. super happy.</li>
            <li> I thought these five compartments would be bigger, but it is a sturdy organizer and I have put it to good use.  It just doesn&#x27;t accommodate as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Larger than I thought it would be and absolutely perfect for storing and organizing my bathroom counter items.</li>
            <li> Nice, durable organizer. I use it for my facial cleansers, creams, and all the stuff I use for my face routine. I keep it in the bathroom where it sits perfectly on top of the counter. It&#x27;s the perfect size to hold all my products and it&#x27;s made out of durable acrylic. I have had this organizer for more than a year and it&#x27;s still in great shape; no scratches, cracks, or discoloration. Excellent material; made to last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so well made. Very sturdy. Looks neat in my bathroom. Love it.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bit bigger. It helps organize all my wife&#x27;s make-up that she uses on a daily basis. Easy to clean and love that is see through.</li>
            <li> I love these organizers!</li>
            <li> Finally organized all of the &amp;#34;I need this close at hand&amp;#34; stuff that was cluttering up (and falling off of) the bottom shelf of a bedroom table. It holds much more than I had hope it would and looks very nice...</li>
            <li> I purchased this acrylic storage item for sundries and personal supplies and it has worked out great.  It is of good quality and ample weight.  The price is a bit high, compared to some similar items I saw at a local chain store, but I was able to select a size and shape I wanted via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great organizer.  This is used on my computer desk to help organize there and is a perfect application.</li>
            <li> This is such a great organizer. I really like it keeps all my makeup seperated and clean verses being shoved in a bad thats Not organized and messy.</li>
            <li> Great, sturdy organizer. Variety of perfect-sized spaces to place items such as toothpaste/brush(es), nail clippers, lotion bottles/tubes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I ordered 2: 1 for each end of my vanity!</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous purchasing these because so many reviewers had them crack. I bought two to put in vanity drawers. One for my husband and one for me. Stuff gets taken in and out of them daily, they shift back and forth as we open and close drawers - after a month of heavy use, no cracks. I wonder if one of their molds is damaged and causing some of the plastic organizers to crack. It might be luck of the draw.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky and these are awesome. They hold a ton of stuff upright in my drawer and keep stuff from shifting. No more pawing through the drawer to find a smaller item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these to organize my hair products, makeup and  face creams.  I have a small shelf, and these fit perfectly and keeps everything organized.  Love and will probably be buying more!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It suits my needs, what I was looking for. I love the large compartment. Its perfect and fits my eyeshadow palettes. The smaller compartments holds my brushes and small make up items. And its sturdy.</li>
            <li> Love all the compartments.  Able to separate different items which is very useful instead of one larger organizer.  Easy to see, find and use.</li>
            <li> Would be better if one side was a little lower than the other, but it is OK</li>
            <li> I love it. Really confines the clutter. Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted fits alot of makeup and accessories</li>
            <li> LOVED IT. LOOKS VERY NICE ON THE BATHROOM COUNTER TOP, AND HOLDS LOTS OF STUFF.  Would highly recommend it to anyone, plus there are many styles to choose from.  Some are even in colors.</li>
            <li> Exactly how it looks in the picture... Good Stuff</li>
            <li> Very substantial organizer with large enough compartments.  Very attractive and fits nicely on a vanity area or similar type area.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice organizer. It is heavy clear acrylic, very strong and well suited for larger things on your bathroom counter or vanity table like bottles of hairspray, etc. There are some smaller compartments too. It arrived extremely well packaged, in perfect condition with no scratches, dents or chips. I will be buying more products from this company because if this is representative of their offerings, they have amazing acrylic organizer products that will help me tame my cosmetic chaos. :-)</li>
            <li> This organizer is very well made and almost looks like glass . I was so pleased with it I ordered another one the same day it arrived.  It holds a lot of my bathroom items and looks pretty on the shelf as well  !</li>
            <li> Total solution for the messy-looking array of cosmetics I had on my bathroom counter. From hairspray to moisturizer, everything fit into the slots! It is obviously good quality of acrylic.</li>
            <li> I use it to put all my foundations and setting sprays and It made life so easier. I no longer have to look for them. It&#x27;s a swell way to organize your makeup for beauty lovers.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints in any way about this item.  It is just the right size for holding my minimal makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality little organizer.  It is thick and the compartments are nice sized.  I have it on my counter with some bottles, a few brushes, and a couple little knick knacks in it...looks nice, works great</li>
            <li> Perfect for my vanity. Holds my medium to large size products. Very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this but when I took it out of the box it was broken.  I was disappointed about that but it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!  Exceptionally well made.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is made of plastic, but it is very heavy and sturdy and looks as if it was made of glass. I like it a lot and it was exactly what I needed in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This product has very good quality!</li>
            <li> Great size to organize bottles.  Does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It holds a lot in each section. I  fit 10 bottles and tubes of hair products, 2 paddle brushes and an extra large bottle of earring cleaning solution.  It looks nice up against all my other acrylic up on my vanity. The clear acrylic gives it an updated and clean look.</li>
            <li> This is a lot bigger than what I thought it would be.  As soon as I opened I was completely surprised. I&#x27;m very pleased.  Gives me plenty of room to put my supplies in, along with more room/organization in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Nice and roomy for your essentials.  I meant to purchase an organizer for small makeup brushes, lotions, primers, et cetra that come in tubes, however I should&#x27;ve payed more attention to the measurements listed.  I made my purchase based on the scale of products in the picture and when it arrived I was a bit surprised to find it is way bigger than I was looking for.  I still find it useful and use it to hold my larger body lotions and hair brushes instead.  Good quality, durable, and overall great deal, just make sure this is a size you want.</li>
            <li> Cleanser, toner, lotion,toothbrush, toothpaste, spray, etc. Whatever the daily needs for cleansing and dressing yourself can put into this organizer. I love the design, because it looks so elegant.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money for the quality and organization.  I managed to fit all my daily essentials and more and be able to tuck it in as easily as pulling it out.  No more mess, no more multiple bags of makeup.  Excellent item for the person that needs help in that department.</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s big enough to fit my bottles of lotion, sunscreen, lip gloss, etc. What can I say, it&#x27;s a good looking and functional container.</li>
            <li> good quality - very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love IT - this product is nice and sturdy tand will keep my make up products organized on my dresser</li>
            <li> I love this organizer, I use it for my craft items.</li>
            <li> This product is a great buy. It&#x27;s really good quality and keeps my vanity organized. A couple things I&#x27;m not too fond of is that it is pretty bulky and on the deep side. I use it for my brushes and foundations and i literally have to go into the compartments to get what I need plus small brushes get lost on the bottom. I fixed that aspect by putting crystals in the compartments so they&#x27;re higher up now and u can see the crystals so it does look a bit decorative. I&#x27;d recommend don&#x27;t know if id buy though. Probably look for something more shallow.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the bedroom and bathroom dressers tops and counter tops.  Looks fantastic and has deeper, larger compartments than many other acrylic vanity or makeup organizers.  I ended up ordering a second one as soon as I saw how well my hairbrushes and other beauty accessories fit.  I may even order a third, as I think it would make an excellent Mother&#x27;s day gift! Excellent purchase, thank you!</li>
            <li> After searching all over, we settled on this acrylic organizer to house the multiple remote controllers we have.  Also have enough room for storing a TV Guide, pencils for crosswords, a a pocket size pack of kleenix and cotton swabs.  The latter items are handy because out cats jump in my wife&#x27;s lap when she watches TV and it is the perfect opportunity to clean the little dears ears, or wipe their eyes.  For me, I am happy to finally have the 4 remote controllers in one handy easy to use corral.</li>
            <li> After purchasing and discarding several &amp;#34;organizers&amp;#34; I purchased this one.  It&#x27;s very well made, heavier acrylic and features just the right size slots and compartments to hold bottles and lotions of large to small size.  I will order this brand again.  I might add that the shipping was really fast and the packaging was perfect for the product size.  Itâ€™s great to get something that works on all levels. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, thick acrylic. Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Cheap and works perfectly for 4 boys to hold their toothbrush, toothpaste, and water cups!</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of these organizers.  I have purchased 4 or 5 of them.  Just an FYI if you are using it for face products - I use Dermologica - and several of the products are a foil like container.  I think that those products get warm and crack the acrylic.  The one my husband has his stuff in, and the one i use for my hair products - is perfectly fine.  Looks good on your counter top too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this organizer!  It holds a lot more than I had originally thought it would.  All the different products I use is now in one container and I can just pick-up/move-it for easier cleaning.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price, I kind of wish I had just gone with glass. This product is useful and great for sorting, but I was hoping it would look a little classier than it does. In general, I think I&#x27;ll stay away from acrylic materials as much as possible for a variety of health and aesthetic reasons.</li>
            <li> For about ten years now, I&#x27;ve had all my hair products shoved awkwardly into a big blue plastic shower caddy, which I stick on the top of my toilet for lack of any other place for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to &amp;#34;grow up,&amp;#34; which I did in this case by replacing the shower caddy (which had slanted sides, so it was impossible for me to keep any product straight) with this clear organizer. It was large enough for all of my hair products and also looks quite nice on my toilet. My one complaint is there didn&#x27;t seem to be any slots specifically for brushes. But that&#x27;s a small quibble on an otherwise great organizer!</li>
            <li> delivered on time, product as described, I love it, ease to fit in to my cabinet and organaze your things,  still using , thanks</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s spacious, durable, and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> this organizer item helps tidy up my bathroom ,makes it easy to find items,  although it has five compartments it holds so much more, and is neater than throwing  everything in a basket</li>
            <li> I love it really made my vanity organized thanks</li>
            <li> My wife and I now have a grown up bathroom and this keeps her crap organized perfectly.</li>
            <li> Use this in my esthetics room to hold back at items</li>
            <li> US Acrylic makes a high-quality product. Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> organized the top of the bathroom counter and it looks so much better....I was also surprised with the quality because it is so solid and sturdy</li>
            <li> Perfect for my make up table.  I am using this for brushes,tools,and my every day products.  This is sturdy and looks clean on the table.</li>
            <li> Just as promised. Helped us organize supplies in our baby&#x27;s room. May order another for our master bath</li>
            <li> very strudy and useful</li>
            <li> I used to keep my husbands toiletry items from overtaking the whole bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;When we have company, I just hide the filled  organizer underneath the sink, and put it back up when&lt;br /&gt;they leave and he doesn&#x27;t have to hunt for anything. When it gets dirty, a good rinse and wipe with warm water&lt;br /&gt;a quick dry with a paper towel or whatever and it&#x27;s ready to use again.</li>
            <li> I love this vanity organizer.  I had one for many years and it recently got a big crack on the bottom.  So I ordered a new one here on Amazon.  It is a great size and holds lots of beauty products, combs, brushes, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these to organize my cosmetics and makeup brushes.  Everything is at your fingertips and because it&#x27;s clear you can see what&#x27;s in each section.  I also like that it&#x27;s deep enough to keep tall items from falling over.</li>
            <li> Perfect organizer and looks very nice in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I thought this item was larger is size. Once I attempt to place my items in it I was a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It also was a little price e&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this Item</li>
            <li> Excellent!  &amp;#34;All that, and a Bag of Chips&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I ordered a second because I like the first one so much. I can slide it out from under my sink and have all my products handy. They slide back in and out of sight...perfect.</li>
            <li> Really do like this one.  It&#x27;s great for holding all kinds of stuff that I use daily.  The product arrived and scheduled and thank you!</li>
            <li> need to put hair accessories in a small compact area and this works pretty good, wish it was a little more narrow.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. Looks more expensive and pretty than what you think. Fits everything perfectly and ships fast.</li>
            <li> Very nice organizer, just as described</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.  Put into use on the day delivered.  Am satisfied.  Would purchase again if needed to.</li>
            <li> So glad I got this! Holds all my brushes well!</li>
            <li> Great quality and well worth the money. The build quality exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I need to hold my everyday face products, its very sturdy and looks wonderful on my vanity, it was packaged very well and was delivered on time</li>
            <li> This is a great little organizer for your taller, bulkier beauty items that seem to float around your drawers/cabinets. Having my items so well organized has actually saved me time in the morning since I don&#x27;t have to dig around to find things. Really nice quality and reasonably priced. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A TERRIFIC PRODUCT!  VERY HAPPY WITH ITS QUALITY, LOOK, AND DESIGN. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR EASY AND NEAT ORGANIZATION IN ANY ROOM OF A HOME OR AN OFFICE. POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS.</li>
            <li> Has a spot for all my makeup needs.  Especially like the ridged bottom, allowing lipsticks and other items to stand upright!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for what I needed and it is very sturdy and holds up nice. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice and useful product</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy, well made organizer. It has some larger compartments, which is nice. I am using it for some things under the sink in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This Product is a good organizational product --- whether you use it on your bathroom counters or underneath the sink for storage, you can see what&#x27;s in it.  It is very well made &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one !!</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy, and just as it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li> This is so nice , makes me look so organized. Ha ha . Every morning can get ready 4 work in a speed of light! Cos i can see everything @ once .</li>
            <li> More than I expected. Storage space is enough for all my products and fits nicely on top on the sink counter. The look is also appealing and matches the white bathroom tile. Definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pretty and practical organizer.</li>
            <li> Very nice, thick acrylic. Great for holding items that can clutter the bathroom, combs, hair accessories, toothbrush/paste, travel size shampoos, lotions.</li>
            <li> I am waiting for this organizer and my expectations were met! He is very roomy, all my makeup now in order. Recommend buying this PDA!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  In my opinion, the actual product looks prettier than the picture!  Acrylic around the outside is not flat - it has a slight wave to it creating an overall prism type effect.  Acrylic is not thin and flimsy.  Very solid, quality product.</li>
            <li> It came as described, but I wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> This acrylic container has made my life easier since I got it. Always searching in drawers now it right in front of me while I get dressed.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deep and sturdy, really well made, ordering more for other things. You can see everything which is important sometimes.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for organizing bathroom.</li>
            <li> This product helps keep my vanity nice and neat.  The quality is great as well as the price.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> perfect size for small bathroom tank storage -- nice &amp; sturdy</li>
            <li> A GREAT SPACE SAVER, AND I WOULD SUGGEST IF YOU NEED TO STORE MAKE-UP OR BRUSHES THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED.&lt;br /&gt;WELL WORTH THE MONEY AND I REALLY LIKE ACRYLIC. I HOPE THE FUTURE BRINGS OUT MORE ACRYLIC ITEMS INSTEAD OF THE OLD TUBBERWARE THAT STAINS AND YOU CAN NOT SEE THRU IT.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD PURCHASE IT AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;NICE ITEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mickeyitaly3@aol.com</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and filled with make up and body care products for her new vanity she got on Christmas.she is very happy and keeps everything organized.  ;)</li>

            <li> This organizer is exactly what I was looking for. The right height so you can fit taller and shorter thinks. Each compartment is large enough. The material that it&#x27;s made of is a really good quality.</li>
            <li> These work so well, Iput two of them in my kids bathroom.  It&#x27;s easy for them to see what is where and really helps keep the sink area organized!</li>
            <li> i thought is small but isnt .. kinda getting some space in my vanity. but Nice</li>
            <li> Great product and just as described. I liked it so much I ended up buying a second one to hold my lotions.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the sturdiness and the deep sides so things stand up. The kids want one for their bathroom now!</li>
            <li> Sturdy and perfect for all of my makeup brushes, moisturizers, deodorant, perfume, and foundation. Works great, and isn&#x27;t flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this organizer with another one from US Acrylic and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The organizer looks like beveled glass...made sturdy and looks beautiful! Definately recommend for the picky person!</li>
            <li> Nice little organizer.  Fits in my bathroom drawer perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these to organize my bathroom drawer for my make-up, combs and other personal items.  They are really nice quality.  I realize they are a bit spendy, but they will last a long time and I&#x27;m really glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> I love this, a lot bigger than what I was expecting! Great item!</li>
            <li> Great for organizing bathroom clutter.  You can easily see its contents and it holds things upright.</li>
            <li> This fits perfect in my bathroom drawer. The slots are generous in size. Having it in the drawer prevents everything from falling over. I&#x27;m going to order a second one to go under the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Love this organizer.  It makes the vanity top so much neater.  This is a nice, sturdy piece.  You won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It keeps all my things organize and it looks great in the bathroom. I recommend this product if you want to keep your hair brushes, hair ties, hair accessories and much more in an organized space.</li>
            <li> Perfect for organizing your clutter. Big enough for large size contact lense cleaner. With smaller. Compartments for baby tooth paste etc. Happy with this buy.</li>
            <li> Received this today and am very pleased with the transparent but thick and sturdy quality of this product.  It is as good as others have said.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect- exactly what I needed to get my makeup drawer in order!  It is exactly as advertised and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice organizer, its exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Very large. Holds a lot of beauty products. Sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It is perfect for organizing my makeup, etc. in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Very good quality. For my use (makeup) the compartments are a little too large, so the pencils, brushes, etc. don&#x27;t stand upright. Perhaps if it had another compartment or two that would alleviate the issue. But overall very good.</li>
            <li> Great organizer! Smears are barely visible.</li>
            <li> Very strong, useful and decorative. It&#x27;s very useful for my small bathroom. Being that it is clear it makes my bathroom seem more open and airy!</li>
            <li> Is quite big and works for what I needed it for!</li>
            <li> worked great, need to get everything organized for my son and all the supplies for his braces !</li>
            <li> Very high quality materials and construction. The size is perfect for the top of the bathroom vanity, and I was able to fit in all of my cosmetics without problem. I especially like the height of the sides, which are sufficiently high to keep items from falling out.</li>
            <li> This organizer was bought in tandem with another acrylic caddy for storage of my stuff in the bathroom. Now I don&#x27;t have to move 20 things when I am cleaning and it looks so neat on my bathroom counter. The slots are good size and lots of things fit in them.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product; would like two of the sections to be taller/deeper. I had read reviews before purchasing, and agree with others who said the quality was very good, as in strong and attractive.</li>
            <li> It i realized how many uses I would have purchased more than one.  Using in my office at this and the size is just perfect to organize the many little things we all keep on our desk.  I received on date expected and it was received in good shape.  Packaging was good.</li>
            <li> Perfect little organizer for inside bathroom drawers. This was exactly what I was looking for! I measured my drawer first to be sure it would fit, then ordered, got it, and popped it in. Perfectly stores all my makeup and the big compartment in it perfectly fits my brush and combs. Highly recommend if you want a little order in your bathroom drawers!</li>
            <li> Organizing your make-up and toiletries is a real pleasure with this attractive little organizer.  Now, I can find everything easily!</li>
            <li> Love helps keep everything organized</li>
            <li> Finally no mess in my bathroom. Love it!</li>
            <li> Just got this- very impressed with the quality. Using this combined with the 3 drawer organizer and it keeps everything organized and easy to access. Much better price than the popular acrylic organizers at the Container Store!</li>
            <li> A lot nicer then expected. Very good quality. Product arrived as indicated by vendor.</li>
            <li> My vanity was a mess...My wife constantly complains about my section of the vanity so cluttered and spilling over into her section..No problem anymore. After getting this organizer, my stuff is so clean and organized. Well spaced compartments to keep all the essentials.</li>
            <li> Searched in a few stores but nothing was what I needed.  I needed a product that would hold my skin care products and can be tucked away in a cabinet when not in use.  Being acrylic it scratches easily but the convenience far outweighs a few scratches.</li>
            <li> I use the product to hold me art brushes and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, for the bathroom.  Easy to wash and easy to view contents of compartments (of course! it is clear!); a better replacement for my cloth box/divider I had previously used.</li>
            <li> i would give this one *******SEVEN stars (if possible).  one of my all-time favorites because of it&#x27;s height and stability.  Easily contains top-heavy brushes.</li>
            <li> Good size,  sturdy, fits plenty of items</li>
            <li> This item was bigger than I thought but that was a good thing. The acrylic is very sturdy and it fit a lot of stuff. I got this for my daughter to help organize her dresser  the compartments are spacious. There are 4 in front and one long compartment in the back. Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Its a  little chunky looking and to wide for my bathroom sink but Im using it in the living room to seperate and organize items on my side table</li>
            <li> Wow! This is useful as well as nice looking in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> arrived timely and intact</li>
            <li> Product is very high quality.  This product was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> The shape of the vanity organizer is fine but the size of the compartments are not big enough to put big sized bottles and containers.</li>
            <li> I use it for my small bathroom since I like to keep a lot of stuff I use near my sink. My bathroom is definitely more organized now and not a cluttered mess like it was before!</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my everyday essential, like mouthwash, deodorant, etc. It&#x27;s a nice size and fits well on my counter. It has areas large enough to hold a large bottle of lotion. Its&#x27; hard to tell from the picture, but there are little dividers inside each compartment to hold various items in place. Good product, and it&#x27;s made of sturdy plastic.</li>
            <li> After placing my order yesterday, I promptly received my vanity organizer from Amazon (Prime membership) this a.m. and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I had read all the wonderful reviews about it, but still expected an organizer that was not only as sturdily made as this is, but also one that looked exactly as the photo shows. More importantly, it&#x27;s a little bigger than I had pictured and serves as an ideal size for my more frequently used hair styling products, deodorant, perfume, and hair brush. My bathroom vanity is fairly small and has always looked like a mess with my various products scattered all over it since I never have time to keep it neat and tidy. Now if only I can find another vanity organizer to put my frequently used cosmetics in that&#x27;s made as well, but not quite as big, I will be a happily organized lady!! Another big bonus  about this product is that it was made in the USA!! How refreshing since not many things are made here anymore. Guess that explains why it&#x27;s made well. I&#x27;ll sum up my review by saying it&#x27;s another fantastic find thanks to my favorite place to shop that never lets me down~ thank you Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smaller compartments seem to be a bit too big for items that I wanted to store, but nice looking product.</li>
            <li> Amazing holder to my full collection of make up brushes. It&#x27;s big enough and light weighted. The transparency is a big advantage.</li>
            <li> This five-compartment vanity organizer is made of a heavy, durable acrylic.  The four smaller and one large compartment handle many different shapes and sizes, and it is weighty enough not to tip over when filled.  The acrylic is clear and it is easy to read labels through it.  I keep all kinds of bottles of perfume on a bathroom shelf; this is an elegant way to keep them together while making it easier to clean around and under them.</li>
            <li> Love it! Compact but functional</li>
            <li> high end quality. nicely place it in the bath room. :)</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this.I&#x27;ve tried too many to count.  Most are too short for hairbrushes and combs. This holds everything beautifully. Hairspray cans and brushes-no problem. Each cube is big enough to stand multiple items in. Very sturdy and well made. So glad I found it. My counter is neat at last.</li>
            <li> Can hold a lot of my beauty products in an organized way. Wish it didn&#x27;t have that very very short little separator on the front sections. Sturdy material and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for me. Good quality, solid and ridged. Not flimsy thin acrylic.</li>
            <li> Great organizer for my bathroom counter! I really needed it thanks to my growing skincare products.</li>
            <li> Great for organizing toiletry items in the bathroom and on the dresser.</li>
            <li> I needed a small organizer to fit on my limited space bathroom countertop. This is perfect. Everything fits and is now so organized. Very well made. I recommend buying this. :)</li>
            <li> This really helps organize items so they&#x27;re not all falling over.</li>
            <li> It could be larger but my things are organized now, so that makes it nice.  I really could use 3  or 4 of these:), I have so much to organize-Brushes, tools, etc.  But, I  like it.  All of my acrylic items are nice with good weight, not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but it&#x27;s bigger than I would of like it to be.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my medicines and other items to keep them together as I need them in the a.m./p.m.  So happy I found this product.  Would definitely recommend it.  Packaging was great and came on time.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 based on the reviews, they are Spacious and Sturdy organizers..will be buying more to keep and give as gifts</li>
            <li> Very useful, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are nicer-looking than you would think, being made of acrylic.  They are a good size -- you can fit plenty in one of these.  And they are attractive on your bathroom vanity.  Nice organization tool.  I bought a second one for another bathroom, I like it so much.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Thick acrylic that seems quite strong. It is  bigger than I expected, which is nice. There is one long compartment the length of the organizer, then 4 smaller compartments. I am not using it for makeup but for the things I keep on my bedside table. It is perfect, just what I needed. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This organizer sits on my bathroom counter because I have a double sink and needed a way to sort my mess of products. I neatly tuck everything into the compartments and they are easily accessible while eliminating the clutter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to have a place to put all of our hairsprays, hair gels, brushes, etc. and it works perfectly.  In fact, I thought it might not hold all of the products my husband and I have, but it did with room to spare.  Love that it organizes everything and makes our bathroom look much nicer.</li>
            <li> I read the description, but still didn&#x27;t realize just how large this organizer is. It&#x27;s also very thick and extremely sturdy. I purchased two of them so I could use one on my office desk for pens and misc. So glad I did. Great piece for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> My bathroom sink looks so much better now!</li>
            <li> We bought this for our mom who is in assisted living and has minimal counter space. This product looks great on the counter top - clean and uncluttered.  Perfect for the job - I will be buying more for myself!</li>
            <li> Love to organize everything,so I can find it fast.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this organizer!  Perfect size and good weight and quality.&lt;br /&gt;But mine arrived with a crack, otherwise i would have given 5 stars!! Had to send it back and re-order another one.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to get my new organizer!</li>
            <li> Larger than expected!  This was bought to organize makeup brushes for my daughter (who has ALOT of brushes!).  She was so surprised at the size and overjoyed that it fit all her brushes, with room to spare!</li>
            <li> I have 4 electric toothbrushes and associated toothpastes for 4 different family members in the four small sections and a stack of paper cups + a bottle of mouthwash in the larger section. It&#x27;s perfect for my purposes! I wash it in the dishwasher occasionally and it cleans great.</li>
            <li> The Vanity Organizer is the best thing ever! Just kidding but really I use it to organize the products I use everyday and obviously it works great. Good quality not sure if it&#x27;s the best price out there but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Thank You. Fits the need.</li>
            <li> This works well with my cosmetics, makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> Perfect for storing my makeup and hair styling accessories.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep body sprays and lotions in one place. No more searching everywhere. Just grab spray and go.</li>
            <li> Very nice vanity organizer, strong enough to hold all the materials. Front 4 and back 1 compartments really make it convenient to put all your stuffs-in. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Was perfect for the makeup and hair products I use on a daily basis that wouldn&#x27;t fit in my makeup drawer.  It was exactly what I had been looking for and it is easy to find everything when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> A woman&#x27;s must have! Larger than expected and holds a lot. Keeps everything handy and clutter free. Recommend to anyone who needs quick organization.</li>
            <li> I am using then organizer in a bathroom cabinet.  I am very happy!!  I holds even not than I thought for the picture.  I use round brushes in my hair and it easily hold all 6 plus three hair brushes.  The front section is all open and holds almost a whole bag of cotton balls.  Totally wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my bathroom.  It&#x27;s just the right size &amp; because it&#x27;s clear, it doesn&#x27;t seem as obtrusive as it could.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> They are nice, but really not that impressive, not like crystal at all as some of the review said.</li>
            <li> This organizer started cracking the same evening I got it.  After several days it almost broke into pieces and I have to throw it into trash can and make sure there&#x27;s no small piece left on my vanity.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed to help organize our bathroom drawers.  They fit a surprising amount of stuff and helped us double our storage and keep everything right where we can see and reach it quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it...very sturdy...just what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> i was really excited to receive this box i use this for storage. it arrived on time and looked great. also appeared to be durable. had it for a few weeks and noticed a large crack on the bottom of the plastic. the crack eventually spread and the box fell apart . i thought maybe it had just accidentally broke so i bought another one. this time it remained on my self. the same crack appeared and eventually the box broke again. i was pretty dissapointed</li>
            <li> Quality acrylic and great organizer</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as some others and has wavy pattern in it that I didn&#x27;t love but I&#x27;m keeping it in a closet so it doesn&#x27;t matter so much.</li>
            <li> Nice products. Just as described.</li>
            <li> Good quality and very useful</li>
            <li> Great way to organize skin care products.  Looks nice on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, shiny, perfect fit for my bathroom cabinet! Love both pieces I purchased!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, perfect for my makeup vanity.  Looks nice enough to leave out on top.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Highly recommended! Shipped immediately! Exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Just what I wanted! Found another one at a store from you folks so I have several of your products. You folks should contact Luminous Air Cosmetics in Texas and design a the inside liner for a to go make up case. Thanks again Anne Souza&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. if you do that hope mine will be free lol...</li>
            <li> Organizes the items I use everyday.</li>
            <li> Very helpful organizer for small items (nail polish, lotien bottles, tweezers, etc.) that would otherwise roll around in your storage drawers.  Liked it so much I ordered a second one!</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> US Acrylic organizers are a HIGH QUALITY product that I have ordered to fit my vanity drawers. I ordered about six of these ad all of them fit nicely. US Acrylic has so many different sizes and configurations that you will not be disappointed when you order these organizers. I will order many more of these. VERY WELL MADE!!!</li>
            <li> good product works well nice quality</li>
            <li> this sits on my vanity top and is looking awesome. de-cluttered my vanity.</li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I had estimated, but looks strong, does the job, and is very convenient. I would recommend getting this if you don&#x27;t have much storage space in your bathroom and frequently have items all over your counter. If you&#x27;re still wanting some space, get a shower caddy and just put it up next to your sink. It will give you even more space for miscellaneous items. I got this product for toothbrushes and toothpaste, but now holds makeup, combs, nail clippers, tweezers, brushes, and more on top of that. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really like that it has different compartments.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps things really handy &amp; easy to move so I can clean the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Wish one of the compartments was a little bigger so my husband&#x27;s shaving cream could fit in it.</li>
            <li> It was a bit bigger than I expected, but very thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The organizer is perfect for tall items.  I needed something to hold hair products such as hair sprays, dry shampoo, straightening sprays and flat iron protection sprays.  These items are heavy and tall, and normally would fall over if I moved or shifted the container I had them in.  I like to keep them in an organizer so that it is portable, and also to keep the counter or cabinet clean.  This is so sturdy and thick, even my husband commented on the quality.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality.  It would also hold make up brushes as pictured.</li>
