            <li>This stuff is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>An amazing product.</li>
            <li>After an application my lips are nicely covered</li>
            <li>this is a really nice lip and face moisturizer, i love it</li>
            <li>Yes, I love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially great for burns, heals and soothes the pain instantly (which is why it&#x27;s in the kitchen).  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my face and lips.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to apply more moisturizer until after I wash my face in the evening.</li>
            <li>My lips have responded beautifully to it without an adverse reaction (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry winter skin and for eczema.</li>
            <li>Awesome for dry skin lips</li>
            <li>, can I use that Sweet Bee?&amp;#34;... music to my ears... and skin!</li>
            <li>We love all Medicine Mama&#x27;s Apothecary&#x27;s products, but the Wand is special to my children for it&#x27;s accessibility and application ease.  </li>
            <li>This product is so smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>I love Mama&#x27;s Bee cream, and this is the same formula, which makes it good stuff.</li>
            <li>Our skin heals so quickly when it&#x27;s under the magic of Sweet Bee.  </li>
            <li>First of all, this stick is huge and I love that.</li>
            <li>It leaves a light, fresh, taste that dissipates after twenty minutes once the product absorbs.</li>
            <li>I ordered and got it so quickly, and as soon as we put it on, it started to heal.  </li>
            <li>I used it when my daughter decided it would be fun to pick up the habit of continually licking around her lips.  </li>
            <li>I put it on at night and right after washing my hands</li>
            <li>Lighter than the Sweet Bee magic skin cream but equally moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is great on hands but not safe for face.</li>
            <li>and that is not a bad thing, and this product is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>wtf?&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped with the dryness!</li>
            <li>We received our first &#x27;stick&#x27; of it as a sample from a Whole Foods rep we knew.  </li>
            <li>My children find it very soothing for every bump, bruise, and scratch.  </li>
            <li>One of my daughters loves it so much, she convinced me to buy one for her teacher.  </li>
            <li>Very emollient, but there&#x27;s an ingredient in it that my lips don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use much at all.</li>
            <li>Most natural lip balms I have used in the past tend to have a strong manufactured taste or an off putting chemical taste after a while.</li>
            <li>I have been on a long quest for the perfect lip balm due to chronically dry lips.</li>
            <li>However, I was spending a fortune on that particular item.</li>
            <li>The balm itself is smooth and it immediately melts to my lips upon contact unlike a lot of other balms which tend to take too much effort to apply.</li>
            <li>It is not one of those skinny tubes that lip balm normally comes in</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Most recently, she had a small blemish on her face and really wouldn&#x27;t leave it alone.  </li>
            <li>Overly large and will last you awhile.</li>
            <li>Hard to get more natural than this.</li>
            <li>So far, all I can tell is different is the texture, this is much creamer</li>
            <li>I ended up using this on her and it completely soothed her skin and cleared it up within a day.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My lips needed a natural lip balm that did not contain petroleum and this has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive and could never digest anything heavier than seaweed cream from body shop.</li>
            <li>on myself or my 16 month old daughter.</li>
            <li>It will last a long time and it is priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li>Our special little girl has skin problems and we refuse to use steroids if there is any possible way.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for a few weeks now and it has softened up since it first arrived.</li>

            <li> I have had it for a few weeks now and it has softened up since it first arrived.</li>
            <li> so I like to spray my face with moisturizing water and then apply a very thin layer of the Bee Magic.  </li>
            <li> and we all use it constantly for our dry lips and cracked knuckles.  </li>
            <li> so I use it on my really dry hands.</li>
            <li> Where I work I have to wear gloves all day long, so my hands get very dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so hard to find where I live.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips and saw the reviews on this.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out like other products can.</li>
            <li> We use ours everyday, multiple times throughout.  </li>
            <li> Odd scent, lots of grease, minimal moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Her face, once again, got so dry and chapped and raw.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one does not provide much relief for me.  </li>
            <li> It literally healed the rash that took up half her face within a day.  </li>
            <li> My eye area was getting very dry (wrinkles!!!)  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let the price mess with your head (&amp;#34;$11.00+ for lip balm????????  </li>
            <li> So I did a little google and came up with this product.</li>
            <li> I slather it on at night but just a little during the day since it looks greasy (olive oil).</li>
            <li> I use this product as an eye cream during the day and also for my dried and eczema prone lips.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who has trouble remembering not to touch my face, so I wanted something to keep in my purse that I could use on my hands that would work for my face.</li>
            <li> The formulation is thin and my lips feel dry within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Following more than two weeks of a bad cold, I had chapped lips, chapped nose and an irritated upper lip moving toward cold sores.  </li>
            <li> Usually it lasts all day</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a thin, slippery consistency that is not appropriate for outdoors wear.  </li>
            <li> so it is not particularly good for putting in a pocket, but I leave it by my computer to use during the day.  </li>
            <li> so it is not good protection for your lip or face in the sun, but it is moisturizing, if a bit greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Her skin was so dry and painful.  </li>
            <li> Kids at school were asking me what was wrong with her face.  </li>
            <li> This soothes her and preserves her skin from her nasty little fingernails.  </li>
            <li> When we&#x27;re out and about in this cold, I have one in my purse</li>
            <li> She ended up getting a very bad rash.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a really great size. Overly large and will last you awhile. I have had it for a few weeks now and it has softened up since it first arrived. No waxy feeling at all and it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out like other products can. Very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this product. I had become sold on a product similar to this called Boom. However, I was spending a fortune on that particular item. So I did a little google and came up with this product. So far, all I can tell is different is the texture, this is much creamer and that is not a bad thing, and this product is so much cheaper. I like and will continue to use it. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> super-moisturizing, and good for any place you have skin.  don&#x27;t let the price mess with your head (&amp;#34;$11.00+ for lip balm????????  wtf?&amp;#34;).  it&#x27;s a big fat tube, so you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply amazing.  We received our first &#x27;stick&#x27; of it as a sample from a Whole Foods rep we knew.  I used it when my daughter decided it would be fun to pick up the habit of continually licking around her lips.  Her skin was so dry and painful.  I ended up using this on her and it completely soothed her skin and cleared it up within a day.  Most recently, she had a small blemish on her face and really wouldn&#x27;t leave it alone.  Her face, once again, got so dry and chapped and raw.  We ended up putting some coconut oil on it, some moisturizer; nothing worked.  She ended up getting a very bad rash.  Kids at school were asking me what was wrong with her face.  I immediately thought of this product, but since we were out, I tried what I had on hand.  Well, thank goodness for Amazon Prime.  I ordered and got it so quickly, and as soon as we put it on, it started to heal.  It literally healed the rash that took up half her face within a day.  Absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> We use ours everyday, multiple times throughout.  My children find it very soothing for every bump, bruise, and scratch.  Our skin heals so quickly when it&#x27;s under the magic of Sweet Bee.  One of my daughters loves it so much, she convinced me to buy one for her teacher.  We love all Medicine Mama&#x27;s Apothecary&#x27;s products, but the Wand is special to my children for it&#x27;s accessibility and application ease.  It sits on a shelf in the kitchen, and they always know they can find it there.  It&#x27;s especially great for burns, heals and soothes the pain instantly (which is why it&#x27;s in the kitchen).  When we&#x27;re out and about in this cold, I have one in my purse and we all use it constantly for our dry lips and cracked knuckles.  I hear them say &amp;#34;Mom, can I use that Sweet Bee?&amp;#34;... music to my ears... and skin!</li>
            <li> I love Mama&#x27;s Bee cream, and this is the same formula, which makes it good stuff. But it&#x27;s a thin, slippery consistency that is not appropriate for outdoors wear.  I use it at night at home several times before bed and it is soothing and healing.</li>
            <li> Yummy. I love this stuff for my face and lips. It&#x27;s convenient to put on after washing up in the evenings. MM&#x27;s has the best products!</li>
            <li> Since i have been diagnosed with blepharitis, i cannot put any lotion, no matter how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; the claim, without my eyes freaking out. My eye area was getting very dry (wrinkles!!!)  My acupuncturist introduced me to this line. Wow. No irritation whatsoever and totally moisturizing. I slather it on at night but just a little during the day since it looks greasy (olive oil). Read the ingredients. Hard to get more natural than this. Love.</li>
            <li> Never without this in winter - the best for your lips or anywhere you need moisture on the go fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips and saw the reviews on this.  It is not one of those skinny tubes that lip balm normally comes in so it is not particularly good for putting in a pocket, but I leave it by my computer to use during the day.  It does NOT have sunscreen in it so it is not good protection for your lip or face in the sun, but it is moisturizing, if a bit greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> When I saw the word wand I thought the product was applied with a wand like lip gloss. It&#x27;s not. For the lips it&#x27;s an oversized stick. Would work for the face but I got for the lips.</li>
            <li> Great product- love it</li>
            <li> Very emollient, but there&#x27;s an ingredient in it that my lips don&#x27;t like so I use it on my really dry hands.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry winter skin and for eczema. I use this product as an eye cream during the day and also for my dried and eczema prone lips. Lighter than the Sweet Bee magic skin cream but equally moisturizing. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only thing I can wear as eye cream</li>
            <li> Awesome for dry skin lips</li>
            <li> I have been on a long quest for the perfect lip balm due to chronically dry lips. Unfortunately this one does not provide much relief for me.  The formulation is thin and my lips feel dry within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> My lips needed a natural lip balm that did not contain petroleum and this has exceeded my expectations. First of all, this stick is huge and I love that. It will last a long time and it is priced very reasonably. Second, it is not flavored but I do not mind the taste. Most natural lip balms I have used in the past tend to have a strong manufactured taste or an off putting chemical taste after a while. This has neither. It leaves a light, fresh, taste that dissipates after twenty minutes once the product absorbs. The third thing I want to rave about is the texture. The balm itself is smooth and it immediately melts to my lips upon contact unlike a lot of other balms which tend to take too much effort to apply. This product is so smooth to apply. After an application my lips are nicely covered and I don&#x27;t have to use much at all. Lastly, it does hydrate my lips. I can apply once in the morning for the entire day without a need to re-apply. My lips have responded beautifully to it without an adverse reaction (I have sensitive skin). It is just wonderful and I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Love it. My skin is so sensitive and could never digest anything heavier than seaweed cream from body shop. But I can actually apply this on my face and my skin does not get irritated. Can use as sleep mask to provide whatever you need through the night.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I use it everywhere.  The blow dryer always dries out my face so I like to spray my face with moisturizing water and then apply a very thin layer of the Bee Magic.  Usually it lasts all day and I don&#x27;t have to apply more moisturizer until after I wash my face in the evening.</li>
            <li> Our special little girl has skin problems and we refuse to use steroids if there is any possible way.  This soothes her and preserves her skin from her nasty little fingernails.  We carry this with us at all times.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Ive ordered this twice already! Its good for everything but its my favorite as lip balm!! I use it to help set my eyebrows after makeup, i use it on any bumps, bites, scratches, etc. on myself or my 16 month old daughter. I love it! I won&#x27;t ever be without it!</li>
            <li> Odd scent, lots of grease, minimal moisturizing.</li>
            <li> this is a really nice lip and face moisturizer, i love it</li>
            <li> Following more than two weeks of a bad cold, I had chapped lips, chapped nose and an irritated upper lip moving toward cold sores.  I bought this at the suggestion of a woman at a food coop, applied it to my chapped lips and nose before bed and in the morning all irritation was entirely gone.  I now use it as lip balm and, when traveling, on my face.  An amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is great on hands but not safe for face. I am one of those people who has trouble remembering not to touch my face, so I wanted something to keep in my purse that I could use on my hands that would work for my face. I have plenty of zits to attest to the fact that this causes them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so hard to find where I live. It&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t use it on my face. Where I work I have to wear gloves all day long, so my hands get very dry.
