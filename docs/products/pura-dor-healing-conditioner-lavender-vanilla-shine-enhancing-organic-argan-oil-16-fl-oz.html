            <li>I&#x27;m vegetarian and in excellent health, but as the doctor was including &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;Or&amp;#34; in his notes, he said, &amp;#34;This conditioner may be &#x27;organic&#x27;, but then again, so is poison ivy!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>and I got good results.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves hair feeling so nice.</li>
            <li>I saw some really good reviews about this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is good.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, some websites recommend this brand to customer as well, so this product must be a good choice for your hair.</li>
            <li>It is a good thing that it is wrapped with plastic</li>
            <li>Although the conditioner feels good in my hair, once it is rinsed out, I can&#x27;t get my fingers through my hair and need to spritz in a detangler.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good too.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good conditioner for your hair.</li>
            <li>Thus, it is best fit for my hair.</li>

            <li>I eat a quality seasonal diet comprised of good meats and veggies, pasture raised eggs and dairy.</li>
            <li>I found this to be surprising.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair smooth and silky, and smells great, too!</li>
            <li>You will have to use a lot to condition your hair and it still does not feel like it coats it like a good conditioner</li>

            <li>Really nice smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a very soothing scent and I like that my hair smells great when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li>The products have a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I just want a conditioner that detangles, doesn&#x27;t leave you hair residuey-feeling, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and works</li>
            <li>I make my own &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m not all that impressed with this conditioner, as much as I am with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but is not moisturizing to my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a week and have liked the way my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>Nice to find something the whoe family can use.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells herbal and the conditioner smells nice-</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, a really good quality shampoo with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what the rave is about.</li>
            <li>But honestly for me</li>
            <li>For the price, I will use my own conditioner on the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>Waited since September 2014 to make a review: Hair still fall&#x27;s out, does nothing to keep my hair healthy,  and it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with all the products!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am loving this with the accompanying shampoo.</li>
            <li>Really nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>Washes nicely.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cost effective product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and seems to go haywire with frizz and no control</li>
            <li>What I am saying is that it promotes healthy scalp resulting in an environment primed for grow with a good hair care regime.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent too.</li>
            <li>, i do not recommend this product for dyed hair, or any kind of hair for that matter</li>
            <li>I am using the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Conditioner for six month now and can honestly state that&lt;</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice, doesn&#x27;t run off until I rinse.</li>
            <li>Plus, the scent is nice, but I don&#x27;t smell it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The shampoo on it&#x27;s own will leave your hair feeling neglected and stressed.  </li>
            <li>It gives nice shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;LL ADMIT THE SHAMPOO DOES NOT SMELL NICE, BUT IT IS WORKING</li>
            <li>IT LATHERS NICE</li>
            <li>As the shampoo is a bit pricey I decided to wait to see if I liked it.</li>
            <li>Pura D&#x27;or makes spectacular products and I&#x27;m thrilled to have been referred to them.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells good and my hair has never felt better</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the whole transaction, and the product</li>
            <li>Smells real good, tried the shampoo left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to help ease my hair loss and liked the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it is nice.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair nice volume and shine.</li>
            <li>I still liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>It also had a nice, not overly perfumed, smell.</li>

            <li>The product is really awesome with real organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>My relatives liked my hair and I never thought of facing hair fall problems.</li>
            <li>Everyone around me is asking what kind of hair product I am using.</li>
            <li>Works really well and smells great!</li>
            <li>One week after using the shampoo, I was thrilled to see that the cowlick had drastically improved, even though it&#x27;s still there</li>

            <li>Awesomely effective.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is nice but doesn&#x27;t wash out well.</li>
            <li>Works well with Shampoo, leaved hair nice after wash.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say, that i do not think  it will grow hair?</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that it work as well as my $30+ salon conditioner and will continue using it.</li>

            <li>I love the feel and the smell of my hair, not to mention that my hair is really easy to manage now!!</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend to anyone who is looking for the best product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is equally good and leaves my hair easy to manage and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Great conditioner, smells nice and brings volume to my hair (use adequate amount).</li>
            <li>I have tried many conditioners and this one feels very satisfying</li>
            <li>The smell is really quite the cherry on top of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It did not do a good job of nourishing my hair or making it easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>Does smell nice and is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; so far at best.</li>
            <li>The shampoo however has a very strong chemical spell in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty good!</li>
            <li>I usually never review items, but I have to say this is one of the best products i have ever used for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair did not get greasy and I have even been able to skip a day between shampoos (which is so much better for my hair!)</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and the fragrance does linger in the hair after use, but it&#x27;s light and smells nice and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Good consistency in the hand and lathers up fine.</li>
            <li>Has been a great product, smells good &amp; does not leave a film or a heaviness to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>good conditioner makes my hair smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li>The best conditioner I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see this being any more effective than $5 conditioner.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent of the shampoo, although I&#x27;m not as thrilled with the scent of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice scent to it and gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li>- Comparing to Invati, the conditioner has equally nice smell, this one more manmade smell than the Invanti as the Invanti has ginsense smell.  </li>
            <li>So far this conditioner has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>I pair it with the pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo and so far I am very happy with the result.</li>
            <li>Works well, natural ingredients and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This conditioner did a good job of keeping my hair and scalp smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>And off course it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li>I waited a good 6 weeks before posting this review as I believe a product like this takes time to see and feel genuine results.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This method allows me to customize my hair’s needs because even though I try to use the most kindest of products, hair spray and even a touch of it is not so nice when comes to build-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 08 months and is the best so far, besides the added benefit of it being organic</li>
            <li>It is the best by far conditioner that I have put in my hair.</li>
            <li>The creamy texture and very mild scent certainly are plus factors that make this purchase an excellent one.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner, I could tell a difference in my hair right away.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and it felt fuller and softer...</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It is also nice and shiny and feels very clean (no</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky, smooth and manageable, really all I need and it smells ABSOLUTELY amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I loved it specially</li>
            <li>The smell is also pretty great.</li>
            <li>but it turned out it smells sweet and good.</li>
            <li>I think it leaves your hair with a nice clean smell and have had people comment how nice my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has sort of a more sophisticated &amp;#34;baby-fresh&amp;#34; scent in my opinion, but it&#x27;s not bad and it is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The product is very smooth.</li>
            <li>This conditioner applies on very smooth and helps keep my permed curls bouncy.</li>
            <li>hair feels very smooth after using it</li>
            <li>Feel very COMFORTABLE with this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light - not overpowering, which I like.  </li>
            <li>Upon first impression, this conditioner smelled amazing, so I was hopeful that it would work as good as it smelled.</li>
            <li>It is very mild and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It is very mild and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was a thinner consistency, but nice and easy to rinse out also.</li>
            <li>but I do believe its a good product to help prevent hair loss (have realistic expectations people!!!)</li>
            <li>Having a product that is organic, while providing a superior feeling of clean and conditioning to my hair, is worth every cent!!  </li>
            <li>it works just fine for me! :)</li>
            <li>pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner have both been amazing for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is growing fast and is super healthy!!!</li>
            <li>and I have to say after using it for just about 2 weeks I have seen a huge difference in my hair&#x27;s health!  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and honestly I&#x27;m in love :)</li>

            <li>however I can confidently say that this is a much better product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad with the hair loss shampoo.</li>
            <li>However, after using it for a couple of months, I started notice that I have more hair.</li>
            <li>I do see more hairs coming in -</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos,  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll like it!  :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found these Pura d&#x27;or products</li>
            <li>I also recommend using the conditioner with the pura d&#x27;or argan oil hair-loss prevention shampoo for much better results.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner it leaves my hair well conditioned, feeling thicker, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt smoother and I had more shine.</li>
            <li>It is however carcinogenic free and smells nice.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have been looking to replace my favorite conditioner (Pureology)</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>It provides an effect to make the hair look more fuller.</li>
            <li>Takes the static out of your hair in the winter months.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for sure.</li>
            <li>This product seems to check all the boxes for me:  my hair is more manageable, I do not notice any hair loss from breakage, and my scalp is not at all irritated.  </li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the shampoo (which I really like) and I am happy with how my hair comes out smelling afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my hair has been thinning more and more every year.</li>

            <li>This conditioner is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>shampoo but have not been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It needs something to make it more detangle when you rince it out.</li>
            <li>Product was not compatible for me however I am sure based on the reviews its a quality product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>

            <li>I just purchased this product a week ago, I can tell you, I love the vanilla/lavender scent.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic conditioner!</li>
            <li>I use it with the hair loss and thinning shampoo and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells okay</li>
            <li>I also bought the tranquility shampoo and love them both.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the look, feel and health of my hair</li>
            <li>it does not smell like lavender vanilla - more like baby wipes or baby lotion.</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, as the vanilla overpowers the lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>Better, but still tangled, I had to add oil to get tangles combed out.  </li>
            <li>Phenomenal conditioner.  </li>

            <li>Absolutely love this conditioner.  </li>

            <li>I would buy again. :)</li>
            <li>This product has a wonderful fragrance which I finally remembered smelling at the beach when I was a child.  </li>
            <li>It has a bit of a minty feel on the scalp which is refreshing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also not going to throw the bottle out, and will try it with another shampoo to see if it has better conditioning benefits than if used with the companion shampoo.</li>
            <li>The fact that its all organic is even more satisfying.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>

            <li>I love everything about this conditioner.</li>
            <li>sure whether it&#x27;s the conditioner or shampoo,</li>
            <li>My hair is not falling any more. :))</li>
            <li>Will update this review in a month for a better feel for the product.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I just unscrew the top.</li>
            <li>It really did a great job.</li>
            <li>I do love the lavender scent.</li>

            <li>Looking forward to using more.</li>
            <li>I love it , it does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but too pricey.</li>
            <li>I have longer hair, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts is because it doesn&#x27;t do the best job detangeling.</li>
            <li>Sure doesn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it&#x27;s organic.....</li>
            <li>This has a great smell and my hair feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;m glad that I had it with that shampoo.</li>
            <li>love the smell and how it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>The product had somehow leaked out thru the top when I received it.</li>

            <li>I love the shampoo and the conditioner</li>
            <li>makes me love it even more.</li>

            <li>When you put it on and comb it through it works even better.</li>
            <li>This one is ok but leaves my hair</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo shows its magic during shampooing where it reduces the hair fall</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>My hair stylist also began noticing the redness as well as hair loss on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>On Amazon after reading many reviews to find a replacement shampoo without sulfates, I found Pura d&#x27;or Hair Lss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo and to boot it promotes hair growth &amp; fullness.  </li>
            <li>The redness stopped after a week of use and my hair felt better and thicker.</li>
            <li>I have used for more than one month.</li>
            <li>I gave it one more shot and bought this stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable.</li>

            <li>Love the pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>the smell is just ok.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and now i get compliments about my hair :))</li>
            <li>and I am glad she did.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product &amp; will order again.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that using most shampoos makes my hair fall out more.</li>
            <li>it is MUCH better than it was.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with these products.</li>
            <li>Nice light conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>They have purchased this item and will recommend it to as many people as they can.</li>
            <li>Love purador products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did--</li>
            <li>Also the volume of my hair is substantially more.  </li>
            <li>it may require the use of more.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair nice and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the conditioner especially that it is organic.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>LOVE...</li>
            <li>Would have been better not to have used it at all.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have tried many thickening shampoos and they just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The conditioner I focused more on application to my strands, versus the roots of my hair.</li>
            <li>Again, you will love the scent and feel your hair gets from this conditioner</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love how my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the shampoo contains a DHT fighter.  </li>
            <li>This is better than going to the dermatologist and using whatever  they recommended.  </li>
            <li>Others love it</li>
            <li>but I think the Gold label it better with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I do like the fact this product is made with mostly organic oils.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>so my hair continues to grow and stop thinning :)</li>
            <li>I want to use both in order to get better results.</li>
            <li>it leaves you hair shinny and healthy</li>
            <li>Love using this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is outstanding in every way.</li>
            <li>To be truthful</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo (LOVE THE HAIR LOSS PREVENTION SHAMPOO) and conditioner together</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a need anymore to use gel because I love the way the hair looks after it dries out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this with the Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo - that I love.  </li>
            <li>( this is what my hair looks like shiny and healthy)</li>
            <li>Definitely, the best working conditioner for my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair has more shine and is so much more manageable than before using this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this a while back and since then, I have found it to be one of the best conditioner for my hair.  </li>
            <li>have to use more to give better insights.</li>
            <li>you-flat overwhelming, either.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this product after reading many reviews after 6 month of use</li>
            <li>love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I feel my hair is getting better,</li>
            <li>Conditioner is okay</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used the shampoo (gold) this conditioner (blue)  for about 5 weeks and have been very happy with both.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Ya never know when the next best thing will come along!&lt;br</li>
            <li>At that point I wasn&#x27;t too sure the conditioner was going to work, I assumed it was going to leave it</li>
            <li>I guess it didn&#x27;t matter too much because the conditioner smelled great.</li>
            <li>#34;I love this stuff!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my hair look as well, healthy and shiny.</li>

            <li>The product is bit highly priced, but if it helps with hair loss, I will be happy.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very nice, it smells good and leaves your hair super soft..</li>

            <li>Very clean</li>
            <li>It is pretty good.</li>
            <li>So, in sum, perfect for the hair on my scalp, inadequate for parts of long hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals, smells good, and the dispenser is great!</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo for Hair Loss first and followed it with the conditioner and loved the way my hair felt after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for most people as it is not a chemical smell</li>
            <li>natural creamy lavender smell, makes me happy knowing how sweet my hair smells, love it!</li>
            <li>I like the conditioner as it is very light on my thinning, fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I like the conditioner as it is very light on my thinning, fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>One quick rinse at the end of the shower will do it nicely.</li>
            <li>and I am able to comb easily through my hair after showering.  </li>
            <li>Best conditioner in the market to treat dry scalps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Argan Oil for years with excellent results on my hair, but after a day or two my head would feel dry again.</li>
            <li>Let me first start out by saying the lavender vanilla smells incredible and very calming!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy so far!  </li>
            <li>Great natural conditioner!</li>
            <li>my first order, I&#x27;ve reordered two more bottles to make sure I don&#x27;t run out !  </li>
            <li>This is a very classic conditioner which does a good job conditioning your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products and totally impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>Other products by  Pura d&#x27;or&#x27; are okay, the hair loss shampoo is excellent!</li>
            <li>There are no chemicals in the shampoo, it lathers up very nicely, it has a pretty nice smell, my hair does feel fuller, and the argan oil does also make my hair feel much softer.</li>
            <li>and it’s a nice clean but light scent.</li>
            <li>It feels very full.</li>
            <li>It is not extremely moisturizing but great for me on most days.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product sends me into a wonderful special time when someone in my life used that fragrance (lavender mixed with something).  </li>
            <li>Unless you plan on getting some eye disease or cancer continuing to use cheap hair products like Pert or the rest of them, you need to spend for for something worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I&#x27;ve find a natural product that is helping me.</li>
            <li>Way better than the crappy cheap conditioner I was using before.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a really great smell but made me hair oilier than it is naturally.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my hair smooth and easier to comb, but the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite, in fact, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I smelled it in the store...</li>
            <li>Great conditioner, non toxic ingredients, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great on my naturally curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It is a great product that leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair is much more manageable and feels extremely smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I am impressed after the first usage - my hair indeed moisturized and felt soft.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t get allergic reaction, which is most important for me, so I will  keep using it.</li>
            <li>After rinsing my hair out it feels great and soft.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>So far makes my hair seem thicker smells great.</li>
            <li>Though others have made claims to the contrary, the bottle states that the conditioner is SLS free and mostly organic.</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li>Second time conditioning with this brand  showed incredible difference in how my hair flowed and shined.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this conditioner if you are looking for silky smooth and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, Natural ingredients that keeps your hair very moist and healthy.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell than you will be enjoy this.</li>
            <li>This organic conditioner smells great and gives my hair a soft, silky texture.</li>
            <li>primrose oil taken internally, every day, along with fresh, organic healthy food, multi-vitamins, lots of exercise and visualization is what worked best for me.  </li>
            <li>Great natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>I accept aging very well and believe I am doing a good job at it.</li>
            <li>After so I have found good oranic conditionar and it really works.</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad, but not the greatest for my hair......</li>
            <li>I no longer do the combover or spend 30 minutes teasing my hair to get it just right to hide bald spots!!</li>
            <li>what a super product....  just what I needed to help control the &#x27;gray frizzies&amp;#34;.... I really love how smooth my hair feels with these products!  </li>
            <li>It makes her hair so smooth and shiny after she deep conditions it and on top of that it smells so good!</li>
            <li>Wow Sensational I have never in my life experienced so much satisfaction in coming into contact with any concept or circumstance which could yield so.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice smell and leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I need something more rich and conditioning, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>My hair significantly reduced to fall, more manageable and it gives some volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>I am trying to use more to get the most out of this bottle, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend introduced me to a great product rather a hair doctor, Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil hair conditioner and the hair fall prevention shampoo of the same brand, which worked magically to reduce my hair fall and rebuild my hair.</li>
            <li>Even though I am a guy, I use this conditioner because it is effective, safe to use and really affordable.</li>
            <li>This conditioner comes in a sturdy pump bottle that makes it easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and wash off.</li>
            <li>My hair look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>I have hair that gets oily easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy drying and styling.</li>
            <li>and I can easily manage my hair now.</li>
            <li>Easy to manage after towel drying.</li>
            <li>but when it dries it leaves my hair much more smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Easy to distribute through hair.  </li>
            <li>but I think it more felt over clean...</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a thicker consistency and it was easy to use and rinse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soo strong.</li>
            <li>Still, your hair will come out shiny and strong.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, I love the texture of my hair and my scalp is healthly and</li>
            <li>and I get migraines from the strong scents.</li>
            <li>Product doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either.  </li>
            <li>but the smell can come off as strong.</li>
            <li>It really does help you hair have a good, smooth texture.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend a try of Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t trust all these raving reviews, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re paid, nothing special about this product, nothing to rant and rave about.</li>
            <li>The thickness of the hair is apparent and it looks great.</li>
            <li>After washing and conditioning my hair felt significantly thicker and more smooth.</li>
            <li>full statisfied now :)</li>
            <li>This one is way more creamier and has a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It also makes your hair soft and smell nice!</li>
            <li>Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the products first and then let the girls each give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;The Premium Organic Argan Oil Based Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo is one of a kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried conditioners and this is hands down the best.</li>

            <li>/&gt;This is the best conditioner on the market hands down.</li>

            <li>I purchased this conditioner after using the pura d&#x27;or premium organic shampoo, this product is excellent as well, there is less hair in my shower drain and my hair never felt cleaner or healthier.</li>

            <li>It was a good smell but not usually a scent I would choose for my hair care products.</li>

            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and plan to keep on keepin&#x27; on with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that while it smells nice, it does smell kind of girly.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughters hair is gorgeous from it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell, smells like vanilla and leaves my hair soft with a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Constant use of this shampoo and conditioner has helped eliminate dandruff problem which I have been battling for more than a decade and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching for a good shampoo and conditioner for quite sometime before I had decided on this.</li>
            <li>This is not 100% natural (99%), but has good reviews, so I decided to try both shampoo and conditioner of this brand.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner does a good job of making my hair feel soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>good and soft.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The added bonus is that I feel good knowing this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good...keeps hairline strong!</li>
            <li>Having used it for the first time , I can immediately feel its  magic power , because my hair stops coming off like before and it is shiny and easily combed .so</li>
            <li>I inherited a full head of beautiful wavy hair, that is now a unique white in front and salt and per throughout the rest.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner and it has a great scent and leaves my hair shiny and it smell fresh &amp; clean without harmful chemicals &amp; sulfates, so its a big bonus!</li>
            <li>The price is right andI love that it is organic.</li>
            <li>It feels rich when applying it and makes my hair feel smooth and and silky as well as making it tangle free and shiny.</li>
            <li>when she used that shampoo, she thought that&#x27;s very useful to deal with her hair loss</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it; I love the smell of the shampoo (tea tree oil smell), but am not crazy about the smell of the conditioner (I&#x27;m used to it now, though...</li>
            <li>Great product, havent been using it for a really long time but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The product felt clean and chemical free.</li>
            <li>Before, my hair is super unmanageable and hair falls easily.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first however after using it my hair feels light and healthy without build up.</li>
            <li>conditioner smells a little stronger (aromatic) in scent from it’s shampoo counterpart, but nonetheless still very pleasant</li>
            <li>I used to use Nioxin and decided to try something new, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and my hair is so soft and not frizzy at all!!</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve been using their conditioner my hair has been much softer and much more easy to manage.</li>
            <li>, I am a very sensitive person, I cannot use most of the products out there because  I am allergic to so many things.</li>
            <li>I would go great lengths for this conditioner and am quite sure it has completely taken over my old favorites.</li>
            <li>it lasts a long time and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited for it to work too</li>
            <li>Between the two I have seen significant improvement in the quality of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased the conditioner after using the shampoo for many months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in my hair loss with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I fell in love after the first shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I originally purchased it in January.</li>
            <li>It has not made a significant difference in my hair quality, hair strength, hair loss/thinning, or hair growth.</li>
            <li>I also noticed no change in hair growth after 8 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:&lt;br /&gt;After about 8 weeks of use of this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Works great for my long, wavy hair that gets dyed from time to time.</li>
            <li>Its just been around 3 weeks since I started using this shampoo, but I can see a significant difference in my hair texture.  </li>
            <li>WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>It is worth it!</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Love thi s stuff so much!</li>
            <li>Having tried many so called replacements, I found Pura d&#x27;or to be exactly what it purports to be.</li>
            <li>She was not as excited as Emmaleigh</li>
            <li>and it probably has been the best thing for my fine slow growing hair.</li>
            <li>This product can make hair less loss is very good step up.</li>
            <li>I have included a new picture to show you how nice my hair looks now.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to move to clean eating and cleaner health and beauty care products.  </li>
            <li>I am just going through it way too quickly and it isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>It does clean my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>Works great on dry and thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Hair feels moisturized and clean after use.</li>
            <li>great.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, RINSES CLEAN AND</li>
            <li>It feels a bit dry but the results on my hair are great.</li>
            <li>This conditioner nourishes and gives the clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is light and fresh, and leaves the hair light as feather.</li>
            <li>I love the healthy smell of the ingredients used and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Simple but effective, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have thinning hair but the lack of SLS and parabins leaves a completely different, yet pleasant, after effects.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell that lingers until the next washing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft, clean and with a nice aroma.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing and makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>but I am very sensitive to any kind of fragrance</li>
            <li>The natural approach makes so much more sense!</li>
            <li>I find it o be nothing special</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that any conditioner is going to prevent hair loss, but I do believe certain ones give a much better appearance of density.  </li>
            <li>Everything is all right!</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and this was the first time after using an organic conditioner that I didn&#x27;t have frizz or flyaway&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I expected a great product.</li>
            <li>It goes well with the shampoo with nice smell, like it so far after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner because I use the same brand shampoo, and it is organic and smells good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering how much of the product I have to use per condition, I might try something else out to see if I can get a better bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is not only good</li>
            <li>but my wife said it smell so nice too,  it doesn&#x27;t harm your hair and helps in making it soft.  </li>
            <li>I liked this conditioner because it made my hair feel soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t work well and have too much perfume.</li>
            <li>Although I am not a huge fan of the smell, kind of too sweet to my liking, but overall, very happy for my purchase!!!!</li>
            <li>The Pura D&#x27;or blue is not as good as the Gold Premium version I have found.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I feel like this conditioner really protects my hair from heat and makes me able to go longer in between hair cuts</li>
            <li>I really have been enjoying this product</li>
            <li>I mostly use cleansing conditioners and decided to try this because I really like the argan oil that this company makes.</li>
            <li>but it is true my hair is not falling like before</li>
            <li>I can honestly say my hair has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>OCT Garnier works much better, at much lower price...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really looked closely to see if I see any baby hair growing (according to most of the reviews)</li>
            <li>Good luck to all of you with the same issue I had.</li>
            <li>Overall, good results for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>But overall, good product.</li>
            <li>Just a mild, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Overall good conditioner</li>
            <li>Not as good as conditioners from a regular store.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft with a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely smell of lavender and the scent lasts for a whole day.</li>
            <li>So far i am loving this product.</li>
            <li>It says that it slows hair loss, and that is actually true.</li>
            <li>Good second act to the Gold label.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to LOVE this conditioner as much as the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma and no harsh chemicals and additives.  </li>
            <li>I am assuming it&#x27;s true as it is written on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>TRUE..</li>
            <li>There are some tried and true brands I stick with</li>
            <li>/&gt;See FULL REVIEW HERE  </li>
            <li>and I feel this makes my hair more rich and vibrant</li>
            <li>I have a medium thickness, very (very) straight hair that&#x27;s easily tangled and breaks.</li>
            <li>The conditioner does that rare task of conditioning really well, without leaving a coating; it rinses cleanly and feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>the fact that I&#x27;m now virtually completely gray around my face, and that I take an oral chemo drug every day, and you have the perfect setup for thinning, dry hair.  </li>
            <li>This make my hair super soft and nice.</li>
            <li>My hair feel really soft and love the smell really easy to style after wash my hair</li>
            <li>This is great conditioner leaves hair soft, with shine and bounce, no heavy residue or build up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great body builder for limp fine hair.</li>
            <li>question the accuracy of the many positive reviews because of the offer for free conditioner if a positive review is written.</li>
            <li>Both my temples and nape are filling in slowly but surely (Yay!!!</li>
            <li>Although it serves as no aid to  hair loss function wise like the shampoo does, this product certainly restores the feel of hair after the natural cleanse, form the corresponding shampoo.</li>
            <li>1.&lt;br /&gt;We have been using this condition among other products, and we are quite happy.</li>
            <li>I started using this immediately based on the feedback from other customers who have great results.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair feeling clean and healthy, and I am seeing some new hair growth and volume.</li>
            <li>I guess if you are looking for a super lightweight conditioner - this is for you.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner absorbs quickly and leaves no residue after rising.</li>
            <li>;  However, as a formerly long-haired guy, I can tell you conditioner will make your hair softer and more manageable, which is why most women use it.  </li>
            <li>Also my finger nails are growing so quickly</li>
            <li>I can already see a tremendous difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Only one I don&#x27;t love about it, the scent does not smell like &amp;#34;lavender and vanilla&amp;#34;, its more like a lavender and almond.</li>
            <li>This product also contains argan oil, which has helped strengthen my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>The trick is to use my palm and massage it quickly without stopping.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>great effect lasting the whole day</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>She also loves it and has super curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I was super consernd than my friend recommend this products</li>
            <li>Super lightweight, did not feel like it was conditioning my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>It all arrived so quickly</li>
            <li>Hopefully the shedding will subside quickly.</li>
            <li>Use with the shampoo will tremendously reduce hair loss.</li>
            <li>I like the way the conditioner leaves the texture of my hair, and the mild smell of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Even on high humidity days, I have better control over how my hair looks</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and if you let your long hair dry before brushing it, it brushes out easily.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure what ingredients are doing this, but whichever ones they are, they are working miracles up top, and smell extremely different than most conditioners that I&#x27;ve used...which is usually almost always a good sign in my book.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference in my hair from the very first use.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable having my whole family use it!</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Either this condition is too light without enough deep conditioning ingredients to provide a good slip to the hair post-shampoo (regardless of shampoo used), or it just cannot compensate for the harshness of the companion shampoo, I haven&#x27;t been able to determine that yet.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown back and it&#x27;s much more healthy, feels soft &amp; more manageable.  </li>
            <li>if the hair falling out now needs to come out to make way for new healthy hair or if I&#x27;m still not getting to the root cause of my hair loss issue.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hear that tangles easily and have tried some of my wife&#x27;s conditioners that say they detangle.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well but my hair was not as easy to brush through after washing.</li>
            <li>I hope to see long term results that last and prove that this is the best combo of shampoo and conditioner for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I shampooed and conditioned my hair a week after the relaxer and my hair was just as soft and beautiful as when the salon products were used, only this product is organic</li>
            <li>As I grow older I find that my skin has become overly sensitive to many chemicals, specifically many of them which are being used in health/beauty products (the irony).</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel very soft and manageable, i have yet to use it more.</li>
            <li>I am trying this conditioner with same brand shampoo, looks like it is very good, hair is not dry</li>
            <li>My conditioner expectations are pretty straightforward:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the hair loss shampoo from Pura d&#x27;or as well and the combo is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Not as rich or hair supporting as the  description led me to believe.</li>
            <li>I got this conditioner as a present from my aunt, and I truly love it!</li>
            <li>the curl is comming back to healthy n shinny!</li>
            <li>I really like it!!</li>
            <li>Most importantly the first time I used it  my hair felt soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>and actually I lost more hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve payed a lot of money, looking for a good product to avoid my hait loose, and finaly</li>
            <li>It not only leaves my hair detangled but it doesn&#x27;t have that the strong perfumed smell that most conditioners have.  </li>
            <li>And your hair will feel silky smooth, comb better, and lay down better.  </li>
            <li>Through the years I have had a challenge with using regular conditioners because it seemed it would cause my hair to fall out more easily.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo seems to dry my hair out, but following up with this conditioner seems to leave it with the perfect moisture.  </li>
            <li>It did however work on my daughters fine virgin straight hair...</li>
            <li>Smell is really refreshing, however, doesn&#x27;t spread quite easily, would need a few more pumps to for longer hair.</li>
            <li>certainly nothing smooth or silky</li>
            <li>Overall I liked the product it has good mild aroma as expected.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner, a little pricey though</li>
            <li>think I am going to go to TJMaxx (cheap Natural hair products) or the Health Food Store and get Conditoner for Fine Hair (organic type) and use instead.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s nice, but I think I need a little more use before deciding that this will be my conditioner for life.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have used quite a few great organic conditioners.  </li>
            <li>This is such an amazing experience to use purad&#x27;or company&#x27;s products and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>After using this for a few weeks I can say that the results are great.</li>
            <li>I use a heavy duty conditioning treatment to help style my hair and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Theorie&#x27;s Argan Oil conditioner, which is an amazing product, but it just wasn&#x27;t conditioning enough to compensate for the shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and seems to be working great.</li>
            <li>Fantastic combination with Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo and my hair are really vitalised</li>
            <li>It really works on my hair and make my oily scalp comfortable.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fantastic thing.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky soft and fuller :)</li>
            <li>far as cost, I believe is it better than the rest.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading many reviews and like what I am seeing so far.  </li>
            <li>and the result is far better with Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pics aren&#x27;t the greatest (I&#x27;m tired tonight), but I hope you can see a difference in hair quality.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot for the price.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with how well this product is working so far.  </li>
            <li>With the conditioner I have to use probably 50% more than with the old conditioners.</li>
            <li>Even my hair dresser commented on how healthy and soft my hair felt, and this is just after about a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>Definitely gave a nice feel to my damaged hair after use.</li>
            <li>I love this Argan oil even though this is my second day using it my face feel so smooth</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li>only thing is I feel it is kind of expansive.</li>
            <li>So far love how the product feels.</li>
            <li>If you want a conditioner that is worth every penny you are offering then this one is for you.</li>
            <li>Gives my wife&#x27;s hair a sexy natural shine</li>
            <li>So the tradeoff is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s always been very healthy and can grow quite long.</li>
            <li>and I wanted the hair that I have left to look nice.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and silky and looking shiny, all while smelling great.</li>
            <li>It is also the priciest, but I love that it has all natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>The product is well worth it.</li>
            <li>so far:-)</li>
            <li>Smells like there is not artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s hair regrowth abilities, but it has a great scent, which helps eliminate the gold labels&#x27; strong scent btw, and it washes out easier than most conditioners and leaves my hair felling less dry and fuller/thicker.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and manageable after using this product, and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I will be using this product from now on and the cost is well worth its qualities.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural</li>
            <li>So far, pleased with the smell, lather and feel of both of these products.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li>and we are not unhappy with our choice of Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have all of the ingredients that the shampoo has that&#x27;s suppose to combat hair loss, but it does contain natural, healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Has a nice gentle natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>More natural looking and not so &amp;#34;stressed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This product is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh smell of it.</li>
            <li>There is no way to tell if it actually helps prevent hair loss but the shampoo and conditioner are high-quality products that make my hair look nice</li>
            <li>so I am early on in the process to be able to leave a definitive result.</li>
            <li>Since I have started using it, my natural hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a product with out the harsh chemicals most stores carry.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell on that, but it is nice using a product that works so well with no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week but really like it so far as my hair looks more naturally healthy, has more body and feels thicker.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that its all natural and better for the environment.</li>
            <li>but it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is bit pricey but worth everything you spend.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but had to write one for this SCAM.</li>
            <li>It smelled like the shampoo, the Argan Oil does have a distinct scent.</li>
            <li>feel moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is a bit pricey but worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair feeling fuller and with less hair loss in the shower, and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and smelling very pleasant, like vanilla.</li>
            <li>Made my hair very easy to comb through - great smell and left my hair extra soft.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair more body and keeps it from being too fly-away due to static electricity.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not strong and over barring leaves your hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>You can tell the shampoo washes out nicely and leave behind a nice clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>but I do notice that my hair gets oily pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair is incredibly soft, so clean, looks fuller and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Strong enough but not too strong and overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to file them every other day, which I think is a good sign.    </li>
            <li>It smells AMAZINGGGG too!&lt;br /&gt;Its not better than my JASON organic biotin condition, but its a great condition to make ur hair soft if you wanna splurge. :)</li>
            <li>I have used multiple sulphate free products in the past, and this one is one of the best ones.</li>
            <li>Make sure to leave it in for awhile (more than a few minutes) to get the full effect.  </li>
            <li>It conditions my fine hair without weighing it down and gives it a nice feel.  </li>
            <li>wow-you can tell a difference right away..</li>
            <li>, I thinking I am in the right product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair silky and sleek right after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s making a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Started using right away and.</li>
            <li>Still lost some hair the first shampoo, but by the second one I didn&#x27;t notice any loss which I found amazing.  </li>
            <li>It should be better on normal straight hair.</li>
            <li>i recommend the ultra labs hair lush - better hydrating, smells good, and does prevent hair loss - didn&#x27;t notice hair growth but did notice less hair loss.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-hair loss decreased(did not totally stop yet,we hope eventually it will stop with frequent use).&lt;br /&gt;-the product has a pleasant</li>
            <li>/&gt;-hair loss decreased(did not totally stop yet,we hope eventually it will stop with frequent use).&lt;br /&gt;-the product has a pleasant</li>
            <li>My hair feels very elastic, strong and is very shiny.</li>
            <li>This organic conditioner has a creamy feel and high end texture that will leave you hair fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I only eat organic food, and now I finally found an organic shampoo and conditioner that works great and smells really fresh.  </li>
            <li>but I felt the shampoo was helping my hair so much that I wanted to get the full benefit of both products used simultaneously.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so greasy as regular brand conditioners, which I guess maybe because of the lack of chemical components to help you getting the feeling of smoothness, that&#x27;s why if you do want to achieve the same kind of feeling of nourishing after bath, you have to put a bit more on your hair and let it stay for a longer time before rinsing off.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only been weeks and my hair feels so good , soft and fuller!</li>
            <li>If you research the ingredients they use you will see all of them are good for preventing or slowing down hair loss.</li>
            <li>I understand that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is a little bit different, but it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>the quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The product seems of very high quality</li>
            <li>It felt really soft and full again (my son used to say &amp;#34;Your hair feels like spider webs&amp;#34; as a toddler, it was a compliment!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as instantly conditioning as other conditioners, but my hair feels really nice after using, and, as noted before, it smells so nice.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>it leaves hair soft, just enough shine and really good smell.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but made my hair dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to report back in the future but as I said before, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it provide great moisture and care to beat up hair, but you can smell the scent on your head for up to an entire day after using this.</li>
            <li>Very waxy, leaves a heavy residue or coating on the hair and not all that great a detangler.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair really soft and easy to comb after showers.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Only thing is that you really have to pump out a lot and can feel kind of watery.</li>
            <li>It has, after a few weeks use, really started to deal with my thinning hair by imparting great volume to it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my hair feeling clean but the ends of my hair tangled easily.  </li>
            <li>I have used other hair loss shampoos in the past - this is the best so far, and this product has a nice scent As well.</li>
            <li>I love to shop organically, and have been using farmers markets and local farms for years, so when I found this product I decided to step away from those commercial conditioners full of chemicals and try this, I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I liked that the conditioner worked well on my fine, thin hair which tangles easily.</li>
            <li>I am a 59-year-old male and my hair is very important to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend very much...</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo very much.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I once had conditioner in Hawaii and it smelled very much like this.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde color treated hair and was looking for a more natural product that actually made my hair look and feel good.</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair feeling smooth silky and even in the heat my hair does not get frizzy using this conditioner, give it a shot - its worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased so far!</li>
            <li>so I need a good conditioner, something a little heavier</li>
            <li>Along with significantly reduced hairloss, my hair and is now lively and shiny, too.  </li>
            <li>Besides that, the product itself is decent and overall nice product.</li>
            <li>Feels good in my hair and a little more silkier than my regular conditioner!</li>
            <li>Saw results after first shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells nicer than the shampoo (shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like anything) and it keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After my first use I immediately noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I started buying wigs and felt like my life as a pretty woman was over.</li>
            <li>First, I bought this shampoo, conditioner, and oil.</li>
            <li>I noticed an immediate difference in my hair texture the first day.</li>
            <li>I love it, hope they will make it in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li>My hair has been growing more since i have been using it for only two weeks!!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am okay with the product.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it then feels light and full, so it actually is a treat to style and work with.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in an Organic non-paraben conditioner because my hair seemed to be falling out in handfuls every day...</li>
            <li>I decided to try this conditioner although many reviews for the shampoo said to only buy the shampoo.</li>
            <li>First off it smelled hideous.</li>
            <li>Great product the portion size is what sucks.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure because it felt like I had to use a lot of it to actually feel it in my hair</li>
            <li>This is my first conditioner I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I tried many different brand with Conditioner</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It is also organic which we also try to use, and most organics especially with</li>
            <li>After I used several times, I found my hair loss is getting better.  </li>
            <li>Towards the middle of 2014, I started researching oils for skin, hair, to nails to see what they were all about because so many oils were being touted as the solution to all our beauty needs.</li>
            <li>To squash the moodiness, I learned that simple is better when it comes to what I put on my skin and</li>
            <li>From the first time i used this conditioner</li>
            <li>Really wish I&#x27;d found this sooner because it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also bright, ghostbusters, green.</li>
            <li>After using the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo, this conditioner leaves my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>just used it today for the first time along wiht the Tranquility shampoo and my hair looks and feels beautiuful!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I may get my thyroid hormones tested just to make sure that is functioning properly as well.</li>
            <li>But what really ticks me off is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>but I come back to these ones because they are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Thanks purad&#x27;or!</li>
            <li>first week - My hair is fuller and some hair is growing.</li>
            <li>it seems pretty good！</li>
            <li>Tangled hair, no shine, and dryness) with first use</li>
            <li>First time using this brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been experiencing falling hair for several months (more than 50 strands a day) and tried everything.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had hair fall for about an year while I tried many different shampoos and conditioners but to no avail.</li>
            <li>After I started using it, I understand the benefit at the first time.</li>
            <li>I first started using the anti-hairloss shampoo without the conditioner</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I first purchased this after being on the search for an organic hair set of shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it will work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Therefore I bought it and we can see the difference even in first week of using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>What I found to be even more helpful to my hair is to apply some coconut oil prior to a shower.</li>
            <li>Essentially I have felt a natural luxurious feel to my hair, great piece of mind knowing this conditioner has natural ingredients to help lock in that beneficial stimulating cleanse from the shampoo, for the day.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Pura d shampoo and this was my first use of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has much more volume and is finally starting to grow quicker and is thicker already!!!  </li>
            <li>Hoping a consistent improvement in  my hair with the help of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like it so much!</li>
            <li>Coupled with the Shampoo, I find this conditioner leaves my hair feeling really soft and light.</li>
            <li>How ironic!</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels afterwards, and the smell is terrific.  </li>
            <li>first bought a hemp conditioner for some weeks</li>
            <li>Tried both for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with my hair my entire life (more than 30 years).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time to use Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m only saying that because I love argan oil</li>
            <li>Love this product, and rave enough about it.</li>
            <li>I checked the label to make sure it is actually conditioner and not lotion.  </li>
            <li>after used this conditioner, I feel that my hair is smooth and soft and continued for two days.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed if my hair is thicker, yet, but I like it well enough to give it more time.</li>
            <li>Especially it works better when I use Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label).</li>
            <li>I ordered this version first</li>
            <li>It definitely had more body.  </li>
            <li>I believe I have found a real winner!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s natural but not silky, smooth.</li>
            <li>I always keep an extra bottle at home in case I run out before I remember to order some more.</li>
            <li>The first night I used it, I could feel the nourishment provided by this oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love both products and will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and leaves my hair soft, silky and managable.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner especially since it was a bit cheaper at $20 for a 16 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>Towards the middle of 2014, I started researching oils for skin, hair, to nails to see what they were all about because so many oils were being touted as the solution to all our beauty needs.</li>
            <li>To squash the moodiness, I learned that simple is better when it comes to what I put on my skin and</li>
            <li>I have used these products for several months now and my hair has never been better.  </li>
            <li>may finish the bottle but add another conditioner to help detangle my hair more. will continue use and update later</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Still using  the first bottle  </li>
            <li>Its natural and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to see if this conditioner was truly color safe and it is - no color residue on my white hair towels!</li>
            <li>and I am able to groom it properly.</li>
            <li>I tried the shampoo and conditioner first the day after they got here.</li>
            <li>My hair stays in good shape of curls, not as messy as before.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells good, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, lathers well.</li>
            <li>I have been using different kind of shampoo and conditioners before but after using this product my hair became very soft.</li>
            <li>conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a product that not only works, it&#x27;s is NOT going to kill me using it, and it is so natural and made from mostly vegetables, that you almost can drink it!</li>
            <li>I was kind of worried, at first, about the scent based on some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li>I was kind of worried, at first, about the scent based on some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li>Though I know a lot of my hair fall is due to stress and managing my stress is probably the best hair loss prevention for me, this is this first product that I&#x27;ve noticed less hair fall while showering throughout my cycles of stress.</li>
            <li>probably a good product for someone who doesn&#x27;t have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine and limp hair and using this product makes my hair strands more thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li>I originally made this purchase for myself but now use it for my young daughters as well.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner in conjunction with the Argan Gold shampoo from the same line works very well for strengthening existing super fine hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I finally found another great shampoo and conditioner for my very fine, thin hair after trying forever...</li>
            <li>Smelled great, but left my hair feeling rough afterwards.</li>
            <li>This product left my hair feeling extremely soft and manageable, not to mention the scent of this conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and it lathers very well but just does not leave my hair as soft as it could be for the price point.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this conditioner and shampoo, I used to have to blow dry my hair before to look good, but now I just let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>I was so used to the slickness of silicones both in my shampoo and conditioning product that I had no idea how natural, clean hair felt.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t been using them for a long time yet, I am very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>As far as healthy, it seems to be natural</li>
            <li>Making hair grow more is very scientific topic and technical problem.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing and seem to need to use more than I would if using a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells good, I used few days, it&#x27;s really helped save my hair.</li>
            <li>At first large amounts of hair came out which almost made me stop.</li>
            <li>This stuff along with the hair loss prevention shampoo and pure argan oil have really improved the condition of my damaged hair!</li>
            <li>My hair seemed damaged, flat and dead, nothing helped make it look full and feel great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with how little hair I lost while shampooing.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and helps tame my frizzy, curly hair!!</li>
            <li>For me the price was a bit high but was worth it for the bottle size and using organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft and silky!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would keep using this conditioner for the positive effects it has, but it may not be for everyone...</li>
            <li>It does nothing positive for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife bought this product for me after she saw lots of positive reviews online</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great, it definitely increases volume in my hair, comparing to other conditioner I have been used for years.</li>
            <li>This conditioner work great for African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair that most shampoo and conditioner does not work well with.  </li>
            <li>After the first time I used this I could feel a difference; and that is because the product has a volumizing effect that helps a lot when you have lost so much hair.</li>
            <li>Currently, I use it about 3 times/week and it was been doing the job with keeping my hair from becoming dandruffy.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is OK; but if you have long hair like I do - it will not de-tangle it.</li>
            <li>leaves your hair feeling full and really soft.</li>
            <li>So far, the claims from Pura d&#x27;or appear to be true.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness and have become a true fan.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and was noticing a lot more hair loss than normal lately.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an organic product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, does the job and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and cream rinse really make my hair feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all tangled and feels a bit dry almost like you&#x27;ll never get it untangled and smooth again!  </li>
            <li>With only first use of this conditionars my hair become so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that I am having more volume when I dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but hey, this is organic and after dry my hair, my hair stays so much better than before.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>However, while applying, it didn&#x27;t give me enough confidence that my hair will be easy ti untangle</li>
            <li>Mild natural lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>Even with the large amount of conditioner I used, I still don&#x27;t feel like my hair was conditioned.</li>
            <li>I did my research and watched certain talk shows and found out about this product.  </li>
            <li>Allow the scalp to soak in the coconut oil and then use the Pure d&#x27;or Shampoo and Conditioner to wash the hair off.</li>
            <li>I also have 2 daughters that help out with the reviews for certain products, hair care is one of them.</li>
            <li>After I used this brand shampoo, I wasn&#x27;t sure any conditioner would help as it made my hair bone dry (just for the first week or so while my hair adjusted to it), but this soaked right in and made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Bought this after reading all the positive reviews and I have to say that the hype is real.</li>
            <li>both contain anti-har-loss extracts, and with using the both of them PLUS taking biotin, I&#x27;ve noticed new hairs emerge!!  </li>
            <li>I found my new hair care pair!!  </li>
            <li>first time I used it I was amazed at how soft it left my hair and how much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I love trying out new and different hair care products.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t seem worth the cost when I can get more shampoo and conditioner twice the size and half the cost.</li>
            <li>Secondly this product is not intended or good for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I was using a Pantene 2 in 1 product previously and find this product far superior.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean, and does not weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I&#x27;ve had to use a leave in AFTER conditioner in conjunction with this just to keep my hair looking decent.</li>
            <li>If I had to be picky about this product, it would be the fact that I am going through it much faster than pure d&#x27;or shampoo; and I&#x27;ve had my shampoo bottle longer.</li>
            <li>Throughout this whole period large amounts of hair would come out in the shower</li>
            <li>but this conditioner is very thick and does a great job of moisturizing my hair after i shampoo it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair flat and smells strongly like baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>The only downside of this conditioner is that as light as it is, it doesn&#x27;t help much with giving my hair some volume.</li>
            <li>My roommate gave me a bottle of Premium Organic Conditioner in a few month ago, I used it and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li>It saved my hair which was totally damaged from a &amp;#34;conditioning rinse&amp;#34; I purchased (and trashed) and it kept my hair smooth on a very humid day.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, the smell is amazing after using few days</li>
            <li>I know the product does not claim to grow hair, I really believe with my attitude and by stopping it from falling out, the reverse process is bound to happen.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works very well in my hair.</li>
            <li>but after a whole week my hair seemed to get adapted to it</li>
            <li>I really like how this product makes my hair and scalp feel.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>But this one doesn&#x27;t really work for</li>
            <li>I had and still have hair loss problem and decided to give this a shot as the reviews seemed to be promising.</li>
            <li>But really did not help.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This product is better than expected.</li>
            <li>I have very picky hair</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind it, though.</li>
            <li>I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li>And a bottle lasts about 1-2 months depending how much you want to use.</li>
            <li>I became very concerned and decided to try Pura d&#x27;or:</li>
            <li>It work really well.</li>
            <li>Not so much, anymore.  </li>
            <li>unlike the shampoo, I feel that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t actually do much.</li>
            <li>I refuse to pay the price for the real &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; anymore.  </li>
            <li>but this one is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This is a very hydrating conditioner.  </li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife purchased this conditioner and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Really like how the conditioner smooths the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>however I have straight hair.</li>
            <li>This product has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, after losing so much hair</li>
            <li>but with a much richer conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Very drying for curly hair, would not recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li>I would really like to throw it away, but I don&#x27;t believe in wasting products.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my mom and it really works for her.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much healthier, and my confidence is returning.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soothing and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It really weorked for me.</li>
            <li>It has so much bounce</li>
            <li>/&gt;She absolutely loves this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I can really go that 4th day without washing if I wanted to.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much time with it</li>
            <li>The whole family is using it.</li>

            <li>and like it so much that I am going to try the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Pur D’ or.  </li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Pur D’ or.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey for sure, but the bottle lasts 3 months before it is empty</li>
            <li>For the price (for the shampoo and conditioner) I expected more.</li>
            <li>My hair look really shiny just after 2 applications.</li>
            <li>My hair stopped falling out so much the day I started using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, my hair stopped falling out</li>
            <li>I also really like the scent as well.  </li>
            <li>I have already noticed that I am not losing hair as much as before.</li>
            <li>Everyone commons how shiny my hair looks, thanks to the Purador.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it actually began to make my hair really soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>actually looks natural and healthy.</li>
            <li>I am a 25 year old male and have a receding hairline along with thinning hair on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s so far working better than Invanti.</li>
            <li>I have been highlighting my hair for years now and tried so many products to keep my hair soft,bring the shine back,and most important of all prevent our crazy hair loss...</li>
            <li>I have been highlighting my hair for years now and tried so many products to keep my hair soft,bring the shine back,and most important of all prevent our crazy hair loss...</li>
            <li>I will be honest I am not a huge fan of the smell of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product and conditioner for about one week and as expected have not seen much results but can say it sure smells good and leaves my hair feeling softer with a somewhat fuller appearance, possibly due to a bit of thickening.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and  silky!!!</li>
            <li>After having used for a few weeks, I feel it is a very good conditioner as compared to the other ones in the market - it&#x27;s organic and there is no SLS.</li>
            <li>After the first time use, I found the hair in my bathroom is much more less than before.</li>
            <li>Other products have left my scalp itching; this soothes my scalp and makes the hair soft and it also smells great.  </li>
            <li>I got it last weekend , and use 2 times,feel good,my hair feel more smooth than i use other conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and conditioners tend to weight it down and cause it to be greasy.  </li>
            <li>Only prp therapy offers more new hair!  </li>
            <li>Now it is a deep rich brown in appearance and much fuller looking.</li>
            <li>So far after a couple of uses this conditioner has Left my hair shiny and soft, very easy to comb through my hair</li>
            <li>I have very baby fine long hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to wash every other day or every three days</li>
            <li>I was so excited for it to work too, especially because I bought the shampoo which I like, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I still use their Euro hair oil but have abandoned most of the other products.</li>
            <li>I like this better than my other conditioner.</li>
            <li>Shampoo and conditioner smell great and a little shampoo goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Many other reviews and articles seemed to confirm this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many other reviews and articles seemed to confirm this.  </li>
            <li>My hair is full, shiny and more manageable, softer than I can remember in a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>Like the shampoo, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to decide if it&#x27;s effective but will update this review once I have used it more and compare it to the other preventive hair loss productive I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a 55 year old male who has always had a very full head of hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 55 year old male who has always had a very full head of hair</li>
            <li>Even after using 5 pumps of this on my long, fine hair and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes, it still did nothing to &amp;#34;heal and repair damaged&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>This is a really solid hair conditioner that I find leaves my hair with a clean look and a texture that I can style.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy, and together with the shampoo, left my hair bouncy and full.</li>
            <li>No bad chemicals and my hair is soft and manageable like when I was young.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s the former, then this would probably be a good conditioner for people who tend to have oily hair, or want something lightweight that won&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li>Sometimes lavender can be overwhelming so the vanilla really calms it down.</li>
            <li>It actually leaves my hair feeling soft, full of volume, and even helps my scalp!</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found the right product!</li>
            <li>Will have to further inquire to see who is right, I suppose!</li>
            <li>I tried many  other  products and decided to stick to this one , I highly recommend it to others 😊.  </li>
            <li>my hair has become smooth and shiny and very manageable and my dry scalp is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I have to say it really makes my hair less fuzzy more shiny.</li>
            <li>Its so soft and looks healthy, it doesn&#x27;t look dry or washed out.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for having your hair not too dry or wet.</li>
            <li>I always leave in quite a bit of my conditioner, with this one I can rinse out more of it, because it&#x27;s quite a heavy product which I consider to be a positive trait.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on my hairs, made it silky smooth without all the crazy chemicals from my old conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and much happier!  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to use natural hair conditioning products.</li>
            <li>after the first use my hair felt soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lived in tropical and blizzard-like climates and the same holds true.</li>
            <li>and it calms it down and makes it look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and this leaves it very soft but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I would suggest everyone who is facing the same hair loss problem, please start using this unique product Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil hair conditioner for a new look of your hair style.</li>
            <li>and instead I see new baby hair all over my head !</li>
            <li>smelled great but left hair dull.</li>
            <li>But, this conditioner helps conditioned my hair better and avoid breakage when I brush my hair, I did see less breakage and tangling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to quantify &amp;#34;less hair loss&amp;#34; but the less hair I see in my brush all week, the better I&#x27;m feeling about the product.  </li>
            <li>Has been about a week since I started using this product and I can already see changes in more hair growth and less hair loss.</li>
            <li>Slightly drying on ends so be sure to use lots of conditioner.</li>
            <li>Since using this my hair has started looking better and I have noticed less loss.</li>
            <li>More in winter and less in summer.</li>
            <li>Its a good one with out any harsh chemicals in it as the regular shampoo have</li>
            <li>I can also feel deeply hydrated, I think this brings a feature which adds vital moisture and gets rid of the friz and gives me a smooth look.</li>
            <li>One of the main fragrances is  vanilla.  </li>
            <li>My only complaints is the price and when I received it the bottle top was open and some leaked in the box.  </li>
            <li>I received pura d&#x27;por as a gift from my older brother for my 30th birthday.</li>
            <li>I use about two pumps for the conditioner to have a decent smoothness.  </li>
            <li>The combination of the two products has improved my hair in look, feel, and keeps the color vibrant longer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Nioxin for the last 7 years and this is a good alternative if you want an organic product without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I am older and am looking to end my hair loss.</li>
            <li>Left my hair in more tangles than it was prior to using it.</li>
            <li>Also, the problem with these type of container tops is that after you manage to open the top, if kept open, water somehow gets into it and dilutes the product and they are a hassle to close.</li>
            <li>The conditioner worked itself left my hair soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li>my hair are fine, very dry and unmanageable .Since</li>
            <li>Because I literally had to take out the cap and pour sooo much just to make my hair soft!</li>
            <li>Very soft hair!</li>
            <li>It left my hair very manageable, feeling really soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li>This is my very first review I have written on amazon (daily shopper here).  </li>
            <li>No dry ends, no limp hair, non oily, no bad scents, no chemicals.</li>
            <li>The price is high but you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Conditioner, try it with the Pura d&#x27;or:</li>
            <li>We also highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using Pura d&#x27;or anti-hairloss shampoo, I HIGHLY recommend that you use their conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it and will continue to use it well after this review is submitted.</li>
            <li>Just high priced shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li>although to be honest, I started a lot of other treatments at about the same time (Biotin, Fo-Ti, and Reishi).</li>
            <li>A little too pure or clear looking for having so many herbal ingredients.</li>
            <li>I got my blood tested to make sure there was not a significant health issue.</li>
            <li>Hair seems to be a little more shinier.  </li>
            <li>would have given the product a 5 star if the price was a little more affordable.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner.dont weight my hair down like other products that claims to be natural.</li>
            <li>I do have to use a little more than normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>I started a new all natural dandruff shampoo that was extremely effective, but as a consequence left my curly hair unbelievably dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Feels very natural, and makes my hair nice, soft and lends a slight natural glow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the shampoo really clarifies and then this conditioner makes my hair feel soft, shinny and manageable.</li>
            <li>but it was not thick</li>
            <li>Great product- a bit expensive though.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as I like it to make me feel like it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li>Would buy again makes hair feel soft and supple, doesnt really do much  for hair growth and hair fall.</li>
            <li>After the final rinse you can still feel that your hair has absorbed the oils from the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is pretty nice but a bit on the thin side for my taste.</li>
            <li>I bought both shampoo and conditioner  after using it for a few times I notice my hair is much more healthier, softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>rarely write reviews, but I felt obliged to warn potential customers.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a few days my hair is already looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li>but otherwise I can see the normal hairfall the remaining time</li>
            <li>My barber also noticed a difference, the hair growth was thicker and was faster than normal.</li>
            <li>Feels a lot different going on than most commercial conditioners and so far my hair seems to be responding well to it.</li>
            <li>I really like how easy it is to comb with little sculpting product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave the messy buildup that I&#x27;ve gotten with other so-called high end conditioners, and the shine is amazing!</li>
            <li>Love the slight fragrance, will continue to use!</li>
            <li>Nothing special about product...left my hair feeling dry</li>
            <li>It is hard to tell which is having a more positive effect on my hair, the shampoo or the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>At first I was very leery of this conditioner as it is very light and did not think it could hold to my very thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>When dry, it feels fuller, smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>my hair is shiny and soft and seems much more manageable than previously.</li>
            <li>A little of the shampoo and conditioner go a long way, so they last a while, and they smell great.</li>
            <li>I know that it is made a little bit differently from regular conditioners, with better and more natural ingredients, but I really need to use a lot to get my hair actually conditioned.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but makes it easy to comb and manageable.</li>
            <li>Other reviews concerning the fragrances seem accurate:  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but after using it for four months now, my hair is back in great condition.  </li>
            <li>My wife likes it, she says her hair stopped falling out like it use to, and lots of new baby hairs growing .</li>
            <li>I am a new user to the Pura D&#x27;or Line.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any new hair growth</li>
            <li>I might end up giving this product five stars, but since it&#x27;s relatively new to me, I am going for four.</li>
            <li>and also my hair is dull from coloring it so much and since I  used this product the color has more shine to it.</li>
            <li>My natural hair was soft and easy to manage after using it, so much so that it reminded me of my previously relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals is the main reason I use this.</li>
            <li>Not enough time to really see real improvement</li>
            <li>I have very fine, usually quite soft, hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair does not feel very soft after using the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>wow, wow!!  </li>
            <li>I could tell that the shampoo really cleaned my hair and it felt pretty dry afterwards, so I used a lot of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I did not like it at first because it didn&#x27;t give enough fumes.</li>
            <li>I usually do not use Conditioner, but if it was going to help me grow hair</li>
            <li>It is made of natural, organic ingredients (a rarity!)</li>
            <li>Not only did it work, it worked better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>I noticed some pretty severe shedding and breakage earlier in the year.  </li>
            <li>And my hair is SO soft!</li>
            <li>Much better than Nioxin (what a waste of money!).</li>
            <li>I would buy again simply because it promotes hair growth.;)</li>
            <li>Even without any other product, I&#x27;ve received constant compliments and have had many strangers walk up and either touch my hair or ask to touch my hair.</li>
            <li>I usually do not leave reviews for products I bought</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It leaves ur hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Found our Pura d&#x27; or shampoo and conditioner and I am starting to notice a difference in my hair, I&#x27;m not loosing as much hair now, and my hair is getting thicker!</li>
            <li>Usually I rec many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li>This is actually my first time leaving a comment on a product but to my surprise, this product actually worked for me!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li>Like the smell and leaves my hair soft!</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try and have been pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I first used this product about a month back when I ran out of hair conditioner and my roommate had this one on the bathtub shelf.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling nourished and smooth without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Its true what the products say that it really really helps dull ,fine dry hair .</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference right away, but by the second or third time I&#x27;d tried it I was really blown away.</li>
            <li>Using the products at this point is giving me a sense that the individual hair strands are becoming less susceptible to breakage, but I can&#x27;t say that with absolute certainty.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend and worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use a high quality organic conditioner that actually does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>and I must say, it not only leaves my hair clean and soft, but it has slowed down the volume of hair I was losing with each shampoo and simple light brushing.  </li>
            <li>Used along with the shampoo and did see an improvement with less hair fall compared to Enjoy, Nioxin and Satinique.</li>
            <li>I normally can&#x27;t use conditioner in my hair because it weighs my hair way too much, but this conditioner actually leaves my hair feeling like silk</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine and thin</li>
            <li>but now I can easily say I dont worry about how hard I brush my hair or how fast I curl or straighten because I know my hair is stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li>However, I realized that you don&#x27;t need to use much with this condition since it does leave my hair feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, I live in a very humid climate and my hair tends to frizz by mid day.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and the conditioner did not leave hair easy to comb, but once combed and dry</li>
            <li>This conditioner does not leave my hair super silky like other brands.</li>
            <li>I started using these products two months ago ,my hair changes from  dull to healthy .</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean an with a lot of body, Not heavy or weighted down like some conditioners can do.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it to know that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the harsh chemicals in it like many store bought conditioners.</li>
            <li>Caused more hair loss and extreme dry scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down and felt like I went to a spa for a special treatment.  </li>
            <li>I bought it based on the great reviews but what a disappointment.</li>
            <li>old&#x27;s straight hair, with the same results.</li>
            <li>This helped even and clear it up.</li>
            <li>guess there is nothing that will really grown hair back</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and prone to eczema</li>
            <li>I have a wavy, frizzy hair and this conditioner helps it look smooth without damaging my hair color, as it does not have any harsh sulfates.</li>
            <li>and it looked shinier, not dead and lifeless from being colored hair.  </li>
            <li>I think because it contains a lot of natural oils.  </li>
            <li>The natural ingredients are also a plus.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a natural product with Argan oil.</li>
            <li>The seller was professional and promptly refunded my account☺</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, but still leaves the hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 76 years old.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioners are not harsh on your hair and leave your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft</li>
            <li>All natural and smells like lavender.</li>
            <li>Natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It smells like an old, stinky bathroom covered up by a lavender/floral room spray.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a soft feel to my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and therefore naturally frizzy, especially here in the Southeast where we have so much humidity.  </li>
            <li>Also, although it is natural it&#x27;s NOT organic.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it so far.</li>
            <li>The smell is gentle enough that my fiance can use this without it smelling too girly for him.</li>
            <li>tried to purchase this directly from Pura D&#x27;or.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>According to the ads, it&#x27;s 99% natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It also protects from heat damage as i straight my hair daily,</li>
            <li>Her hair feels so soft and</li>
            <li>hair lush costs a bundle though which is why i tried looking for something cheaper.</li>
            <li>So far, this conditioner coupled with the shampoo that goes with it has done wonders for my hair without the biotin supplement.</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old lady</li>
            <li>Because of my age ( 71 years old )</li>
            <li>all  of which are Purador products ,,,My husband was so surprised ,he started using them too</li>
            <li>, he is 77 years old .</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a soft feel to my hair</li>
            <li>but it did not make my hair soft at all.  </li>
            <li>its has been working so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using it about two weeks so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking it so far....</li>
            <li>Smells like baby lotion and makes my hair soft and feel thicker.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>I was expecting to have soft, silky hair with the conditioner..</li>
            <li>It does what it says, it makes your hair soft within mins</li>
            <li>I had oily hair, so this completely retexture my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the conditioner and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>

            <li>It makes my hair so shiny and lush.</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair soft and adds some shine, not a lot, but it&#x27;s natural looking.</li>
            <li>I just started using it, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner all natural, organic.</li>
            <li>It is natural, I like it.</li>
            <li>I like for my hair to feel soft when being conditioned.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; soft.</li>
            <li>so I decided to go all natural with hair</li>
            <li>thought this shampoo was all natural, but have since learned that any shampoo that foams/lathers contains some form of SLS (in this case cocamide) and strips the hair of all</li>
            <li>I like the product results so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky, soft, and un-frizzy without a buildup of gunk.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural wavy-ness.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft</li>
            <li>Like it so far.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner, especially after using the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic shampoo.  </li>
            <li>MY HAIR FEELS &amp; LOOKS THICKER AND IS SOFT TO THE TOUCH.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky soft, hydrated, and fuller.  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I came across this shampoo when I was looking for all natural shampoos &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li>I went low-poo about six months ago and have been looking for a fully natural product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that a natural conditioner would work so well</li>
            <li>I have tried it and it helps to keep my hair soft, yet to see changes in hair loss.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and moisturized during the winter.</li>
            <li>It leaves it soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>After using these Pura d&#x27;or products for just two days, my hair appears thicker and naturally wavy</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This conditioner keeps my hair soft, without making it oily.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, I wanted to order the conditioner to go along with my shampoo.  </li>
            <li>If you want natural stuff without all the chemicals and your hair to feel like it got nutrition, go for this.</li>
            <li>Like the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked well so far.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt this soft before..</li>
            <li>My hair is sooo incredibly soft and I didn&#x27;t have to use product in my hair after the shower.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for a couple of weeks and have to admit I&#x27;m a fan so far.. will give an update in a couple of months</li>
            <li>My hair feels very nourished now, and overall healthier.</li>
            <li>I will never use my old shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
            <li>So far hair shedding is accelerating not slowing.</li>
            <li>, I am unsure if it takes more time to reduce the hair fall as I have just started to use lately.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a week and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with hair loss for a while and this product with the shampoo has helped my hair feel soft and healthier again.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up on natural shampoo and conditioner until you try this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;After trying everything out there, including natural, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It was quite unexpected when I noticed hair shedding.</li>
            <li>I was a surprised as I didn&#x27;t know the reason.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have used mostly professional line shampoos.</li>
            <li>I had to completely change my hairstyle, where I part my hair AND almost always have it in a ponytail,</li>
            <li>I am a 28 year old man and I have been using this product for about 3 weeks in conduction with their hair loss shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair loss has nearly stopped.  </li>
            <li>but that isn&#x27;t a big deal really after your hair dries.</li>
            <li>so far i have not seen any results still lots of hair in shower.  </li>
            <li>my rashes have completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>It did not leave my hair completely soft but it works.  </li>
            <li>but I do love to at least try others out.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a year and thus far I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  </li>
            <li>I purchased blue bottle Pura D&#x27;or Hair loss Prevention shampoo and found it it is real works for me.</li>
            <li>I also like the natural fragrance and ingredients.  </li>
            <li>They leave my hair soft and shiny, and reduce the amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li>It has all natural and organic ingredients, and is free of parabens, sulfates, and harsh, toxic petroleum based chemicals.  </li>
            <li>At least if I&#x27;m going to lose my hair it, the hair that&#x27;s left can look nice.    </li>
            <li>My hair seems much more manageable and healthier only after using a few times.  </li>
            <li>and I actually think I dried out and damaged my hair more by using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive but for me it&#x27;s worth the end result.</li>
            <li>My hair just looked thick and greasy most of the time.</li>
            <li>was good but to expensive</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it makes it so smooth!</li>
            <li>After 6 weeks of us, I&#x27;m finding it leaves my long, fine, straight hair soft without making it limp.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it due to the results I had</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and full - not weighed down at all!</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bit special, but still acceptable.</li>
            <li>My hair is waist length, so for a bottle to last that long makes it also worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I only ordered the shampoo and used a different conditioner</li>
            <li>Usually when you use cheap conditioner, it leaves a foul smell will taking forever to have water rinsing through completely.</li>
            <li>The first is before beginning Pura D&#x27;or, the second after three months, the last two were taken 6 months afterward.</li>
            <li>I used it for 3 weeks, and what started as a tingling on my scalp (&amp;#34;it&#x27;s working!&amp;#34;) was actually the beginning of a month&#x27;s-long rash that ultimately became infected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various conditioners in the past, but this one seems to provide the most long-lasting dryness relief.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind an intense coconut scent (not lavender!) left on your hair and the fact that you need another product for detangling after applying Pura D&#x27;Or&#x27;s blue conditioner, go for it.  </li>
            <li>Initially it doesn&#x27;t feel as rich as some of the other conditioners I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I previously purchased a bottle of the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Shampoo not too long ago and fell in love with it the first time I used it and immediately threw out all of my other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Hair is growing back and also grey is turning back to original brown color.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt it will grow back hair</li>
            <li>Second, my sister (a stylist) colored my hair using high contrast blond and brown, and voila, somehow my hair looks like it did years</li>
            <li>The combination of highly hair beneficial ingredients was key to my purchasing this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for the last month and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>reason I do not give this a full five stars, though, is because I find it to be pretty weak.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, the lathering was minimal, but I chocked it up to the organic nature of the product.</li>
            <li>and I will certainly Come back again for my next order.</li>
            <li>Premium Organic Argan Oil Conditioner leaves my hair very silky and sleek all day long (unlike many other argan oil conditioners I&#x27;ve tried that tended to leave my hair feeling heavy) but is not too soft - it allows my hair to be manageable and holds any styling well.</li>
            <li>I was a Hospice Social Worker for 6 years and seen some of the most horrible cancers anddeaths, and I am telling you right now, they majority were caused UNNECESSARILY from the chemicals we allow businesses to put into our magnificent bodies.</li>
            <li>This is currently my favorite conditioner for thin hair since the original Nioxin 2 scalp therapy formula (not the new trash that they&#x27;ve been putting in bottles for the last few years).</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth, my hair is definitely fuller with body and shine, like I used to have.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I after finally deciding to try something new  organic conditioner</li>
            <li>Instead, I use a small amount and comb it through my hair while I&#x27;m in the shower, then leave it on for as long as possible, and rinse with cool water right before I get out.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really works for my hair , which is dry and frizzy .</li>
            <li>My hair is very tangled and dry feeling after use.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner (and shampoo) is of quality and leaves my hair feeling thicker, less dry and easily managed.</li>
            <li>Last pretty long... three months.</li>
            <li>Not expensive when you finally see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>I guess that is the tradeoff since this is the only product that really makes a big difference in the volume of my hair.  </li>
            <li>male, mid 30&#x27;s, use this conditioner along with the gold label shampoo, and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>A hairdresser fried my hair and after a few weeks of these products it has helped with the texture and dryness tremendously.</li>
            <li>The price is totally worth it because you only need a small amount of the product as opposed to using a large amount of another product.  </li>
            <li>, only need to use just a little bit of both the shampoo and conditioner and they lather pretty well using the palm of my hand without too much effort.</li>
            <li>had a major hair loss after divorce</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if I noticed any other improvements.</li>
            <li>I have major post pregnancy hair loss.</li>
            <li>No other conditioner touches my hair now.</li>
            <li>now I can barely see my scalp!</li>
            <li>I usually let my hair dry untied instead of trying to fight a brush through it (and take out more hairs!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like any other condition and it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural with no crazy chemicals that just mess up your hair!</li>
            <li>I have Thick but fine hair which is wavy and sometimes frizzy.  </li>
            <li>then with a large toothed&lt;br /&gt;shower comb, I carefully comb my hair.</li>
            <li>Pur d&#x27;or products are a little spendy but well worth.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product, along with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo for over a year now &amp; have noticed less thinning on top &amp; MUCH less hair in the drain....</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s better than my previous shampoo as I notice even less shedding when washing my hair</li>
            <li>After seeing how incredible my hair looked and felt with the shampoo, I figured I would take a shot at the conditioner, expecting the same lousy results all the other conditioners left me with</li>
            <li>Because pretty much all my life I&#x27;ve had dull hair.</li>
            <li>So it is a reason to keep using Pura D&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner or at least products that are silicone free.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for delicate damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I do not have to use much conditioner to get this effect so it can last me a long time.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not sure of is if the Shampoo and Conditioner products are  wheat and gluten free??</li>
            <li>I am a professional psychic medium, spiritual teacher, and speaker.</li>
            <li>I found myself having to use a ton of the product to make my hair actually feel soft.</li>
            <li>With the shampoo, I use about the same amount as I did with my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>The next time I used it, I added some of my old bumble and bumble conditioner with it, to see if that would help.  </li>
            <li>You can slather it on and it still barely moisturizes.</li>
            <li>And now that I&#x27;m old and bald, I doubt I will be starting any time soon.</li>
            <li>These products are not only for young people but also for seniors like me and my husband.</li>
            <li>, I only use a bristle boar soft brush.</li>
            <li>The ingredients look all natural but the scent of the conditioner is strongly reminiscent of Johnson&#x27;s baby oil.  </li>
            <li>Since there is no heavy buildup, my hair is back to</li>
            <li>The entire system does wonder for the look and feel of hair, makes hair look healthier, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s too early to say whether this is preventing any hair loss or not, but this definitely made my hair silkier and smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying natural remedies for hair growth for almost a month and recently I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old male I&#x27;ve been losing my hair on the front crown</li>
            <li>BARELY ANY OF THEM</li>
            <li>FYI, I have long, normal hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make matters worse, I thought if I sprayed on the leave-in conditioner (after using this conditioner), THEN I would be able to comb it without problems.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of scary to me.</li>
            <li>Mine came with a broken top on the bottle, but seems to do its job.</li>
            <li>It does not leave behind any residue, so my hair has more volume than when I used drug store conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair feel unbelievably silky from just one full pump.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many name brands before, but this one not only helps to keep your hair soft but also avoid unnecessary breakage during and after the hair wash.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of weird</li>
            <li>Not too thick so does not weigh my hair down and leaves it with a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I also use the shampoo as well, the two goes hand in hand.&lt;br /&gt;Try not to use too much of the conditioner though as it will make your hair very oily, I use about one and a half pump for my long hair!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The conditioner made my hair spell like vanilla and feel amazingly smooth in the shower, however when my hair dried it was still dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair very soft even the next morning after having shampooed at night.</li>
            <li>The texture of my hair changed to very dry, limp and fine.  </li>
            <li>hair is long,  I&#x27;m looking for new growth - and see some.  </li>
            <li>As others had commented, the smell is strongly reminiscent of Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s baby line of lavender products (which was a bit disappointing, because I enjoy the smell of Argan oil), but it intensely conditions, and my hair is left soft without much heaviness or buildup.</li>
            <li>This conditioner feels very light weight and at first I was afraid I&#x27;d end up using massive amounts of it to get that slippery feeling on my hair.</li>
            <li>However, as I have to make up my grey hair by dyeing from time to time, and so far I can&#x27;t find a hair dye product pure organic and finishing the job in an efficient way ( I really don&#x27;t have time for those Indian hannah to take several hours to effect), I decided every other hair care product I use shall be as organic as possible, so as to reduce the chemical stimulus as much as possible, that&#x27;s why I switched to this brand.</li>
            <li>The first two days that I began using the conditioner it didn&#x27;t seem to condition my hair as much as my previous one did</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a color friendly conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave build-up residue on my scalp too.  </li>
            <li>(I have straight hair but at a certain length it starts to &amp;#34;flip out&amp;#34; and becomes hard to style).</li>
            <li>and I think I see tiny hairs starting to grow in especially around my high forehead area.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is thick, you don&#x27;t have to use them a lot, and it work well on my hair.besides, the two pack is offering a pretty decent deal.</li>
            <li>It helped out very well, because without the conditioner, the other shampoo dries your scalp out over time.</li>
            <li>This really is a must for people with extreme hair loss.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use very much just every so little...</li>
            <li>I recommend trying it with the shampoo because if I use it after a different brand shampoo, I do not get the same fresh smell after washing my hair due the mixed scents.</li>
            <li>At least my hair feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This is definitely organic, but as far as a shampoo goes, it does nothing for my hair than simply cleaning it.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several months a like how the conditioner is not heavy and works well for daily use.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft &amp; silky &amp; my hair is no longer falling out by the handful &amp; is actually growing back in!</li>
            <li>Have only used a few times but it leaves my scalp feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products before and never experienced the same results.</li>
            <li>I use one pump, and I can&#x27;t believe how clean and thick it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out the scalp.</li>
            <li>This tended to be slightly out of my price range but decided to give it a shot anyway, having read all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more amazed that my bathroom floor is not full of little bits of my hair every time I comb!  </li>
            <li>but my body is also recovering from a very harsh medical treatment that I was on for 3 full months</li>
            <li>Initially, it seemed like my wet hair was too tangled to comb easily, but I started putting just a little conditioner back on my hair after I rinsed.  </li>
            <li>After only three uses, the shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel oily and heavy, NOT clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>One Winter I could have a normal scalp and the next Winter it could be dry, so it’s also skin with a temper</li>
            <li>One Winter I could have a normal scalp and the next Winter it could be dry, so it’s also skin with a temper</li>
            <li>smells very relaxing and isnt super thick like other conditioners</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel silky soft, but it does feel softer than it&#x27;s felt in a long time.</li>
            <li>I tried applying the aloe vera for the first few days, it help reduces the redness</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for the blizzard, I&#x27;ll follow up when I get a chance to go down by the Equator.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp that typically does not respond too well to conditioners, hair gels and any product you can conceivably apply to your hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care who you are, but once you use argan oil conditioner and shampoo, you will never go back to head and shoulder or that other crap product that you buy.&lt;br /&gt;The amount you get for the price you are getting it at is also an incredible deal!</li>
            <li>It makes my aging, dry hair soft without buildup.</li>
            <li>The main reason why I purchased this conditioner was because of dry hair and scalp that I have had for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>My hair has thinned a lot over the past few years, and I noticed way too many hairs in the sink when I would brush it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down my already thin hair and leaves a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see it slow down the loss as well.</li>
            <li>Conversely, my hair does feel dry at times, although that could be due to a number of external factors (weather, shower water too hot, shampoo frequency, dehydration, etc.).</li>
            <li>Somehow with this product I tried to tame my frizzy, unhealthy and extremely want hair with tons of fly aways.</li>
            <li>No residue left behind and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>- my hair looks super dark and shiny after the oil but not weighed down, and</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very dry and not at all soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner should not be laeled conditioner because it thouroughly dried my hair out and left it a huge tangled mess when I was done.</li>
            <li>Expecting miracles with one Shampoo conditioner might be little too much as it is also dependent on the food diet.</li>
            <li>My hair is both fine and thin, and although I don&#x27;t think I am loosing hair, I needed something that would help enhance what I already had (and fill me out a bit, if possible).</li>
            <li>No other supplement has helped in the past, but this product seems promising.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The conditioner is good.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, some websites recommend this brand to customer as well, so this product must be a good choice for your hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good thing that it is wrapped with plastic</li>
            <li> Although the conditioner feels good in my hair, once it is rinsed out, I can&#x27;t get my fingers through my hair and need to spritz in a detangler.  </li>
            <li> It smells really good too.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good conditioner for your hair.</li>
            <li> Thus, it is best fit for my hair.</li>

            <li> I eat a quality seasonal diet comprised of good meats and veggies, pasture raised eggs and dairy.</li>
            <li> I found this to be surprising.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair smooth and silky, and smells great, too!</li>
            <li> You will have to use a lot to condition your hair and it still does not feel like it coats it like a good conditioner</li>

            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a very soothing scent and I like that my hair smells great when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> The products have a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> I just want a conditioner that detangles, doesn&#x27;t leave you hair residuey-feeling, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and works</li>
            <li> I make my own &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not all that impressed with this conditioner, as much as I am with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but is not moisturizing to my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Nice smell</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a week and have liked the way my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> Nice to find something the whoe family can use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells herbal and the conditioner smells nice-</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, a really good quality shampoo with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what the rave is about.</li>
            <li> But honestly for me</li>
            <li> For the price, I will use my own conditioner on the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Waited since September 2014 to make a review: Hair still fall&#x27;s out, does nothing to keep my hair healthy,  and it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with all the products!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am loving this with the accompanying shampoo.</li>
            <li> Really nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells really nice.  </li>
            <li> Washes nicely.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cost effective product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own and seems to go haywire with frizz and no control</li>
            <li> What I am saying is that it promotes healthy scalp resulting in an environment primed for grow with a good hair care regime.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent too.</li>
            <li> , i do not recommend this product for dyed hair, or any kind of hair for that matter</li>
            <li> I am using the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Conditioner for six month now and can honestly state that&lt;</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice, doesn&#x27;t run off until I rinse.</li>
            <li> Plus, the scent is nice, but I don&#x27;t smell it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The shampoo on it&#x27;s own will leave your hair feeling neglected and stressed.  </li>
            <li> It gives nice shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;LL ADMIT THE SHAMPOO DOES NOT SMELL NICE, BUT IT IS WORKING</li>
            <li> IT LATHERS NICE</li>
            <li> As the shampoo is a bit pricey I decided to wait to see if I liked it.</li>
            <li> Pura D&#x27;or makes spectacular products and I&#x27;m thrilled to have been referred to them.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells good and my hair has never felt better</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the whole transaction, and the product</li>
            <li> Smells real good, tried the shampoo left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to help ease my hair loss and liked the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it is nice.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair nice volume and shine.</li>
            <li> I still liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> It also had a nice, not overly perfumed, smell.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good...smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> The product is really awesome with real organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> My relatives liked my hair and I never thought of facing hair fall problems.</li>
            <li> Everyone around me is asking what kind of hair product I am using.</li>
            <li> Works really well and smells great!</li>
            <li> One week after using the shampoo, I was thrilled to see that the cowlick had drastically improved, even though it&#x27;s still there</li>
            <li> The scent is nice</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner smells good too</li>
            <li> Nice organic product.  </li>
            <li> Awesomely effective.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is nice but doesn&#x27;t wash out well.</li>
            <li> Works well with Shampoo, leaved hair nice after wash.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say, that i do not think  it will grow hair?</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that it work as well as my $30+ salon conditioner and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> The scent of this conditioner is light and very nice.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel and the smell of my hair, not to mention that my hair is really easy to manage now!!</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend to anyone who is looking for the best product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is equally good and leaves my hair easy to manage and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Great conditioner, smells nice and brings volume to my hair (use adequate amount).</li>
            <li> I have tried many conditioners and this one feels very satisfying</li>
            <li> The smell is really quite the cherry on top of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It did not do a good job of nourishing my hair or making it easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> Does smell nice and is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; so far at best.</li>
            <li> The shampoo however has a very strong chemical spell in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty good!</li>
            <li> I usually never review items, but I have to say this is one of the best products i have ever used for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair did not get greasy and I have even been able to skip a day between shampoos (which is so much better for my hair!)</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and the fragrance does linger in the hair after use, but it&#x27;s light and smells nice and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Good consistency in the hand and lathers up fine.</li>
            <li> Has been a great product, smells good &amp; does not leave a film or a heaviness to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good conditioner makes my hair smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see this being any more effective than $5 conditioner.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent of the shampoo, although I&#x27;m not as thrilled with the scent of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice scent to it and gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li> - Comparing to Invati, the conditioner has equally nice smell, this one more manmade smell than the Invanti as the Invanti has ginsense smell.  </li>
            <li> So far this conditioner has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> I pair it with the pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo and so far I am very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Works well, natural ingredients and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This conditioner did a good job of keeping my hair and scalp smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> And off course it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li> I waited a good 6 weeks before posting this review as I believe a product like this takes time to see and feel genuine results.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This method allows me to customize my hair’s needs because even though I try to use the most kindest of products, hair spray and even a touch of it is not so nice when comes to build-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 08 months and is the best so far, besides the added benefit of it being organic</li>
            <li> It is the best by far conditioner that I have put in my hair.</li>
            <li> The creamy texture and very mild scent certainly are plus factors that make this purchase an excellent one.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, I could tell a difference in my hair right away.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and it felt fuller and softer...</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It is also nice and shiny and feels very clean (no</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky, smooth and manageable, really all I need and it smells ABSOLUTELY amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it specially</li>
            <li> The smell is also pretty great.</li>
            <li> but it turned out it smells sweet and good.</li>
            <li> I think it leaves your hair with a nice clean smell and have had people comment how nice my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has sort of a more sophisticated &amp;#34;baby-fresh&amp;#34; scent in my opinion, but it&#x27;s not bad and it is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The product is very smooth.</li>
            <li> This conditioner applies on very smooth and helps keep my permed curls bouncy.</li>
            <li> hair feels very smooth after using it</li>
            <li> Feel very COMFORTABLE with this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light - not overpowering, which I like.  </li>
            <li> Upon first impression, this conditioner smelled amazing, so I was hopeful that it would work as good as it smelled.</li>
            <li> It is very mild and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It is very mild and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was a thinner consistency, but nice and easy to rinse out also.</li>
            <li> but I do believe its a good product to help prevent hair loss (have realistic expectations people!!!)</li>
            <li> Having a product that is organic, while providing a superior feeling of clean and conditioning to my hair, is worth every cent!!  </li>
            <li> it works just fine for me! :)</li>
            <li> pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner have both been amazing for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is growing fast and is super healthy!!!</li>
            <li> and I have to say after using it for just about 2 weeks I have seen a huge difference in my hair&#x27;s health!  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and honestly I&#x27;m in love :)</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT and the shampoo that goes with it-PURA</li>
            <li> however I can confidently say that this is a much better product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad with the hair loss shampoo.</li>
            <li> However, after using it for a couple of months, I started notice that I have more hair.</li>
            <li> I do see more hairs coming in -</li>
            <li> I have tried many shampoos,  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll like it!  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found these Pura d&#x27;or products</li>
            <li> I also recommend using the conditioner with the pura d&#x27;or argan oil hair-loss prevention shampoo for much better results.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner it leaves my hair well conditioned, feeling thicker, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt smoother and I had more shine.</li>
            <li> It is however carcinogenic free and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been looking to replace my favorite conditioner (Pureology)</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> It provides an effect to make the hair look more fuller.</li>
            <li> Takes the static out of your hair in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for sure.</li>
            <li> This product seems to check all the boxes for me:  my hair is more manageable, I do not notice any hair loss from breakage, and my scalp is not at all irritated.  </li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the shampoo (which I really like) and I am happy with how my hair comes out smelling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my hair has been thinning more and more every year.</li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> shampoo but have not been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It needs something to make it more detangle when you rince it out.</li>
            <li> Product was not compatible for me however I am sure based on the reviews its a quality product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Really love it,</li>
            <li> I never thought I would fall in love with a conditioner</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner...</li>
            <li> It is more manageable and seems to be in better condition.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product a week ago, I can tell you, I love the vanilla/lavender scent.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic conditioner!</li>
            <li> I use it with the hair loss and thinning shampoo and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells okay</li>
            <li> I also bought the tranquility shampoo and love them both.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the look, feel and health of my hair</li>
            <li> it does not smell like lavender vanilla - more like baby wipes or baby lotion.</li>
            <li> she comments how much better my hair is getting.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this conditioner.</li>

            <li> I am so glad  I tried it.</li>
            <li> I will be buying it more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, as the vanilla overpowers the lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> Better, but still tangled, I had to add oil to get tangles combed out.  </li>
            <li> Phenomenal conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Gonna order more.....</li>
            <li> am 100 % sure you will find the difference....</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t most shampoos come with it baked it?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Used this product with the [Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo Scalp &amp; Dandruff Treatment] and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I used to be able to see his scalp more and his hair was more of an ashy withering brown.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> i just used the conditioner, it feels ok, but i do not like the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and I think I&#x27;ve found &amp;#34;the</li>
            <li> I would buy again. :)</li>
            <li> This product has a wonderful fragrance which I finally remembered smelling at the beach when I was a child.  </li>
            <li> It has a bit of a minty feel on the scalp which is refreshing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also not going to throw the bottle out, and will try it with another shampoo to see if it has better conditioning benefits than if used with the companion shampoo.</li>
            <li> The fact that its all organic is even more satisfying.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found more hair in my hand while washing.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells, and the oils in it.</li>
            <li> Aside from this, I love my hair.</li>
            <li> Will buy more again soon.</li>
            <li> I always buy extra  stocks because I do not like to run out  of these wonderful Purador Shampoo, Conditioner, Argan oil, Vit C serum,</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy, growing and NOT falling out as it did before using this.</li>

            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> but i can say that her hair looks more healthier.</li>

            <li> Also its more shiny.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t find (feel) my hair growing but looks more value.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> However, I did notice that using 3 or more pumps of the conditioner makes my hair a lot nicer and softer.  </li>
            <li> The price is much better as well.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender-vinalla scent as well.</li>

            <li> i love it</li>

            <li> it is MUCH better than it was.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with these products.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did--</li>
            <li> Also the volume of my hair is substantially more.  </li>

            <li> Would have been better not to have used it at all.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many thickening shampoos and they just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The conditioner I focused more on application to my strands, versus the roots of my hair.</li>
            <li> Again, you will love the scent and feel your hair gets from this conditioner</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the shampoo contains a DHT fighter.  </li>
            <li> This is better than going to the dermatologist and using whatever  they recommended.  </li>
            <li> Others love it</li>
            <li> but I think the Gold label it better with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I do like the fact this product is made with mostly organic oils.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> so my hair continues to grow and stop thinning :)</li>
            <li> I want to use both in order to get better results.</li>
            <li> it leaves you hair shinny and healthy</li>

            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is outstanding in every way.</li>
            <li> To be truthful</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo (LOVE THE HAIR LOSS PREVENTION SHAMPOO) and conditioner together</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a need anymore to use gel because I love the way the hair looks after it dries out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo - that I love.  </li>
            <li> ( this is what my hair looks like shiny and healthy)</li>
            <li> Definitely, the best working conditioner for my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair has more shine and is so much more manageable than before using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this a while back and since then, I have found it to be one of the best conditioner for my hair.  </li>
            <li> have to use more to give better insights.</li>
            <li> you-flat overwhelming, either.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this product after reading many reviews after 6 month of use</li>
            <li> love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I feel my hair is getting better,</li>
            <li> Conditioner is okay</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo (gold) this conditioner (blue)  for about 5 weeks and have been very happy with both.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Ya never know when the next best thing will come along!&lt;br</li>
            <li> At that point I wasn&#x27;t too sure the conditioner was going to work, I assumed it was going to leave it</li>
            <li> I guess it didn&#x27;t matter too much because the conditioner smelled great.</li>
            <li> #34;I love this stuff!&amp;#34</li>

            <li> Very clean</li>
            <li> It is pretty good.</li>
            <li> So, in sum, perfect for the hair on my scalp, inadequate for parts of long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals, smells good, and the dispenser is great!</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo for Hair Loss first and followed it with the conditioner and loved the way my hair felt after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for most people as it is not a chemical smell</li>
            <li> natural creamy lavender smell, makes me happy knowing how sweet my hair smells, love it!</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner as it is very light on my thinning, fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner as it is very light on my thinning, fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> One quick rinse at the end of the shower will do it nicely.</li>
            <li> and I am able to comb easily through my hair after showering.  </li>
            <li> Best conditioner in the market to treat dry scalps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan Oil for years with excellent results on my hair, but after a day or two my head would feel dry again.</li>
            <li> Let me first start out by saying the lavender vanilla smells incredible and very calming!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy so far!  </li>
            <li> Great natural conditioner!</li>
            <li> my first order, I&#x27;ve reordered two more bottles to make sure I don&#x27;t run out !  </li>
            <li> This is a very classic conditioner which does a good job conditioning your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products and totally impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Other products by  Pura d&#x27;or&#x27; are okay, the hair loss shampoo is excellent!</li>
            <li> There are no chemicals in the shampoo, it lathers up very nicely, it has a pretty nice smell, my hair does feel fuller, and the argan oil does also make my hair feel much softer.</li>
            <li> and it’s a nice clean but light scent.</li>
            <li> It feels very full.</li>
            <li> It is not extremely moisturizing but great for me on most days.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product sends me into a wonderful special time when someone in my life used that fragrance (lavender mixed with something).  </li>
            <li> Unless you plan on getting some eye disease or cancer continuing to use cheap hair products like Pert or the rest of them, you need to spend for for something worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I&#x27;ve find a natural product that is helping me.</li>
            <li> Way better than the crappy cheap conditioner I was using before.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a really great smell but made me hair oilier than it is naturally.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair smooth and easier to comb, but the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite, in fact, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I smelled it in the store...</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, non toxic ingredients, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great on my naturally curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It is a great product that leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair is much more manageable and feels extremely smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I am impressed after the first usage - my hair indeed moisturized and felt soft.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t get allergic reaction, which is most important for me, so I will  keep using it.</li>
            <li> After rinsing my hair out it feels great and soft.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> So far makes my hair seem thicker smells great.</li>
            <li> Though others have made claims to the contrary, the bottle states that the conditioner is SLS free and mostly organic.</li>
            <li> My hair is more manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li> Second time conditioning with this brand  showed incredible difference in how my hair flowed and shined.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this conditioner if you are looking for silky smooth and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, Natural ingredients that keeps your hair very moist and healthy.</li>
            <li> If you love the smell than you will be enjoy this.</li>
            <li> This organic conditioner smells great and gives my hair a soft, silky texture.</li>
            <li> primrose oil taken internally, every day, along with fresh, organic healthy food, multi-vitamins, lots of exercise and visualization is what worked best for me.  </li>
            <li> Great natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I accept aging very well and believe I am doing a good job at it.</li>
            <li> After so I have found good oranic conditionar and it really works.</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad, but not the greatest for my hair......</li>
            <li> I no longer do the combover or spend 30 minutes teasing my hair to get it just right to hide bald spots!!</li>
            <li> what a super product....  just what I needed to help control the &#x27;gray frizzies&amp;#34;.... I really love how smooth my hair feels with these products!  </li>
            <li> It makes her hair so smooth and shiny after she deep conditions it and on top of that it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Wow Sensational I have never in my life experienced so much satisfaction in coming into contact with any concept or circumstance which could yield so.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice smell and leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I need something more rich and conditioning, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My hair significantly reduced to fall, more manageable and it gives some volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use more to get the most out of this bottle, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend introduced me to a great product rather a hair doctor, Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil hair conditioner and the hair fall prevention shampoo of the same brand, which worked magically to reduce my hair fall and rebuild my hair.</li>
            <li> Even though I am a guy, I use this conditioner because it is effective, safe to use and really affordable.</li>
            <li> This conditioner comes in a sturdy pump bottle that makes it easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle is convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and wash off.</li>
            <li> My hair look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> I have hair that gets oily easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy drying and styling.</li>
            <li> and I can easily manage my hair now.</li>
            <li> Easy to manage after towel drying.</li>
            <li> but when it dries it leaves my hair much more smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Easy to distribute through hair.  </li>
            <li> but I think it more felt over clean...</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a thicker consistency and it was easy to use and rinse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soo strong.</li>
            <li> Still, your hair will come out shiny and strong.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, I love the texture of my hair and my scalp is healthly and</li>
            <li> and I get migraines from the strong scents.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either.  </li>
            <li> but the smell can come off as strong.</li>
            <li> It really does help you hair have a good, smooth texture.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend a try of Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust all these raving reviews, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re paid, nothing special about this product, nothing to rant and rave about.</li>
            <li> The thickness of the hair is apparent and it looks great.</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning my hair felt significantly thicker and more smooth.</li>
            <li> full statisfied now :)</li>
            <li> This one is way more creamier and has a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> It also makes your hair soft and smell nice!</li>
            <li> Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the products first and then let the girls each give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;The Premium Organic Argan Oil Based Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo is one of a kind.</li>

            <li> After I used it, I find it is useful to prevent losing more hair.</li>
            <li> After researching sulfate free shampoos, found this conditioner to match.  </li>
            <li> also, the after-use hair feels so comfortable.</li>
            <li> They company gives you a free bottle if you write a review.</li>
            <li> My hair feels light and has body.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone in need of a great organic product for your hair.</li>
            <li> The product has a nice scent and is very soothing on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Great conditioner, makes a big difference for my hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels super soft, smells great, and is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> makes my hair smooth and locks in moisture.</li>
            <li> Conditionair feels diluted in water it does not condition or smooth  the hair caused dandruff</li>
            <li> the cheap one that&#x27;s what it smells like.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it has caused hair to grow, but it hasn&#x27;t done the opposite and for that I am happy.</li>
            <li> I still get the silky smooth results without all the tangles.</li>
            <li> fantastic conditioner.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Pura d&#x27;or shampoo is fantastic and stopped my hair loss immediately.  </li>
            <li> Works great for short hair and up to the shoulders.</li>
            <li> Hair always feels silky and smooth after.</li>
            <li> Conditions well - leaves hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have to get used to how light the conditioner is and leave on some after rinsing.</li>
            <li> Secondly it has stopped hair loss and seems to have begun to regain some of the loss to my great satisfaction.</li>
            <li> but I have to use Moroccan oil in addition to the conditioner after my shower to keep my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It made my hair completely smooth and eliminated my frizz.</li>
            <li> A HUGE MAJORITY of these 5 star reviews are solely written by the reviewer to get a free bottle of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Our shampoos and conditioners are free from SLS, Parabens and Gluten!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the one with the beautiful head of shinny grey hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it, my hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft in years.</li>
            <li> So far so good, we&#x27;ll see in another month.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and plan to keep on keepin&#x27; on with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that while it smells nice, it does smell kind of girly.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughters hair is gorgeous from it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell, smells like vanilla and leaves my hair soft with a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Constant use of this shampoo and conditioner has helped eliminate dandruff problem which I have been battling for more than a decade and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching for a good shampoo and conditioner for quite sometime before I had decided on this.</li>
            <li> This is not 100% natural (99%), but has good reviews, so I decided to try both shampoo and conditioner of this brand.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner does a good job of making my hair feel soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> good and soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The added bonus is that I feel good knowing this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good...keeps hairline strong!</li>
            <li> Having used it for the first time , I can immediately feel its  magic power , because my hair stops coming off like before and it is shiny and easily combed .so</li>
            <li> I inherited a full head of beautiful wavy hair, that is now a unique white in front and salt and per throughout the rest.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner and it has a great scent and leaves my hair shiny and it smell fresh &amp; clean without harmful chemicals &amp; sulfates, so its a big bonus!</li>
            <li> The price is right andI love that it is organic.</li>
            <li> It feels rich when applying it and makes my hair feel smooth and and silky as well as making it tangle free and shiny.</li>
            <li> when she used that shampoo, she thought that&#x27;s very useful to deal with her hair loss</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it; I love the smell of the shampoo (tea tree oil smell), but am not crazy about the smell of the conditioner (I&#x27;m used to it now, though...</li>
            <li> Great product, havent been using it for a really long time but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The product felt clean and chemical free.</li>
            <li> Before, my hair is super unmanageable and hair falls easily.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first however after using it my hair feels light and healthy without build up.</li>
            <li> conditioner smells a little stronger (aromatic) in scent from it’s shampoo counterpart, but nonetheless still very pleasant</li>
            <li> I used to use Nioxin and decided to try something new, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and my hair is so soft and not frizzy at all!!</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve been using their conditioner my hair has been much softer and much more easy to manage.</li>
            <li> , I am a very sensitive person, I cannot use most of the products out there because  I am allergic to so many things.</li>
            <li> I would go great lengths for this conditioner and am quite sure it has completely taken over my old favorites.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited for it to work too</li>
            <li> Between the two I have seen significant improvement in the quality of my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased the conditioner after using the shampoo for many months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in my hair loss with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I fell in love after the first shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and I originally purchased it in January.</li>
            <li> It has not made a significant difference in my hair quality, hair strength, hair loss/thinning, or hair growth.</li>
            <li> I also noticed no change in hair growth after 8 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:&lt;br /&gt;After about 8 weeks of use of this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Works great for my long, wavy hair that gets dyed from time to time.</li>
            <li> Its just been around 3 weeks since I started using this shampoo, but I can see a significant difference in my hair texture.  </li>
            <li> WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> It is worth it!</li>
            <li> It smells great and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love thi s stuff so much!</li>
            <li> Having tried many so called replacements, I found Pura d&#x27;or to be exactly what it purports to be.</li>
            <li> She was not as excited as Emmaleigh</li>
            <li> and it probably has been the best thing for my fine slow growing hair.</li>
            <li> This product can make hair less loss is very good step up.</li>
            <li> I have included a new picture to show you how nice my hair looks now.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to move to clean eating and cleaner health and beauty care products.  </li>
            <li> I am just going through it way too quickly and it isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> It does clean my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry and thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Hair feels moisturized and clean after use.</li>
            <li> great.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , RINSES CLEAN AND</li>
            <li> It feels a bit dry but the results on my hair are great.</li>
            <li> This conditioner nourishes and gives the clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is light and fresh, and leaves the hair light as feather.</li>
            <li> I love the healthy smell of the ingredients used and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thinning hair but the lack of SLS and parabins leaves a completely different, yet pleasant, after effects.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell that lingers until the next washing.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft, clean and with a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> but I am very sensitive to any kind of fragrance</li>
            <li> The natural approach makes so much more sense!</li>
            <li> I find it o be nothing special</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that any conditioner is going to prevent hair loss, but I do believe certain ones give a much better appearance of density.  </li>
            <li> Everything is all right!</li>
            <li> It smells fabulous and this was the first time after using an organic conditioner that I didn&#x27;t have frizz or flyaway&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I expected a great product.</li>
            <li> It goes well with the shampoo with nice smell, like it so far after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because I use the same brand shampoo, and it is organic and smells good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering how much of the product I have to use per condition, I might try something else out to see if I can get a better bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not only good</li>
            <li> but my wife said it smell so nice too,  it doesn&#x27;t harm your hair and helps in making it soft.  </li>
            <li> I liked this conditioner because it made my hair feel soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Most don&#x27;t work well and have too much perfume.</li>
            <li> Although I am not a huge fan of the smell, kind of too sweet to my liking, but overall, very happy for my purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> The Pura D&#x27;or blue is not as good as the Gold Premium version I have found.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I feel like this conditioner really protects my hair from heat and makes me able to go longer in between hair cuts</li>
            <li> I really have been enjoying this product</li>
            <li> I mostly use cleansing conditioners and decided to try this because I really like the argan oil that this company makes.</li>
            <li> but it is true my hair is not falling like before</li>
            <li> I can honestly say my hair has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> OCT Garnier works much better, at much lower price...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really looked closely to see if I see any baby hair growing (according to most of the reviews)</li>
            <li> Good luck to all of you with the same issue I had.</li>
            <li> Overall, good results for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> But overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Just a mild, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Overall good conditioner</li>
            <li> Not as good as conditioners from a regular store.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft with a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely smell of lavender and the scent lasts for a whole day.</li>
            <li> So far i am loving this product.</li>
            <li> It says that it slows hair loss, and that is actually true.</li>
            <li> Good second act to the Gold label.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to LOVE this conditioner as much as the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma and no harsh chemicals and additives.  </li>
            <li> I am assuming it&#x27;s true as it is written on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> TRUE..</li>
            <li> There are some tried and true brands I stick with</li>
            <li> /&gt;See FULL REVIEW HERE  </li>
            <li> and I feel this makes my hair more rich and vibrant</li>
            <li> I have a medium thickness, very (very) straight hair that&#x27;s easily tangled and breaks.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does that rare task of conditioning really well, without leaving a coating; it rinses cleanly and feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> the fact that I&#x27;m now virtually completely gray around my face, and that I take an oral chemo drug every day, and you have the perfect setup for thinning, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> This make my hair super soft and nice.</li>
            <li> My hair feel really soft and love the smell really easy to style after wash my hair</li>
            <li> This is great conditioner leaves hair soft, with shine and bounce, no heavy residue or build up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great body builder for limp fine hair.</li>
            <li> question the accuracy of the many positive reviews because of the offer for free conditioner if a positive review is written.</li>
            <li> Both my temples and nape are filling in slowly but surely (Yay!!!</li>
            <li> Although it serves as no aid to  hair loss function wise like the shampoo does, this product certainly restores the feel of hair after the natural cleanse, form the corresponding shampoo.</li>
            <li> 1.&lt;br /&gt;We have been using this condition among other products, and we are quite happy.</li>
            <li> I started using this immediately based on the feedback from other customers who have great results.</li>
            <li> They leave my hair feeling clean and healthy, and I am seeing some new hair growth and volume.</li>
            <li> I guess if you are looking for a super lightweight conditioner - this is for you.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner absorbs quickly and leaves no residue after rising.</li>
            <li> ;  However, as a formerly long-haired guy, I can tell you conditioner will make your hair softer and more manageable, which is why most women use it.  </li>
            <li> Also my finger nails are growing so quickly</li>
            <li> I can already see a tremendous difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Only one I don&#x27;t love about it, the scent does not smell like &amp;#34;lavender and vanilla&amp;#34;, its more like a lavender and almond.</li>
            <li> This product also contains argan oil, which has helped strengthen my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li> The trick is to use my palm and massage it quickly without stopping.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> great effect lasting the whole day</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> She also loves it and has super curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I was super consernd than my friend recommend this products</li>
            <li> Super lightweight, did not feel like it was conditioning my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> It all arrived so quickly</li>
            <li> Hopefully the shedding will subside quickly.</li>
            <li> Use with the shampoo will tremendously reduce hair loss.</li>
            <li> I like the way the conditioner leaves the texture of my hair, and the mild smell of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Even on high humidity days, I have better control over how my hair looks</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and if you let your long hair dry before brushing it, it brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure what ingredients are doing this, but whichever ones they are, they are working miracles up top, and smell extremely different than most conditioners that I&#x27;ve used...which is usually almost always a good sign in my book.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my hair from the very first use.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable having my whole family use it!</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Either this condition is too light without enough deep conditioning ingredients to provide a good slip to the hair post-shampoo (regardless of shampoo used), or it just cannot compensate for the harshness of the companion shampoo, I haven&#x27;t been able to determine that yet.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown back and it&#x27;s much more healthy, feels soft &amp; more manageable.  </li>
            <li> if the hair falling out now needs to come out to make way for new healthy hair or if I&#x27;m still not getting to the root cause of my hair loss issue.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hear that tangles easily and have tried some of my wife&#x27;s conditioners that say they detangle.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well but my hair was not as easy to brush through after washing.</li>
            <li> I hope to see long term results that last and prove that this is the best combo of shampoo and conditioner for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I shampooed and conditioned my hair a week after the relaxer and my hair was just as soft and beautiful as when the salon products were used, only this product is organic</li>
            <li> As I grow older I find that my skin has become overly sensitive to many chemicals, specifically many of them which are being used in health/beauty products (the irony).</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel very soft and manageable, i have yet to use it more.</li>
            <li> I am trying this conditioner with same brand shampoo, looks like it is very good, hair is not dry</li>
            <li> My conditioner expectations are pretty straightforward:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the hair loss shampoo from Pura d&#x27;or as well and the combo is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Not as rich or hair supporting as the  description led me to believe.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner as a present from my aunt, and I truly love it!</li>
            <li> the curl is comming back to healthy n shinny!</li>
            <li> I really like it!!</li>
            <li> Most importantly the first time I used it  my hair felt soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> and actually I lost more hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve payed a lot of money, looking for a good product to avoid my hait loose, and finaly</li>
            <li> It not only leaves my hair detangled but it doesn&#x27;t have that the strong perfumed smell that most conditioners have.  </li>
            <li> And your hair will feel silky smooth, comb better, and lay down better.  </li>
            <li> Through the years I have had a challenge with using regular conditioners because it seemed it would cause my hair to fall out more easily.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to dry my hair out, but following up with this conditioner seems to leave it with the perfect moisture.  </li>
            <li> It did however work on my daughters fine virgin straight hair...</li>
            <li> Smell is really refreshing, however, doesn&#x27;t spread quite easily, would need a few more pumps to for longer hair.</li>
            <li> certainly nothing smooth or silky</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the product it has good mild aroma as expected.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, a little pricey though</li>
            <li> think I am going to go to TJMaxx (cheap Natural hair products) or the Health Food Store and get Conditoner for Fine Hair (organic type) and use instead.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s nice, but I think I need a little more use before deciding that this will be my conditioner for life.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I have used quite a few great organic conditioners.  </li>
            <li> This is such an amazing experience to use purad&#x27;or company&#x27;s products and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks I can say that the results are great.</li>
            <li> I use a heavy duty conditioning treatment to help style my hair and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Theorie&#x27;s Argan Oil conditioner, which is an amazing product, but it just wasn&#x27;t conditioning enough to compensate for the shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> Fantastic combination with Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo and my hair are really vitalised</li>
            <li> It really works on my hair and make my oily scalp comfortable.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fantastic thing.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky soft and fuller :)</li>
            <li> far as cost, I believe is it better than the rest.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading many reviews and like what I am seeing so far.  </li>
            <li> and the result is far better with Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pics aren&#x27;t the greatest (I&#x27;m tired tonight), but I hope you can see a difference in hair quality.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot for the price.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with how well this product is working so far.  </li>
            <li> With the conditioner I have to use probably 50% more than with the old conditioners.</li>
            <li> Even my hair dresser commented on how healthy and soft my hair felt, and this is just after about a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Definitely gave a nice feel to my damaged hair after use.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil even though this is my second day using it my face feel so smooth</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> only thing is I feel it is kind of expansive.</li>
            <li> So far love how the product feels.</li>
            <li> If you want a conditioner that is worth every penny you are offering then this one is for you.</li>
            <li> Gives my wife&#x27;s hair a sexy natural shine</li>
            <li> So the tradeoff is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s always been very healthy and can grow quite long.</li>
            <li> and I wanted the hair that I have left to look nice.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and silky and looking shiny, all while smelling great.</li>
            <li> It is also the priciest, but I love that it has all natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> The product is well worth it.</li>
            <li> so far:-)</li>
            <li> Smells like there is not artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s hair regrowth abilities, but it has a great scent, which helps eliminate the gold labels&#x27; strong scent btw, and it washes out easier than most conditioners and leaves my hair felling less dry and fuller/thicker.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and manageable after using this product, and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product from now on and the cost is well worth its qualities.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural</li>
            <li> So far, pleased with the smell, lather and feel of both of these products.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li> and we are not unhappy with our choice of Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have all of the ingredients that the shampoo has that&#x27;s suppose to combat hair loss, but it does contain natural, healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Has a nice gentle natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> More natural looking and not so &amp;#34;stressed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh smell of it.</li>
            <li> There is no way to tell if it actually helps prevent hair loss but the shampoo and conditioner are high-quality products that make my hair look nice</li>
            <li> so I am early on in the process to be able to leave a definitive result.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using it, my natural hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a product with out the harsh chemicals most stores carry.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell on that, but it is nice using a product that works so well with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week but really like it so far as my hair looks more naturally healthy, has more body and feels thicker.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that its all natural and better for the environment.</li>
            <li> but it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is bit pricey but worth everything you spend.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but had to write one for this SCAM.</li>
            <li> It smelled like the shampoo, the Argan Oil does have a distinct scent.</li>
            <li> feel moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is a bit pricey but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair feeling fuller and with less hair loss in the shower, and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and smelling very pleasant, like vanilla.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very easy to comb through - great smell and left my hair extra soft.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair more body and keeps it from being too fly-away due to static electricity.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not strong and over barring leaves your hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> You can tell the shampoo washes out nicely and leave behind a nice clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> but I do notice that my hair gets oily pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair is incredibly soft, so clean, looks fuller and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Strong enough but not too strong and overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to file them every other day, which I think is a good sign.    </li>
            <li> It smells AMAZINGGGG too!&lt;br /&gt;Its not better than my JASON organic biotin condition, but its a great condition to make ur hair soft if you wanna splurge. :)</li>
            <li> I have used multiple sulphate free products in the past, and this one is one of the best ones.</li>
            <li> Make sure to leave it in for awhile (more than a few minutes) to get the full effect.  </li>
            <li> It conditions my fine hair without weighing it down and gives it a nice feel.  </li>
            <li> wow-you can tell a difference right away..</li>
            <li> , I thinking I am in the right product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair silky and sleek right after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Started using right away and.</li>
            <li> Still lost some hair the first shampoo, but by the second one I didn&#x27;t notice any loss which I found amazing.  </li>
            <li> It should be better on normal straight hair.</li>
            <li> i recommend the ultra labs hair lush - better hydrating, smells good, and does prevent hair loss - didn&#x27;t notice hair growth but did notice less hair loss.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-hair loss decreased(did not totally stop yet,we hope eventually it will stop with frequent use).&lt;br /&gt;-the product has a pleasant</li>
            <li> /&gt;-hair loss decreased(did not totally stop yet,we hope eventually it will stop with frequent use).&lt;br /&gt;-the product has a pleasant</li>
            <li> My hair feels very elastic, strong and is very shiny.</li>
            <li> This organic conditioner has a creamy feel and high end texture that will leave you hair fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I only eat organic food, and now I finally found an organic shampoo and conditioner that works great and smells really fresh.  </li>
            <li> but I felt the shampoo was helping my hair so much that I wanted to get the full benefit of both products used simultaneously.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so greasy as regular brand conditioners, which I guess maybe because of the lack of chemical components to help you getting the feeling of smoothness, that&#x27;s why if you do want to achieve the same kind of feeling of nourishing after bath, you have to put a bit more on your hair and let it stay for a longer time before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been weeks and my hair feels so good , soft and fuller!</li>
            <li> If you research the ingredients they use you will see all of them are good for preventing or slowing down hair loss.</li>
            <li> I understand that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is a little bit different, but it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> the quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The product seems of very high quality</li>
            <li> It felt really soft and full again (my son used to say &amp;#34;Your hair feels like spider webs&amp;#34; as a toddler, it was a compliment!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as instantly conditioning as other conditioners, but my hair feels really nice after using, and, as noted before, it smells so nice.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> it leaves hair soft, just enough shine and really good smell.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to report back in the future but as I said before, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Not only does it provide great moisture and care to beat up hair, but you can smell the scent on your head for up to an entire day after using this.</li>
            <li> Very waxy, leaves a heavy residue or coating on the hair and not all that great a detangler.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair really soft and easy to comb after showers.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Only thing is that you really have to pump out a lot and can feel kind of watery.</li>
            <li> It has, after a few weeks use, really started to deal with my thinning hair by imparting great volume to it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair feeling clean but the ends of my hair tangled easily.  </li>
            <li> I have used other hair loss shampoos in the past - this is the best so far, and this product has a nice scent As well.</li>
            <li> I love to shop organically, and have been using farmers markets and local farms for years, so when I found this product I decided to step away from those commercial conditioners full of chemicals and try this, I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I liked that the conditioner worked well on my fine, thin hair which tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I am a 59-year-old male and my hair is very important to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend very much...</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo very much.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I once had conditioner in Hawaii and it smelled very much like this.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde color treated hair and was looking for a more natural product that actually made my hair look and feel good.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling smooth silky and even in the heat my hair does not get frizzy using this conditioner, give it a shot - its worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> so I need a good conditioner, something a little heavier</li>
            <li> Along with significantly reduced hairloss, my hair and is now lively and shiny, too.  </li>
            <li> Besides that, the product itself is decent and overall nice product.</li>
            <li> Feels good in my hair and a little more silkier than my regular conditioner!</li>
            <li> Saw results after first shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells nicer than the shampoo (shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like anything) and it keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> After my first use I immediately noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I started buying wigs and felt like my life as a pretty woman was over.</li>
            <li> First, I bought this shampoo, conditioner, and oil.</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate difference in my hair texture the first day.</li>
            <li> I love it, hope they will make it in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li> My hair has been growing more since i have been using it for only two weeks!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am okay with the product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it then feels light and full, so it actually is a treat to style and work with.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in an Organic non-paraben conditioner because my hair seemed to be falling out in handfuls every day...</li>
            <li> I decided to try this conditioner although many reviews for the shampoo said to only buy the shampoo.</li>
            <li> First off it smelled hideous.</li>
            <li> Great product the portion size is what sucks.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure because it felt like I had to use a lot of it to actually feel it in my hair</li>
            <li> This is my first conditioner I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I tried many different brand with Conditioner</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It is also organic which we also try to use, and most organics especially with</li>
            <li> After I used several times, I found my hair loss is getting better.  </li>
            <li> Towards the middle of 2014, I started researching oils for skin, hair, to nails to see what they were all about because so many oils were being touted as the solution to all our beauty needs.</li>
            <li> To squash the moodiness, I learned that simple is better when it comes to what I put on my skin and</li>
            <li> From the first time i used this conditioner</li>
            <li> Really wish I&#x27;d found this sooner because it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also bright, ghostbusters, green.</li>
            <li> After using the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo, this conditioner leaves my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> just used it today for the first time along wiht the Tranquility shampoo and my hair looks and feels beautiuful!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I may get my thyroid hormones tested just to make sure that is functioning properly as well.</li>
            <li> But what really ticks me off is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> but I come back to these ones because they are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Thanks purad&#x27;or!</li>
            <li> first week - My hair is fuller and some hair is growing.</li>
            <li> it seems pretty good！</li>
            <li> Tangled hair, no shine, and dryness) with first use</li>
            <li> First time using this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing falling hair for several months (more than 50 strands a day) and tried everything.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hair fall for about an year while I tried many different shampoos and conditioners but to no avail.</li>
            <li> After I started using it, I understand the benefit at the first time.</li>
            <li> I first started using the anti-hairloss shampoo without the conditioner</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I first purchased this after being on the search for an organic hair set of shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it will work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Therefore I bought it and we can see the difference even in first week of using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> What I found to be even more helpful to my hair is to apply some coconut oil prior to a shower.</li>
            <li> Essentially I have felt a natural luxurious feel to my hair, great piece of mind knowing this conditioner has natural ingredients to help lock in that beneficial stimulating cleanse from the shampoo, for the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pura d shampoo and this was my first use of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has much more volume and is finally starting to grow quicker and is thicker already!!!  </li>
            <li> Hoping a consistent improvement in  my hair with the help of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like it so much!</li>
            <li> Coupled with the Shampoo, I find this conditioner leaves my hair feeling really soft and light.</li>
            <li> How ironic!</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels afterwards, and the smell is terrific.  </li>
            <li> first bought a hemp conditioner for some weeks</li>
            <li> Tried both for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with my hair my entire life (more than 30 years).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time to use Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only saying that because I love argan oil</li>
            <li> Love this product, and rave enough about it.</li>
            <li> I checked the label to make sure it is actually conditioner and not lotion.  </li>
            <li> after used this conditioner, I feel that my hair is smooth and soft and continued for two days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed if my hair is thicker, yet, but I like it well enough to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Especially it works better when I use Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label).</li>
            <li> I ordered this version first</li>
            <li> It definitely had more body.  </li>
            <li> I believe I have found a real winner!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s natural but not silky, smooth.</li>
            <li> I always keep an extra bottle at home in case I run out before I remember to order some more.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it, I could feel the nourishment provided by this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love both products and will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and leaves my hair soft, silky and managable.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner especially since it was a bit cheaper at $20 for a 16 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Towards the middle of 2014, I started researching oils for skin, hair, to nails to see what they were all about because so many oils were being touted as the solution to all our beauty needs.</li>
            <li> To squash the moodiness, I learned that simple is better when it comes to what I put on my skin and</li>
            <li> I have used these products for several months now and my hair has never been better.  </li>
            <li> may finish the bottle but add another conditioner to help detangle my hair more. will continue use and update later</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Still using  the first bottle  </li>
            <li> Its natural and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to see if this conditioner was truly color safe and it is - no color residue on my white hair towels!</li>
            <li> and I am able to groom it properly.</li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo and conditioner first the day after they got here.</li>
            <li> My hair stays in good shape of curls, not as messy as before.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, lathers well.</li>
            <li> I have been using different kind of shampoo and conditioners before but after using this product my hair became very soft.</li>
            <li> conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a product that not only works, it&#x27;s is NOT going to kill me using it, and it is so natural and made from mostly vegetables, that you almost can drink it!</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried, at first, about the scent based on some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried, at first, about the scent based on some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Though I know a lot of my hair fall is due to stress and managing my stress is probably the best hair loss prevention for me, this is this first product that I&#x27;ve noticed less hair fall while showering throughout my cycles of stress.</li>
            <li> probably a good product for someone who doesn&#x27;t have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine and limp hair and using this product makes my hair strands more thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li> I originally made this purchase for myself but now use it for my young daughters as well.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner in conjunction with the Argan Gold shampoo from the same line works very well for strengthening existing super fine hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I finally found another great shampoo and conditioner for my very fine, thin hair after trying forever...</li>
            <li> Smelled great, but left my hair feeling rough afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling extremely soft and manageable, not to mention the scent of this conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and it lathers very well but just does not leave my hair as soft as it could be for the price point.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this conditioner and shampoo, I used to have to blow dry my hair before to look good, but now I just let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I was so used to the slickness of silicones both in my shampoo and conditioning product that I had no idea how natural, clean hair felt.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t been using them for a long time yet, I am very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> As far as healthy, it seems to be natural</li>
            <li> Making hair grow more is very scientific topic and technical problem.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing and seem to need to use more than I would if using a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells good, I used few days, it&#x27;s really helped save my hair.</li>
            <li> At first large amounts of hair came out which almost made me stop.</li>
            <li> This stuff along with the hair loss prevention shampoo and pure argan oil have really improved the condition of my damaged hair!</li>
            <li> My hair seemed damaged, flat and dead, nothing helped make it look full and feel great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with how little hair I lost while shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and helps tame my frizzy, curly hair!!</li>
            <li> For me the price was a bit high but was worth it for the bottle size and using organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft and silky!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would keep using this conditioner for the positive effects it has, but it may not be for everyone...</li>
            <li> It does nothing positive for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product for me after she saw lots of positive reviews online</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great, it definitely increases volume in my hair, comparing to other conditioner I have been used for years.</li>
            <li> This conditioner work great for African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that most shampoo and conditioner does not work well with.  </li>
            <li> After the first time I used this I could feel a difference; and that is because the product has a volumizing effect that helps a lot when you have lost so much hair.</li>
            <li> Currently, I use it about 3 times/week and it was been doing the job with keeping my hair from becoming dandruffy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is OK; but if you have long hair like I do - it will not de-tangle it.</li>
            <li> leaves your hair feeling full and really soft.</li>
            <li> So far, the claims from Pura d&#x27;or appear to be true.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness and have become a true fan.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was noticing a lot more hair loss than normal lately.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organic product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, does the job and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and cream rinse really make my hair feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all tangled and feels a bit dry almost like you&#x27;ll never get it untangled and smooth again!  </li>
            <li> With only first use of this conditionars my hair become so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that I am having more volume when I dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but hey, this is organic and after dry my hair, my hair stays so much better than before.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> However, while applying, it didn&#x27;t give me enough confidence that my hair will be easy ti untangle</li>
            <li> Mild natural lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> Even with the large amount of conditioner I used, I still don&#x27;t feel like my hair was conditioned.</li>
            <li> I did my research and watched certain talk shows and found out about this product.  </li>
            <li> Allow the scalp to soak in the coconut oil and then use the Pure d&#x27;or Shampoo and Conditioner to wash the hair off.</li>
            <li> I also have 2 daughters that help out with the reviews for certain products, hair care is one of them.</li>
            <li> After I used this brand shampoo, I wasn&#x27;t sure any conditioner would help as it made my hair bone dry (just for the first week or so while my hair adjusted to it), but this soaked right in and made my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading all the positive reviews and I have to say that the hype is real.</li>
            <li> both contain anti-har-loss extracts, and with using the both of them PLUS taking biotin, I&#x27;ve noticed new hairs emerge!!  </li>
            <li> I found my new hair care pair!!  </li>
            <li> first time I used it I was amazed at how soft it left my hair and how much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I love trying out new and different hair care products.</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t seem worth the cost when I can get more shampoo and conditioner twice the size and half the cost.</li>
            <li> Secondly this product is not intended or good for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I was using a Pantene 2 in 1 product previously and find this product far superior.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean, and does not weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I&#x27;ve had to use a leave in AFTER conditioner in conjunction with this just to keep my hair looking decent.</li>
            <li> If I had to be picky about this product, it would be the fact that I am going through it much faster than pure d&#x27;or shampoo; and I&#x27;ve had my shampoo bottle longer.</li>
            <li> Throughout this whole period large amounts of hair would come out in the shower</li>
            <li> but this conditioner is very thick and does a great job of moisturizing my hair after i shampoo it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair flat and smells strongly like baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> The only downside of this conditioner is that as light as it is, it doesn&#x27;t help much with giving my hair some volume.</li>
            <li> My roommate gave me a bottle of Premium Organic Conditioner in a few month ago, I used it and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li> It saved my hair which was totally damaged from a &amp;#34;conditioning rinse&amp;#34; I purchased (and trashed) and it kept my hair smooth on a very humid day.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, the smell is amazing after using few days</li>
            <li> I know the product does not claim to grow hair, I really believe with my attitude and by stopping it from falling out, the reverse process is bound to happen.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well in my hair.</li>
            <li> but after a whole week my hair seemed to get adapted to it</li>
            <li> I really like how this product makes my hair and scalp feel.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> But this one doesn&#x27;t really work for</li>
            <li> I had and still have hair loss problem and decided to give this a shot as the reviews seemed to be promising.</li>
            <li> But really did not help.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is better than expected.</li>
            <li> I have very picky hair</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind it, though.</li>
            <li> I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> And a bottle lasts about 1-2 months depending how much you want to use.</li>
            <li> I became very concerned and decided to try Pura d&#x27;or:</li>
            <li> It work really well.</li>
            <li> Not so much, anymore.  </li>
            <li> unlike the shampoo, I feel that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t actually do much.</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay the price for the real &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; anymore.  </li>
            <li> but this one is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is a very hydrating conditioner.  </li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this conditioner and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Really like how the conditioner smooths the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li> however I have straight hair.</li>
            <li> This product has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, after losing so much hair</li>
            <li> but with a much richer conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Very drying for curly hair, would not recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li> I would really like to throw it away, but I don&#x27;t believe in wasting products.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom and it really works for her.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much healthier, and my confidence is returning.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very soothing and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It really weorked for me.</li>
            <li> It has so much bounce</li>
            <li> /&gt;She absolutely loves this conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I can really go that 4th day without washing if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much time with it</li>
            <li> The whole family is using it.</li>
            <li> and my hair felt very silky after.</li>
            <li> I really like that is organic</li>

            <li> She was very worried and</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need much, just a dab.  </li>
            <li> I have allergic reactions to regular shampoos and conditions, and was looking for chemical free products.</li>

            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much of leave in hair for 2 mins and feel.</li>
            <li> and like it so much that I am going to try the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I received the above product(s) free of charge from Pur D’ or.  </li>
            <li> I received the above product(s) free of charge from Pur D’ or.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricey for sure, but the bottle lasts 3 months before it is empty</li>
            <li> For the price (for the shampoo and conditioner) I expected more.</li>
            <li> My hair look really shiny just after 2 applications.</li>
            <li> My hair stopped falling out so much the day I started using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, my hair stopped falling out</li>
            <li> I also really like the scent as well.  </li>
            <li> I have already noticed that I am not losing hair as much as before.</li>
            <li> Everyone commons how shiny my hair looks, thanks to the Purador.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it actually began to make my hair really soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> actually looks natural and healthy.</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old male and have a receding hairline along with thinning hair on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s so far working better than Invanti.</li>
            <li> I have been highlighting my hair for years now and tried so many products to keep my hair soft,bring the shine back,and most important of all prevent our crazy hair loss...</li>
            <li> I have been highlighting my hair for years now and tried so many products to keep my hair soft,bring the shine back,and most important of all prevent our crazy hair loss...</li>
            <li> I will be honest I am not a huge fan of the smell of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product and conditioner for about one week and as expected have not seen much results but can say it sure smells good and leaves my hair feeling softer with a somewhat fuller appearance, possibly due to a bit of thickening.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and  silky!!!</li>
            <li> After having used for a few weeks, I feel it is a very good conditioner as compared to the other ones in the market - it&#x27;s organic and there is no SLS.</li>
            <li> After the first time use, I found the hair in my bathroom is much more less than before.</li>
            <li> Other products have left my scalp itching; this soothes my scalp and makes the hair soft and it also smells great.  </li>
            <li> I got it last weekend , and use 2 times,feel good,my hair feel more smooth than i use other conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and conditioners tend to weight it down and cause it to be greasy.  </li>
            <li> Only prp therapy offers more new hair!  </li>
            <li> Now it is a deep rich brown in appearance and much fuller looking.</li>
            <li> So far after a couple of uses this conditioner has Left my hair shiny and soft, very easy to comb through my hair</li>
            <li> I have very baby fine long hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to wash every other day or every three days</li>
            <li> I was so excited for it to work too, especially because I bought the shampoo which I like, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I still use their Euro hair oil but have abandoned most of the other products.</li>
            <li> I like this better than my other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner smell great and a little shampoo goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Many other reviews and articles seemed to confirm this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many other reviews and articles seemed to confirm this.  </li>
            <li> My hair is full, shiny and more manageable, softer than I can remember in a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> Like the shampoo, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to decide if it&#x27;s effective but will update this review once I have used it more and compare it to the other preventive hair loss productive I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a 55 year old male who has always had a very full head of hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 55 year old male who has always had a very full head of hair</li>
            <li> Even after using 5 pumps of this on my long, fine hair and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes, it still did nothing to &amp;#34;heal and repair damaged&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> This is a really solid hair conditioner that I find leaves my hair with a clean look and a texture that I can style.  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy, and together with the shampoo, left my hair bouncy and full.</li>
            <li> No bad chemicals and my hair is soft and manageable like when I was young.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s the former, then this would probably be a good conditioner for people who tend to have oily hair, or want something lightweight that won&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> Sometimes lavender can be overwhelming so the vanilla really calms it down.</li>
            <li> It actually leaves my hair feeling soft, full of volume, and even helps my scalp!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found the right product!</li>
            <li> Will have to further inquire to see who is right, I suppose!</li>
            <li> I tried many  other  products and decided to stick to this one , I highly recommend it to others 😊.  </li>
            <li> my hair has become smooth and shiny and very manageable and my dry scalp is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I have to say it really makes my hair less fuzzy more shiny.</li>
            <li> Its so soft and looks healthy, it doesn&#x27;t look dry or washed out.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for having your hair not too dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I always leave in quite a bit of my conditioner, with this one I can rinse out more of it, because it&#x27;s quite a heavy product which I consider to be a positive trait.  </li>
            <li> Feels great on my hairs, made it silky smooth without all the crazy chemicals from my old conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and much happier!  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to use natural hair conditioning products.</li>
            <li> after the first use my hair felt soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived in tropical and blizzard-like climates and the same holds true.</li>
            <li> and it calms it down and makes it look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and this leaves it very soft but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I would suggest everyone who is facing the same hair loss problem, please start using this unique product Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil hair conditioner for a new look of your hair style.</li>
            <li> and instead I see new baby hair all over my head !</li>
            <li> smelled great but left hair dull.</li>
            <li> But, this conditioner helps conditioned my hair better and avoid breakage when I brush my hair, I did see less breakage and tangling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to quantify &amp;#34;less hair loss&amp;#34; but the less hair I see in my brush all week, the better I&#x27;m feeling about the product.  </li>
            <li> Has been about a week since I started using this product and I can already see changes in more hair growth and less hair loss.</li>
            <li> Slightly drying on ends so be sure to use lots of conditioner.</li>
            <li> Since using this my hair has started looking better and I have noticed less loss.</li>
            <li> More in winter and less in summer.</li>
            <li> Its a good one with out any harsh chemicals in it as the regular shampoo have</li>
            <li> I can also feel deeply hydrated, I think this brings a feature which adds vital moisture and gets rid of the friz and gives me a smooth look.</li>
            <li> One of the main fragrances is  vanilla.  </li>
            <li> My only complaints is the price and when I received it the bottle top was open and some leaked in the box.  </li>
            <li> I received pura d&#x27;por as a gift from my older brother for my 30th birthday.</li>
            <li> I use about two pumps for the conditioner to have a decent smoothness.  </li>
            <li> The combination of the two products has improved my hair in look, feel, and keeps the color vibrant longer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for the last 7 years and this is a good alternative if you want an organic product without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am older and am looking to end my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Left my hair in more tangles than it was prior to using it.</li>
            <li> Also, the problem with these type of container tops is that after you manage to open the top, if kept open, water somehow gets into it and dilutes the product and they are a hassle to close.</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked itself left my hair soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li> my hair are fine, very dry and unmanageable .Since</li>
            <li> Because I literally had to take out the cap and pour sooo much just to make my hair soft!</li>
            <li> Very soft hair!</li>
            <li> It left my hair very manageable, feeling really soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li> This is my very first review I have written on amazon (daily shopper here).  </li>
            <li> No dry ends, no limp hair, non oily, no bad scents, no chemicals.</li>
            <li> The price is high but you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Conditioner, try it with the Pura d&#x27;or:</li>

            <li> , I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it and will continue to use it well after this review is submitted.</li>
            <li> Just high priced shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> although to be honest, I started a lot of other treatments at about the same time (Biotin, Fo-Ti, and Reishi).</li>
            <li> A little too pure or clear looking for having so many herbal ingredients.</li>
            <li> I got my blood tested to make sure there was not a significant health issue.</li>
            <li> Hair seems to be a little more shinier.  </li>
            <li> would have given the product a 5 star if the price was a little more affordable.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.dont weight my hair down like other products that claims to be natural.</li>
            <li> I do have to use a little more than normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> I started a new all natural dandruff shampoo that was extremely effective, but as a consequence left my curly hair unbelievably dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Feels very natural, and makes my hair nice, soft and lends a slight natural glow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the shampoo really clarifies and then this conditioner makes my hair feel soft, shinny and manageable.</li>
            <li> but it was not thick</li>
            <li> Great product- a bit expensive though.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I like it to make me feel like it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> Would buy again makes hair feel soft and supple, doesnt really do much  for hair growth and hair fall.</li>
            <li> After the final rinse you can still feel that your hair has absorbed the oils from the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is pretty nice but a bit on the thin side for my taste.</li>
            <li> I bought both shampoo and conditioner  after using it for a few times I notice my hair is much more healthier, softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> rarely write reviews, but I felt obliged to warn potential customers.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few days my hair is already looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li> but otherwise I can see the normal hairfall the remaining time</li>
            <li> My barber also noticed a difference, the hair growth was thicker and was faster than normal.</li>
            <li> Feels a lot different going on than most commercial conditioners and so far my hair seems to be responding well to it.</li>
            <li> I really like how easy it is to comb with little sculpting product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the messy buildup that I&#x27;ve gotten with other so-called high end conditioners, and the shine is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love the slight fragrance, will continue to use!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about product...left my hair feeling dry</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell which is having a more positive effect on my hair, the shampoo or the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> At first I was very leery of this conditioner as it is very light and did not think it could hold to my very thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> When dry, it feels fuller, smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> my hair is shiny and soft and seems much more manageable than previously.</li>
            <li> A little of the shampoo and conditioner go a long way, so they last a while, and they smell great.</li>
            <li> I know that it is made a little bit differently from regular conditioners, with better and more natural ingredients, but I really need to use a lot to get my hair actually conditioned.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but makes it easy to comb and manageable.</li>
            <li> Other reviews concerning the fragrances seem accurate:  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after using it for four months now, my hair is back in great condition.  </li>
            <li> My wife likes it, she says her hair stopped falling out like it use to, and lots of new baby hairs growing .</li>
            <li> I am a new user to the Pura D&#x27;or Line.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any new hair growth</li>
            <li> I might end up giving this product five stars, but since it&#x27;s relatively new to me, I am going for four.</li>
            <li> and also my hair is dull from coloring it so much and since I  used this product the color has more shine to it.</li>
            <li> My natural hair was soft and easy to manage after using it, so much so that it reminded me of my previously relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals is the main reason I use this.</li>
            <li> Not enough time to really see real improvement</li>
            <li> I have very fine, usually quite soft, hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel very soft after using the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> wow, wow!!  </li>
            <li> I could tell that the shampoo really cleaned my hair and it felt pretty dry afterwards, so I used a lot of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I did not like it at first because it didn&#x27;t give enough fumes.</li>
            <li> I usually do not use Conditioner, but if it was going to help me grow hair</li>
            <li> It is made of natural, organic ingredients (a rarity!)</li>
            <li> Not only did it work, it worked better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> I noticed some pretty severe shedding and breakage earlier in the year.  </li>
            <li> And my hair is SO soft!</li>
            <li> Much better than Nioxin (what a waste of money!).</li>
            <li> I would buy again simply because it promotes hair growth.;)</li>
            <li> Even without any other product, I&#x27;ve received constant compliments and have had many strangers walk up and either touch my hair or ask to touch my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually do not leave reviews for products I bought</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It leaves ur hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Found our Pura d&#x27; or shampoo and conditioner and I am starting to notice a difference in my hair, I&#x27;m not loosing as much hair now, and my hair is getting thicker!</li>
            <li> Usually I rec many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li> This is actually my first time leaving a comment on a product but to my surprise, this product actually worked for me!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li> Like the smell and leaves my hair soft!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try and have been pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I first used this product about a month back when I ran out of hair conditioner and my roommate had this one on the bathtub shelf.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling nourished and smooth without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Its true what the products say that it really really helps dull ,fine dry hair .</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference right away, but by the second or third time I&#x27;d tried it I was really blown away.</li>
            <li> Using the products at this point is giving me a sense that the individual hair strands are becoming less susceptible to breakage, but I can&#x27;t say that with absolute certainty.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend and worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use a high quality organic conditioner that actually does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> and I must say, it not only leaves my hair clean and soft, but it has slowed down the volume of hair I was losing with each shampoo and simple light brushing.  </li>
            <li> Used along with the shampoo and did see an improvement with less hair fall compared to Enjoy, Nioxin and Satinique.</li>
            <li> I normally can&#x27;t use conditioner in my hair because it weighs my hair way too much, but this conditioner actually leaves my hair feeling like silk</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine and thin</li>
            <li> but now I can easily say I dont worry about how hard I brush my hair or how fast I curl or straighten because I know my hair is stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> However, I realized that you don&#x27;t need to use much with this condition since it does leave my hair feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, I live in a very humid climate and my hair tends to frizz by mid day.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the conditioner did not leave hair easy to comb, but once combed and dry</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not leave my hair super silky like other brands.</li>
            <li> I started using these products two months ago ,my hair changes from  dull to healthy .</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean an with a lot of body, Not heavy or weighted down like some conditioners can do.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth it to know that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the harsh chemicals in it like many store bought conditioners.</li>
            <li> Caused more hair loss and extreme dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down and felt like I went to a spa for a special treatment.  </li>
            <li> I bought it based on the great reviews but what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> old&#x27;s straight hair, with the same results.</li>
            <li> This helped even and clear it up.</li>
            <li> guess there is nothing that will really grown hair back</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and prone to eczema</li>
            <li> I have a wavy, frizzy hair and this conditioner helps it look smooth without damaging my hair color, as it does not have any harsh sulfates.</li>
            <li> and it looked shinier, not dead and lifeless from being colored hair.  </li>
            <li> I think because it contains a lot of natural oils.  </li>
            <li> The natural ingredients are also a plus.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a natural product with Argan oil.</li>
            <li> The seller was professional and promptly refunded my account☺</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, but still leaves the hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 76 years old.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioners are not harsh on your hair and leave your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft</li>
            <li> All natural and smells like lavender.</li>
            <li> Natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It smells like an old, stinky bathroom covered up by a lavender/floral room spray.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a soft feel to my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and therefore naturally frizzy, especially here in the Southeast where we have so much humidity.  </li>
            <li> Also, although it is natural it&#x27;s NOT organic.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it so far.</li>
            <li> The smell is gentle enough that my fiance can use this without it smelling too girly for him.</li>
            <li> tried to purchase this directly from Pura D&#x27;or.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> According to the ads, it&#x27;s 99% natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It also protects from heat damage as i straight my hair daily,</li>
            <li> Her hair feels so soft and</li>
            <li> hair lush costs a bundle though which is why i tried looking for something cheaper.</li>
            <li> So far, this conditioner coupled with the shampoo that goes with it has done wonders for my hair without the biotin supplement.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old lady</li>
            <li> Because of my age ( 71 years old )</li>
            <li> all  of which are Purador products ,,,My husband was so surprised ,he started using them too</li>
            <li> , he is 77 years old .</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a soft feel to my hair</li>
            <li> but it did not make my hair soft at all.  </li>
            <li> its has been working so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using it about two weeks so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it so far....</li>
            <li> Smells like baby lotion and makes my hair soft and feel thicker.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> I was expecting to have soft, silky hair with the conditioner..</li>
            <li> It does what it says, it makes your hair soft within mins</li>
            <li> I had oily hair, so this completely retexture my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the conditioner and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> After I tried this conditioner, my hair becomes soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so shiny and lush.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair soft and adds some shine, not a lot, but it&#x27;s natural looking.</li>
            <li> I just started using it, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner all natural, organic.</li>
            <li> It is natural, I like it.</li>
            <li> I like for my hair to feel soft when being conditioned.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; soft.</li>
            <li> so I decided to go all natural with hair</li>
            <li> thought this shampoo was all natural, but have since learned that any shampoo that foams/lathers contains some form of SLS (in this case cocamide) and strips the hair of all</li>
            <li> I like the product results so far.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky, soft, and un-frizzy without a buildup of gunk.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural wavy-ness.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft</li>
            <li> Like it so far.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner, especially after using the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic shampoo.  </li>
            <li> MY HAIR FEELS &amp; LOOKS THICKER AND IS SOFT TO THE TOUCH.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky soft, hydrated, and fuller.  </li>
            <li> All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I came across this shampoo when I was looking for all natural shampoos &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li> I went low-poo about six months ago and have been looking for a fully natural product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that a natural conditioner would work so well</li>
            <li> I have tried it and it helps to keep my hair soft, yet to see changes in hair loss.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and moisturized during the winter.</li>
            <li> It leaves it soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> After using these Pura d&#x27;or products for just two days, my hair appears thicker and naturally wavy</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This conditioner keeps my hair soft, without making it oily.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, I wanted to order the conditioner to go along with my shampoo.  </li>
            <li> If you want natural stuff without all the chemicals and your hair to feel like it got nutrition, go for this.</li>
            <li> Like the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked well so far.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt this soft before..</li>
            <li> My hair is sooo incredibly soft and I didn&#x27;t have to use product in my hair after the shower.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for a couple of weeks and have to admit I&#x27;m a fan so far.. will give an update in a couple of months</li>
            <li> My hair feels very nourished now, and overall healthier.</li>
            <li> I will never use my old shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
            <li> So far hair shedding is accelerating not slowing.</li>
            <li> , I am unsure if it takes more time to reduce the hair fall as I have just started to use lately.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with hair loss for a while and this product with the shampoo has helped my hair feel soft and healthier again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up on natural shampoo and conditioner until you try this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;After trying everything out there, including natural, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It was quite unexpected when I noticed hair shedding.</li>
            <li> I was a surprised as I didn&#x27;t know the reason.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used mostly professional line shampoos.</li>
            <li> I had to completely change my hairstyle, where I part my hair AND almost always have it in a ponytail,</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old man and I have been using this product for about 3 weeks in conduction with their hair loss shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair loss has nearly stopped.  </li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t a big deal really after your hair dries.</li>
            <li> so far i have not seen any results still lots of hair in shower.  </li>
            <li> my rashes have completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> It did not leave my hair completely soft but it works.  </li>
            <li> but I do love to at least try others out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and thus far I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  </li>
            <li> I purchased blue bottle Pura D&#x27;or Hair loss Prevention shampoo and found it it is real works for me.</li>
            <li> I also like the natural fragrance and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> They leave my hair soft and shiny, and reduce the amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> It has all natural and organic ingredients, and is free of parabens, sulfates, and harsh, toxic petroleum based chemicals.  </li>
            <li> At least if I&#x27;m going to lose my hair it, the hair that&#x27;s left can look nice.    </li>
            <li> My hair seems much more manageable and healthier only after using a few times.  </li>
            <li> and I actually think I dried out and damaged my hair more by using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive but for me it&#x27;s worth the end result.</li>
            <li> My hair just looked thick and greasy most of the time.</li>
            <li> was good but to expensive</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it makes it so smooth!</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks of us, I&#x27;m finding it leaves my long, fine, straight hair soft without making it limp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it due to the results I had</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and full - not weighed down at all!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit special, but still acceptable.</li>
            <li> My hair is waist length, so for a bottle to last that long makes it also worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I only ordered the shampoo and used a different conditioner</li>
            <li> Usually when you use cheap conditioner, it leaves a foul smell will taking forever to have water rinsing through completely.</li>
            <li> The first is before beginning Pura D&#x27;or, the second after three months, the last two were taken 6 months afterward.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks, and what started as a tingling on my scalp (&amp;#34;it&#x27;s working!&amp;#34;) was actually the beginning of a month&#x27;s-long rash that ultimately became infected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various conditioners in the past, but this one seems to provide the most long-lasting dryness relief.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind an intense coconut scent (not lavender!) left on your hair and the fact that you need another product for detangling after applying Pura D&#x27;Or&#x27;s blue conditioner, go for it.  </li>
            <li> Initially it doesn&#x27;t feel as rich as some of the other conditioners I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a bottle of the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Shampoo not too long ago and fell in love with it the first time I used it and immediately threw out all of my other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Hair is growing back and also grey is turning back to original brown color.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt it will grow back hair</li>
            <li> Second, my sister (a stylist) colored my hair using high contrast blond and brown, and voila, somehow my hair looks like it did years</li>
            <li> The combination of highly hair beneficial ingredients was key to my purchasing this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for the last month and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> reason I do not give this a full five stars, though, is because I find it to be pretty weak.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, the lathering was minimal, but I chocked it up to the organic nature of the product.</li>
            <li> and I will certainly Come back again for my next order.</li>
            <li> Premium Organic Argan Oil Conditioner leaves my hair very silky and sleek all day long (unlike many other argan oil conditioners I&#x27;ve tried that tended to leave my hair feeling heavy) but is not too soft - it allows my hair to be manageable and holds any styling well.</li>
            <li> I was a Hospice Social Worker for 6 years and seen some of the most horrible cancers anddeaths, and I am telling you right now, they majority were caused UNNECESSARILY from the chemicals we allow businesses to put into our magnificent bodies.</li>
            <li> This is currently my favorite conditioner for thin hair since the original Nioxin 2 scalp therapy formula (not the new trash that they&#x27;ve been putting in bottles for the last few years).</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth, my hair is definitely fuller with body and shine, like I used to have.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I after finally deciding to try something new  organic conditioner</li>
            <li> Instead, I use a small amount and comb it through my hair while I&#x27;m in the shower, then leave it on for as long as possible, and rinse with cool water right before I get out.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really works for my hair , which is dry and frizzy .</li>
            <li> My hair is very tangled and dry feeling after use.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner (and shampoo) is of quality and leaves my hair feeling thicker, less dry and easily managed.</li>
            <li> Last pretty long... three months.</li>
            <li> Not expensive when you finally see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I guess that is the tradeoff since this is the only product that really makes a big difference in the volume of my hair.  </li>
            <li> male, mid 30&#x27;s, use this conditioner along with the gold label shampoo, and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> A hairdresser fried my hair and after a few weeks of these products it has helped with the texture and dryness tremendously.</li>
            <li> The price is totally worth it because you only need a small amount of the product as opposed to using a large amount of another product.  </li>
            <li> , only need to use just a little bit of both the shampoo and conditioner and they lather pretty well using the palm of my hand without too much effort.</li>
            <li> had a major hair loss after divorce</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if I noticed any other improvements.</li>
            <li> I have major post pregnancy hair loss.</li>
            <li> No other conditioner touches my hair now.</li>
            <li> now I can barely see my scalp!</li>
            <li> I usually let my hair dry untied instead of trying to fight a brush through it (and take out more hairs!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like any other condition and it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural with no crazy chemicals that just mess up your hair!</li>
            <li> I have Thick but fine hair which is wavy and sometimes frizzy.  </li>
            <li> then with a large toothed&lt;br /&gt;shower comb, I carefully comb my hair.</li>
            <li> Pur d&#x27;or products are a little spendy but well worth.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, along with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo for over a year now &amp; have noticed less thinning on top &amp; MUCH less hair in the drain....</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s better than my previous shampoo as I notice even less shedding when washing my hair</li>
            <li> After seeing how incredible my hair looked and felt with the shampoo, I figured I would take a shot at the conditioner, expecting the same lousy results all the other conditioners left me with</li>
            <li> Because pretty much all my life I&#x27;ve had dull hair.</li>
            <li> So it is a reason to keep using Pura D&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner or at least products that are silicone free.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for delicate damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I do not have to use much conditioner to get this effect so it can last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not sure of is if the Shampoo and Conditioner products are  wheat and gluten free??</li>
            <li> I am a professional psychic medium, spiritual teacher, and speaker.</li>
            <li> I found myself having to use a ton of the product to make my hair actually feel soft.</li>
            <li> With the shampoo, I use about the same amount as I did with my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it, I added some of my old bumble and bumble conditioner with it, to see if that would help.  </li>
            <li> You can slather it on and it still barely moisturizes.</li>
            <li> And now that I&#x27;m old and bald, I doubt I will be starting any time soon.</li>
            <li> These products are not only for young people but also for seniors like me and my husband.</li>
            <li> , I only use a bristle boar soft brush.</li>
            <li> The ingredients look all natural but the scent of the conditioner is strongly reminiscent of Johnson&#x27;s baby oil.  </li>
            <li> Since there is no heavy buildup, my hair is back to</li>
            <li> The entire system does wonder for the look and feel of hair, makes hair look healthier, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s too early to say whether this is preventing any hair loss or not, but this definitely made my hair silkier and smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying natural remedies for hair growth for almost a month and recently I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old male I&#x27;ve been losing my hair on the front crown</li>
            <li> BARELY ANY OF THEM</li>
            <li> FYI, I have long, normal hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make matters worse, I thought if I sprayed on the leave-in conditioner (after using this conditioner), THEN I would be able to comb it without problems.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of scary to me.</li>
            <li> Mine came with a broken top on the bottle, but seems to do its job.</li>
            <li> It does not leave behind any residue, so my hair has more volume than when I used drug store conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair feel unbelievably silky from just one full pump.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many name brands before, but this one not only helps to keep your hair soft but also avoid unnecessary breakage during and after the hair wash.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of weird</li>
            <li> Not too thick so does not weigh my hair down and leaves it with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I also use the shampoo as well, the two goes hand in hand.&lt;br /&gt;Try not to use too much of the conditioner though as it will make your hair very oily, I use about one and a half pump for my long hair!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair spell like vanilla and feel amazingly smooth in the shower, however when my hair dried it was still dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair very soft even the next morning after having shampooed at night.</li>
            <li> The texture of my hair changed to very dry, limp and fine.  </li>
            <li> hair is long,  I&#x27;m looking for new growth - and see some.  </li>
            <li> As others had commented, the smell is strongly reminiscent of Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s baby line of lavender products (which was a bit disappointing, because I enjoy the smell of Argan oil), but it intensely conditions, and my hair is left soft without much heaviness or buildup.</li>
            <li> This conditioner feels very light weight and at first I was afraid I&#x27;d end up using massive amounts of it to get that slippery feeling on my hair.</li>
            <li> However, as I have to make up my grey hair by dyeing from time to time, and so far I can&#x27;t find a hair dye product pure organic and finishing the job in an efficient way ( I really don&#x27;t have time for those Indian hannah to take several hours to effect), I decided every other hair care product I use shall be as organic as possible, so as to reduce the chemical stimulus as much as possible, that&#x27;s why I switched to this brand.</li>
            <li> The first two days that I began using the conditioner it didn&#x27;t seem to condition my hair as much as my previous one did</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a color friendly conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave build-up residue on my scalp too.  </li>
            <li> (I have straight hair but at a certain length it starts to &amp;#34;flip out&amp;#34; and becomes hard to style).</li>
            <li> and I think I see tiny hairs starting to grow in especially around my high forehead area.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick, you don&#x27;t have to use them a lot, and it work well on my hair.besides, the two pack is offering a pretty decent deal.</li>
            <li> It helped out very well, because without the conditioner, the other shampoo dries your scalp out over time.</li>
            <li> This really is a must for people with extreme hair loss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use very much just every so little...</li>
            <li> I recommend trying it with the shampoo because if I use it after a different brand shampoo, I do not get the same fresh smell after washing my hair due the mixed scents.</li>
            <li> At least my hair feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is definitely organic, but as far as a shampoo goes, it does nothing for my hair than simply cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several months a like how the conditioner is not heavy and works well for daily use.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft &amp; silky &amp; my hair is no longer falling out by the handful &amp; is actually growing back in!</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times but it leaves my scalp feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products before and never experienced the same results.</li>
            <li> I use one pump, and I can&#x27;t believe how clean and thick it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out the scalp.</li>
            <li> This tended to be slightly out of my price range but decided to give it a shot anyway, having read all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more amazed that my bathroom floor is not full of little bits of my hair every time I comb!  </li>
            <li> but my body is also recovering from a very harsh medical treatment that I was on for 3 full months</li>
            <li> Initially, it seemed like my wet hair was too tangled to comb easily, but I started putting just a little conditioner back on my hair after I rinsed.  </li>
            <li> After only three uses, the shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel oily and heavy, NOT clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> One Winter I could have a normal scalp and the next Winter it could be dry, so it’s also skin with a temper</li>
            <li> One Winter I could have a normal scalp and the next Winter it could be dry, so it’s also skin with a temper</li>
            <li> smells very relaxing and isnt super thick like other conditioners</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel silky soft, but it does feel softer than it&#x27;s felt in a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried applying the aloe vera for the first few days, it help reduces the redness</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for the blizzard, I&#x27;ll follow up when I get a chance to go down by the Equator.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp that typically does not respond too well to conditioners, hair gels and any product you can conceivably apply to your hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care who you are, but once you use argan oil conditioner and shampoo, you will never go back to head and shoulder or that other crap product that you buy.&lt;br /&gt;The amount you get for the price you are getting it at is also an incredible deal!</li>
            <li> It makes my aging, dry hair soft without buildup.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I purchased this conditioner was because of dry hair and scalp that I have had for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned a lot over the past few years, and I noticed way too many hairs in the sink when I would brush it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down my already thin hair and leaves a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see it slow down the loss as well.</li>
            <li> Conversely, my hair does feel dry at times, although that could be due to a number of external factors (weather, shower water too hot, shampoo frequency, dehydration, etc.).</li>
            <li> Somehow with this product I tried to tame my frizzy, unhealthy and extremely want hair with tons of fly aways.</li>
            <li> No residue left behind and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> - my hair looks super dark and shiny after the oil but not weighed down, and</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very dry and not at all soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner should not be laeled conditioner because it thouroughly dried my hair out and left it a huge tangled mess when I was done.</li>
            <li> Expecting miracles with one Shampoo conditioner might be little too much as it is also dependent on the food diet.</li>
            <li> My hair is both fine and thin, and although I don&#x27;t think I am loosing hair, I needed something that would help enhance what I already had (and fill me out a bit, if possible).</li>
            <li> No other supplement has helped in the past, but this product seems promising.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Typically when the humidity is high in my area my hair takes a mind of</li>
            <li> I will keep using to finish the bottle, but do not think i will purchase again, going back to my other natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> It did not have enough slip for me to comb my thinning African American hair, but did make my hair soft while wet and added volume when dry.</li>
            <li> The feel is very natural, but not very smooth.</li>
            <li> Washes and lathers well unlike other natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> The amount has decreased significantly however.</li>
            <li> so I also use a little leave in conditioner in the ends of my hair because all of the conditioners that I have used that don&#x27;t have bad stuff in them tend to leave your hair a little drier but more healthy</li>
            <li> Used it several times, made it very flat</li>
            <li> Normally, shampoos tend to dry my hair out, which often causes dandruff for me (especially in dry, winter months).</li>
            <li> A side bonus, it works equally well on both long and short hair.  </li>
            <li> I have stuggled with thinning hair for the past 5 years or so since I reached a certain age.</li>
            <li> I have tried various conditioners in my past (I mainly used Nexxus Keraphix prior),</li>
            <li> My hair was pretty dull and now it is regaining its shine (after having two kids).</li>
            <li> You are left with soft locks that tend to need less leave-in oils/styling treatments when you get to the drying stage of your hair.</li>
            <li> so far I have already seen a big difference I have  less hair loss and my curls  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The person that answers the emails on their website is also pretty rude</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really helps hair grow</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used Argan oil in the past, you will know that this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> The blue caused severe irritation and didnt seem to arrest the symptoms as described on the Pura D&#x27;or website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I went with Pura d&#x27;or after some extensive research and now till this day, my hair is still looking long, and NO LONGER</li>
            <li> n flat</li>
            <li> like the product but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a difference</li>
            <li> Even though my hairdresser told me to not use conditioner on my har because it would make it flat, I found that not to be the case with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Like the shampoo I have not been using this product long enough to state that it regrows hair.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to fully review the product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it is simply not an option to go without conditioning.</li>
            <li> So far had a few uses and definitely like this product overall!  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves your hair feeling so soft, without feeling weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel laden down with product and my professionally bleached hair</li>
            <li> It gives my hair body and makes it soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This weighed my hair down and it didn&#x27;t leave it soft or manageable to comb thru.</li>
            <li> Due to my frequent visits to the hair salon and use of flat iron, my hair had become dry, damaged, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> this made my hair FLAT, made it very greasy looky, which made my color extra dull looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick hair that was hard to manage and style , but after using this product  my hair was glossy and a lot more tamable.</li>
            <li> No major signs of hair growth yet</li>
            <li> This has helped me have thicker hair, not super lush, but thicker for my hair type</li>
            <li> If not it would just be dry and brittle after only applying on time..</li>
            <li> Leaves hair vary soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> and I only brush it when it is dry</li>
            <li> my hairs are less frizzy after using it ....and leaves a shine , must use product no chemical harshness all natural as per ingridiants</li>
            <li> Lavender scent is reminiscent of my grandmother and does not condition well leaving my hair dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and less dry looking that it was prior to using it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers well however my hair feels dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> I could only stand to use this conditioner for a couple of months before my hair felt so gross, straw-like, and rough that I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst conditioners I&#x27;ve tryd, you need to use a quarter of the bottle to feel like it&#x27;s doing anything for ur hair, I am very suspicious about any good reviews for this or the shampoo, wich I&#x27;ve only used 4 xs but won&#x27;t continue bcz my hair is become so dry</li>
            <li> The outside temperature was in the single digits</li>
            <li> and I think it is necessary to use this conditioner with it because the shampoo alone will dry your hair a little and not leave it as soft.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling like dry straw!</li>
            <li> better then other products that are twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is the dominant smell,  I have essential Tea Tree oil-- various other products as well, and this smells synthetic.</li>
            <li> My hair not only looks fuller but it actually looks darker (less gray), which I did not think was possible.</li>
            <li> So I got hard core in to the &#x27;real food&#x27; diet and revved up my ayurvedic routine and supplement intake.    </li>
            <li> I will purchase this along with the accompanying shampoo for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I always cared about my shampoos but for the conditioners as long as they were organic</li>
            <li> I didnt even have to leave it in for long.</li>
            <li> As a woman, it&#x27;s unthinkable to lose one&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li> We should all be using natural products in preference to harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> Softens your long hair as desired.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve used in a long time on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and this conditioner keeps it moisturized, shiny and manageable</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> My hair fall has reduced but not completely stopped.</li>
            <li> Since using Pura d&#x27;or, my hair has dulled considerable dried out.  </li>
            <li> but the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair looks soft and thicker after few weeks.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of strange chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 2.5 inches long, if that helps.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, a complementary product may be needed for your ends.</li>
            <li> I used this a long with pura d&#x27;or shampoo and Biotin supplement.</li>
            <li> I have been using the pura d&#x27;or shampoo for a long time now and ordered the conditioner by mistake, thinking that it was the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tried calling the maker of the product and they never called me back the few times I called and left a message and because of these reasons I won&#x27;t  continue to use the product if I can&#x27;t get definite answers to my questions.</li>
            <li> Will wait to see long term results of this product.</li>
            <li> She has long hair and it tends to get tangled but that wasn&#x27;t the case when she used Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li> Still, this product is very expensive and although I did like it, I think I could find better equal results/</li>
            <li> Since I started using this shampoo and conditioner my hair is ridiculously thick again, even my boyfriend has commented on how much hair I seem to have now.</li>
            <li> I have used Mane n&#x27; Tail Gro Shampoo and Conditioner for quite some time first (which is much cheaper compared to what I usually buy!!!!)</li>
            <li> and I do not like that much the dispenser system which sometimes gets stuck and is not easy to press down, but</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little pricey compared to drugstore brands, but it will last a long time if you have short hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normal, a little drier than I would like from coloring and everyday wear and tear so trying to find products that actually work is always a chore.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that while the bottle is labeled to last for 3 months, I do not see that happening unless you are a male or have short hair.</li>
            <li> I usually keep it on for 5 minutes because I live in a really dry area of the country.</li>
            <li> Finally ran out of my other conditioner, and decided to try Pura d&#x27;or.  </li>
            <li> Went back to my other staple I use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s contributing to the hair loss because I&#x27;m simultaneously doing other things, but the hair loss has definitely slowed or stopped.  </li>
            <li> Not as well as other box-store generic shampoo</li>
            <li> So, I was literally fed up and about to cut my hair to an extremely shorter length, but decided to give ONE last conditioner a try before I did</li>
            <li> I bought the Pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo and conditioner and wash my hair with it every other day, sometimes every third day.</li>
            <li> A lot of other people say they like it, I think it smells gross.</li>
            <li> I have also incorporated a 5 in 1 reconstructor every other week for the next month or two since I relaxed my hair).  </li>
            <li> I have also incorporated a 5 in 1 reconstructor every other week for the next month or two since I relaxed my hair).  </li>
            <li> Due to medical reasons my hair began to fall out by the handful.  </li>
            <li> I do not feel different from the other brand I had before.</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews and purchasing this product I had a hard time coming to terms with the disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> Takes me 10 pumps of the conditioner to 1 pump shampoo to saturate my hair, but my hair is also very long &amp; damaged.</li>
            <li> and have noticed less hair loss, thicker hair, along with new hair growing in a previously bald spot.</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry and coarser than before I used the shampoo and conditioning.</li>
            <li> After you dry your hair</li>
            <li> It was stressed and dry</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it will fix my dry hair</li>
            <li> I air dry my hair</li>
            <li> I still have to use a leave in after so that my hair will not be as dry.</li>
            <li> it felt dry and lifeless</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend it unless your hair is too dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to those who are struggling with dry, damaged, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit dry than I thought</li>
            <li> I depend on it to help ensure my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> My hair even felt dry afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have curly dry frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> After used that shampoo, you can immediately feel that your hair is really dry,</li>
            <li> My hair is dry from processing.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry and matted.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and the conditioner made my hair so dry</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scent nor how dry it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> but the proof is in how my hair looks when its dry and styled... not</li>
            <li> so this began to worry &amp; depress me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this began to worry &amp; depress me.  </li>
            <li> I can never live  without these products after what I have seen happened to my hair .</li>
            <li> I do like the conditioner ( and shampoo) very much, however, the pump on the conditioner was broken</li>
            <li> The second time I used the product, my hair was noticeably oilier and not very clean.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner together every single time I shower.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has no, to limited scent, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> This conditioner feels a lot different from conventional ones.</li>
            <li> I am a young male with very thick but coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> like that fact that it is organic and it DOES NOT strip your hair of the natural oils like other harsh shampoos do...</li>
            <li> Big thumbs DOWN.</li>
            <li> you want shine / body / hair that is not weighed down by left in chemicals, this conditioner is for you.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and it smells like fragrant essential oils (and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering).</li>
            <li> and it definitely keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner along with the shampoo, I have noticed a big change in texture and fall-out appears to have slowed down dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I certainly hope this is not a case of a company changing the formula to save a few dollar as others have done in the past...</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so this is bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(I am also using extra dark Jamaican Black Castor Oil, shampooing and hair steam deep conditioning weekly.  </li>
            <li> (I am also using extra dark Jamaican Black Castor Oil, shampooing and hair steam deep conditioning weekly.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave the overly weighed down/super slick feeling on your hair (that can be good or bad based on what you like) and the smell is not knock-</li>
            <li> Notice the dry, frizzy ends in the before picture where I was sitting inside the car, yuck!</li>
            <li> I had alot of dry hair and friz!</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner, my hair is not as dry as before!</li>
            <li> If you are a typical male with this problem, I recommend you trying this conditioner along with the shampoo and see if it helps you the way it has helped me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Morrocco Method shampoos for about two months, shampooing much less (twice a week), have used the hair detox 3 times and am using the scalp massager daily and brushing with a Mason Pearson brush.  </li>
            <li> For 2-3 years I&#x27;ve started having problems with my hair - thinning, lots of hair falling out, and having trouble growing it long again after I last cut it to a bob length 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> My hair is still falling out in the shower in similar quantities as before, but each time I wash my hair with Pura d&#x27;or products my hair looks fuller, straighter, and less unruly when it dries.</li>
            <li> I initially noticed less hair falling off</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair fall after using this conditioner with Dandruff shampoo of same brand.</li>
            <li> , my hair has grown about an inch and a half - which is BIG for me!</li>
            <li> If I dont leave the conditioner in long enough in the shower, my hair becomes a little harder to brush</li>
            <li> and it left my hair a little dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> The Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Conditioner works as well as my regular commercially marketed brand when it comes to hair softness and manageability but without the harsh and other unknown chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The product does make my hair appear fuller but it makes it very dry.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, and I wished this conditioner helps to moisturize my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I would nor recommend this product for very dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My fine, thinning hair tangles into teeny little mats that are so difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> Only been a few weeks but no real positive hair changes</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that it&#x27;s a little pricey for me, as I tend to go through conditioner about 2 to 3 times faster than I go through shampoo, and so my bottle is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> I add my little essential oils concoction &amp; off</li>
            <li> I have LITTLE hair loss daily.</li>
            <li> Some work better than others, but nothing this bad.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using store brand conditioners because I always feel like there are unknown chemicals bad for my scalp, while I&#x27;m always sure that purador&#x27;s ingredients are organic and unharmful.</li>
            <li> Being a natural also taught me the importance of treating my hair as delicately as I would silk so my hair care practices are meticulous</li>
            <li> The scent of this conditioner is a bit stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Used this, comb just glides through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my lifelong conditioner now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully my hair loss will stop completely in next few weeks.</li>
            <li> It gives it volume and that shiny look without being wet.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> and you only need a few pumps depending on your hair length.</li>
            <li> Within one week after starting to use this shampoo and conditioner the heavy hair loss had stopped.  </li>
            <li> a pile of fluff.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried the baking soda and apple cider vinegar only routine, which I would never recommend to anyone because it completely dried out my scalp.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different &amp;#34;hair thickening/hair loss prevention&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Will have to try a bit harder to leave them on longer</li>
            <li> Not much hair losing anymore.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle a few days ago.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo I apply the conditioner for a few minutes as I have short hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We personally do recommend this product(with PURA d&#x27;or Organic conditioner) to every person suffering from dried stiffed up lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We personally do recommend this product(with PURA d&#x27;or Organic conditioner) to every person suffering from dried stiffed up lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is expensive but the results up till now are worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this with Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label) which has absolutely no scent to it.</li>
            <li> It did not take out my tangles as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the bottle I received a few days ago does not contain the same conditioner I am used to.</li>
            <li> I still notice that I am loosing hair, but I&#x27;ve only been using the shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Not very conditioning &amp; smells like baby powder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried to fix it.</li>
            <li> I really do not like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been depressed crying and in tears every time I washed my hair or brushed it.</li>
            <li> Likes the product as it makes my hair feel soft and feel thick.</li>
            <li> Actually my hair felt dried out after towel drying and was harder to brush; resulting in hair loss because of the tangles.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy it again however for those with thick coarse hair like myself</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which i like, will continue use to see its benefits in the long term</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because I&#x27;ve struggled with finding the right conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> To me, the only problem is that this production is really expensive than other productions of some common brands, but if it continue to be useful for my wife, I will buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> Even after glopping on several palm-fulls of this conditioner and leaving it on for ten minutes, I can still barely run my fingers through my hair without pulling out gratuitous amounts.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle to your hair, unlike other regular conditioner which has artificial ingridients.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about three months I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference...or really any difference...</li>
            <li> I have long, thick (strands, thinning overall) hair.</li>
            <li> The market is flooded with bringing back oils, which not too long ago was seen as a major no-no and especially for suffers of oily skin.</li>
            <li> The market is flooded with bringing back oils, which not too long ago was seen as a major no-no and especially for suffers of oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but my hair feels fuller and softer and looks shinier than it has for some time, without being weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit does NOT go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as other conditioners, but it still slightly weigh it down a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> I installed a high quality water filter in my shower to remove chemicals and other unnecessary additives.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that only a few strands of hair come out (much less than before).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss shampoos and conditioners, but these products are organic  </li>
            <li> My only gripe with the product is that the bottle is a bit small</li>
            <li> This conditioner is like none other.  </li>
            <li> I heard about this brand of shampoo and conditioner and read other peoples reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no shampoos!   </li>
            <li> I have tried other conditioners to make my &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Unlike other shampoos/conditioners, this doesn&#x27;t leave any buildup after long-term use.</li>
            <li> Tried this due to losing hair, and reviews said it helped.  </li>
            <li> I do not have this problem with other conditioners I have used.  </li>
            <li> I will suggest other to try this.</li>
            <li> Got the shampoo due to hair loss.</li>
            <li> In my attempt to ween myself off of shampoo and conditioner, which was causing massive build up and dandruff (even organic and expensive brands) I tried several different alternative hair care routines.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t contribute hair regrowth solely to pura d&#x27;or because I am doing several other things to help with my hair loss issue, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s everything or one thing that is helping.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands</li>
            <li> my bald spot is covered with tiny hairs, no more bald spot.</li>
            <li> Been using this product daily for the past four months in conjunction with Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo.</li>
            <li> that NEVER happens when I use other conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use any other products on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can wash my hair ever other day, except in extreme heat.</li>
            <li> As directed I used only a small amount</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it was enough.</li>
            <li> ...one other thing...</li>
            <li> It seems to have helped curb hair loss as well, as part of a wholistic approach with the shampoo and other products.</li>
            <li> This turned to be like any other comercial hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> this stuff will make you forgot all other conditioners.</li>
            <li> hair is extremely damaged (and relaxed every 3 months).</li>
            <li> A total waste of money for me!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how people gave the product such rave reviews</li>
            <li> You can turned it to &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; so no need to worried about leaking or other problems.</li>
            <li> I shifted from rogaine, due to allergic reaction to rogaine.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair softer and shinier than any other conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li> Maybe the company can add some essential oil which I did to get past the smell to use it.</li>
            <li> So I decided try to some Argan based but with other nutrients for the scalp etc.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and have thrown away all my other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> So if you find that for some reason or other a conditioner does not work, try using it as a leave in.</li>
            <li> Use only a small amount.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for the other results others have claimed.  </li>
            <li> Other products always emphasize how merriment they will be</li>
            <li> ; (by that I mean it says natural but has hidden chemicals) baking soda, Castile, shampoo bars</li>
            <li> I think it is a little bit dry for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Some reviews said no conditioner is needed but since shampoo leave hair a little dry the conditioner helps with this.</li>
            <li> expect feeling a little dry after using.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> i feel a little bit dry after using it, but it helps to control oil</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair feeling a little dry</li>
            <li> I used to get dry scalp after using their shampoo, but after using this conditioner I have no more dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair took very harsh beating from constant blow drying.</li>
            <li> I’ve got hairloss problem and I am very careful with the type of shampoo I used.</li>
            <li> It has actually dried my hair out even more than before and has given me bad dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is critical to me because I have an extremely sensitive sense of smell and I am unable to use some hair products since the smell lingers throughout the day</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo and conditioner set after going through various Whole Foods shampoos and conditioners that were expensive but missing a little something.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, heavy &amp; dry naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and it does not weight it down like other conditioner do .</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little pricey but a little product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have also tired other natural productions, but I felt the difference in my hair with this.</li>
            <li> I put a little in my wet hair and that&#x60;s</li>
            <li> I am a skeptic about hair loss treatments and it&#x27;s hard for me to admit that I actually think this conditioner/shampoo pair works.</li>
            <li> Although I love the Pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo, I was a little disappointed in the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair is much finer now</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I started experimenting with expensive branded products 1 year ago and nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li> but about 2 - 3 months after use (everyday showering), the amount of hair I lost was about the same, if not more, comparing to before I started using the system.</li>
            <li> I am a woman in my late twenty, starting to lose hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for about 2 weeks now and my hair loss is starting to slow.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo counterpart to this product, but I absolutely HATE the smell of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> in fact it was a thin cream that did not make my hair soft at all.</li>
            <li> Not only is it thick and luxurious</li>
            <li> it keep it feeling thicker and healthier and potentially halt or slow down the balding process?</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out so badly I had to have my hair cut super short to take the dead hair</li>
            <li> When I use conditioner, often it weighs it down</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, probably because there is no need to use a lot of product to get my hair well conditioned.</li>
            <li> My hair is still thinning but it has slowed down since using these products.</li>
            <li> My flyaways are now lying down and behaving.  </li>
            <li> It cleans &amp; moisturizes without feeling greasy or weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh hair down or leave it greasy.  </li>
            <li> It seems to compliment the Pur a dor shampoo well, but to be used sparingly otherwise it will weight hair down.  </li>
            <li> weighed down, also seems to improve the color vibrancy.  </li>
            <li> it did not feel weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WEIGH YOUR HAIR DOWN AND MOISTURIZES</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down or leave it oily looking.  </li>
            <li> It washes out without leaving my hair weighed down and looking like it needs another wash.</li>
            <li> no weigh down...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> Weighs hair down.</li>
            <li> Other than that, 4 stars!</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get used to unlike  other type of shampoo</li>
            <li> I purchased the system (shampoo, conditioner and revitalizer), very expensive at $116 and the entire system lasted me about 3 months for the main purpose of preventing hair loss / enducing hair growth.</li>
            <li> Heavy hair loss due to body stress from a hospital stay.  </li>
            <li> It creates long-lasting shine without the harsh chemicals that other manufacturers resort to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp like other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I appreciate how it is not filled with parabens, SLS, and other</li>
            <li> However I mix a few pumps of the Pura d&#x27;or Conditioner with my other conditioner and find that it works well.</li>
            <li> so I have gone thru half the bottle because of the length and thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> In addition, there is less scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> Any less</li>
            <li> I had started to notice every time I took a shower or combed my hair it seems like half the hair on my head was falling out.  </li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed less hair falling out and within two weeks it seem almost no hair was showing up in my drain or on my brush.  </li>
            <li> basically smells like bland</li>
            <li> I have noticed less fall out since using these products.  </li>
            <li> I have notice less fall out.</li>
            <li> I Had previously around 100-150 hair falls per day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo along with the conditioner for three weeks and have noticed less hair loss.</li>
            <li> and I find myself using less and less of it as days go on.</li>
            <li> and I oil/massage my scalp with Jamaicam black castor oil every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Less frizz.</li>
            <li> Hair sheds much less on this product, will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> were less than sanitary practices of a hair braider.  </li>
            <li> I resumed relaxing my hair two and a half weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I also started to see less hair fall out.</li>
            <li> I would imagine people with shorter hair would need much less.</li>
            <li> Less hair shedding too.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I&#x27;m losing less hair, my hair is shinier, and feels healthier.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s odd about this conditioner is the scent.  </li>
            <li> I think because less hair loss.</li>
            <li> even just used once, there was less hair loss.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that my hair is breaking less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product since December 2, 2014 and have noticed less hair loss.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I wash off the shampoo and conditioner in less than the recommended amount of time needed for the product to work asintended.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I noticed less hair fallout.  </li>
            <li> that less hair is ending up in my brush or on the shower floor.</li>
            <li> I have been use for a week and half now.</li>
            <li> is falling off much less</li>
            <li> I assume this contains much less chemicals, so less moisturizer agents.</li>
            <li> I found that I shed less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for about a week and a half now</li>
            <li> notice less hair loss in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, especially considering a leave-in conditioner is absolutely necessary afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see less hair in my shower drain as well as seeing a lot of baby hair along my hair line.  </li>
            <li> I have also seen less hair loss.</li>
            <li> There is Less hair in the sink in the morning.</li>
            <li> After using these products, there is so much less hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Filipino with colored, less than wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I also have less dandruff when I comb my hair.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> and I have noticed losing less hair while shampooing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LESS HAIR FALLOUT.</li>
            <li> I have found less hair loss and my hair is getting thicker.</li>
            <li> Before using it, my hair usually feels very dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt thicker, more natural and lighter (not weighed down by thick nasty product).  </li>
            <li> The other artificial conditioners tend to make my hair very oily.</li>
            <li> but now the product is not full anymore</li>
            <li> It leeked out of the bottle a bit during shipping,so the was a slite mess.</li>
            <li> and I had a bit of a mess since it leaked.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick frizzy damaged hair...</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that frizzes.</li>
            <li> It conditions well, not too heavy in weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> After losing a lot of my hair, I had to stop using conditioner because it was leaving my hair heavy, greasy, weighted down</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this after a friend suggested the product because I complained of how dry my hair had gotten.</li>
            <li> it can get somewhat dry after a shampoo, but it works at least for me it does...</li>
            <li> I can tell my hair is falling out less now and has already gotten stronger after a few weeks use.  </li>
            <li> The only small complaint I have is the smell.</li>
            <li> Seems to help a little but</li>
            <li> Other products are to harsh, not this!  </li>
            <li> conditioner smells a little stronge...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it to be a little smoother when you spread it and massage it in</li>
            <li> I see little difference in 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I feel like I want to use 2 pumps, but 2 might make my hair a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a little over a week ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I little staticky and tangled.</li>
            <li> and there is little signs anymore of lost hair strands on my work desktop.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my husband who has been using for little over a month coupled with the anti-hair loss conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every other day but ever since using Pura d&#x27;or products, I tend to have to wash my hair everyday now.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this has a very plain fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little heavy for my taste, but I will continue to use it in spite of that.</li>
            <li> felt a little harsh.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down like I thought it would!</li>
            <li> a condition that lets does not leave my hair felling weighted down or oily!</li>
            <li> and it helps with the fact that due to stress my hair has been thinning!!</li>
            <li> Only complaint that I would give is that it is hard to wash.</li>
            <li> hair is very curly in some parts, wavy in some others, all totally crazy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I leave both the shampoo and conditioner on as it says for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> I feel like I have wasted time and money.</li>
            <li> Bleh... Waste of money and time..</li>
            <li> Before using this product I noticed that every morning I would leave dead hair on my pillow.</li>
            <li> After just one week of using Pura d&#x27;or, I noticed that the dead hair on the pillow had stop.</li>
            <li> Waste of $20.  </li>
            <li> but since I can&#x27;t I&#x27;ll round up to 5.</li>
            <li> Between this and the shampoo I have actually noticed where my hair had gotten extremely thin</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp dried out and hair felt brittle.</li>
            <li> been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> am I missing something?</li>
            <li> No matter what conditioner I used in the shower, and how I dried my hair, I would always end up with a fluffy head,</li>
            <li> It thoroughly conditions my hair without leaving it feeling heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I will follow up in a few months to see if the hair growth worked as well.</li>
            <li> I need to pump a few times to get the liquid out.</li>
            <li> The benefit of using this organic product is that it&lt;br /&gt;does not contain any harsh chemicals and nourishes hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> and the fact that I am buying it again says a lot, since it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I think this is really not as important for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and feeling like there is residue on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner hydrates your hair and scalp without the harsh chemical SLS and without paraben preservatives.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times after I received it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money 1</li>
            <li> I am an everyday hair washer</li>
            <li> I have the shampoo and oil, wasted my money, cannot use</li>
            <li> I had trouble combing through my hair after I got out.</li>
            <li> My hair felt heavy but not too oily.</li>
            <li> Received within few days of order.  </li>
            <li> I will update in a few months.</li>
            <li> I waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I decided to switch to Silk 18 which costs about $12 for a 8 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> But, after a few uses it was undeniable.</li>
            <li> Used it for few days</li>
            <li> feeling dried out too.</li>
            <li> No residue left behind when I used it either.</li>
            <li> No change noted, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I think I am having less hair falling out!</li>
            <li> What I like, using both shampoo and conditioner together, they tame my frizzy hair as well.</li>
            <li> I have tired other products of purad&#x27;or and ordered this I was having extreme hair loss for years.</li>
            <li> I finally ended up at the the moroccan method and that helped a little bit, but ultimately I was not happy with the way it made my hair look and became skeptical of the &#x27;detox&#x27; period the company claims your hair has to go through.</li>
            <li> My hair has been noticeably thinning for the past few years, so I&#x27;ve been searching for a shampoo and conditioner to help stop hair loss.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because the product received very positive reviews</li>
            <li> and so I think it also helps to slow down hair loss.</li>
            <li> My hair is down to my waist, curly, and thick.</li>
            <li> and noticed that herbal shampoos help slow down my hair loss.</li>
            <li> For one it does not smell like lavender like previous bottles and the consistency of the conditioner is not as thick as before.</li>
            <li> All the scientific formula hair products did very little compared.</li>
            <li> the conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell as bad but doesn&#x27;t really help moisturizing the dryness the shampoo causes.</li>
            <li> I am using it for the past 1 month.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to take the color out of my hair (I use regular permanenet hair color) and the conditioner leaves my hair difficult to comb out.  </li>
            <li> No more harsh chemicals for me!  </li>
            <li> not sure if i&#x27;d buy again-</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d repurchase this,</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> There are small 1-inch hairs all over my head, some are two inches</li>
            <li> My hair loss issue started sometime over this past summer.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I like this product or not.</li>
            <li> I then resorted to going natural as I was then afraid to have any chemicals touch my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> shampoo/conditioner left my hair feeling sticky/dry and difficult to get a comb through after showering.  </li>
            <li> For those who are not sure whether to use this product or the Aveda Invanti 3-Step system, my pros and cons are provided below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using it in conjunction with the Purador shampoo as well as taking nutritional supplements, so it&#x27;s difficult to tie results to this specific product.</li>
            <li> No more too short bangs, no more wisps of hair sticking up making a weird side part.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps on hair loss</li>
            <li> The third and last time I used this product, my hair looked stringy and unhealthy as well as oily and dirty.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the premium hair loss shampoo in the gold bottle, and I&#x27;ve used them together two times in the past two days.</li>
            <li> I have used organic products in the past and they did not moisturize my hair like this conditioner does.  </li>
            <li> but im not sure if it works for hairloss</li>
            <li> and I know it could take at least a few months to tell if these products have worked.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I have seen regrowth,</li>
            <li> My hair is usually frizzy but with this conditioner it smooths and shines my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell, it smells like baby wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still losing hair as usual.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair though, it will be difficult to comb them, so you might not enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Rated a 3 because I&#x27;m not sure yet of the results..</li>
            <li> but not sure if it works with gray hair.</li>
            <li> Only one pro, it is a small bottle and expensive.</li>
            <li> Very few shampoos out there have the benefits that this one has.</li>
            <li> I do have very long hair that was once also very thick, but I had noticed it beginning to thin out a little.</li>
            <li> I did not use this product as I have other issues making hair thin.</li>
            <li> The only negative I think is that it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I just try and breathe softer if that makes any sense because if you take deep breaths and really inhale this scent it tastes terrible (even though you aren&#x27;t eating it)</li>
            <li> Not a very good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> THIS conditioner made a MESS of my hair!!  </li>
            <li> Very thick, so a little hard to spread a small amount evenly through your hair.</li>
            <li> Typically I have what they refer to as cat hair....dry and frizzy, but really thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to comb my hair after use, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not conditioning the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to comb my hair after use, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not conditioning the hair.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s hard for me to rate.</li>
            <li> and I think everyone should have to try at least once.</li>
            <li> The scent is not particularly nice- smells a bit like baby wipes.</li>
            <li> Well spite the fact it was late</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began doing a lot of research and found that this redness &amp; hair loss was probably the end result of a common shampoo ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
            <li> When I bought this combo shampoo/conditioner I was hoping it would at least not make my hair feel \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; after.</li>
            <li> complaint is the lack of de-tangling.  </li>
            <li> I began doing a lot of research and found that this redness &amp; hair loss was probably the end result of a common shampoo ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick and it does condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick too, which helps with saving money.</li>
            <li> but the recovery speed is slow, so i decided to give Pura D&#x27;or premium Organic anti-hair loss shampoo and conditioner for a shot.</li>
            <li> I have curly coily thick hair</li>
            <li> I did see my hair started to lose slowly</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, voluminous and shiny.</li>
            <li> when a thick conditioner is supposedly penetrating my hair follicles in the shower.</li>
            <li> (the absence of SLS and artificial</li>
            <li> I mean, 4-5 handfuls of hair per shower.</li>
            <li> it did not improve my hair, and it made my hair so squeeky clean, it was horrible to comb out...</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually a bit thin along my part in the front of my head.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair on my drain which is a plus!!!</li>
            <li> Sadly, this conditioner doesn&#x27;t work well for my chin length hair with a slight wave.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, don&#x27;t use the anti-hairloss shampoo without conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and/or conditioner caused a serious rash on my scalp and neck, verified by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Everything from the consistency of the conditioner (thin and watery) to the bland smell to how the shampoo failed to clean my hair was just terrible.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive for shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Two years ago I had a bad bought of seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp followed my an infection from what I can only presume</li>
            <li> So maybe not good for my type..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Pura D&#x27;or SHAMPOO + CONDITIONER for 2 weeks, I got this scary /bad sunburn on my scalp , few days later the sunburn I got this bad bald spot about a size of a quarter</li>
            <li> I bought the Argan oil as well, it&#x27;s not a good brand or product.</li>
            <li> but I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft, shiny, and it doesn&#x27;t snarl at the base of my neck.</li>
            <li> It smells fine, nothing shocking or disturbing that you&#x27;re massaging into your hair.</li>
            <li> I use to hold a mirror above my head and could see my scalp :(</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t detangle my hair and made it very hard to brush after the shower.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been very thick and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still falling out, growing very slowly, and was a bit unruly.</li>
            <li> Guy with very thick, curly hair here.</li>
            <li> I mean, even the bible says a woman&#x27;s hair is her glory !</li>
            <li> I was washing the life and lustre out of my hair and trying to replace them with chemicals which only accumulated on the hair shaft and made it worse!!!</li>
            <li> I started to use without the pump and realized that it made my hair thin and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting thin from another shampoo I was using.  </li>
            <li> and my scalp turned reddish and I have thin hairs.</li>
            <li> Getting poor results (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> Spreads and permeates poorly.  </li>
            <li> The amount of hair my family has been finding on the floor has decreased, so I&#x27;m going to infer that our collective hair loss has decreased.</li>
            <li> It was still in the protective wrap or else it would have been worse.  </li>
            <li> one came with a broken cap</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> That did not help but made the matters worse.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very subtle, but it smells a bit like &amp;#34;Play-doh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give up on my frizzy greasy limp ugly hair.</li>
            <li> AND I have noticed my hair filling in around my temples and hair line where before it just seemed thin and sad.</li>
            <li> it would just sprout and while it was growing, it was growing VERY slow!  </li>
            <li> I like the faint fragrance.</li>
            <li> way to expensive for what you get.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but works for me.  </li>
            <li> *** is expensive.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to find hair care products because of the add gluten.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> Lousy product.</li>
            <li> The benefit for you is that women will want to run their hands through your hair, and if I need to explain why this is a benefit, then I feel sorry for</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this is just not for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed with the product itself.  </li>
            <li> They are both expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about the claims, but make no mistake</li>
            <li> I had some male pattern baldness and was very frustrated!  </li>
            <li> unfortunately nothing seemed to work</li>
            <li> weird for a guy to say that</li>
            <li> Just google &amp;#34;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll come up with a lot of startling information on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unfortunately nothing seemed to work</li>
            <li> and so is rather useless.</li>
            <li> but I am really sad about this</li>
            <li> Just google &amp;#34;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll come up with a lot of startling information on it.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
            <li> and it simply looked awful.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> Terrible tangles so bad that it was a major struggle to comb my hair after my shower...</li>
            <li> but this stuff doesn&#x27;t have all the other nasty chemicals in it that they do.</li>
            <li> terrible watered down waxy like substance.</li>
            <li> the loss of my hair started to lessen and the it got thick again!!!</li>
            <li> It was incredibly depressing</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s way too much &#x27;artificial&#x27; out there</li>
            <li> I was afraid to become bald, because I already seen my scalp under my hair.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m crazy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% cold pressed.</li>
            <li> ; WRONG!</li>
            <li> No more drugstore products with all those terrible chemicals.</li>
            <li> What a sad state!</li>
            <li> This would make maintaining my hair very difficult.</li>
            <li> I use a very expensive organic hair color</li>
            <li> I opened to use it and the pump was defective and impossible to use.</li>
            <li> There is harmful composition inside,meanwhile the producer Purador&#x27;s customer service policy is bad.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in august after reading about all the bad chemicals in grocery store shampoos.</li>
            <li> but my doctor already has me on DHEA which causes acne so bad that I have to take it a week on and a week off</li>
            <li> (bad product).  </li>
            <li> It literally made me sick..</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I am disappointed to see that it has not helped at all my hair</li>
            <li> The scent was very artificial.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Problem is I&#x27;ve been using it after shampooing with this product line&#x27;s horrible horrible horrible Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label), which is incredibly harsh and drying on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I need to mention something else that I noticed within one week of using the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Shampoo; for about 5 months I had a terrible cowlick that was so bad</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair feels nourished after I use the Pura d&#x27;or Conditioner.  I love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Saw results after first shampoo. My hair is silky soft and fuller :)</li>
            <li> I like this hair conditioner, a lot! I use it with the Pura d&#x27;or Gold Label Argan Oil Shampoo. I have a medium thickness, very (very) straight hair that&#x27;s easily tangled and breaks. When I use conditioner, often it weighs it down and I won&#x27;t have any volume. But, this conditioner helps conditioned my hair better and avoid breakage when I brush my hair, I did see less breakage and tangling. The only downside of this conditioner is that as light as it is, it doesn&#x27;t help much with giving my hair some volume. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as other conditioners, but it still slightly weigh it down a tiny bit. I also use Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil on the ends of my hair to avoid breakage.</li>
            <li> I use Purador&#x27;s hair loss prevention shampoo, so I thought I&#x27;d try their conditioner as well and honestly I&#x27;m in love :) It smells nicer than the shampoo (shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like anything) and it keeps my hair soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t like using store brand conditioners because I always feel like there are unknown chemicals bad for my scalp, while I&#x27;m always sure that purador&#x27;s ingredients are organic and unharmful. It works like any good conditioner too :D</li>
            <li> I am a 59-year-old male and my hair is very important to me. I inherited a full head of beautiful wavy hair, that is now a unique white in front and salt and per throughout the rest. I do take the time to style and coif my hair to perfection, and receive countless accolades on its beauty. I am a professional psychic medium, spiritual teacher, and speaker. Not only am I in front of the public eye throughout the year, I am also on television doing guest spots. So, needless to say, my hair is important to me!  I accept aging very well and believe I am doing a good job at it. HOWEVER, the hair has been leaving! I have tried numerous remedies, pills, and shampoos without any satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and the shampoo that goes with it-PURA D’OR PREMIUM ORGANIC ANTI-HAIR LOSS SHAMPOO (GOLD LABEL), 16 FLUID OUNCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the shampoo really clarifies and then this conditioner makes my hair feel soft, shinny and manageable. And second, it is NOT falling out in my shower towel or on my brush every day! I know the product does not claim to grow hair, I really believe with my attitude and by stopping it from falling out, the reverse process is bound to happen. So I KNOW this product is going to stimulate some hair growth on my head and keep it looking good until I say it&#x27;s time for me to leave! This will be the last shampoo and conditioner you will ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cost, I believe is it better than the rest. Unless you plan on getting some eye disease or cancer continuing to use cheap hair products like Pert or the rest of them, you need to spend for for something worthwhile. AND DO NOT BE SUCKERED INTO WEN!!!!!  I used that too and after I read the ingredients, I asked my doctor for a volunteer radiation treatment to kill all the cancer cells I created by using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE read the ingredients people and CARE about what you are using. I was a Hospice Social Worker for 6 years and seen some of the most horrible cancers anddeaths, and I am telling you right now, they majority were caused UNNECESSARILY from the chemicals we allow businesses to put into our magnificent bodies. Here is a product, finally, you will not here can cause or add to any cancers or diseases. That&#x27;s why I am reviewing both the shampoo and thew conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a product that not only works, it&#x27;s is NOT going to kill me using it, and it is so natural and made from mostly vegetables, that you almost can drink it! Don&#x27;t though because you may grow hair on your tongue! And look for me on TV. I&#x27;m the one with the beautiful head of shinny grey hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for about 2 weeks now and I have to say that I can see a nice improvement in volume, texture, and manageability of my hair. I have tried various conditioners in my past (I mainly used Nexxus Keraphix prior), however I can confidently say that this is a much better product. Not only does it leave my hair feeling softer, it looks visible healthier. The price is high but you get what you paid for. My only complaint would be that while the bottle is labeled to last for 3 months, I do not see that happening unless you are a male or have short hair. Not a problem for me as a male but ladies be warned.</li>
            <li> I am so glad with the hair loss shampoo. I used it for 3 weeks and I got good results.</li>
            <li> I did not like it at first because it didn&#x27;t give enough fumes. However, after using it for a couple of months, I started notice that I have more hair. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner after using the pura d&#x27;or premium organic shampoo, this product is excellent as well, there is less hair in my shower drain and my hair never felt cleaner or healthier. I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss shampoos and conditioners, but these products are organic  (the absence of SLS and artificial additives)- and that is what makes the difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried many conditioners and this one feels very satisfying it makes my hair feel very soft and manageable, i have yet to use it more. But i would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good. I like the faint fragrance. Hopefully, it can help to prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li> Great product- liked shine and good for my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading many reviews and like what I am seeing so far.  I have been using this shampoo for about a month and my hair loss has slowed by one third in my assessment.  I have been using French shampoo called Rene Furterer Forticea prior and the result is far better with Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. I would definitely recommend those who experience similar hair loss issue.</li>
            <li> I usually do not use Conditioner, but if it was going to help me grow hair well here I go.  I do think it is helping.  I leave both the shampoo and conditioner on as it says for a few minutes.  Lo and behold I do see more hairs coming in - I guess to make up for the ones that left!  I will keep using for 6 months and write another review.  I have tried many shampoos,  so hope this combo will be the trick!  Only prp therapy offers more new hair!  and THIS is cheaper!  Nice smell,  not allergic.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long,  I&#x27;m looking for new growth - and see some.  I also use my own Hair skin and nails product,  eat fairly well, eat lots of protein, hair is made from I think, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Have not found another I like as well - so try it ,  you&#x27;ll like it!  :-)</li>
            <li> wow-you can tell a difference right away..</li>
            <li> Really nice smelling shampoo. Have only used a few times but it leaves my scalp feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well in my hair. It leaves my hair very soft, clean and with a nice aroma. I can&#x27;t wait to run out of my regular shampoo so I can order the organic argan oil shampoo too. I&#x27;m glad I found these Pura d&#x27;or products</li>
            <li> Nice product. A little pricey, but worth it to know that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the harsh chemicals in it like many store bought conditioners.</li>
            <li> smells great and feels great for my head and hair.Seems like it controlled my loosing hair</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt softer.  I really enjoy using the shampoo and this conditioner afterwards. I let it each set pn my hair for 2-3 minutes as instructed.  I can tell my hair is falling out less now and has already gotten stronger after a few weeks use.  I plan to keep using these products and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> The first two days that I began using the conditioner it didn&#x27;t seem to condition my hair as much as my previous one did but after a whole week my hair seemed to get adapted to it and it actually began to make my hair really soft and smooth! I still apply leave in hair conditioner but overall I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Tried this product.  I loved it, my hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft in years.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best! It not only helps thicken your hair, but it also hydrates and provides shine. I also recommend using the conditioner with the pura d&#x27;or argan oil hair-loss prevention shampoo for much better results.</li>
            <li> Seems to help a little but guess there is nothing that will really grown hair back</li>
            <li> The scent of this conditioner is light and very nice.  It does give my hair a great shine.  You do need to read and follow the directions. You need to leave it on your hair for a minute or so in the shower so that it has time to soak into the hair. I like this conditioner, though it does condition the hair, I just wish that it made my hair feel softer.  Some conditioners I have used seem to make my hair softer to the touch when I am rinsing it out of my hair. Had I felt that I would give this conditioner 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky, smooth and manageable, really all I need and it smells ABSOLUTELY amazing!!!</li>
            <li> The Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Argan Oil conditioner is a perfect compliment to the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.  The shampoo can make your hair feel like it does when you come out of the ocean.  It&#x27;s all tangled and feels a bit dry almost like you&#x27;ll never get it untangled and smooth again!  Once the conditioner is applied and I massage it in, my hair begins to untangle and feel remoisturized.  The conditioner has a very soothing scent and I like that my hair smells great when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I have ever used - does not make my fine hair greasy and it feels noticeably thicker! I am so happy I&#x27;ve find a natural product that is helping me. Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner it leaves my hair well conditioned, feeling thicker, and manageable.  A little goes a long way.  Just received my second bottle.  Very happy I found this product, I would and have recommended it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after a friend suggested the product because I complained of how dry my hair had gotten. After my first use I immediately noticed a difference. My hair felt smoother and I had more shine. I have been using it for over a week now and my hair feels amazing. My only gripe with the product is that the bottle is a bit small so I have gone thru half the bottle because of the length and thickness of my hair. I am trying to use more to get the most out of this bottle, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> way to expensive for what you get.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to help my hair.  I will not purchase again</li>
            <li> This is definitely organic, but as far as a shampoo goes, it does nothing for my hair than simply cleaning it. I have not noticed a difference in breakage, oiliness or dryness. It doesn&#x27;t help dandruff or flaky scalps. This is coming from a multi person house hold. It is however carcinogenic free and smells nice. If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re looking for then this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product makes my hair and scalp feel.  Other products have left my scalp itching; this soothes my scalp and makes the hair soft and it also smells great.  Only a dime-size is all you need. It works that well -- better then other products that are twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Pura d’or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo for about a year along with the  Pura d’or: Premium Organic Conditioner (16 fl. oz.), and have noticed less hair loss, thicker hair, along with new hair growing in a previously bald spot. In addition, there is less scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> Very good! Conditions my hair perfectly. Only complaint that I would give is that it is hard to wash.</li>
            <li> I have blonde color treated hair and was looking for a more natural product that actually made my hair look and feel good. This conditioner was fantastic! I have sensitive skin and prone to eczema and this has helped with that too. It also smells amazing. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or greasy and I&#x27;m able to wash every other day or every three days and my hair still looks, feels, and smells wonderful. Great product!</li>
            <li> The product is very smooth. Makes my hair feel very soft. I have tried many products before and never experienced the same results. Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this with the Pura d’or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo. I have the bottom of my hair bleached so that I do need conditioner to moisturize. But this one doesn&#x27;t really work for that even I used big amount of it. I don&#x27;t see any big progress of preventing losing hair.&lt;br /&gt;However after read others reviews, I decided to give it another chance. I will continue using it to see.</li>
            <li> I finished a bottle of this shampoo but did not help me at all. I had and still have hair loss problem and decided to give this a shot as the reviews seemed to be promising. But really did not help.</li>
            <li> I have been looking to replace my favorite conditioner (Pureology) and I am so glad I found this one. It is made of natural, organic ingredients (a rarity!), it smells amazing, and most importantly my hair looks and feels great! I have a wavy, frizzy hair and this conditioner helps it look smooth without damaging my hair color, as it does not have any harsh sulfates. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like the organic/natural ingriedents and it definitely helps in maintaining a moist scalp.  I will purchase this along with the accompanying shampoo for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> This product is better than expected. The smell and texture will leave your hair feeling excellent. It provides an effect to make the hair look more fuller. I highly doubt it will grow back hair but it is one of the best organic products in the market. Make sure you purchase the shampoo as a companion and you should see results rather quickly.</li>
            <li> good conditioner makes my hair smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good! Always, I lose my hair. But this conditioner helps me a lot! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Upon first impression, this conditioner smelled amazing, so I was hopeful that it would work as good as it smelled. Not only did it work, it worked better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used to date. I have the smooth silky softness that I&#x27;ve always wanted-- without the worry of damaging my hair or my body with chemicals. The smell is really quite the cherry on top of this wonderful product. I use it in combination with the shampoo</li>
            <li> **Also posted under shampoo review**&lt;br /&gt;Wow, wow, wow!!  I can&#x27;t believe I finally found another great shampoo and conditioner for my very fine, thin hair after trying forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a major hair loss after divorce, I&#x27;m post-menopausal, etc. etc. I started buying wigs and felt like my life as a pretty woman was over. My hair seemed damaged, flat and dead, nothing helped make it look full and feel great.  BUT two wonderful things happened to change that. First, I bought this shampoo, conditioner, and oil. I noticed an immediate difference in my hair texture the first day. It felt really soft and full again (my son used to say &amp;#34;Your hair feels like spider webs&amp;#34; as a toddler, it was a compliment! lol), and it looked shinier, not dead and lifeless from being colored hair.  Notice the dry, frizzy ends in the before picture where I was sitting inside the car, yuck! Second, my sister (a stylist) colored my hair using high contrast blond and brown, and voila, somehow my hair looks like it did years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pics aren&#x27;t the greatest (I&#x27;m tired tonight), but I hope you can see a difference in hair quality. They were taken a couple of weeks apart.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is like none other.  It helps remove snarls from washing without leaving a waxy buildup on your hair.  It&#x27;s also great to use after you use hair color products.  Has a great smell that doesn&#x27;t linger forever.  I think because it contains a lot of natural oils.  Takes the static out of your hair in the winter months.  It&#x27;s a great body builder for limp fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product just smells like it works... I approve. Waiting for my hair to stop falling out. Worth a shot for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves hair feeling so nice.</li>
            <li> I saw some really good reviews about this product and decided to give it a try. I use it with their shampoo. The scent of this conditioner is a bit stronger than I expected. But I have to say it really makes my hair less fuzzy more shiny. I hope it will  help solve my shredding problem too.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need the conditioner to have results from the shampoo. I am not a fan of this product. It leaves my hair flat and smells strongly like baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> It goes well with the shampoo with nice smell, like it so far after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for about 2 weeks now and my hair loss is starting to slow. Whereas before, I had quarter size loss, now it&#x27;s about a dime.  I am pleased with how well this product is working so far.  No other supplement has helped in the past, but this product seems promising.  I&#x27;ll have to follow it up with an update in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but my hair feels fuller and softer and looks shinier than it has for some time, without being weighed down at all. 5/5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because I use the same brand shampoo, and it is organic and smells good. The conditioner is thick, you don&#x27;t have to use them a lot, and it work well on my hair.besides, the two pack is offering a pretty decent deal.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this conditioner and shampoo, I used to have to blow dry my hair before to look good, but now I just let it dry naturally. My hair stays in good shape of curls, not as messy as before. The trick is you need to let the conditioner sit for two minutes before rinsing (as the instruction says).</li>
            <li> Way better than the crappy cheap conditioner I was using before. I put a little in my wet hair and that&#x60;s all I ever need!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to move to clean eating and cleaner health and beauty care products.  Pura d&#x27;or was highly recommended to me by others who have been really happy with the products and results.  While I haven&#x27;t been using them for a long time yet, I am very pleased with the results so far.  The products have a nice scent.  They leave my hair feeling clean and healthy, and I am seeing some new hair growth and volume.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and makes my hair very soft. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so costly...</li>
            <li> Love this!  Leaves my hair soft and full - not weighed down at all!</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve had so far. I have very picky hair but this conditioner works well. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, probably because there is no need to use a lot of product to get my hair well conditioned. Also the lavender scent is my favorite choice for all bath products and vanilla adds a very nice note, but not overpowering. I will continue to use it for sure.</li>
            <li> My conditioner expectations are pretty straightforward:  I just want a conditioner that detangles, doesn&#x27;t leave you hair residuey-feeling, and smells nice.  This conditioner achieved all of these things.  It has sort of a more sophisticated &amp;#34;baby-fresh&amp;#34; scent in my opinion, but it&#x27;s not bad and it is pleasant.  The natural ingredients are also a plus.  My only qualm is that it&#x27;s a little pricey for me, as I tend to go through conditioner about 2 to 3 times faster than I go through shampoo, and so my bottle is almost gone.  I might try to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> Hair is growing back and also grey is turning back to original brown color.</li>
            <li> I love it, hope they will make it in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and works ok, I just don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive. Don&#x27;t see this being any more effective than $5 conditioner. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> smelled great but left hair dull.</li>
            <li> Love the vanilla lavander smell!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a really great smell but made me hair oilier than it is naturally.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner after reading all the great reviews. I wanted a natural product with Argan oil. I found myself having to use a ton of the product to make my hair actually feel soft. Even with the large amount of conditioner I used, I still don&#x27;t feel like my hair was conditioned. Next time I will be trying something else. I guess if you are looking for a super lightweight conditioner - this is for you. Didn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp that typically does not respond too well to conditioners, hair gels and any product you can conceivably apply to your hair after washing it.  I also have hair loss concerns.  I wanted to use some sort of conditioner that can provide some sort of manageability while strengthening the hair.  This product seems to check all the boxes for me:  my hair is more manageable, I do not notice any hair loss from breakage, and my scalp is not at all irritated.  Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried, at first, about the scent based on some of the other reviews. I really don&#x27;t mind it, though. You can detect the vanilla and herb smell to it. I use it in combination with the shampoo (which I really like) and I am happy with how my hair comes out smelling afterwards.It is also nice and shiny and feels very clean (no residue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I do not give this a full five stars, though, is because I find it to be pretty weak. A little bit does NOT go a long way. I know that it is made a little bit differently from regular conditioners, with better and more natural ingredients, but I really need to use a lot to get my hair actually conditioned. I leave it in for a minimum of 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For background, I am 30 and my hair is un-colored, fine, and wavy. With the shampoo, I use about the same amount as I did with my old shampoo. With the conditioner I have to use probably 50% more than with the old conditioners. Any less and my hair gets too fuzzy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering how much of the product I have to use per condition, I might try something else out to see if I can get a better bang for my buck. I am just going through it way too quickly and it isn&#x27;t cheap. I will, however, be sticking with the shampoo for sure!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. My hair has been growing more since i have been using it for only two weeks!!!! I was freaking out because my hair was falling out and I think I am having less hair falling out!</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this conditioner, it smells great even hours after taking a shower. The hair feels silky smooth, hydrated and so easy to style. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I expected more for the price. Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be improving in volume and texture. I don&#x27;t like the smell either.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, just used it today and my hair was much more manageable with my hair product</li>
            <li> Softest hair ever after using it. Totally recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my hair has been thinning more and more every year. I heard about this brand of shampoo and conditioner and read other peoples reviews and decided to give it a try. That was 3 bottles ago. And a bottle lasts about 1-2 months depending how much you want to use. My hair is still thinning but it has slowed down since using these products. If you research the ingredients they use you will see all of them are good for preventing or slowing down hair loss. If you are a typical male with this problem, I recommend you trying this conditioner along with the shampoo and see if it helps you the way it has helped me.</li>
            <li> I had started to notice every time I took a shower or combed my hair it seems like half the hair on my head was falling out.  I became very concerned and decided to try Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Organic Argan oil shampoo and conditioner.  I have to say I am amazed.  Within a week I noticed less hair falling out and within two weeks it seem almost no hair was showing up in my drain or on my brush.  I highly recommend this Conditioner, try it with the Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Organic Argan oil shampoo, you will love it!!</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchase this product. This time I bought the shampoo and conditioner. Now my boy friend and I are both using Pura  d&#x27;or product. We both love it. It work really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks, it&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve used.  Leaves my hair super soft and luxurious and my curls looks and feel great!  I will definitely continue using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am trying this conditioner with same brand shampoo, looks like it is very good, hair is not dry</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not only good but my wife said it smell so nice too,  it doesn&#x27;t harm your hair and helps in making it soft.  We also highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> natural creamy lavender smell, makes me happy knowing how sweet my hair smells, love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good, we&#x27;ll see in another month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had beautiful hair and was complimented on it, often!  Not so much, anymore.  Unfortunately, my hair is much finer now and I&#x27;m experiencing overall hair loss, I&#x27;m 59.  I&#x27;ve been taking measures to try and mitigate the problem i.e. Hairmaxx and vitamin supplements.  After reading the reviews on the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner, I decided to give it a try, as well.  While I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth, my hair is definitely fuller with body and shine, like I used to have.  Yeah!!  I would recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone .. even if you don&#x27;t have hair loss issues.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fantastic!  I have thinning hair, and so have been using Pura d&#x27;Or shampoo for a while.  Finally ran out of my other conditioner, and decided to try Pura d&#x27;or.  My fine, thinning hair tangles into teeny little mats that are so difficult to remove.  Used this, comb just glides through my wet hair.  When dry, it feels fuller, smooth and soft.  My flyaways are now lying down and behaving.  I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and plan to keep on keepin&#x27; on with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner, along with the Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo for months now.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it; I love the smell of the shampoo (tea tree oil smell), but am not crazy about the smell of the conditioner (I&#x27;m used to it now, though...basically smells like bland cream.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest pro of this conditioner (and the reason why I&#x27;m still using it) is that it complements the shampoo...both contain anti-har-loss extracts, and with using the both of them PLUS taking biotin, I&#x27;ve noticed new hairs emerge!!  Woohoo!!!  Also, this conditioner does leave my hair with a volumous, clean-hair look.  A con of the conditioner, however, is that it doesn&#x27;t take away tangles in my hair for some reason, so I usually let my hair dry untied instead of trying to fight a brush through it (and take out more hairs!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would keep using this conditioner for the positive effects it has, but it may not be for everyone...I would recommend buying a bottle and seeing if you like it, especially if you are already using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before..it lasts a long time and does a great job.  It came quickly and was packaged well.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> unlike the shampoo, I feel that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t actually do much. It seems like any other condition and it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s effective. Like the shampoo, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to decide if it&#x27;s effective but will update this review once I have used it more and compare it to the other preventive hair loss productive I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon</li>
            <li> Expensive but works for me.  I make my own &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; type shampoo out of it and have gone through numerous bottles.  I refuse to pay the price for the real &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; anymore.  I add my little essential oils concoction &amp; off I go.  Have been using only pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Argan Oil exclusively for 2yrs. on my hair.  Absolutely no shampoos!   I have tried other conditioners to make my &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; shampoo but have not been satisfied.  Only pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic.</li>
            <li> It needs something to make it more detangle when you rince it out.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the product it has good mild aroma as expected.</li>
            <li> Product was not compatible for me however I am sure based on the reviews its a quality product. The seller was professional and promptly refunded my account☺</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.Leaves my hair soft and  silky!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for me.I love it</li>
            <li> This conditioner absorbs quickly and leaves no residue after rising. My hair is shinier! It does not, however, help with moisture or softness. Although my hair and scalp feel cleaner after using the shampoo and conditioning, the conditioning does not help provide moisture and softness to my hair. My hair feels dry and coarser than before I used the shampoo and conditioning. Overall, I am okay with the product. I&#x27;ll give it a little more time to see if I noticed any other improvements.</li>
            <li> I have used this along with the shampoo for about eight months.  I like it a lot and the fact that it i organic.  I have noticed less fall out since using these products.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Really love it,</li>
            <li> This conditioner should not be laeled conditioner because it thouroughly dried my hair out and left it a huge tangled mess when I was done. Absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying this product. It leaves my hair soft and smooth. Like the fact that its organic and without the harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> my hair is the most important thing in my life and this stuff is awesome.  i&#x27;ve already told several friends about it.  i got the shampoo, too.  love it!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would fall in love with a conditioner but this one is the real deal. I always cared about my shampoos but for the conditioners as long as they were organic I didn&#x27;t care about their brand cause I thought they are all the same. I have to admit this one is just amazing. I never put conditioner on my roots cause that made my hair fall but with this one I don&#x27;t have that problem. I can put it all over my hair from roots to the end and not worry a slightest. It smells wonderful and it conditions my hair without making it sticky. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner...I have very fine hair, and this leaves it very soft but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This conditioner applies on very smooth and helps keep my permed curls bouncy. I really am in love with the Purador line of hair products!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I feel like I have wasted time and money.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really works for my hair , which is dry and frizzy . Having used it for the first time , I can immediately feel its  magic power , because my hair stops coming off like before and it is shiny and easily combed .so definitely I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week, and can tell a difference in my hair.  It is more manageable and seems to be in better condition.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product a week ago, I can tell you, I love the vanilla/lavender scent. It conditions well, not too heavy in weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells like baby oil but when paired with the shampoo and post-rinse, your hair feels and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a very hydrating conditioner.  After the final rinse you can still feel that your hair has absorbed the oils from the conditioner.  After you dry your hair it then feels light and full, so it actually is a treat to style and work with.  The feeling will also last throughout the day, it does not stop until you once again shampoo or truly sweat it out.  A side bonus, it works equally well on both long and short hair.  Thank you.  Dan</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel like straw and tangled up.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling like dry straw!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It cleans &amp; moisturizes without feeling greasy or weighing my hair down. Unlike other shampoos/conditioners, this doesn&#x27;t leave any buildup after long-term use.</li>
            <li> Great organic conditioner with amazing fragrance</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic conditioner! I use it with the hair loss and thinning shampoo and my hair has never looked better. Even my hair dresser commented on how healthy and soft my hair felt, and this is just after about a month&#x27;s use. Typically I have what they refer to as cat hair....dry and frizzy, but really thin. This has helped me have thicker hair, not super lush, but thicker for my hair type and it has also helped my hair grow. Love it! Will be ordering again when needed!</li>
            <li> I have done research on this product before purchasing, I am post menopause and have had some hair loss. Other products are to harsh, not this!  The product feels like a spa for your hair, you feel good about using it!  Love the slight fragrance, will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I use this with the shampoo and as directed...leaving it on hair for 2 to 5 minutes and I couldn&#x27;t be more amazed that my bathroom floor is not full of little bits of my hair every time I comb!  Praise God!!  I don&#x27;t know about regrowth yet but that is a goooood start!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not all that impressed with this conditioner, as much as I am with the shampoo. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m use to running my hands through my hair to untangle while in shower, and this doesn&#x27;t have quite the follicle softening I&#x27;m use to.</li>
            <li> Use it after their shampoo and it works great. I don&#x27;t have thinning hair but the lack of SLS and parabins leaves a completely different, yet pleasant, after effects.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good...keeps hairline strong!</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells okay, it reminds me a bit of dog shampoo. This make my hair super soft and nice. I&#x27;ve tried conditioners and this is hands down the best. The other artificial conditioners tend to make my hair very oily. This would make maintaining my hair very difficult. This is perfect. I would use it on my dog but this s*** is expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s truly organic. I also bought the tranquility shampoo and love them both. My hair and scalp feel great.</li>
            <li> It is sooo  perfect It conditions without weighing my fine &amp; thinning hair. I&#x27;m hoping your shampoo will help that problem ! But this conditioner  smells great great and feels good!</li>
            <li> works great with Pura d&#x27;or shampoo...</li>
            <li> nothing elaborate for description, just a great product. Pleased with the look, feel and health of my hair</li>
            <li> Smells nice but is not moisturizing to my hair at all.  When I put it on, it feels like I&#x27;m rubbing hand lotion on my hair and when I rinse it out, my hair does not have that conditioned feel.</li>
            <li> I have major post pregnancy hair loss. Lots and lots of hair would fall off when I wash my hair. After using this product. I have notice less fall out. Must note: I have also started taking biotin and prenatal vitamins.</li>
            <li> I am using it for the past 1 month. It creates dandruff. I do not have it before using it. I dont suggest this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was interested in an Organic non-paraben conditioner because my hair seemed to be falling out in handfuls every day... It was stressed and dry and I needed a change.  I love this conditioner! I am on my second bottle.  My hair is soft, shiny and much happier!  I&#x27;m using the hair loss shampoo from Pura d&#x27;or as well and the combo is exactly what I needed! (oh, and the scent is great! not overpowering but there.)</li>
            <li> Please see my review for this product under: Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevenion Premium Organic Shampoo  I reviewed them together because I used them together.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair smooth and easier to comb, but the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite, in fact, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I smelled it in the store... it does not smell like lavender vanilla - more like baby wipes or baby lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now and I must say, it not only leaves my hair clean and soft, but it has slowed down the volume of hair I was losing with each shampoo and simple light brushing.  I do also take one daily Biotin (10,000 mcg) vitamin supplement.  I am so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this conditioner and she absolutely loves it. She says it smells nice and leaves her hair feeling really clean. She loves it and will continue to be a fan of it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I noticed some pretty severe shedding and breakage earlier in the year.  Ordered this product and every time I see my hair stylist she comments how much better my hair is getting.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this conditioner. It does the job well and has the best ingredients that are good for you.</li>
            <li> Tried this due to losing hair, and reviews said it helped.  Still lost some hair the first shampoo, but by the second one I didn&#x27;t notice any loss which I found amazing.  Definitely gave a nice feel to my damaged hair after use. The only negative I think is that it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmmm smells so good! And my hair is SO soft! I love this product!</li>
            <li> Lightly scented lavender conditioner.  Does not weigh hair down or leave it greasy.  My hair stays smooth all day.  Really like how the conditioner smooths the texture of my hair.  Will be purchasing again.  That says a lot.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair very soft even the next morning after having shampooed at night.</li>
            <li> There are so many things I love about this conditioner.  It is lightweight, but still leaves the hair soft, silky and shiny.  The lavendar scent smells lovely and wards off insects (including lice!). It has all natural and organic ingredients, and is free of parabens, sulfates, and harsh, toxic petroleum based chemicals.  It&#x27;s hard to find a color friendly conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave build-up residue on my scalp too.  This is my lifelong conditioner now.  I combine it with the pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo that I have been using now for 3 months, and I can see hair re-growth and thickening!  Love, love, love, your products!!!</li>
            <li> Big thumbs DOWN. I question the authenticity of the ingredients. Smells a bit synthetic. A little too pure or clear looking for having so many herbal ingredients. Tea tree oil is the dominant smell,  I have essential Tea Tree oil-- various other products as well, and this smells synthetic. Would not buy again. Don&#x27;t trust all these raving reviews, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re paid, nothing special about this product, nothing to rant and rave about. Drys out hair. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this conditioner although many reviews for the shampoo said to only buy the shampoo. I am so glad  I tried it. I love it, it is a lightweight conditioner with the most beautiful scent. My Husband said he loves the way my hair smells. It leaves my hair super soft and silky! I will be buying it more. Thankyou Pura D&#x27;or. ,please never change that wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner because I wanted to change conditioners and because I read all the reviews and said &amp;#34; hey, why not..&amp;#34; WRONG! First off it smelled hideous. It literally made me sick.. It&#x27;s soo strong. Secondly this product is not intended or good for dry damaged hair. I finished this product in 3 weeks!! Because I literally had to take out the cap and pour sooo much just to make my hair soft! If not it would just be dry and brittle after only applying on time.. I have to apply 4 times!! I&#x27;m not kidding either... I have long thick frizzy damaged hair... So maybe not good for my type.. It did however work on my daughters fine virgin straight hair... I still have another bottle left... I&#x27;m going to give it away.. Bleh... Waste of money and time..</li>
            <li> Great product! Noticed results within a week. Before using this product I noticed that every morning I would leave dead hair on my pillow. After just one week of using Pura d&#x27;or, I noticed that the dead hair on the pillow had stop.</li>
            <li> Great product the portion size is what sucks. The bottle is very small... Only lasted me maybe 2 weeks?</li>
            <li> Purchased with shampoo to treat hair loss.  Did not help me at all.  I&#x27;m 76 years old.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The shampoo and conditioners are not harsh on your hair and leave your hair soft and manageable.  There are no extra chemicals to strip out you hair color.  I am Gluten Free and it is difficult to find hair care products because of the add gluten.  Pura d&#x27;or is the product I have been searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want shine / body / hair that is not weighed down by left in chemicals, this conditioner is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for hair products that are free of chemicals. I&#x27;m loving this conditioner. I have very long hair and I always only apply conditioner on the length of my hair, never on the scalp. This conditioner not only leaves my hair smelling really good and feeling well conditioned, but it leaves me feeling satisfied that I have made a good natural choice for my hair!</li>
            <li> I like it, smells wonderful. I feel like I have to use a lot though in order to sufficiently condition my hair. Will still buy again though. Much better than Nioxin (what a waste of money!).</li>
            <li> The perfect finish for the perfect shampoo.  This is the only conditioner I have used that makes a noticeable difference for my hair.  I am so impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever bough. This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft however I have straight hair. When I used it, I felt my hair sticky and tangled.</li>
            <li> good stuff. Nice smell</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, non toxic ingredients, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference. Made my hair dry!!</li>
            <li> This product has worked really well for me. At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure because it felt like I had to use a lot of it to actually feel it in my hair (and I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair). However, I realized that you don&#x27;t need to use much with this condition since it does leave my hair feeling soft and not dry. The best part about it is the smell. I get compliments from my wife that hair smells awesome. If I had to be picky about this product, it would be the fact that I am going through it much faster than pure d&#x27;or shampoo; and I&#x27;ve had my shampoo bottle longer. Otherwise, great product that I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel very soft after using the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. So buying this conditioner was a necessity for me.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it, she says her hair stopped falling out like it use to, and lots of new baby hairs growing .</li>
            <li> Smell is really refreshing, however, doesn&#x27;t spread quite easily, would need a few more pumps to for longer hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feel really soft and love the smell really easy to style after wash my hair&lt;br /&gt;My really like this product</li>
            <li> Works Great, My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Great Conditioner! All natural and smells like lavender.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to take the color out of my hair (I use regular permanenet hair color) and the conditioner leaves my hair difficult to comb out.  It does clean my scalp and hair. Is it helping beyond that?  Too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Pura Dor Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for last 3 -4 weeks and I see noticeable difference in loss of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss has reduced quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my hair loss will stop completely in next few weeks. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I liked this conditioner because it made my hair feel soft afterwards. My hair seemed smoother after I used it for a while. I just didn&#x27;t care for the smell of it. I prefer using a conditioner that smells fruity.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The shampoo is great as well.  Really works.</li>
            <li> my hair feels softer every time I use it and it is not frizzy anymore.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is good.  It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, as the vanilla overpowers the lavender scent.  It seems to compliment the Pur a dor shampoo well, but to be used sparingly otherwise it will weight hair down.  I would buy again simply because it promotes hair growth.;)</li>
            <li> I was using Nioxin for years and then I read that it has all seven of the chemicals you should never put on your hair like parabans, Sodium Laurel Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate,BPA etc....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after losing so much hair I did my research and found this Shampoo and conditioner... At first large amounts of hair came out which almost made me stop. But, after talking to my Dr, he said that I should continue using it because that may have happen regardless... So, I continued using it... Now my hair is shiny, manageable, and looks like it is growing back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that fact that it is organic and it DOES NOT strip your hair of the natural oils like other harsh shampoos do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend very much...</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt smoother or healthier!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the matching gold shampoo for thinning hair.  I could tell that the shampoo really cleaned my hair and it felt pretty dry afterwards, so I used a lot of this conditioner.  It does not have the slippery feeling.  When I got out I could not even comb my hair.  I had tangles everywhere.  I had to use a ton of leave in conditioner just to get it combed out . The next time I used it, I added some of my old bumble and bumble conditioner with it, to see if that would help.  Better, but still tangled, I had to add oil to get tangles combed out.  I do not have this problem with other conditioners I have used.  Some work better than others, but nothing this bad.  I will try the idea left below to use this as a leave in conditioner.  I tried to contact the seller to return it, but I got no reply.  Waste of $20.  I will keep using the shampoo but with a much richer conditioner.  This may work on a guy&#x27;s hair, or someone with short hair.</li>
            <li> There is harmful composition inside,meanwhile the producer Purador&#x27;s customer service policy is bad.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal conditioner.  My barber told me to wash my hair every-other day and to wash with conditioner in-between on the days I don&#x27;t wash with shampoo.  This is my first conditioner I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m hooked.  It has a great silky-smooth texture and goes in your hair the same.  Once I&#x27;m finished with my shower I can feel it has made a huge difference in the feel and appearance of my hair. It gives it volume and that shiny look without being wet.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Its a great product. I will suggest other to try this. I Had previously around 100-150 hair falls per day. Now after 4 weeks i can its 10-20. almost 90% of hair fall reduced. I loved this product. Gonna order more..... Suggest others to try it for a month and see the results!!! am 100 % sure you will find the difference.... Please try with the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo following the same conditioner and see the difference.....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a week and have liked the way my hair looks and feels.  I was using a Pantene 2 in 1 product previously and find this product far superior.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all so I returned it</li>
            <li> Very drying for curly hair, would not recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li> My roommate gave me a bottle of Premium Organic Conditioner in a few month ago, I used it and the result is amazing. So I bought another one when this conditioner had a big deal at 31rd,2014. I tried many different brand with Conditioner but this is best one I think. Otherwise, some websites recommend this brand to customer as well, so this product must be a good choice for your hair.</li>
            <li> Just like the shampoo...This is exactly what i was looking for.  Natural and organic ingredients.  No more harsh chemicals for me!  Great price and fast shipping.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil even though this is my second day using it my face feel so smooth I&#x27;m sure I will order more of this before I run out thank you Argan oil for the best of you!!!</li>
            <li> After hitting menopause and under job stress, I lost 50% of my hair!  I always took great care of my hair and when this happened I was even more stressed.  I did my research and watched certain talk shows and found out about this product.  I was skeptical at first, but after using it for four months now, my hair is back in great condition.  I noticed a change immediately.  It&#x27;s nice to get compliments on my hair again!  Thank you Pura!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo counterpart to this product, but I absolutely HATE the smell of this conditioner.  I would really like to throw it away, but I don&#x27;t believe in wasting products.  I have offered it to my friends and they can&#x27;t stand it, as well.  It smells like an old, stinky bathroom covered up by a lavender/floral room spray.  Yuck.  I wish it had the same scent (or lack of scent) as the organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the smell of the product.  My hair seemed to break more.  I would not purchase again, especially given the price.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see a difference  after a month of use and it does sting a bit when you put it on.  I&#x27;ve moved on to a different product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this conditioner to cOndition my brazilian weave and i must say this product worked wonderfulLy. I am so impressed. I didnt even have to leave it in for long. I am definitely going to purchase again!!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo very much. I recommend it highly. I don&#x27;t know if it prevents hair loss or not.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of this product. I bought it for my mom and it really works for her. It has great smell and her hair is nice and soft. The hair loss is lesser. The only problem on this 2nd purchase was there was a leak and the conditioner where all over the bottle. It is a good thing that it is wrapped with plastic but now the product is not full anymore 😕. I did purchase the shampoo. The shipment on that was perfect and no damage</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  My husband and I have been using this product along with the shampoo and the Vitamin C serum. We love them all!  We love the fact that it is organic with quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I could only stand to use this conditioner for a couple of months before my hair felt so gross, straw-like, and rough that I gave up on it. I was using this in combination with the argan oil anti-hair loss shampoo also by Pura d&#x27;or. I have very fine, usually quite soft, hair. This conditioner did nothing for tangles, softness, or manageability. Never again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as it says. I was expecting a soft feel to my hair but it was not thick in fact it was a thin cream that did not make my hair soft at all. Went back to my other staple I use. I was so excited for it to work too but it didn&#x27;t. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Best Conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!  It makes my aging, dry hair soft without buildup. And, smells awesome!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t any different from Bosley</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !  My hair is naturally curly and therefore naturally frizzy, especially here in the Southeast where we have so much humidity.  Add to that the fact that I&#x27;m now virtually completely gray around my face, and that I take an oral chemo drug every day, and you have the perfect setup for thinning, dry hair.  Enter Premium Organic Argan Oil by pura d&#x27;or.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I was amazed at how soft it left my hair and how much more manageable.  The frizzies were gone.  ISince my first order, I&#x27;ve reordered two more bottles to make sure I don&#x27;t run out !  I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s contributing to the hair loss because I&#x27;m simultaneously doing other things, but the hair loss has definitely slowed or stopped.  My hair has grown back in the areas it had fallen out and it&#x27;s much healthier, and my confidence is returning.  As a woman, it&#x27;s unthinkable to lose one&#x27;s hair... I mean, even the bible says a woman&#x27;s hair is her glory !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.  I use both the shampoo and the conditioner.  Thank you pura d&#x27;or !!!</li>
            <li> Great product- a bit expensive though. Also, although it is natural it&#x27;s NOT organic. Nevertheless, great product.</li>
            <li> Great smell! It makes my hair soft, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> After so I have found good oranic conditionar and it really works. makes my hair shiny and silky</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reliable hair care specialist! My girlfriend introduced me to a great product rather a hair doctor, Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil hair conditioner and the hair fall prevention shampoo of the same brand, which worked magically to reduce my hair fall and rebuild my hair. The Argan oil hair conditioner gave my hair a healthy look that I never dreamed of. The products helped me to resolve my hair loss problem and turned it to shinny and silky. I would suggest everyone who is facing the same hair loss problem, please start using this unique product Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil hair conditioner for a new look of your hair style.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this conditioner doesn&#x27;t work well for my chin length hair with a slight wave.  Although the conditioner feels good in my hair, once it is rinsed out, I can&#x27;t get my fingers through my hair and need to spritz in a detangler.  I&#x27;ll use this up, but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is great.. very happy with it..</li>
            <li> Oh My.....brings out the SHINE. Great conditioner</li>
            <li> Great product, havent been using it for a really long time but so far so good.</li>
            <li> My brother is satisfied with teh product I didnt use though</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I only eat organic food, and now I finally found an organic shampoo and conditioner that works great and smells really fresh.  My hair smells wonderful and is so shiny and clean feeling.  I found my new hair care pair!!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and I can&#x27;t tell any differenct.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not leave my hair super silky like other brands. But it helps my permed hair since it becomes easier to shape my hair. It makes me feel my hair got stronger.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, heavy &amp; dry naturally curly hair.  I always leave in quite a bit of my conditioner, with this one I can rinse out more of it, because it&#x27;s quite a heavy product which I consider to be a positive trait.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  Not too thick so does not weigh my hair down and leaves it with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell and when it is used with the golden shampoo, it feels really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for a week and I like it. Smells nice &amp;&#x27;gets rid of my tangles - and it&#x27;s loaded with good for you ingredients</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair feels,to soon to tell if it stops hair loss though.It leeked out of the bottle a bit during shipping,so the was a slite mess.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hear that tangles easily and have tried some of my wife&#x27;s conditioners that say they detangle.  Most don&#x27;t work well and have too much perfume. This is the best I have tried.  It not only leaves my hair detangled but it doesn&#x27;t have that the strong perfumed smell that most conditioners have.  It is also organic which we also try to use, and most organics especially with Argen oil leave your hair greasy this doesn&#x27;t.  Nice to find something the whoe family can use.</li>
            <li> I have used Pura d&#x27;or for about 3 weeks now and am already seeing results.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo along with the conditioner for three weeks and have noticed less hair loss. I don&#x27;t know how to quantify &amp;#34;less hair loss&amp;#34; but the less hair I see in my brush all week, the better I&#x27;m feeling about the product.  Using the products at this point is giving me a sense that the individual hair strands are becoming less susceptible to breakage, but I can&#x27;t say that with absolute certainty.  Other reviews concerning the fragrances seem accurate:  The shampoo smells herbal and the conditioner smells nice-I think it smells like baby powder. I&#x27;m optimistic that the reduced hair loss will continue.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in conjunction with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. The shampoo leaves my hair feeling fuller and with less hair loss in the shower, and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and smelling very pleasant, like vanilla. I leave the shampoo on for about a minute before rinsing, and the conditioner about the same. I will definitely be purchasing this along with the shampoo again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my hair loss. After I used several times, I found my hair loss is getting better.  I believe this product works.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is I feel it is kind of expansive.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great on my naturally curly/frizzy hair. It defines my curls and moisturizes well. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. I opened to use it and the pump was defective and impossible to use. I told them to replace tit, and they wouldn&#x27;t do so. I started to use without the pump and realized that it made my hair thin and unmanageable. Lousy product.</li>
            <li> Smelled great, but left my hair feeling rough afterwards. Used Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Renewal with Argon oil after showering to make my hair softer.</li>
            <li> This stuff seemed to coat the hair and make it feel thicker. It did nothing to grow hair. It dried my hair out so badly I had to have my hair cut super short to take the dead hair off.&lt;br /&gt;To add insult to injury I don&#x27;t see a contact the seller choice.</li>
            <li> Its a good one with out any harsh chemicals in it as the regular shampoo have</li>
            <li> Smells good and has made my hair feel great. Used with minoxinil and I have seen a reduction in shedding.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it so far.</li>
            <li> I was scared because i was losing my hair but then i tried your product and I am having very good results. I am so happy.</li>
            <li> This is a very classic conditioner which does a good job conditioning your hair. It does leave a shine. It smells really good too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great, it definitely increases volume in my hair, comparing to other conditioner I have been used for years. Although I am not a huge fan of the smell, kind of too sweet to my liking, but overall, very happy for my purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> Towards the middle of 2014, I started researching oils for skin, hair, to nails to see what they were all about because so many oils were being touted as the solution to all our beauty needs. As a kid, we all opened the Vitamin E capsules and they were always great with sunburns and so forth, but that was the extent of my knowledge. I then got into Coconut anything in my teens and moved on to Jojoba and Cocoa butters. The market is flooded with bringing back oils, which not too long ago was seen as a major no-no and especially for suffers of oily skin. I suffer from combination skin and this includes my scalp’s skin where I fluctuate with what the weather and seasons bring. One Winter I could have a normal scalp and the next Winter it could be dry, so it’s also skin with a temper and if you ask me, sort of moody. To squash the moodiness, I learned that simple is better when it comes to what I put on my skin and this includes my hair and scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner smells a little stronge...

            <li> I like this product very much, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in august after reading about all the bad chemicals in grocery store shampoos. I was also looking for something to help stop my massive shedding during every shower. I mean, 4-5 handfuls of hair per shower. I do have very long hair that was once also very thick, but I had noticed it beginning to thin out a little. Since I started using this shampoo and conditioner my hair is ridiculously thick again, even my boyfriend has commented on how much hair I seem to have now. We have both been using it since August, it is now December and I&#x27;ve just now had to reorder. My hair is waist length, so for a bottle to last that long makes it also worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very curly in some parts, wavy in some others, all totally crazy and unmanageable. It&#x27;s basically a mane... Anything that can keep it from looking like a horrendous frizz ball, I&#x27;ve tried. This conditioner feels very light weight and at first I was afraid I&#x27;d end up using massive amounts of it to get that slippery feeling on my hair. Instead, I use a small amount and comb it through my hair while I&#x27;m in the shower, then leave it on for as long as possible, and rinse with cool water right before I get out. Even without any other product, I&#x27;ve received constant compliments and have had many strangers walk up and either touch my hair or ask to touch my hair. They have all exclaimed at how beautiful it is, so something about this conditioner just be working. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Pura D&#x27;or Scalp and Dandruff shampoo and these 2 products are so awesome for my hair! I normally can&#x27;t use conditioner in my hair because it weighs my hair way too much, but this conditioner actually leaves my hair feeling like silk and I find myself using less and less of it as days go on. The smell is gentle enough that my fiance can use this without it smelling too girly for him.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this conditioner and love how it makes my hair feels it give my hair body and it does not weight it down like other conditioner do .</li>
            <li> The Pura D&#x27;or blue is not as good as the Gold Premium version I have found. The blue caused severe irritation and didnt seem to arrest the symptoms as described on the Pura D&#x27;or website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to purchase this directly from Pura D&#x27;or. However I was informed they could not ship it to my location unless I paid them via a money wire transfer rather than via paypal. At that stage I had already paid and they ended up refunding my money are one week of emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person that answers the emails on their website is also pretty rude I have to say.</li>
            <li> I usually never review items, but I have to say this is one of the best products i have ever used for my hair. From the first time i used this conditioner i felt a difference in my hair. I would 100% recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!  It leaves my hair feeling nourished and smooth without weighing it down.  It also smells great!  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this conditioner again!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is pretty nice but a bit on the thin side for my taste. Still, your hair will come out shiny and strong.  I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I love this product! makes my hair feel amazing and nutured.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far. It&#x27;s definitely helped to decrease the amount of hair loss I was experiencing.  I use this along with the gild label pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo and I oil/massage my scalp with Jamaicam black castor oil every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo and this conditioner.  the conditioner smells great.  I HAVE to use a de-tangeling spray after using both products.  my hair cannot even begin to get a comb through it otherwise.  BUT it does leave my hair very clean and non weighed down, also seems to improve the color vibrancy.  not sure if i&#x27;d buy again- prob not</li>
            <li> I got this to go with the Pura shampoo for thinning hair. My hair is both fine and thin, and although I don&#x27;t think I am loosing hair, I needed something that would help enhance what I already had (and fill me out a bit, if possible). The conditioner is thick and it does condition. My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to massage in well. I&#x27;d like it to be a little smoother when you spread it and massage it in so you don&#x27;t fill like you&#x27;ve missed spots. As far as healthy, it seems to be natural so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good conditioner for your hair.</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed.  Hair feels knotty after use, although I LOVE the smell.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month, I use two pumps (I have short hair about two inches) it leaves hair soft, just enough shine and really good smell. I would continue using this conditioner. Hopefully in the future they come out with a bigger size to save some money buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> Just got the product. It arrived promptly. Has a pleasant smell and nice texture.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, a really good quality shampoo with natural ingredients. Hair has extra shine after use.</li>
            <li> I am &#x27;poo-less&#x27; so I only use conditioner, no shampoo.  Therefore, I have used quite a few great organic conditioners.  Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil is a perfect conditioner.  No residue, very pleasant aroma, and my hair is showing healthy improvement from root to tip.</li>
            <li> I bought this product recently because i&#x27;m beginning my hair journey and i&#x27;m now using organic products.  I&#x27;ve only used it once but this conditioner is very thick and does a great job of moisturizing my hair after i shampoo it.  I also added some emu oil to my hair and cover it with a plastic cap for about 30 minutes. Did i mention it smells amazing? Give it a try. Its expensive but worth it and you only need a few pumps depending on your hair length.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what the rave is about. This does not condition at all! You can slather it on and it still barely moisturizes. It&#x27;s way too light. FYI, I have long, normal hair. I didn&#x27;t try it as a leave in conditioner as another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> It helped out very well, because without the conditioner, the other shampoo dries your scalp out over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve payed a lot of money, looking for a good product to avoid my hait loose, and finaly, I thinking I am in the right product. All natural. Smell so great, and leave my hair so shine a smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I could definitely tell a difference.  Makes the scalp feel smooth also.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use natural hair conditioning products. Before, my hair is super unmanageable and hair falls easily. Also, I have problems with having frizzy hair. I think maybe it&#x27;s because of the hair care I am using. So I tried to but Pura d&#x27;or. According to the ads, it&#x27;s 99% natural. When I used it, it feels so light in my head. Thus, it is best fit for my hair. My hair is soft and silky. Less frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that this product is finally available on amazon. We should all be using natural products in preference to harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed...and doing your bit for the environment to boot....</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the shampoo, and let me just say that this conditioner does wonders for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave the messy buildup that I&#x27;ve gotten with other so-called high end conditioners, and the shine is amazing! I don&#x27;t even have to use extra hair balm anymore to control frizz. This conditioner leaves my hair silky and sleek right after rinsing it out. Really wish I&#x27;d found this sooner because it&#x27;s well worth the money. And the scent...it&#x27;s very soothing and it lasts all day. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it will fix my dry hair/frizz. I had alot of dry hair and friz! Since I&#x27;ve received this my hair my hairs smooth, hair feels like silk not going to lie! I can also feel deeply hydrated, I think this brings a feature which adds vital moisture and gets rid of the friz and gives me a smooth look. It also protects from heat damage as i straight my hair daily, Don&#x27;t forget the SMELL, its jus amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would 100% definitely recommend this product to everyone. It&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve used and smells amazing, Its perfect for any women with friz.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a short-haired guy like me, you might wonder to yourself &amp;#34;What is conditioner and why do I need it?  Don&#x27;t most shampoos come with it baked it?&amp;#34;  However, as a formerly long-haired guy, I can tell you conditioner will make your hair softer and more manageable, which is why most women use it.  The benefit for you is that women will want to run their hands through your hair, and if I need to explain why this is a benefit, then I feel sorry for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on to the Pura d&#x27;or conditioner.  This stuff is a little pricey compared to drugstore brands, but it will last a long time if you have short hair.  And your hair will feel silky smooth, comb better, and lay down better.  The only downside is that while it smells nice, it does smell kind of girly.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but since I can&#x27;t I&#x27;ll round up to 5.</li>
            <li> Probably the best product tried. Works reliably.</li>
            <li> My son likes it. He says it&#x27;s almost as good as the conditioner that my sister pays $50 for. Me? I&#x27;ve never used or purchased hair conditioner in my life. And now that I&#x27;m old and bald, I doubt I will be starting any time soon.</li>
            <li> Used this product with the [Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo Scalp &amp; Dandruff Treatment] and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I find it o be nothing special</li>
            <li> smells great and makes my hair feel good, won&#x27;t regrow hair tho.  only way to do it is with surgery.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product</li>
            <li> My fiancé&#x27;s hair is visibly bolder in color (which I&#x27;m assuming means it&#x27;s thicker). I used to be able to see his scalp more and his hair was more of an ashy withering brown. Now it is a deep rich brown in appearance and much fuller looking. He had been using Nioxin for almost a year now and I decided to look into something else as Nioxin made no difference in my eyes, and was much more expensive. It&#x27;s also bright, ghostbusters, green. The natural approach makes so much more sense!</li>
            <li> Heavy hair loss due to body stress from a hospital stay.  Within one week after starting to use this shampoo and conditioner the heavy hair loss had stopped.  While waiting for the lost hair to grow back I am continuing to use this product and would recommend it to anyone.  It really weorked for me.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working! I have a fuller looking head of hair</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this conditioner.  I do have to use a little more than normal conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in a long time.  It did wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> Got the shampoo due to hair loss. So far love how the product feels.</li>
            <li> i just used the conditioner, it feels ok, but i do not like the smell.</li>
            <li> Softens your long hair as desired. Smells good. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> This conditioner does everything I want from a conditioner. my hair is soft, shiny, and it doesn&#x27;t snarl at the base of my neck. Between this and the shampoo I have actually noticed where my hair had gotten extremely thin it is slowly starting to fill back in. The only thing I would change would be to have an unscented one and a lower price. I am really glad I took the chance and tried this!</li>
            <li> I have been using Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s premium conditioner for well over 6-months, and have found it to be the best hair conditioner I have ever used.  Through the years I have had a challenge with using regular conditioners because it seemed it would cause my hair to fall out more easily.  However, with Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s premium hair conditioner it has been an excellent product that I plan to use for years to come.  Thank you, Pura d&#x27;or!</li>
            <li> Great product and a good amount for the price. Leaves hair vary soft and less frizzy. Hair sheds much less on this product, will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product and conditioner for about one week and as expected have not seen much results but can say it sure smells good and leaves my hair feeling softer with a somewhat fuller appearance, possibly due to a bit of thickening. Will continue use for now.</li>
            <li> This product gets a 5-star review, why? Because pretty much all my life I&#x27;ve had dull hair. I&#x27;ve tried many products and I think I&#x27;ve found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s ORGANIC!!&lt;br /&gt;- Works great with my hair&lt;br /&gt;- It works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it:&lt;br /&gt;- Nothing, maybe the price for others? But honestly for me it&#x27;s worth it due to the results I had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and I&#x27;ll be ordering it from now on.</li>
            <li> Worked very well but my hair was not as easy to brush through after washing. I would buy again. :)</li>
            <li> After I used this brand shampoo, I wasn&#x27;t sure any conditioner would help as it made my hair bone dry (just for the first week or so while my hair adjusted to it), but this soaked right in and made my hair soft. The scent is pleasant. Overall I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works well and leaves hair smelling  great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo.  Between the two I have seen significant improvement in the quality of my hair.  Specifically, I have stemmed the loss of hair.  This product has a wonderful fragrance which I finally remembered smelling at the beach when I was a child.  One of the main fragrances is  vanilla.  While I let it soak in, I sit and reminisce about the beach all those years ago.  (When used as directed) It is a great product that leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff and smells good too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is just OK, nothing great. It smells lovely and the fragrance does linger in the hair after use, but it&#x27;s light and smells nice and pleasant. It has a bit of a minty feel on the scalp which is refreshing. Problem is I&#x27;ve been using it after shampooing with this product line&#x27;s horrible horrible horrible Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label), which is incredibly harsh and drying on my hair.  Either this condition is too light without enough deep conditioning ingredients to provide a good slip to the hair post-shampoo (regardless of shampoo used), or it just cannot compensate for the harshness of the companion shampoo, I haven&#x27;t been able to determine that yet. If it&#x27;s the former, then this would probably be a good conditioner for people who tend to have oily hair, or want something lightweight that won&#x27;t weigh the hair down. I have to use A LOT of it on my mid-back length, highlighted hair to compensate for the harshness of the companion shampoo. Not sure if I&#x27;d repurchase this, but I&#x27;m also not going to throw the bottle out, and will try it with another shampoo to see if it has better conditioning benefits than if used with the companion shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product! leaves your hair feeling full and really soft. I&#x27;ve always had thick hair that was hard to manage and style , but after using this product  my hair was glossy and a lot more tamable. The fact that its all organic is even more satisfying.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel. Smooth and shinny</li>
            <li> I usually do not leave reviews for products I bought but this one is really different. The conditioner works well with my hair and I have been using it for quite some time. Even though I am a guy, I use this conditioner because it is effective, safe to use and really affordable. If you want a conditioner that is worth every penny you are offering then this one is for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Gives my wife&#x27;s hair a sexy natural shine&lt;br /&gt;2. Her hair feels so soft and&lt;br /&gt;3. It has so much bounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She absolutely loves this conditioner. It makes her hair so smooth and shiny after she deep conditions it and on top of that it smells so good! My wife feels awesome which makes me feel awesome!</li>
            <li> Product smells good but i stopped using after a week. My hair and scalp dried out and hair felt brittle. I found more hair in my hand while washing.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells, and the oils in it. It does condition, although it&#x27;s not up to par with what I need. I have long, thick (strands, thinning overall) hair. It&#x27;s lightweight and just the perfect amount of conditioning for the hair on my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and it smells like fragrant essential oils (and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering). I&#x27;ve tried it on the longer parts of my strands, and it does nothing to condition them. I need something more rich and conditioning, hence the 4 stars. So, in sum, perfect for the hair on my scalp, inadequate for parts of long hair. For the price, I will use my own conditioner on the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Very soft hair! Good for preventing split ends too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good! I like it.</li>
            <li> Waited since September 2014 to make a review: Hair still fall&#x27;s out, does nothing to keep my hair healthy,  and it doesn&#x27;t smell good. It makes my hair smell like a hookah smoker.  Meaning: pineapple&#x27; grape smoke.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> this does not work. been using it for a few weeks and it only dries out my hair.  also smells horribly - smells like medicine. i also bought the conditioner.  the conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell as bad but doesn&#x27;t really help moisturizing the dryness the shampoo causes. i recommend the ultra labs hair lush - better hydrating, smells good, and does prevent hair loss - didn&#x27;t notice hair growth but did notice less hair loss.  hair lush costs a bundle though which is why i tried looking for something cheaper.</li>
            <li> Even though it is qualify/quantify the Organic products as the results are no observed on day 1 on month 1.&lt;br /&gt;We have been using this condition among other products, and we are quite happy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells like Johnson and Johnson baby lotion. If the bottle wasn&#x27;t labeled as Pura d&#x27;or Argan oil conditioner based off the look, feel, smell etc I would think I am supposed to put this product on my skin and not my hair. At first I only ordered the shampoo and used a different conditioner but I felt the shampoo was helping my hair so much that I wanted to get the full benefit of both products used simultaneously. I will be honest I am not a huge fan of the smell of this conditioner. It takes a while to get used to. I wash my hair about every 3-4 days and even when I wash it sometimes I just try and breathe softer if that makes any sense because if you take deep breaths and really inhale this scent it tastes terrible (even though you aren&#x27;t eating it) It just doesn&#x27;t something terrible to my taste buds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I can somewhat deal with the smell. Aside from this, I love my hair. It is growing fast and is super healthy!!! I also have been doing rosehip seed oil treatments the night before I wash my hair and I feel this makes my hair more rich and vibrant and I can really go that 4th day without washing if I wanted to. My hair feels thicker and I notice baby hair growth in my hair line. I thought to increase growth by adding a biotin supplement but my doctor already has me on DHEA which causes acne so bad that I have to take it a week on and a week off that I didn&#x27;t want to take biotin and have double the acne. So far, this conditioner coupled with the shampoo that goes with it has done wonders for my hair without the biotin supplement. I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner and the matching shampoo to try the organic method. I don&#x27;t have much time with it but it seems like a great product. It smells fine, nothing shocking or disturbing that you&#x27;re massaging into your hair. Good consistency in the hand and lathers up fine. Not as well as other box-store generic shampoo but this stuff doesn&#x27;t have all the other nasty chemicals in it that they do. So the tradeoff is worth it to me. I hope to see long term results that last and prove that this is the best combo of shampoo and conditioner for my hair type. I will continue to use this product and watch for any changes as they come.</li>
            <li> I luv this conditioner!!  I had been using &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; but just wasnt  totally happy with it. I&#x27;ve been using this with the &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and what a differance it has made in my hair.. This is the best Conditioner  I think I&#x27;ve used in a long time on my hair. Would highly recommend it. Leaves my hair feeling clean an with a lot of body, Not heavy or weighted down like some conditioners can do. Will buy more again soon.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old lady and I have been using Purador shampoo and Purador conditoner regularly . Its true what the products say that it really really helps dull ,fine dry hair . Because of my age ( 71 years old ) my hair are fine, very dry and unmanageable .Since I started using these products two months ago ,my hair changes from  dull to healthy . I can never live  without these products after what I have seen happened to my hair . I always buy extra  stocks because I do not like to run out  of these wonderful Purador Shampoo, Conditioner, Argan oil, Vit C serum, all  of which are Purador products ,,,My husband was so surprised ,he started using them too , he is 77 years old . These products are not only for young people but also for seniors like me and my husband.</li>
            <li> definitely can see a difference in my texture and health of my hair.  I have baby fine aging hair.  This product definitely does what it claims.  My hair is healthy, growing and NOT falling out as it did before using this.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry and thinning hair. I use this in conjunction with the shampoo every night prior to Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Good product and seller.</li>
            <li> this is terrible. I have to use a huge amount to even get a comb through my hair. I even tried it on my 6 yr. old&#x27;s straight hair, with the same results. am I missing something? I&#x27;ve used conditioners at a fraction of the price that moisturized better. I&#x27;m starting to think some of the reviews on amazon are bogus.</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner at the same time that I started using their organic hair loss prevention shampoo, I like the fact that there are only organic ingredients in both. My wife and I both love it, as it leaves our hair shiny and oil-free and smelling great. We&#x27;ll never go back to those chemical based conditioners again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this conditioner smells. Sometimes lavender can be overwhelming so the vanilla really calms it down. After using this product for about three months I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference...or really any difference...in my hair thickness or growth. I am disappointed because the product received very positive reviews so I was hopeful that I would have the same results. Perhaps it is my hair type or texture but what for what this costs, I would not repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with a organic hair product but I was pleasantly surprised by the results. All the scientific formula hair products did very little compared. Plus I have come to like the lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to post reviews (I think I&#x27;ve only posted 4 in the last 5 years) but heck, this product deserves some recognition. My hair has always been very thick and unmanageable.  No matter what conditioner I used in the shower, and how I dried my hair, I would always end up with a fluffy head, certainly nothing smooth or silky like you see in all those beauty commercials.  So, I was literally fed up and about to cut my hair to an extremely shorter length, but decided to give ONE last conditioner a try before I did so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, you guess it.  I went with Pura d&#x27;or after some extensive research and now till this day, my hair is still looking long, and NO LONGER a pile of fluff.  Not quite sure what ingredients are doing this, but whichever ones they are, they are working miracles up top, and smell extremely different than most conditioners that I&#x27;ve used...which is usually almost always a good sign in my book.</li>
            <li> I was relieved to find this stuff. It creates long-lasting shine without the harsh chemicals that other manufacturers resort to. I understand that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is a little bit different, but it works perfectly for me. I could tell a difference right away, but by the second or third time I&#x27;d tried it I was really blown away. Pura d&#x27;or will continue to be my go-to organic conditioner with results like these. It works. It&#x27;s that simple.</li>
            <li> Not working it increased my hair loss</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves your hair feeling so soft, without feeling weighed down.  I&#x27;ve been suffering from hair thinning and hair loss and have found this conditioner to be the kindest on my hair.  Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! After using the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo, this conditioner leaves my hair smooth and soft. Smells good too! Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very dry and not at all soft. I feel like I have not used any conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> Made hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> awesome upon first using it notice big difference in thickness and shine of hair would recommend</li>
            <li> Not as rich or hair supporting as the  description led me to believe. I see little difference in 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This is a really great conditioner -- I plan to continue buying it!</li>
            <li> I love to shop organically, and have been using farmers markets and local farms for years, so when I found this product I decided to step away from those commercial conditioners full of chemicals and try this, I was not disappointed! This conditioner left my hair feeling smooth silky and even in the heat my hair does not get frizzy using this conditioner, give it a shot - its worth the investment!</li>
            <li> It smells nice but made my hair dry. Not going to buy again or don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. No bad chemicals and my hair is soft and manageable like when I was young. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as described. I was expecting a soft feel to my hair but it did not make my hair soft at all.  I was so excited for it to work too, especially because I bought the shampoo which I like, but it didn&#x27;t. Total waste of money. It&#x27;s hard to comb my hair after use, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not conditioning the hair. I will keep using to finish the bottle, but do not think i will purchase again, going back to my other natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners and I have never been really happy until now!&lt;br /&gt;I have curly color treated hair and this conditioner makes my hair smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I just used it today for the first time along wiht the Tranquility shampoo and my hair looks and feels beautiuful!&lt;br /&gt;I also just started to use the serum for my face and oil for my hair after conditioning and before styling and I am thrilled with all the products!&lt;br /&gt;I can already see a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I am loving this with the accompanying shampoo. I LOVE the scent of the shampoo, although I&#x27;m not as thrilled with the scent of the conditioner. Still, the end result is a great smell. The whole family is using it. My 4 year old daughters hair is gorgeous from it. Smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for 2 years.  I have long hair, and this conditioner keeps it moisturized, shiny and manageable all the way to the tips.  My hair is never greasy and has a lot of bounce and lift.  Argan oil is a gift to the health of your hair, and the fresh smell impressed my hair stylist.  I cannot recommend this conditioner strongly enough.</li>
            <li> At first I was very leery of this conditioner as it is very light and did not think it could hold to my very thick curly hair.  However, after working it through my hair, I found that product is very good and once washed out leaves the hair feeling moisturized and cleaned.  Still, this product is very expensive and although I did like it, I think I could find better equal results/better results with a cheaper product.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this is just not for me.  I have a lot of hair fallen out when I use it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My hair is noticeably more thicker and fuller.  Feels healthier too.</li>
            <li> Really nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> 1. Pump does not work, no matter what i tried so thats annoying!&lt;br /&gt;2. Nothing special about product...left my hair feeling dry n flat&lt;br /&gt;3. Only been a few weeks but no real positive hair changes</li>
            <li> Most organic shampoos and conditioners leave you hair feeling more oily and stringy. But not this shampoo! It actually leaves my hair feeling soft, full of volume, and even helps my scalp!</li>
            <li> I am still losing hair but I&#x27;m not sure if the hair falling out now needs to come out to make way for new healthy hair or if I&#x27;m still not getting to the root cause of my hair loss issue. The amount has decreased significantly however. AND I have noticed my hair filling in around my temples and hair line where before it just seemed thin and sad. There are small 1-inch hairs all over my head, some are two inches so I believe I am regrowing my hair. Overall I think I am on the road to recovery. Also my finger nails are growing so quickly I have to file them every other day, which I think is a good sign.    I have very fine hair that&#x27;s always been very healthy and can grow quite long. My hair loss issue started sometime over this past summer. I had given my hair a bit of beating since last winter. In my attempt to ween myself off of shampoo and conditioner, which was causing massive build up and dandruff (even organic and expensive brands) I tried several different alternative hair care routines. I tried the baking soda and apple cider vinegar only routine, which I would never recommend to anyone because it completely dried out my scalp. High quality shampoo bars, coconut oil masks, no shampoo at all etc. I finally ended up at the the moroccan method and that helped a little bit, but ultimately I was not happy with the way it made my hair look and became skeptical of the &#x27;detox&#x27; period the company claims your hair has to go through. My hair just looked thick and greasy most of the time. I still use their Euro hair oil but have abandoned most of the other products. Throughout this whole period large amounts of hair would come out in the shower and I started to notice my hair line receding and my part widening. Obviously it freaked me out. I&#x27;m a firm believer treating pretty much anything without a doctors help, because I have done so in the past with the help of my chiropractor and ayurvedic practitioner. So I got hard core in to the &#x27;real food&#x27; diet and revved up my ayurvedic routine and supplement intake.    I can&#x27;t contribute hair regrowth solely to pura d&#x27;or because I am doing several other things to help with my hair loss issue, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s everything or one thing that is helping. I got my blood tested to make sure there was not a significant health issue. I eat a quality seasonal diet comprised of good meats and veggies, pasture raised eggs and dairy. I make my own pasture raised chicken bone broth which I drink daily. I am also taking blackstrap molasses daily (for iron), 5000iu vitamin d, fish oils and fermented cod liver oil plus ayurvedic herbs. I take biotin and upped my b-vitamins. I take an adrenal supplement my chiropractor put me on from nutri-west called DSF formula, which has made a huge difference to my energy levels. I also massage doTerra lavender, cedarwood, rosemary and frankincense essential oils, moroccan method euro hair oil, primrose oil and aloe gel in to my scalp an hour before showering to stimulate and moisturize my scalp. I bought the Pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo and conditioner and wash my hair with it every other day, sometimes every third day. I air dry my hair and I only brush it when it is dry, I only use a bristle boar soft brush. I installed a high quality water filter in my shower to remove chemicals and other unnecessary additives. I may get my thyroid hormones tested just to make sure that is functioning properly as well. I bought pura d&#x27;or because of the great reviews and I wanted the hair that I have left to look nice. At least if I&#x27;m going to lose my hair it, the hair that&#x27;s left can look nice.    The only thing I do not like about it, is the scent. A lot of other people say they like it, I think it smells gross. I like the shampoo scent just not the conditioner scent but I like how the product preforms so I just try to ignore it. Plus the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you after your hair dries, which I like. I&#x27;ll try to report back in the future but as I said before, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is so awesome, my hair is healthier and fuller after using the Pura d&#x27;or line. This really is a must for people with extreme hair loss. Go and buy it now!!!</li>
            <li> its has been working so far.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner as a present from my aunt, and I truly love it! Combined with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo this stuff literately works magic. My hair is beyond silky and I&#x27;ve only been hearing compliments from my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> My father has been has been using hair loss prevention products for a number of years and stumbled upon this product after using the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. He is very concerned with hair loss and this conditioner is a great compliment to the shampoo. One bottle seems to last an eternity!</li>
            <li> Used it with Pura d&#x27;or&#x27;s Gold Label shampoo and it works well to prevent hair loss and to promote hair growth. Repeat customer.</li>
            <li> After using this in conjunction to their Gold label product my hair loss has subsided and my hair is as smooth as silk. Always shinning and looking great. Pura d&#x27;or is a great product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this conditioner. The scent was very artificial. It did not do a good job of nourishing my hair or making it easy to comb through. Since I have very short hair I found this to be surprising.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week combined with the shampoo I definitely notice a difference in my hair thickness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, along with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo for over a year now &amp; have noticed less thinning on top &amp; MUCH less hair in the drain.... I&#x27;ll continue using these products!</li>
            <li> Can I just tell you how wonderful your hair will smell after you use this on your hair? Not only does it provide great moisture and care to beat up hair, but you can smell the scent on your head for up to an entire day after using this. It&#x27;s thick too, which helps with saving money. I have damaged curly hair that needs saving after 10+ years of dyeing, and this works wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair. But what really ticks me off is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work! Will not buy this product again for that reason.</li>
            <li> Reminded me of suntan lotion . Did nothing for hair</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully with the pura dor shampoo.  I leave it in my hair for a moment and then with a large toothed&lt;br /&gt;shower comb, I carefully comb my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I like this product or not. I feel like I want to use 2 pumps, but 2 might make my hair a little greasy. But, 1 pump does not feel like enough. This may be me comparing this product to traditional conditioners though. I love the smell. This is the first time I have purchased the conditioner after using the shampoo for many months. I love the shampoo and it does work. I will continue to give the conditioner a chance.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is like having a spa treatment at home. Wonderful aroma and great results on my hair. Definitely would recommend to my friends to use!</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, smells nice and brings volume to my hair (use adequate amount).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really helps hair grow but I did find that it smells delicious especially the conditioner and my hair felt very silky after. I have been using for about a month so I think maybe by three months I should have better results.</li>
            <li> After using this product I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with my hair! It is noticeably thicker, fuller looking and and my ends are smoother. I used to use Nioxin and decided to try something new, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the result as advertised.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair smooth and silky, and smells great, too! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a new user to the Pura D&#x27;or Line. I have been using it about two weeks so far. I love the scent. I really like that is organic and I am not using a bunch of harmful ingredients. Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Really work. My hair was getting thin from another shampoo I was using.  Started using Pura D&#x27;or and within a week, I could see my hair was fuller, and growing.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product sends me into a wonderful special time when someone in my life used that fragrance (lavender mixed with something).  It&#x27;s seems to work well on my hair (I have graying hair) and the product leaves it shiny &amp; beautiful.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it. but i can say that her hair looks more healthier.</li>
            <li> like the product but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a difference</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and tried the conditioner.  Love it.  Will definitely order again.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp like other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Hair feels moisturized and clean after use. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it so far....really like how it leaves my hair feeling afterwards...will continue to use...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months and absolutely love how it changed my hair. I color my hair all the time and use different styling products as well. I can tell what a difference this product did with my hair. Its so soft and looks healthy, it doesn&#x27;t look dry or washed out. I would definitely recommend this product and continue using it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells really nice.  I&#x27;m not really impressed with the product itself.  You will have to use a lot to condition your hair and it still does not feel like it coats it like a good conditioner should.  Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Smells like baby lotion and makes my hair soft and feel thicker.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner with the pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo. Its organic, so it is healthy for your scalp and so I think it also helps to slow down hair loss. I have long hair so I also use a little leave in conditioner in the ends of my hair because all of the conditioners that I have used that don&#x27;t have bad stuff in them tend to leave your hair a little drier but more healthy I think. It smells wonderful and if you let your long hair dry before brushing it, it brushes out easily. Pur d&#x27;or products are a little spendy but well worth. I have tried other brands but I come back to these ones because they are my favorite.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel fuller. i like it. it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> In just one wash with this product my hair looked shiny and beautiful. Love this product !!!</li>
            <li> Loved the shampoo .... so I decided to give the conditioner a try did not like the smell (lavender Vanilla) but did like the overall conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the conditioner would smell like the shampoo which I love.  Having said this I will still reorder these products.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and clean.  Love it with the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my hair from the very first use. I have very fine hair, and it felt fuller and softer...definitely more manageable! I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Very waxy, leaves a heavy residue or coating on the hair and not all that great a detangler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this because I&#x27;ve been looking for the shampoo and conditioner perfect for my hair and scalp. So far so good, I love the texture of my hair and my scalp is healthly and Im no loosing hair like before. Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair shiny and sleek.  And it smells beautiful!  Great paired with Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo with Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. My hair tends to frizz and this helps control that. The fragrance is a little heavy for my taste, but I will continue to use it in spite of that.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Goes with Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.</li>
            <li> as I mentioned in the review for its shampoo, increase of dandruff flakes and hair fall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in my hair loss with this shampoo. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just love the Smell... Washes nicely. This has been my regular conditioner. I&#x27;m already on my second bottle. Last pretty long... three months.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner along with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. Great combination! This conditioner makes my hair silky smooth and I even got a complement on my hair from my stylist! She asked me what products I was using and so she is now a believer as well. This is my second time buying so yes, recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect complement to the Premium Organic Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label).  This conditioner has a pleasant soft scent.  My hair seems much more manageable and healthier only after using a few times.  I love that it is organic and nourishes my damaged and over processed hair. My hair is noticeably thicker and smoother since I began using this product. So glad I discovered Pura d&#x27;or Organic Conditioner.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner brand based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and it did a good job.  My hair is very fine and conditioners tend to weight it down and cause it to be greasy.  This conditioner allowed my hair to have body still- it did not feel weighed down at all.  My hair did not get greasy and I have even been able to skip a day between shampoos (which is so much better for my hair!) It has a very light, pleasant scent that is kind of earthy.  This conditioner comes in a sturdy pump bottle that makes it easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is such an amazing experience to use purad&#x27;or company&#x27;s products and this is one of them. This is amazing conditioners I ever used. With only first use of this conditionars my hair become so smooth and silky. This product is on organic based so it doesn&#x27;t have any side effects so you can use it with confidence in your daily basis for hair conditionar needs. And I personally really like purad&#x27;or products and I will certainly Come back again for my next order. I would recommend this product to all who really wants to taking care of their hair needs. And it&#x27;s cost effective product. So I really like this product and I think everyone should have to try at least once. So I really love purad&#x27;or! Thanks purad&#x27;or!</li>
            <li> In the week I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has sprung to life! It doesn&#x27;t feel laden down with product and my professionally bleached hair actually looks natural and healthy. I love it. Both the shampoo and conditioner work well for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on great reviews. I believe it may help prevent hair loss. In the areas where my hair was thinning, the hairs started looking thicker. And overall my hair was softer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Pura D&#x27;or SHAMPOO + CONDITIONER for 2 weeks, I got this scary /bad sunburn on my scalp , few days later the sunburn I got this bad bald spot about a size of a quarter and my scalp turned reddish and I have thin hairs. This is the worst day of my life. I tried applying the aloe vera for the first few days, it help reduces the redness but the recovery speed is slow, so i decided to give Pura D&#x27;or premium Organic anti-hair loss shampoo and conditioner for a shot. I began using for about 2 weeks now. first week - My hair is fuller and some hair is growing. ( yeahhh) / 2nd week- my bald spot is covered with tiny hairs, no more bald spot. I am very excited about this !! it worked !!! these are the best products for my hairs. I love the smell of it, I feel happier and refreshing after each wash.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner as it is very light on my thinning, fine, curly hair. I also have sensitive skin, I live in a very humid climate and my hair tends to frizz by mid day. I have to get used to how light the conditioner is and leave on some after rinsing. It is very mild and has a nice scent. I think that in addition to this conditioner, I may purchase the argan oil for styling.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  The smell is amazing and my hair is so soft and not frizzy at all!!</li>
            <li> This one smell good and I can&#x27;t wait to see the result.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with the shampoo, brown and blue. It has a silky texture and smells like I am at the spa.  Even though my hairdresser told me to not use conditioner on my har because it would make it flat, I found that not to be the case with this conditioner.  My hair was fuller after using it only once.  I definitely plan to buy this again.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks I can say that the results are great. Typically when the humidity is high in my area my hair takes a mind of it&#x27;s own and seems to go haywire with frizz and no control what so ever. After using this product my hair is much more manageable and feels extremely smooth and silky. Even on high humidity days, I have better control over how my hair looks and it definitely keeps the frizz down. Being that it has all organic ingredients I had to give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really work in few days on my hair.&lt;br /&gt; I love it and I will buy it again and again</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair feeling fuller, stronger, and healthier! Even with blow drying, straightening, nod curling I feel like this conditioner really protects my hair from heat and makes me able to go longer in between hair cuts</li>
            <li> pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner have both been amazing for my fine hair. I have LITTLE hair loss daily. I have used it for several months a like how the conditioner is not heavy and works well for daily use. I will continue to buy this. It is a little pricey but worth it. Gentle, yet effective and it probably has been the best thing for my fine slow growing hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  My hair was pretty dull and now it is regaining its shine (after having two kids).</li>
            <li> it seems pretty good！</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.  The product does NOT seem to do much of anything for my shoulder length hair.  Getting poor results (Tangled hair, no shine, and dryness) with first use, I thought perhaps I was not using enough, so I tripled the amount used.  Still no results.  My hair is very tangled and dry feeling after use.  I also bought the &#x27;matching&#x27; shampoo for hair retention/growth and it smells awful.  Very Disappointed. Will not purchase either in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for almost two weeks now and I am still on the fence. I have the shampoo as well and absolutely love it. I was expecting to have soft, silky hair with the conditioner.. I still have to use a leave in after so that my hair will not be as dry.</li>
            <li> This conditioner work great for African American with natural hair. It does what it says, it makes your hair soft within mins</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully with the pura d or shampoo. This conditioner is smooth and you can just feel how conditioned your hair is.  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It thoroughly conditions my hair without leaving it feeling heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair looks amazing since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I really like the results of using this product. Just two pumps, smooth it on and comb it through. I like to let it set while in the shower while I shave. One quick rinse at the end of the shower will do it nicely. The pump bottle is convenient and easy to use. I like it!</li>
            <li> When you have it on your hair, you will instantly know it&#x27;s a premium product. Usually when you use cheap conditioner, it leaves a foul smell will taking forever to have water rinsing through completely. This organic conditioner has a creamy feel and high end texture that will leave you hair fresh and clean. I had oily hair, so this completely retexture my hair. I also stop losing hair after using for a week now. Recommend it. Especially for people with oily hair and loss of hair.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a little over a week ago. I like the smell of the conditioner and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a couple of weeks. I use one pump, and I can&#x27;t believe how clean and thick it leaves my hair. them smell is great, it smells like coconuts and lotion.  I once had conditioner in Hawaii and it smelled very much like this.  So if you like the tropics your gonna like this!  I really like how easy it is to comb with little sculpting product. It has cured my dandruff too!I wish they made and hair gel as well. I will follow up in a few months to see if the hair growth worked as well.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a hair loss prevention shampoo from the same company.  They are both expensive.  This conditioner does have a fantasic calming scent.  It works well and I am able to comb easily through my hair after showering.  My only complaints is the price and when I received it the bottle top was open and some leaked in the box.  Amazon resolved the issue though.</li>
            <li> This is a truly wonderful organic conditioner that leaves my hair silky smooth after using the accompanying shampoo. It has a pleasant smell that lingers until the next washing.</li>
            <li> Two years ago I had a bad bought of seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp followed my an infection from what I can only presume were less than sanitary practices of a hair braider.  All of that trauma on my scalp coupled with the harshness of the prescription oil, shampoo, and antibiotics left my scalp healed but with bald patches.  My temples and nape were ravaged.  I then resorted to going natural as I was then afraid to have any chemicals touch my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo Brown and Blue and Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Argan Oil Conditioner  two months ago here on Amazon and gave it a shot based on the reviews.  I fell in love after the first shampoo.  My natural hair was soft and easy to manage after using it, so much so that it reminded me of my previously relaxed hair.  I resumed relaxing my hair two and a half weeks ago.  What an amazing find!  My relaxed hair responds equally as well.  I shampooed and conditioned my hair a week after the relaxer and my hair was just as soft and beautiful as when the salon products were used, only this product is organic and oh so good for my hair and scalp.  Both my temples and nape are filling in slowly but surely (Yay!!! progress is better than no)  I so look forward to providing additonal review updates on the growth of my hair; as I notice a measurable difference in the texture and elasticity overall and growth and/or fuzz in the spots where I&#x27;d thought my scalp was so damaged no hair would regrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying this is snake oil that will regrow your hair.  What I am saying is that it promotes healthy scalp resulting in an environment primed for grow with a good hair care regime.  Being a natural also taught me the importance of treating my hair as delicately as I would silk so my hair care practices are meticulous and I take my time  which is paying off with the help, of these products (blue label shampoo and conditioner, biotin supplement 5,000 mg).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.  I love my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;(I am also using extra dark Jamaican Black Castor Oil, shampooing and hair steam deep conditioning weekly.  I have also incorporated a 5 in 1 reconstructor every other week for the next month or two since I relaxed my hair).  I also do avocado and coconut oil pre shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted this same review on the shampoo, since it was a team effort.e my hair again.

            <li> Great compliment to the pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo as it keeps your hair feeling hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li> Been using this product daily for the past four months in conjunction with Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo. This is a good quality conditioner. Leaves my hair well hydrated and manageable. Nice scent too. Will continue purchasing/using.</li>
            <li> I have been use it for a couple of years. It still amazes me. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, along with the Hair Loss Prevention shampoo, for about 6 months now.  I am a 25 year old male and have a receding hairline along with thinning hair on the top of my head.  Before using these products my hair was constantly falling out, but now my hair seems to be quite a bit stronger and thicker than before. I&#x27;ve tried a few different &amp;#34;hair thickening/hair loss prevention&amp;#34; products and I will definitely continue to use this one.  I actually like the scent of it as well, it&#x27;s very subtle, but it smells a bit like &amp;#34;Play-doh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week now. I love the fragrance. Leaves my hair feeling soft. Will update review in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> horrible ! i bought this product based on the good reviews on here .&lt;br /&gt;the minute it touched my hair it felt dry and lifeless, i do not recommend this product for dyed hair, or any kind of hair for that matter</li>
            <li> SO disappointed in this product.  ANY time I use a conditioner, my comb will just glide through my hair without any tangles.  When I DON&#x27;T use a conditioner, I spray my hair with a detangler &amp;#34;leave-in conditioner&amp;#34;, wait about 5 minutes, and then THAT will allow me to comb my hair without any tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But THIS conditioner made a MESS of my hair!!  Terrible tangles so bad that it was a major struggle to comb my hair after my shower...that NEVER happens when I use other conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, I thought if I sprayed on the leave-in conditioner (after using this conditioner), THEN I would be able to comb it without problems.  WRONG!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t continue to use it as it&#x27;s defeating the purpose of trying to keep hair from shedding.</li>
            <li> Great product! Organic and it smells great. I can already see a big diffence in my hair.</li>
            <li> best product since sliced bread</li>
            <li> I like this better than my other conditioner. This will be what I use from now on. Three more words</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was looking for a product to help my hair grow quicker and i found that this product did that and more! It left my hair feeling soft and silky and looking shiny, all while smelling great.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and I love to shop organic hair products.  After I tried this conditioner, my hair becomes soft and shiny. The only one thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle.  I need to pump a few times to get the liquid out. Otherwise, I would give it a 5-star</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organic product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, does the job and smells nice.  I really have been enjoying this product and I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> this conditioner was amazing and stopped my hair loss and breakage.</li>
            <li> I had surgery a year ago, my hair started to fall out because of all the medicine I was on, looked into this wonderful  shampoo Pura  d&#x27;or and it saved me!! the loss of my hair started to lessen and the it got thick again!!! I love this product and suggest it to everyone, told my hairdresser all about it also!! Pass the word.</li>
            <li> I am using the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Conditioner for six month now and can honestly state that&lt;br /&gt;this is the best conditioner I have ever used. The benefit of using this organic product is that it&lt;br /&gt;does not contain any harsh chemicals and nourishes hair and scalp.  Since I started using this&lt;br /&gt;product my hair has become smooth and shiny and very manageable and my dry scalp is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this product and highly recommend it to anyone that likes to improve&lt;br /&gt;the texture and look of their hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It makes my hair so shiny and lush. It also adds so much volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has some magic in it. I have been using different kind of shampoo and conditioners before but after using this product my hair became very soft. I would defintely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been weeks and my hair feels so good , soft and fuller! I have very thin, fine naturally curly hair. the curl is comming back to healthy n shinny! no frizzies! no residue left on my hair...I like this stuff a lot so far!A+++</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner. after the first use my hair felt soft. I also started to see less hair fall out. This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Has been about a week since I started using this product and I can already see changes in more hair growth and less hair loss.</li>
            <li> First time using this brand. I have long, thick, wavy hair that frizzes. The conditioner leaves my hair soft and adds some shine, not a lot, but it&#x27;s natural looking. The consistency is nice, doesn&#x27;t run off until I rinse. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I just started using it, but I like it so far. I&#x27;ve used their shampoo for about 6 months &amp; really like that product.</li>
            <li> Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a skeptic about hair loss treatments and it&#x27;s hard for me to admit that I actually think this conditioner/shampoo pair works. Though I know a lot of my hair fall is due to stress and managing my stress is probably the best hair loss prevention for me, this is this first product that I&#x27;ve noticed less hair fall while showering throughout my cycles of stress. Regardless of it&#x27;s effectiveness at preventing hair loss, it&#x27;s also just a great conditioner overall. It&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals, smells good, and the dispenser is great! I&#x27;ll be sticking with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner along with the shampoo and the results are amazing. My hair is softer, cleaner, and fuller. The smell is also amazing. The combination of the two have halted my hair loss and thinning hair, so I highly recommend giving it a try. The price is totally worth it because you only need a small amount of the product as opposed to using a large amount of another product.  I also love that it&#x27;s organic and contains argan oil.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, lathers well. My hair fall has reduced but not completely stopped. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now &amp; plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used!!! It is also the priciest, but I love that it has all natural and organic ingredients. It makes my hair feel amazingly soft. Plus, the scent is nice, but I don&#x27;t smell it throughout the day. This is critical to me because I have an extremely sensitive sense of smell and I am unable to use some hair products since the smell lingers throughout the day and I get migraines from the strong scents. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how many pumps I need. I seem to be doing okay with seven. My hair is down to my waist, curly, and thick. I would imagine people with shorter hair would need much less. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel silky soft, but it does feel softer than it&#x27;s felt in a long time. I will continue to buy this brand! :)</li>
            <li> Bought the Pura d&#x27;or Gold and was very happy with the order entry and the quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The product seems of very high quality and I&#x27;ve been using it every day.&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes out great and now I&#x27;ll just wait for the results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep you posted and go to 5 stars if I end up with more hair</li>
            <li> Even though this conditioner is not as moisturizing as I would like it to be, it still helped with keeping my hair from feeling grassy. It also has a nice scent to it and gives my hair more volume.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for 2 weeks now. First thing I noticed was the very pleasant scent.  It left my hair very manageable, feeling really soft and full of body.  This product is very gentle to your hair, unlike other regular conditioner which has artificial ingridients. This conditioner all natural, organic. I will continue to use the product going forward.  The product is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!! I&#x27;ve been experiencing falling hair for several months (more than 50 strands a day) and tried everything. Nothing worked except Pura D&#x27;or. The falling hair literally stopped! And the regrowth is so noticeable!</li>
            <li> best conditioner to use after same Brand shampoo , love the fragrance ........my hairs are less frizzy after using it ....and leaves a shine , must use product no chemical harshness all natural as per ingridiants</li>
            <li> Not expensive when you finally see how long it lasts. I am just now buying my second bottle in August and I originally purchased it in January. Smells great and I beleive it works when it&#x27;s apart of a regimen. The shampoo, the conditioner, rogaine, and biotin. My bald spot has gotten significantly better. Also smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to write this review because I wanted to give the product months and months to show any benefit. It has not made a significant difference in my hair quality, hair strength, hair loss/thinning, or hair growth. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I&#x27;m finished with it but it just doesn&#x27;t seem worth the cost when I can get more shampoo and conditioner twice the size and half the cost.</li>
            <li> I loved this conditioner. Was great for adding moisture but not oily. I recommend for a good value and quality.</li>
            <li> Goes well with shampoo. Hair now feels shiny and healthy . Less hair shedding too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably start using it to shave my legs with it.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> I received pura d&#x27;por as a gift from my older brother for my 30th birthday. I have been using it for a little over a week and I can say it is the best shampoo I have ever used. I would recommend to everyone. -David.</li>
            <li> It is natural, I like it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I can already tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this conditioner. I think it&#x27;s nice, but I think I need a little more use before deciding that this will be my conditioner for life. I like for my hair to feel soft when being conditioned. This makes my hair feel &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; soft. Not as soft as I like it to make me feel like it&#x27;s really working. I don&#x27;t wash my hair with shampoo&#x27;s. I only condition. I mostly use cleansing conditioners and decided to try this because I really like the argan oil that this company makes. Overall, not bad, but not the greatest for my hair......so far:-)</li>
            <li> I love the feel and the smell of my hair, not to mention that my hair is really easy to manage now!!</li>
            <li> Nice , leaves good texture n hair, organic and not harmfull for hair</li>
            <li> My hair is getting thinner since I am in 30&#x27;s. It is kind of scary to me. I started to use this conditioner with Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo 1 month ago. After the first time use, I found the hair in my bathroom is much more less than before. I use it every 2 or 3 days, and I feel the shampoo and the conditioner working well together. I will use them longer time to see if I can keep my hair more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner to go along with Pura&#x27;s organic hair loss shampoo, and I&#x27;m glad I did!!  It controls my flyaways, and my hair is more manageable.  Plus, the pleasant fragrance us a bonus!  I will definitely continue this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great for my hair.</li>
            <li> The outcome is what you would expect from a conditioner and I definitely recommend pairing this with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo.  The shampoo on it&#x27;s own will leave your hair feeling neglected and stressed.  My only complaint is that this has a very plain fragrance.  Think vanilla hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Used along with the shampoo and did see an improvement with less hair fall compared to Enjoy, Nioxin and Satinique.</li>
            <li> I just finished a bottle of the conditioner and shampoo.  I noticed that I&#x27;m losing less hair, my hair is shinier, and feels healthier.  The smell after is great as well.  Will update my review if anything should change.</li>
            <li> After a week my hair does feel thicker.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this company for a couple of years now so I decided to try their conditioner. I have very long and thick hair and it get tangly so fast. Ever since I&#x27;ve been using their conditioner my hair has been much softer and much more easy to manage. This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now. I can&#x27;t say i have more hair or anything like that but it is true my hair is not falling like before and the fact that I am buying it again says a lot, since it is not cheap. I am using it with the Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I just love that, and the fact that it is an organic product. I do like the smell and I do not like that much the dispenser system which sometimes gets stuck and is not easy to press down, but I think this is really not as important for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product - all organic, no artificial colors, fragrances or parabens. My hair smells great and feels moisturized! Would definitely recommend it and purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the very best conditioner I have ever purchased.  What is not to love about this conditioner?  I was extremely skeptical about the claims, but make no mistake, Pura d&#x27;or is very different from all of the others.  The smell is wonderful.  But what is even better is the condition of my hair after use.  My hair is full, shiny and more manageable, softer than I can remember in a long, long time.  Forget all of those post-blow drying products too.  Nothing else is needed.  I will be using only Pura d&#x27;or from here on out.  And I am looking forward to trying out the rest of their line.  Wonderful stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! Iove it my hair feels amazing and within the week I can feel new hair growing!!</li>
            <li> I got it last weekend , and use 2 times,feel good,my hair feel more smooth than i use other conditioner.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s odd about this conditioner is the scent.  The ingredients look all natural but the scent of the conditioner is strongly reminiscent of Johnson&#x27;s baby oil.  Also, the scent of the conditioner is completely different from the scent of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo/conditioner left my hair feeling sticky/dry and difficult to get a comb through after showering.  (Aveda hair loss shampoo left my hair feeling the same way).  I also noticed no change in hair growth after 8 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:&lt;br /&gt;After about 8 weeks of use of this shampoo and conditioner, I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my hair loss so I decided to go all natural with hair care.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this shampoo was all natural, but have since learned that any shampoo that foams/lathers contains some form of SLS (in this case cocamide) and strips the hair of all moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Morrocco Method shampoos for about two months, shampooing much less (twice a week), have used the hair detox 3 times and am using the scalp massager daily and brushing with a Mason Pearson brush.  I&#x27;m happy to say I now have lots of new hair growth!  Yea!!</li>
            <li> Using this in conjunction with Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo not only makes my scalp feel great but my skin as well. As I grow older I find that my skin has become overly sensitive to many chemicals, specifically many of them which are being used in health/beauty products (the irony). With the myriad of illnesses attributed to the toxins and chemicals we encounter on a daily basis, it’s great to find products that not only work great but are safe to use as well. GREAT PRODUCT!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought both shampoo and conditioner  after using it for a few times I notice my hair is much more healthier, softer and smoother.  I like this product so much. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product. The scent is not particularly nice- smells a bit like baby wipes. I have long hair and the conditioner did not leave hair easy to comb, but once combed and dry my hair is shiny and soft and seems much more manageable than previously. I do like the final results, though I wish the scent was just lavender or even a rosemary mint such as Aveda has that I really like.</li>
            <li> I was always the guy that used the generic whatever brand conditioner. I always buzzed cut my hair so didn&#x27;t think it mattered. I can honestly say my hair has never felt so soft. Also its more shiny. Tip: follow the instructions and let it sit in and absorb for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried many before and none of them have the effect this does. It leaves my hair smooth and very easy to manage. This along with its partner shampoo are very effective at stopping hair growth. I&#x27;ve had hair fall for about an year while I tried many different shampoos and conditioners but to no avail. This tended to be slightly out of my price range but decided to give it a shot anyway, having read all the positive reviews. And man was that a good decision!</li>
            <li> smells so good!!! After using this conditioner, my hair is not as dry as before!</li>
            <li> After I started using it, I understand the benefit at the first time. I didn&#x27;t find (feel) my hair growing but looks more value. I think because less hair loss. Making hair grow more is very scientific topic and technical problem. This product can make hair less loss is very good step up. Big thumb up! I plan to purchase it as my daily hair care.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using Pura d&#x27;or anti-hairloss shampoo, I HIGHLY recommend that you use their conditioner as well. Since the shampoo is organic, I figure that it&#x27;s best that my conditioner is organic as well, right? I first started using the anti-hairloss shampoo without the conditioner and it left my hair a little dry and brittle. I felt like some hair might have been falling out for that reason. But since I started using the conditioner, it&#x27;s not a problem anymore. The conditioner does smell nice and it does leave your hair looking softer, nicer, and more natural. But seriously, don&#x27;t use the anti-hairloss shampoo without conditioner.</li>
            <li> For 2-3 years I&#x27;ve started having problems with my hair - thinning, lots of hair falling out, and having trouble growing it long again after I last cut it to a bob length 3 years ago. I started experimenting with expensive branded products 1 year ago and nothing has really worked. My hair was still falling out, growing very slowly, and was a bit unruly. (I have straight hair but at a certain length it starts to &amp;#34;flip out&amp;#34; and becomes hard to style). I just started using the Gold Label shampoo together with the Premium Organic conditioner. It&#x27;s making a difference right away. My hair is still falling out in the shower in similar quantities as before, but each time I wash my hair with Pura d&#x27;or products my hair looks fuller, straighter, and less unruly when it dries. I also use a bit of the Argan oil on my scalp and face, which is pretty awesome - my hair looks super dark and shiny after the oil but not weighed down, and my skin literally &amp;#34;glows&amp;#34; all day. I have high hopes for how things will improve with continued use!</li>
            <li> I bought the conditioner and I really like it but unfortunately,  I have to use enough of it to condition my hair to get the softness and to be able to comb it through without loosing lots of hair. I will continue using it however, I&#x27;m hoping that it will help my hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> My hair has been noticeably thinning for the past few years, so I&#x27;ve been searching for a shampoo and conditioner to help stop hair loss. The Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner work. They leave my hair feeling thicker and healthier. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for hair loss, and none of them can compare to the Pura d&#x27;or products. A little of the shampoo and conditioner go a long way, so they last a while, and they smell great. I can already see a tremendous difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast. Smells like there is not artificial fragrance. very smoothy when used. even just used once, there was less hair loss. looking forward to try the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Mine came with a broken top on the bottle, but seems to do its job. Takes me 10 pumps of the conditioner to 1 pump shampoo to saturate my hair, but my hair is also very long &amp; damaged. I like the product results so far.</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and feeling like there is residue on my scalp.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks now and I noticed that my hair is breaking less so I&#x27;m happy so far!  I have a very sensitive scalp and I guess it&#x27;s the organic ingredients that makes the difference.  Great conditioner!  Only one I don&#x27;t love about it, the scent does not smell like &amp;#34;lavender and vanilla&amp;#34;, its more like a lavender and almond.</li>
            <li> This conditioner hydrates your hair and scalp without the harsh chemical SLS and without paraben preservatives. This product also contains argan oil, which has helped strengthen my hair tremendously. An added bonus: this is the best smelling conditioner I have EVER used!</li>
            <li> The product does make my hair appear fuller but it makes it very dry.  I guess that is the tradeoff since this is the only product that really makes a big difference in the volume of my hair.  I use a heavy duty conditioning treatment to help style my hair and it looks great.  Plan on using it forever!</li>
            <li> Combined with the Shampoo, it really works, and it has a nice smell</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results I have seen by using both the shampoo and conditioner.  Due to medical reasons my hair began to fall out by the handful.  The texture of my hair changed to very dry, limp and fine.  After using this conditioner along with the shampoo, I have noticed a big change in texture and fall-out appears to have slowed down dramatically.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this 2 stars because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Very fragrant, smells great..&lt;br /&gt;But it did not improve my hair, and it made my hair so squeeky clean, it was horrible to comb out...&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed..OCT Garnier works much better, at much lower price...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner! It makes my hair silky, soft, and un-frizzy without a buildup of gunk.  I don&#x27;t need to use any other products on my hair.  Since there is no heavy buildup, my hair is back to it&#x27;s natural wavy-ness.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it in place if shampoo.  I like the smell and it seems to really be gentle on my hair and scalp</li>
            <li> The lavender smells very pleasant. I just had my hair permed so it&#x27;s very dry. I feel that this doesn&#x27;t condition my hair we&#x27;ll enough. It should be better on normal straight hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so good! It leaves ur hair soft and shiny! It&#x27;s great for both men and women and it&#x27;s all natural with no crazy chemicals that just mess up your hair! I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> It helps reduce hair loss and I love it&#x27;s smell too</li>
            <li> I use this product with the Pura d&#x27;or Brown and Blue Shampoo. I love it! It makes my hair feel soft and I really like the smell. Big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I used it a few times after I received it. It feels good and has a pleasant smell. Like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loosing hair for sometime now, and have tried everything to help with this horrible problem.. Found our Pura d&#x27; or shampoo and conditioner and I am starting to notice a difference in my hair, I&#x27;m not loosing as much hair now, and my hair is getting thicker! I will continue to buy this product</li>
            <li> For those who are not sure whether to use this product or the Aveda Invanti 3-Step system, my pros and cons are provided below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveda Invanti 3-Step System - Very good smell, only need to use just a little bit of both the shampoo and conditioner and they lather pretty well using the palm of my hand without too much effort. The entire system does wonder for the look and feel of hair, makes hair look healthier, soft and shiny. I purchased the system (shampoo, conditioner and revitalizer), very expensive at $116 and the entire system lasted me about 3 months for the main purpose of preventing hair loss / enducing hair growth. I initially noticed less hair falling off but about 2 - 3 months after use (everyday showering), the amount of hair I lost was about the same, if not more, comparing to before I started using the system. That was when I decided to switch to Pura based on the reviews I see online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura - Comparing to Invati, the conditioner has equally nice smell, this one more manmade smell than the Invanti as the Invanti has ginsense smell.  The shampoo however has a very strong chemical spell in my opinion.  I use about three pumps for the shampoo in order to get it to lather up.  The trick is to use my palm and massage it quickly without stopping.  I use about two pumps for the conditioner to have a decent smoothness.  However, I did notice that using 3 or more pumps of the conditioner makes my hair a lot nicer and softer.  I&#x27;ve been using the product since December 2, 2014 and have noticed less hair loss. My hair seems thicker and fuller. I haven&#x27;t really looked closely to see if I see any baby hair growing (according to most of the reviews) but I feel my tiny bald spot is somewhat covered now. My hair definitly has grown a lot longer so I take that the product is working as advertised. I shower in the morning and sometimes I wash off the shampoo and conditioner in less than the recommended amount of time needed for the product to work asintended. Will have to try a bit harder to leave them on longer but I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s so far working better than Invanti. The price is much better as well. Will provide update by the time I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was noticing a lot more hair loss than normal lately. Started using this shampoo and conditioner a month ago and love it!  My hair has stopped falling out and is so much healthier.  Shampoo and conditioner smell great and a little shampoo goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product, hightly recommend. Work well.</li>
            <li> The Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Conditioner works as well as my regular commercially marketed brand when it comes to hair softness and manageability but without the harsh and other unknown chemicals.  The creamy texture and very mild scent certainly are plus factors that make this purchase an excellent one.</li>
            <li> With great shampoo, must come great conditioner – I really like this conditioner as it makes my hair so much softer and easy to comb.  I have a shoulder-length hair and I do not even need to pump a lot.  What I like, using both shampoo and conditioner together, they tame my frizzy hair as well. ;-)</li>
            <li> I first purchased this after being on the search for an organic hair set of shampoo and conditioners. I am impressed after the first usage - my hair indeed moisturized and felt soft. The conditioner does that rare task of conditioning really well, without leaving a coating; it rinses cleanly and feels very smooth. I love the lavender-vinalla scent as well. Looks like I&#x27;ve finally found the &amp;#34;eco&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo gold and the conditioner to go with it. I do highland recommend the conditioner. This conditioner helped bring back the moister to my hair. and also my hair is dull from coloring it so much and since I  used this product the color has more shine to it. I highly recommend and worth every penny spent. Love this product.</li>
            <li> great shampoo.stopped my hairloss in 1 week.love it.highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Usually I rec many compliments on my hair even tho it has thinned with age.  Since using Pura d&#x27;or, my hair has dulled considerable dried out.  It does nothing positive for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I question the accuracy of the many positive reviews because of the offer for free conditioner if a positive review is written.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner, especially after using the Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic shampoo.  Since the shampoo works well but doesn&#x27;t smell like fruit or flowers or perfume, using this silky conditioner -- that smells like lovely lavender -- afterwards makes my hair both feel and smell great.  The combination of the two products has improved my hair in look, feel, and keeps the color vibrant longer.  I use the product according to the directions.    Recommended!</li>
            <li> Quality Product and has a pleasant aroma.  The bottle coming with a pump is genius!</li>
            <li> Love all the products of this company.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first time leaving a comment on a product but to my surprise, this product actually worked for me! I was losing hair like you wouldnt believe and I had no idea why. Showering, brushing my hair, straightening or curling it would always end with me standing in a pool of my hair on the floor. It was incredibly depressing but now I can easily say I dont worry about how hard I brush my hair or how fast I curl or straighten because I know my hair is stronger and healthier. I use the shampoo and conditioner together every single time I shower. No more drugstore products with all those terrible chemicals. If I dont leave the conditioner in long enough in the shower, my hair becomes a little harder to brush but I always always use a heat protectant oil which does a great job at softening before I brush. Good luck to all of you with the same issue I had.</li>
            <li> probably a good product for someone who doesn&#x27;t have fine, thin hair.  did not do much for mine.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pura D&#x27;or Shampoo and Conditioner for a month now.  You can tell the shampoo washes out nicely and leave behind a nice clean feeling.  The conditioner is equally good and leaves my hair easy to manage and smells nice.  I can tell it is a well made product without any harmful fillers.  My hair loss it getting better.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioner I have used. Hair feel really silky</li>
            <li> It has only been about 4 weeks but the product appears to be working well. I am using it in conjunction with the Purador shampoo as well as taking nutritional supplements, so it&#x27;s difficult to tie results to this specific product. But the conjunctive therapy has increased shine, strength, and density. Conversely, my hair does feel dry at times, although that could be due to a number of external factors (weather, shower water too hot, shampoo frequency, dehydration, etc.). Overall I&#x27;m very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> male, mid 30&#x27;s, use this conditioner along with the gold label shampoo, and I really like this product.  Can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s hair regrowth abilities, but it has a great scent, which helps eliminate the gold labels&#x27; strong scent btw, and it washes out easier than most conditioners and leaves my hair felling less dry and fuller/thicker. part of my day to day routine, hopefully the benefits will continue</li>
            <li> Pump handle wouldn&#x27;t work, otherwise great product. It&#x27;s frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> I really like it!!.... I believe it does work to prevent loss heir.</li>
            <li> Great product. A bit more on the costly side but the bottle lasts a long time. I originally made this purchase for myself but now use it for my young daughters as well.  The smell is very pleasant and we love that we are using an organic product.</li>
            <li> I have Thick but fine hair which is wavy and sometimes frizzy.  My hair is very temperamental and what i use on it really effects the way it will style.  So far after a couple of uses this conditioner has Left my hair shiny and soft, very easy to comb through my hair but the smell is just OK.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which i like, will continue use to see its benefits in the long term</li>
            <li> If I could give a -0 I would.. Do NOT BUY. They lie and do not honor their promises. This stuff is junk ! Waste of money 1</li>
            <li> Love this product along with Shampoo.  After 2 weeks I noticed less hair fallout.  I&#x27;ve tried many other products and totally impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I love the texture and the smell, and I *think* that less hair is ending up in my brush or on the shower floor. I will update this review after I have used it all up.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo for Hair Loss first and followed it with the conditioner and loved the way my hair felt after rinsing it off. I followed with styling with a hair dryer...my hair looked awesome. It feels very full.</li>
            <li> Very good!!! I love this product, i tried it and loved it from first use. It gives nice shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product for couple weeks. I do not feel different from the other brand I had before. The shampoo does not prevent my hair lose also.</li>
            <li> great!wonderful stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product!  I bought it along with the shampoo. I have just started using it and cannot wait to see the results!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. I have been use for a week and half now. The best way to use leave it on for 10 mins. You will see the result. Not much hair losing anymore.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!  I have ordered the Purador shampoo and conditioner and am totally happy with both.  Having a product that is organic, while providing a superior feeling of clean and conditioning to my hair, is worth every cent!!  Thank you for such a wonderful organic product.</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product</li>
            <li> Great item! Quick delivery</li>
            <li> The conditioner works well with its paired shampoo. I was worrying that I would not like the scent but it turned out it smells sweet and good. It is moisturizing and has effect in reducing hair loss. I would recommend it unless your hair is too dry or damaged. Otherwise it will work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;LL ADMIT THE SHAMPOO DOES NOT SMELL NICE, BUT IT IS WORKING AND THAT&#x27;S WHAT YOU WANT.  IT LATHERS NICE, RINSES CLEAN AND I&#x27;VE DEFINATELY SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR SHEDDING.  THE HAIR CONDITIONER SMELLS JUST LIKE JOHNSON&#x27;S BABY LOTION.  IT&#x27;S A NICE FRAGRANCE AND IS A LIGHT CONDITIONER.  IT DOESN&#x27;T WEIGH YOUR HAIR DOWN AND MOISTURIZES JUST ENOUGH.  MY HAIR FEELS &amp; LOOKS THICKER AND IS SOFT TO THE TOUCH.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell, smells like vanilla and leaves my hair soft with a nice touch. I recommend to anybody its amazing</li>
            <li> I had been using Pura D&#x27;or gold shampoo for about three weeks before I purchased the conditioner. As the shampoo is a bit pricey I decided to wait to see if I liked it. I have stuggled with thinning hair for the past 5 years or so since I reached a certain age. For me the shampoo definitely needs a conditoner. This is a good conditoner. It is not extremely moisturizing but great for me on most days. I am an everyday hair washer so my hair can get drier on the ends. I had been regularly applying a leave in mist before I started these products and I kept up with that. Just me. There is no overpowering smell for this conditoner. Reminds me of baby power. I am attaching pictures of my journey. The first is before beginning Pura D&#x27;or, the second after three months, the last two were taken 6 months afterward. Today 7/3/2015! The last photo is how I wear my hair. No more too short bangs, no more wisps of hair sticking up making a weird side part. Just nice, normal hair!!!! Feels sooooo good!&lt;br /&gt;ONE YEAR UPDATE! Jan, 2016. My hair has gotten used to using this conditioner which has no silicones. Along with significantly reduced hairloss, my hair and is now lively and shiny, too.  I was so used to the slickness of silicones both in my shampoo and conditioning product that I had no idea how natural, clean hair felt. I was washing the life and lustre out of my hair and trying to replace them with chemicals which only accumulated on the hair shaft and made it worse!!! Now, I can wash my hair ever other day, except in extreme heat. I have also learned that silicones can build up and also lead to hairloss. So it is a reason to keep using Pura D&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner or at least products that are silicone free. I have left a review for the Pura D&#x27;or Gold Label shampoo if you would like to check it out. Please click the button if this has been helpful to you! If you have questions please write to me!!!! I have included a new picture to show you how nice my hair looks now. Very last picture is second day wash. Just water, this conditioner, wait 2 minutes and rinse.ry last picture is second day wash. Just water, this conditioner, wait 2 minutes and rinse.</li>
            <li> smells very relaxing and isnt super thick like other conditioners</li>
            <li> Smell great. Makes my hair feel so soft! Love it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product . My hair looks soft and thicker after few weeks. Love it.</li>
            <li> Likes the product as it makes my hair feel soft and feel thick. Not sure if it helps on hair loss but it gives me dandruff. All in all the product is comparable to Ultrax conditioner.</li>
            <li> This condition made my hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> This produce works well to detangle my hair and I appreciate the fact that it does not have the poisonous additives that most conditioners do. Overall, good results for my hair.</li>
            <li> Has been a great product, smells good &amp; does not leave a film or a heaviness to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far this conditioner has been wonderful. It smells wonderful and leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife was losing lots of hair every day. Even when she was sleeping she was losing hair. She was very worried and one day I saw a friend of mine using this shampoo, he recommended me to buy Pura Dor Shampoo and Conditioner. Therefore I bought it and we can see the difference even in first week of using this shampoo and conditioner. Therefore I recommend this shampoo if you are having hair loss.</li>
            <li> Smells and works great with the shampoo</li>
            <li> I have bought this conditioner with the hair loss prevention organic shampoo a week ago.  My hair is silky soft, hydrated, and fuller.  Smells wonderful as well.  You really don&#x27;t need much, just a dab.  I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has come to me just in the nick of time. My hair was so damaged and frizy and nothing worked. Now I use the hair loss prevention shampoo followed by this conditioner and I have never been happier with a hair care product. Just read the ingredients you know you are getting some good stuff. I would recommend this conditioner for all hair types and for anyone looking for beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for the last 3 years and there is reason why that has been the case. My hair loss has been arrested. Their premium shampoo works well with the conditioner. What I found to be even more helpful to my hair is to apply some coconut oil prior to a shower. Allow the scalp to soak in the coconut oil and then use the Pure d&#x27;or Shampoo and Conditioner to wash the hair off. I found this to help enhance the effect this shampoo and conditioner has on my hair. Constant use of this shampoo and conditioner has helped eliminate dandruff problem which I have been battling for more than a decade and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching for a good shampoo and conditioner for quite sometime before I had decided on this. Though this might be on the pricier side but it is worth every penny if you want to keep your hair :)</li>
            <li> Free of SLS.  Lathers nicely and a good value for a premium hair product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very nice, it smells good and leaves your hair super soft.. I use it with the Pura D&#x27;Or Shampoo and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week since I started using this Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is falling off much less and I noticed that I am having more volume when I dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using conditioner about two weeks.  Hair seems to be a little more shinier.  No major signs of hair growth yet</li>
            <li> I have allergic reactions to regular shampoos and conditions, and was looking for chemical free products. This is not 100% natural (99%), but has good reviews, so I decided to try both shampoo and conditioner of this brand.  My hair is very dry, and I wished this conditioner helps to moisturize my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I assume this contains much less chemicals, so less moisturizer agents. I need to use some oil to make my hair smooth after conditioner.  But I don&#x27;t get allergic reaction, which is most important for me, so I will  keep using it.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. All natural ingredients. Easy to apply and wash off. great effect lasting the whole day</li>
            <li> BEST SMELL EVER. I love this conditioner. I came across this shampoo when I was looking for all natural shampoos &amp; conditioners. It makes my hair soft and smells amazing. I have noticed less hair fall after using this conditioner with Dandruff shampoo of same brand.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and/or conditioner caused a serious rash on my scalp and neck, verified by my dermatologist. I used it for 3 weeks, and what started as a tingling on my scalp (&amp;#34;it&#x27;s working!&amp;#34;) was actually the beginning of a month&#x27;s-long rash that ultimately became infected. I&#x27;m vegetarian and in excellent health, but as the doctor was including &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;Or&amp;#34; in his notes, he said, &amp;#34;This conditioner may be &#x27;organic&#x27;, but then again, so is poison ivy!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write reviews, but I felt obliged to warn potential customers.</li>
            <li> Awesome conditioner! Due to my frequent visits to the hair salon and use of flat iron, my hair had become dry, damaged, and frizzy. This conditioner has helped made my hair more manageable. I love the smell! And, it&#x27;s reasonably priced. I recommend this product to those who are struggling with dry, damaged, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner. I went low-poo about six months ago and have been looking for a fully natural product. I use JR Liggett&#x27;s Coconut and Argan Oil shampoo bar and follow it up with this now, after the DevaCurl One Condition conditioner fried my hair (bad product).  Using these products, I now only have to wash my hair once or twice per week. My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily anymore!</li>
            <li> Fabulous for delicate damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the conditioner to compliment my purchase of the Anti-Hair Loss shampoo and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this conditioner. I especially love the aroma therapy effect it has right before I go to bed with the lavender and vanilla scent lingering helps me go to sleep and my hair has never felt softer or looked better. Pura D&#x27;or makes spectacular products and I&#x27;m thrilled to have been referred to them.</li>
            <li> Like the smell and leaves my hair soft!, I only have been using for 2 weeks but I like the results.</li>
            <li> I successfully purchased &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;or: Premium Hair Loss Prevention Organic Shampoo&amp;#34; so I of course bought this conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love this smell. Very clean but it is a bit dry than I thought but hey, this is organic and after dry my hair, my hair stays so much better than before. So I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> Allergic reaction, had to get steroid treatment to stop the itching.  if you have any allergies test this product on a small spot first.  I have the shampoo and oil, wasted my money, cannot use</li>
            <li> Although it serves as no aid to  hair loss function wise like the shampoo does, this product certainly restores the feel of hair after the natural cleanse, form the corresponding shampoo. Essentially I have felt a natural luxurious feel to my hair, great piece of mind knowing this conditioner has natural ingredients to help lock in that beneficial stimulating cleanse from the shampoo, for the day.</li>
            <li> When I read the features of it..I saw it&#x27;s best for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for my long, wavy hair that gets dyed from time to time. I don&#x27;t even use shampoo. Pairs well with my gel, but still leaves my hair looking healthy if I choose to skip the product. Light fragrance that I enjoy. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this conditioner to go with my Pura d&#x27;or shampoo. I have to say it is one of the best smelling conditioners I have ever smelled. The shampoo itself has done wonders on my hair. My hair not only looks fuller but it actually looks darker (less gray), which I did not think was possible. The darker hair has been noticed by my family without me saying anything.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and manageable after using this product, and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner and the shampoo last August (2013) for hair loss and it&#x27;s lasted me a year and two months! I just bought my second bottle a few days ago. This is a great product for hair loss - definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged. I have been using the Pura d shampoo and this was my first use of the conditioner. It feels a bit dry but the results on my hair are great. My hair feels smoother and cleaner through to the next day even. I like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was a little put-off by the lavender vanilla fragrance of the product but impressed with the results and appearance of my thinning hair.  This one&#x27;s a keeper, and this product with a citrus scent would be outstanding!</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> smell amazing vanilla mix with lavender......my hair luv it too...will repurchase it again</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! I have noticed a bit of regrowth and I have only been using it for a couple weeks along with the matching Pura Anti-Hair Loss shampoo (Gold Label). Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the worst conditioners I&#x27;ve tryd, you need to use a quarter of the bottle to feel like it&#x27;s doing anything for ur hair, I am very suspicious about any good reviews for this or the shampoo, wich I&#x27;ve only used 4 xs but won&#x27;t continue bcz my hair is become so dry it&#x27;s like straw;(</li>
            <li> I truly do love the Pura d&#x27;or products. I purchased the Argan oil shampoo and conditioner. After using the shampoo I apply the conditioner for a few minutes as I have short hair. After rinsing my hair out it feels great and soft. Explaining how hair my hair feels to my girlfriend, she soon tried the conditioner. She also loves it and has super curly hair.</li>
            <li> Well spite the fact it was late that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it this product 3 stars I love this this stuff smells good and my hair has never felt better</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the whole transaction, and the product</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> As directed I used only a small amount and I&#x27;m not sure it was enough. I had trouble combing through my hair after I got out. I had to put additional product on it to do so. It seems like it conditioned well but it doesn&#x27;t give you that slippery sleek feel afterwards. Probably a good thing though.</li>
            <li> leaves hair soft and smelling fresh throughout the day. I have yet to see any visual hair growth.</li>
            <li> Let me first start out by saying the lavender vanilla smells incredible and very calming! Most importantly the first time I used it  my hair felt soft and luxurious. I didn&#x27;t think that a natural conditioner would work so well but I&#x27;m completely impressed and sold by its qualities. Just rinsing it out of my hair I could feel the difference between this conditioner and others I have used. My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down and felt like I went to a spa for a special treatment.  I will be using this product from now on and the cost is well worth its qualities.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of shampoo and conditioner for about six months.  I went from using sulfate shampoo  and conditioner to this organic products. I found that I shed less. My hair is also more healthy and shiny.  I recommend to anyone  who is battling hair loss.</li>
            <li> The vanilla aroma provides a very pleasant smell to your hair.  It also gives your hair a much &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; feeling.  A definite 5 Star for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good. After I shampoo with Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo I apply this conditioner as per instructions and rinse very well. My hair feels soft,smooth and looks shiny! I like it</li>
            <li> I have tired other products of purad&#x27;or and ordered this I was having extreme hair loss for years. I have tried it and it helps to keep my hair soft, yet to see changes in hair loss. I have also tired other natural productions, but I felt the difference in my hair with this. Now I have also ordered shampoo, waiting to receive and use it. The product is bit highly priced, but if it helps with hair loss, I will be happy.</li>
            <li> was good but to expensive</li>
            <li> Hope springs eternal for us females with hair loss issues. This product is NOT the answer. After only three uses, the shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel oily and heavy, NOT clean and healthy. The first time I used it, the lathering was minimal, but I chocked it up to the organic nature of the product. My hair felt heavy but not too oily. The second time I used the product, my hair was noticeably oilier and not very clean. In fact, my hair felt dirtier after my shampoo! The third and last time I used this product, my hair looked stringy and unhealthy as well as oily and dirty. What a sad state! I have gone back to my It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo and conditioner with keratin. At least my hair feels clean and refreshed. Hair loss increased with Pura products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and love it a lot!</li>
            <li> I am a breast cancer survivor and after chemotherapy my hair did not come in good.  I had some male pattern baldness and was very frustrated!  I waited and waited thinking one day it would just sprout and while it was growing, it was growing VERY slow!  I am also hypothyroid which didn&#x27;t help the issue.  After a few comments from perfect strangers almost 3 years post chemo I finally decided to make a stand for my hair and try something different.  I had tried Keranique and it didn&#x27;t help.  I have also used minoxidil but my hair still didn&#x27;t appear &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34;.  I did some research and decided to try the Pura d&#x27;or line.  I bought the shampoo, conditioner and argon oil and I have to say after using it for just about 2 weeks I have seen a huge difference in my hair&#x27;s health!  It has much more volume and is finally starting to grow quicker and is thicker already!!!  Friends who are close to me have also noticed a difference!  I am 100% sold on this product!  I love that it is all natural, it smells great and this is now my new go to hair product line!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. My hair has never felt so amazing, and it has an amazing scent. I also use the Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo. Love both these products and would recommend to everyone. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> I have been highlighting my hair for years now and tried so many products to keep my hair soft,bring the shine back,and most important of all prevent our crazy hair loss...unfortunately nothing seemed to work (all products were chemical based).&lt;br /&gt;Therefore,my sister(non-dyed hair) and I decided to use an organic based shampoo as our last hope to bring life back to our hair.&lt;br /&gt;After extensive googling,we came across Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo with its conditioner that we decided to try since it was 100% organic and had good reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the third time we use this shampoo since our purchase where we noticed that:&lt;br /&gt;-our hair is absorbing the shampoo more.&lt;br /&gt;-the conditioner makes our hair softer each time we reuse it.&lt;br /&gt;-hair loss decreased(did not totally stop yet,we hope eventually it will stop with frequent use).&lt;br /&gt;-the product has a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;We really love this product till now and we hope we will get the hair we always wanted with more use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We personally do recommend this product(with PURA d&#x27;or Organic conditioner) to every person suffering from dried stiffed up lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals is the main reason I use this. It keeps my hair soft and moisturized during the winter. Great product!</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner.  It makes my hair feels healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner, like the smell! But the effect needs time to prove.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Haven&#x27;t noticed much of difference in my hair yet, but it&#x27;s nice to know there are no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a great follow-up to the Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo.  Moisturizes and makes my hair feel silky without feeling greasy.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo I have not been using this product long enough to state that it regrows hair.  I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for about a week and a half now and I can say is that the product does make your hair fuller.  I have long curly hair that most shampoo and conditioner does not work well with.  Thankfully the product works really well with curly hair.  It does not weigh my hair down or leave it oily looking.  It leaves it soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah...weird for a guy to say that but I&#x27;m a musician what can I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have commented on the smell of the product and I know everyone&#x27;s sense of scent is different.  I think it leaves your hair with a nice clean smell and have had people comment how nice my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh...one other thing...before I forget.  I have also noticed a much smaller dreaded &amp;#34;Drain Monster&amp;#34; so it is definitely helping keep the hair I have.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first however after using it my hair feels light and healthy without build up. I do spray a detangler conditioner in my hair before combing but overall I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the premium hair loss shampoo in the gold bottle, and I&#x27;ve used them together two times in the past two days. The difference in my hair is amazing!! My hair has thinned a lot over the past few years, and I noticed way too many hairs in the sink when I would brush it. After using these Pura d&#x27;or products for just two days, my hair appears thicker and naturally wavy like it did when I was much younger. It has stopped falling out!! This conditioner makes it soft and manageable. It rinses clean, and does not weigh down my fine hair. Very nice. I will keep buying this and the shampoo. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the shampoo by Pura d&#x27;or that I ordered this conditioner too. It did NOT disappoint. Not only is it thick and luxurious (I feel like I&#x27;m at the freaking spa when I use it) but it smells SO GOOD! My boy friend commented on the look, feel and smell of my hair! I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff! After searching and searching for the proper shampoo and conditioner for my thinning hair I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found the right product! The price is right andI love that it is organic.</li>
            <li> About 5 months ago I began to experience severe redness &amp; irritation on my scalp after shampooing with my regular products that I have used for quite sometime. My hair stylist also began noticing the redness as well as hair loss on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 55 year old male who has always had a very full head of hair so this began to worry &amp; depress me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began doing a lot of research and found that this redness &amp; hair loss was probably the end result of a common shampoo ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. Many other reviews and articles seemed to confirm this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an inexpensive detergent and makes mixtures foam well and seemed to be in almost all shampoo products. Just google &amp;#34;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll come up with a lot of startling information on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Amazon after reading many reviews to find a replacement shampoo without sulfates, I found Pura d&#x27;or Hair Lss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo and to boot it promotes hair growth &amp; fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after using t...

            <li> Spreads and permeates poorly.  Takes 3-4 pumps to get enough to cover hair (Shampoo takes 1 pump).  Lavender scent is reminiscent of my grandmother and does not condition well leaving my hair dry and frizzy.  For the first time in my life I&#x27;ve had to use a leave in AFTER conditioner in conjunction with this just to keep my hair looking decent.</li>
            <li> hair feels very smooth after using it</li>
            <li> Washes and lathers well unlike other natural shampoos. Smell takes some getting used to. Slightly drying on ends so be sure to use lots of conditioner.</li>

            <li> I started using this conditioner 1 month back and i can really see the changes on my hair. It reduced the hair fall and makes my hair a bit shiny. Thanks Pura d, I will rate this 5star.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! It gives my hair body and makes it soft without weighing it down. I love the coconut smell too! I do not have to use much conditioner to get this effect so it can last me a long time. Well-nourished and no damage with this product!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife and this is what she says:  Its just been around 3 weeks since I started using this shampoo, but I can see a significant difference in my hair texture.  The shampoo smells and feels good and the conditioner also has a pleasant scent. Hair loss has reduced and hair has become  more manageable. The shampoo is expensive but the results up till now are worth the price. Hoping a consistent improvement in  my hair with the help of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. It really helps my hair loss problem. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have fine and limp hair and using this product makes my hair strands more thicker and stronger. i have been using this product for more than a year and will continue to use it...</li>
            <li> I love everything about this conditioner. The smell is great, it isn&#x27;t too strong. I always get compliments on how good my hair smell. I use this with Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label) which has absolutely no scent to it. This product leaves my hair really soft and easy to comb after showers.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure whether it&#x27;s the conditioner or shampoo, but I do notice that my hair gets oily pretty quickly. I usually wash my hair every other day but ever since using Pura d&#x27;or products, I tend to have to wash my hair everyday now. But overall, good product.</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I notice less hair loss in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It is really good product. I like it so much!</li>
            <li> I was loosing my hair so much and I was super consernd than my friend recommend this products and I have been using the shampoo and the conditioner por acouple month and I love them!! My hair is not falling any more. :))</li>
            <li> Smells real good, tried the shampoo left my hair feeling great. Will update this review in a month for a better feel for the product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because I&#x27;ve struggled with finding the right conditioner for my hair. I wanted something to help ease my hair loss and liked the shampoo.  I decided to give this a try and have been pleasantly surprised! It conditions my fine hair without weighing it down and gives it a nice feel.  Quite happy and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does a good job of making my hair feel soft and manageable.  I also bought the shampoo and I think it is necessary to use this conditioner with it because the shampoo alone will dry your hair a little and not leave it as soft.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent.  Both my wife and I love it.  It has a great lasting smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this product. Coupled with the Shampoo, I find this conditioner leaves my hair feeling really soft and light. I usually keep it on for 5 minutes because I live in a really dry area of the country. I depend on it to help ensure my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of strange chemicals in it. It seems to have helped curb hair loss as well, as part of a wholistic approach with the shampoo and other products.</li>
            <li> I expected a great product. This turned to be like any other comercial hair conditioner. One use made my hair thin,dry,brittle and scalp itchy. I lost all the body i built up with Pura d&#x27;or tranquility shampoo. I am planning to return it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was ordered together with Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label).  I didn&#x27;t use it as often as the shampoo since it needs another 2 minutes to treat my hair.  But I feel it is a good product and made my hair look healthier each time.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference but I will check back in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works good.  I have hair that gets oily easy.  This conditioner keeps my hair soft, without making it oily.  This conditioner has no, to limited scent, which I prefer. You have to keep it in your hair for two minutes, then rinse.  The conditioner rinses out quickly, and does a good job for the whole day.  However, I would prefer a conditioner designed for hair loss that you can use together with the Pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo.  But, in the meantime, this conditioner works good.</li>
            <li> very good conditioner，my father like it，thanks！</li>
            <li> I think it is a little bit dry for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;As I just used only 1 time, looking forward to effective.&lt;br /&gt;Hope help!</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I have ever purchased. I have been using it for 10 days and I can see the difference. My scalp is dandruff free now. Best conditioner in the market to treat dry scalps. I am using it along with Pura d or shampoo.</li>
            <li> Although I love the Pura d&#x27;or hair loss shampoo, I was a little disappointed in the conditioner.  It did not take out my tangles as I expected it to.  I had to use another conditioner over it so I didn&#x27;t pull out any hair while combing through my hair.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells pleasant, in a dryer sheet kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not leave behind any residue, so my hair has more volume than when I used drug store conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;3. It comes in a convenient pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It just doesn&#x27;t work very well. I use this in conjunction with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo, which is very drying. Even after glopping on several palm-fulls of this conditioner and leaving it on for ten minutes, I can still barely run my fingers through my hair without pulling out gratuitous amounts.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s expensive, especially considering a leave-in conditioner is absolutely necessary afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;3. The pump does not dispense enough product in one (or even three) squirts and so is rather useless. I just unscrew the top.</li>
            <li> Bought with shampoo and overall it is nice. The only concern for me is the vanilla scent which is very different from the scent of the shampoo. It&#x27;s a matter of your preference but it is not the greatest choice for me. Besides that, the product itself is decent and overall nice product. Wish it was a bit cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo to help with thinning hair.  I found this brand after reading so many great reviews.  Naturally, I wanted to order the conditioner to go along with my shampoo.  I believe the product is definitely helping with my thinning hair.  I see less hair in my shower drain as well as seeing a lot of baby hair along my hair line.  Product doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either.  Just a mild, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Love it! Feel very COMFORTABLE with this product.</li>
            <li> Disaster! After three wash with this conditioner (and its shampoo), my hair got thinner and thinner. They are all falling out now. How ironic! I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Hi, So I bought this conditioner because so many times I was buying really expensive stuff, but the product just left my hair feeling tried out and brittle. I have very fine hair, so this is bad.  When I bought this combo shampoo/conditioner I was hoping it would at least not make my hair feel \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; after. It really did a great job. My hair felt thicker, more natural and lighter (not weighed down by thick nasty product).  If you want natural stuff without all the chemicals and your hair to feel like it got nutrition, go for this.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I absolutely love it! I pair it with the pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo and so far I am very happy with the result. After washing and conditioning my hair felt significantly thicker and more smooth. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Overall good conditioner</li>
            <li> Like the natural ingredients and it&#x27;s worked well so far.</li>
            <li> After I used it, I find it is useful to prevent losing more hair.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair nice volume and shine. I do love the lavender scent.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt this soft before.. this stuff will make you forgot all other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Guy with very thick, curly hair here. My hair is about 2.5 inches long, if that helps. This conditioner made my hair feel unbelievably silky from just one full pump. Doesn&#x27;t leave it too moisturized. It just feels really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it in combination with the shampoo. Definitely a big difference in texture and moisture. Been using it for a month now and it&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is AMAZING!! My hair is sooo incredibly soft and I didn&#x27;t have to use product in my hair after the shower.  It smells fabulous and this was the first time after using an organic conditioner that I didn&#x27;t have frizz or flyaway&#x27;s! No hair fall!  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use a high quality organic conditioner that actually does what it says it does.  I have used organic products in the past and they did not moisturize my hair like this conditioner does.  Did I mention is smells like the snuggles bear running through a lavender field? WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Super lightweight, did not feel like it was conditioning my hair at all.  My hair even felt dry afterwards.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> After researching sulfate free shampoos, found this conditioner to match.  I love the way my hair feels afterwards, and the smell is terrific.  Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used! It gives me volume and shine! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, a little pricey though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used organic products in my hair before this conditioner, as well as the shampoo.  I&#x27;ve got to say I love the way my hair feels after a shower.  The shampoo seems to dry my hair out, but following up with this conditioner seems to leave it with the perfect moisture.  I also love the smell of this stuff.  So far, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Why did i choose this rating?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it works just fine for me! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought a hemp conditioner for some weeks but it didnt worked so well so i tried this one and im full statisfied now :)</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, love the product!!!</li>
            <li> Although I felt great after using this product,my hair was still falling with a lower rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice!</li>
            <li> I am a vegan, and an environmentalist, and I hunt for organic beauty products. And this product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is extremely damaged (and relaxed every 3 months). And this condition makes it ....... good and soft. It smells AMAZINGGGG too!&lt;br /&gt;Its not better than my JASON organic biotin condition, but its a great condition to make ur hair soft if you wanna splurge. :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo and cream rinse really make my hair feel clean and soft. It all arrived so quickly I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to make my hair grow Cant tell yet</li>
            <li> Purchased this with the Hair Loss Prevention shampoo.  Tried both for the first time today.  So far, pleased with the smell, lather and feel of both of these products.  Looking forward to using more.</li>
            <li> I used this product as soon as it arrived.  It left my hair shiny with lots of body.  Also, I purchased the Pura D&#x27;or Anit-hair loss shampoo and used it the same day as well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how little hair I lost while shampooing.  I will definitely be purchasing both products again.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  After 6 weeks of us, I&#x27;m finding it leaves my long, fine, straight hair soft without making it limp.</li>
            <li> This conditioner in conjunction with the Argan Gold shampoo from the same line works very well for strengthening existing super fine hair. I have also seen less hair loss. I would purchase again. The only small complaint I have is the smell. I much prefer the smell of the shampoo. I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for most people as it is not a chemical smell but I am very sensitive to any kind of fragrance so it is a bit much for me.</li>
            <li> My hair felt horrible while I washed it, and was dryer and unmanageable!  A total waste of money for me!</li>
            <li> I have curly dry frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve always struggled with my hair my entire life (more than 30 years).  I used this conditioner and my hair is manageable and not frizzy.  It defines my curls.  I also have thinning hair and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is thicker.  My husband also noticed it.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> terrible watered down waxy like substance.</li>
            <li> Great natural conditioner! Leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li> Received within few days of order.  Smells good.  Some reviews said no conditioner is needed but since shampoo leave hair a little dry the conditioner helps with this.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit special, but still acceptable. It&#x27;s the first time to use Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li> After three weeks it seams to be helpings.</li>
            <li> So far makes my hair seem thicker smells great.I have only used it four times and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Bought simply to reduce chemicals hitting my head vs. anything else.  Smells nice!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been three weeks, and I can already see noticeable growth! I have fine hair and I&#x27;m usually a bit thin along my part in the front of my head. There&#x27;s several baby hairs sprouting from all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the scent too. My boyfriend is constantly sniffing me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the shampoo too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the lack of de-tangling.  Other than that, 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I am using this pura d&#x27;or conditioner in combination with pura d&#x27;or argan oil and shampoo. Looks like it works, I can see difference in my hair loss and hair regrowth. Though its expensive it works the magic. I have frizzy hair and it calms it down and makes it look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It leaves my hair super soft.  I recommend this to anyone in need of a great organic product for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love it , it does wonders for my hair. I looooooovvvveeee it.😄😄😀😀</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but too pricey. Not as good as conditioners from a regular store.</li>
            <li> Just got it today! Feels good in my hair and a little more silkier than my regular conditioner! For an argan oil product, this smells really good and I&#x27;m only saying that because I love argan oil but the smell can come off as strong. This one is way more creamier and has a sweet smell. I have curly coily thick hair and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down like I thought it would!</li>
            <li> I bought this production for my wife, since she bought the shampoo of same style days before. She loves that shampoo, so when the condition arrived, she can&#x27;t wait to try it. She has a problem of hair loss, when she used that shampoo, she thought that&#x27;s very useful to deal with her hair loss expect feeling a little dry after using. But now, with this condition, she said these two productions are perfect when using together. Everything is all right! To me, the only problem is that this production is really expensive than other productions of some common brands, but if it continue to be useful for my wife, I will buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, I could tell a difference in my hair right away. I have longer hair, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts is because it doesn&#x27;t do the best job detangeling. I mix it with another condition and that works great!</li>
            <li> It works, it took me a while to come to favor this conditioner but I did and now favor it.</li>
            <li> I have used it with Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention but im not sure if it works for hairloss but my hair is softer. Like the smell.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed. I purchased this shampoo and conditioner set after going through various Whole Foods shampoos and conditioners that were expensive but missing a little something. Everything from the consistency of the conditioner (thin and watery) to the bland smell to how the shampoo failed to clean my hair was just terrible. I am not sure how people gave the product such rave reviews but I am really sad about this, I had high hopes for this product and I actually think I dried out and damaged my hair more by using it. I had to use a left over mini bottle of Pantene conditioner (which I have tried to stay away from) in order to painlessly comb through and de tangle my hair. I bought the Argan oil as well, it&#x27;s not a good brand or product. Look elsewhere, I am doubting that it is even certified organic. Sure doesn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
            <li> Feels very natural, and makes my hair nice, soft and lends a slight natural glow. The amount of hair my family has been finding on the floor has decreased, so I&#x27;m going to infer that our collective hair loss has decreased. Only thing is that you really have to pump out a lot and can feel kind of watery.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and rave enough about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Purador for a month, and I now have thicker, fuller hair! There is Less hair in the sink in the morning. I have used other hair loss shampoos in the past - this is the best so far, and this product has a nice scent As well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for the last year or so and it has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle I received a few days ago does not contain the same conditioner I am used to. For one it does not smell like lavender like previous bottles and the consistency of the conditioner is not as thick as before. I certainly hope this is not a case of a company changing the formula to save a few dollar as others have done in the past...</li>
            <li> My wife and I after finally deciding to try something new  organic conditioner and we are not unhappy with our choice of Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Conditioner.  It is hard to tell which is having a more positive effect on my hair, the shampoo or the conditioner.  This is definitely my new favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is great conditioner leaves hair soft, with shine and bounce, no heavy residue or build up! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I did see my hair started to lose slowly and this is 2nd bottle, I found out it works like it says. also, the after-use hair feels so comfortable. I will continue to use this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I do like the conditioner ( and shampoo) very much, however, the pump on the conditioner was broken and I had a bit of a mess since it leaked.  It was still in the protective wrap or else it would have been worse.  I did lose some, and had to throw away the pump and replace it with a screw cap.</li>
            <li> Works well, natural ingredients and smells wonderful. I feel comfortable having my whole family use it!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and ordered this product couple of weeks back. Me and my wife have been using this along with the shampoo. I know it&#x27;s too early to say whether this is preventing any hair loss or not, but this definitely made my hair silkier and smoother. I have used multiple sulphate free products in the past, and this one is one of the best ones. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> smells manly so the guys will probably like it.  I don&#x27;t like the smell when I apply it and afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried, at first, about the scent based on some of the other reviews. I really don&#x27;t mind it, though. You can detect the vanilla and herb smell to it. I use it in combination with the shampoo</li>
            <li> what a super product....  just what I needed to help control the &#x27;gray frizzies&amp;#34;.... I really love how smooth my hair feels with these products!  I also love the fact that it&#x27;s organic..... there&#x27;s way too much &#x27;artificial&#x27; out there so I&#x27;m grateful for companies like Pura&#x27;d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li> Worst conditioner I have ever put in my hair! I checked the label to make sure it is actually conditioner and not lotion.  I am so upset with this purchase.... This is my very first review I have written on amazon (daily shopper here).  They company gives you a free bottle if you write a review.</li>
            <li> The feel is very natural, but not very smooth. I still liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Just one pump is all you need. This has a great smell and my hair feels nice and soft. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I bought this one with the hair loss prevention organic shampoo. I&#x60;m glad that I had it with that shampoo. After used that shampoo, you can immediately feel that your hair is really dry, after used this conditioner, I feel that my hair is smooth and soft and continued for two days. This one really works. I also like the design of the cap. You can turned it to &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; so no need to worried about leaking or other problems. And the smell of this one is good, a milk like smell. If you decided to buy that shampoo, you definitely need this one also.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading all the positive reviews and I have to say that the hype is real. After the first time I used this I could feel a difference; and that is because the product has a volumizing effect that helps a lot when you have lost so much hair. The smell was pleasant; and according to instructions you do have to leave the product on for a couple of minutes in order for them to make effect. I have noticed less hair on my drain which is a plus!!! Have been using for a couple of weeks and have to admit I&#x27;m a fan so far.. will give an update in a couple of months</li>
            <li> This weighed my hair down and it didn&#x27;t leave it soft or manageable to comb thru.</li>
            <li> I have used the conditioner for about three weeks, it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;Scalps decrease a lot, that&#x27;s a good start. it&#x27;s hopeful I will recollect my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Note, at the same time, I still take the hair growth pills and use the hair regrowth treatment.</li>
            <li> love the smell and how it makes my hair feel.  good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Normally, shampoos tend to dry my hair out, which often causes dandruff for me (especially in dry, winter months). This conditioner did a good job of keeping my hair and scalp smooth and moist. I&#x27;ve tried various conditioners in the past, but this one seems to provide the most long-lasting dryness relief. Currently, I use it about 3 times/week and it was been doing the job with keeping my hair from becoming dandruffy.</li>
            <li> The product felt clean and chemical free. I loved how it felt on my skin. My hair took very harsh beating from constant blow drying. Somehow with this product I tried to tame my frizzy, unhealthy and extremely want hair with tons of fly aways. I will recommend for anyone to use.</li>
            <li> I liked that the conditioner worked well on my fine, thin hair which tangles easily. It also had a nice, not overly perfumed, smell. That being said, I thought that the bottle would be larger for the price.</li>
            <li> The product had somehow leaked out thru the top when I received it. The outside temperature was in the single digits so I don&#x27;t know if it froze and that caused it to leak, or if it was just a defective pump lid. The actual product I like!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the shampoo. It really does help you hair have a good, smooth texture. It smells better than the shampoo and does help you have better control of your hair. It doesn&#x27;t have all of the ingredients that the shampoo has that&#x27;s suppose to combat hair loss, but it does contain natural, healthy ingredients. With that being said, I know that its good for your hair. I love the shampoo and the conditioner makes me love it even more. I would definitely recommend this product. I still notice that I am loosing hair, but I&#x27;ve only been using the shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks and I know it could take at least a few months to tell if these products have worked. I will update in a few months.</li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo so I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d try the conditioner. This conditioner feels a lot different from conventional ones. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as silky after rinsing.</li>
            <li> Like all their products, this conditioner leaves my hair healthy and shiny!  I Swear my hair is getting thicker and filling in thinning spots!  Well worth the cost and a little goes a long way.  Their skin care products are really making my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!!! The smell is absolutely amazing. My hair feels very nourished now, and overall healthier. I also use the shampoo as well, the two goes hand in hand.&lt;br /&gt;Try not to use too much of the conditioner though as it will make your hair very oily, I use about one and a half pump for my long hair!&lt;br /&gt;Also, after a while I could feel my hair is growing at a faster than before!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li> good conditioner , just started to use it, and can feel the difference</li>
            <li> I love this condition!!!  I will be buying again and again!</li>
            <li> Only used a couple of times but doesn&#x27;t de-tangle my hair well.  Doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing and seem to need to use more than I would if using a regular conditioner. Does smell nice and is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; so far at best. Will have to use more before deciding if I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good...smells wonderful. I appreciate how it is not filled with parabens, SLS, and other chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this product! My hair feels light and has body. Easy drying and styling. I will never use my old shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I have ever used. I had problems before because the shampoo and conditioner I had caused my hair to become damaged because of the sulfates in the them. After using this product for a few days my hair is already looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li> Smells great, fairly light, leaves hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I adore this product and will continue to buy it really works and I see the difference with my hair, the only thing is you must get an oil to moisturize your scalp it can get somewhat dry after a shampoo, but it works at least for me it does...</li>
            <li> i ordered two. one came with a broken cap</li>
            <li> My hair was falling and this shampoo and conditioner did the job, my hair is growing and is a lot fouler.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair sticky. So far hair shedding is accelerating not slowing. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use this once so I can&#x27;t testify to its effectiveness over time. However, it has a pleasant smell. It did not have enough slip for me to comb my thinning African American hair, but did make my hair soft while wet and added volume when dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was over moisturized and had a lot of build up. This helped even and clear it up. Plus I love that it&#x27;s made from organic materials.</li>
            <li> So, after trying different organic conditioners this is the one for me.  I got this from somewhere else just to test and premium it is.  Feels great on my hairs, made it silky smooth without all the crazy chemicals from my old conditioner.  For me the price was a bit high but was worth it for the bottle size and using organic ingredients.  I would recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my hair so soft and shiny. When you put it on and comb it through it works even better.</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine and thin so I need a good conditioner, something a little heavier I think. This one is ok but leaves my hair I little staticky and tangled.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  Not sure if I have seen regrowth, but it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T SMELL ALL THAT GOOD, BUT I THINK IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> absolutely brilliant. highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like how this makes my hair feel.  Initially, it seemed like my wet hair was too tangled to comb easily, but I started putting just a little conditioner back on my hair after I rinsed.  It gives my hair more body and keeps it from being too fly-away due to static electricity.  I haven&#x27;t noticed if my hair is thicker, yet, but I like it well enough to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel.  Has a nice gentle natural fragrance.  Love that it is organic too!</li>
            <li> This shampoo shows its magic during shampooing where it reduces the hair fall but otherwise I can see the normal hairfall the remaining time, I am unsure if it takes more time to reduce the hair fall as I have just started to use lately. Expecting miracles with one Shampoo conditioner might be little too much as it is also dependent on the food diet.</li>
            <li> When used in combination with the shampoo the outcome is great!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner!! It smelled great, and my hair was fuller and felt healthier after blow drying my hair. I would definately purchase again!!</li>
            <li> This condition works incredibly well and smells fantastic. Another impressive product from Pura d&#x27;or!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner delivers as promised. I started a new all natural dandruff shampoo that was extremely effective, but as a consequence left my curly hair unbelievably dry and frizzy. I used to use Theorie&#x27;s Argan Oil conditioner, which is an amazing product, but it just wasn&#x27;t conditioning enough to compensate for the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I decided to try Pura d&#x27;or, given it&#x27;s great reviews on Amazon- and I&#x27;m pleased with the results. As others had commented, the smell is strongly reminiscent of Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s baby line of lavender products (which was a bit disappointing, because I enjoy the smell of Argan oil), but it intensely conditions, and my hair is left soft without much heaviness or buildup. Though others have made claims to the contrary, the bottle states that the conditioner is SLS free and mostly organic. Will have to further inquire to see who is right, I suppose! But still, I would definitely recommend this product for curly haired individuals.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for having your hair not too dry or wet. Especially it works better when I use Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo (Gold Label). I have been used for 2 months and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and my hair feels so soft. My hair is usually frizzy but with this conditioner it smooths and shines my hair. Love it</li>
            <li> Have been using this conditioner for 2 weeks now and I feel the difference. My hair is more manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li> Started using right away and. I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked really well. We&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and seems to be working great. My wife even loves it too!</li>
            <li> I waste my money on this. It didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Lorena B.</li>
            <li> The product is really awesome with real organic ingredients. Makes your hair softer n lustrous. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner!! Would buy again makes hair feel soft and supple, doesnt really do much  for hair growth and hair fall.</li>
            <li> About 5 months ago I began to experience severe redness &amp; irritation on my scalp after shampooing with my regular products that I have used for quite sometime. My hair stylist also began noticing the redness as well as hair loss on top of my head.  I&#x27;m a 55 year old male who has always had a very full head of hair so this began to worry &amp; depress me.  I began doing a lot of research and found that this redness &amp; hair loss was probably the end result of a common shampoo ingredient called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. Many other reviews and articles seemed to confirm this.  This is an inexpensive detergent and makes mixtures foam well and seemed to be in almost all shampoo products. Just google &amp;#34;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll come up with a lot of startling information on it.  On Amazon after reading many reviews to find a replacement shampoo without sulfates, I found Pura d&#x27;or Hair Lss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo and to boot it promotes hair growth &amp; fullness.  Well, after using the product for 3 months I&#x27;m much happier. The redness stopped after a week of use and my hair felt better and thicker. More natural looking and not so &amp;#34;stressed&amp;#34; looking some days.  I can&#x27;t say yet if if will indeed help grow back some of the hair that I lost but I&#x27;m hopeful.  It has indeed though arrested any further hair lose as the shower drain is no longer clogged with hair and there is little signs anymore of lost hair strands on my work desktop.  Very few shampoos out there have the benefits that this one has. I&#x27;m happy with the product and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s more expensive but for me it&#x27;s worth the end result.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my suspect hair feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Like the smell &amp; feel of this conditioner!</li>
            <li> Good product. I have used for more than one month. My hair has stopped to drop. My wife ia using it as well.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling extremely soft and manageable, not to mention the scent of this conditioner is amazing. I definitely recommend this to anyone in need of a great organic product for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with hair loss for a while and this product with the shampoo has helped my hair feel soft and healthier again. This conditioner nourishes and gives the clean feeling. It does not dry out the scalp. It is a great product and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a healthier hair! I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up on natural shampoo and conditioner until you try this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;After trying everything out there, including natural, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; (by that I mean it says natural but has hidden chemicals) baking soda, Castile, shampoo bars etc I wanted to give up on my frizzy greasy limp ugly hair. I gave it one more shot and bought this stuff. Purely awesome! It saved my hair which was totally damaged from a &amp;#34;conditioning rinse&amp;#34; I purchased (and trashed) and it kept my hair smooth on a very humid day. No dry ends, no limp hair, non oily, no bad scents, no chemicals. Thank you Pura d&#x27;or. Very happy. I use this the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The product has a nice scent and is very soothing on the scalp.  My hair is more manageable. I use both the shampoo and conditioner and I have noticed that only a few strands of hair come out (much less than before).</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and use the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and this conditioner. After using these products, there is so much less hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get used to unlike  other type of shampoo this one feels different. However, after a week you can tell the difference in the texture and volume. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not very conditioning &amp; smells like baby powder.  Bought this with their dandruff shampoo, which has a sandalwood-y smell - gross together!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that works.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.dont weight my hair down like other products that claims to be natural.</li>
            <li> 3 month review.....Even after using 5 pumps of this on my long, fine hair and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes, it still did nothing to &amp;#34;heal and repair damaged&amp;#34; hair. Actually my hair felt dried out after towel drying and was harder to brush; resulting in hair loss because of the tangles.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, makes a big difference for my hair</li>
            <li> makes hair shiny and smells great</li>
            <li> a condition that lets does not leave my hair felling weighted down or oily! and it helps with the fact that due to stress my hair has been thinning!! Been using it for 2 weeks and already see a difference with it and the shampoo!</li>
            <li> It has repaired damaged hair.  In two uses, I feel like I have a different head of hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used Argan oil in the past, you will know that this stuff is the real deal. I don&#x27;t care who you are, but once you use argan oil conditioner and shampoo, you will never go back to head and shoulder or that other crap product that you buy.&lt;br /&gt;The amount you get for the price you are getting it at is also an incredible deal! Absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li> My hair was very good and I was proud of it. My relatives liked my hair and I never thought of facing hair fall problems. It was quite unexpected when I noticed hair shedding. Also, it became unmanageable! I was a surprised as I didn&#x27;t know the reason. I had to find some good products! The conditioner and hair fall shampoo were two great products that helped me reduce my hair fall and I can easily manage my hair now. These are awesome products!</li>
            <li> Tried the shampoo and now the conditioner. They work well together. Good ingredients and good results. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably thicker, fuller looking. I like the fresh smell of it. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a quality product with no harsh chemicals. It leaves my hair soft with a nice shine to it. I use it with the Pura d&#x27;or Organic Shampoo. The shampoo is a good product as well but it leaves my hair a little dry. I feel a conditioner is necessary after using the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey but a little product goes a long way. I have been using Nioxin for the last 7 years and this is a good alternative if you want an organic product without harsh chemicals. There is no way to tell if it actually helps prevent hair loss but the shampoo and conditioner are high-quality products that make my hair look nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this version first and I really like it.  My hair feels super soft, smells great, and is squeaky clean. The combination of highly hair beneficial ingredients was key to my purchasing this shampoo.  My husband said my hair looked thicker after I used it.  It definitely had more body.  These things are HUGE when you are losing hair at the rate I am.  Hopefully the shedding will subside quickly. I will be testing out both versions of the shampoo and posting updates.  I believe I have found a real winner!</li>
            <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand. makes my hair smooth and locks in moisture.</li>
            <li> I just love this... I don&#x27;t need to use very much just every so little...The scent and how light it is is just great</li>
            <li> Good shampoo but pump does not work. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Conditionair feels diluted in water it does not condition or smooth  the hair caused dandruff</li>
            <li> My hair is dry from processing. I ordered 4 types of conditioners and found that Badger and Desert Essence are the best for how damaged my hair is. I resorted to using the heavier products above because this didn&#x27;t help at all.  Other products by  Pura d&#x27;or&#x27; are okay, the hair loss shampoo is excellent! I would nor recommend this product for very dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product about 2 months ago so I am early on in the process to be able to leave a definitive result. What I have noticed is the shampoo leaves my head tingling sometimes to the point of sensitivity, but I see that as a sign it is doing something. This conditioner has once of my favorite features... It washes out without leaving my hair weighed down and looking like it needs another wash. My hair is soft and less dry looking that it was prior to using it. I still shed like a dog but my body is also recovering from a very harsh medical treatment that I was on for 3 full months so I feel like I need to give me time to heal and this product time to really work. I will keep using this product absolutely....and I think I see tiny hairs starting to grow in especially around my high forehead area.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Love the pump bottle.  Make sure to leave it in for awhile (more than a few minutes) to get the full effect.  Very thick, so a little hard to spread a small amount evenly through your hair.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s natural but not silky, smooth. the smell is just ok. it does make hair has thickness though.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pura D&#x27;or&#x27;s shampoo for quite a while and I love it. This conditioner also works great. It has a lovely smell of lavender and the scent lasts for a whole day. And it works well to create a glow on my hair. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Second time conditioning with this brand  showed incredible difference in how my hair flowed and shined. Easy to manage after towel drying. No need for added hair products to style. I&#x27;m Filipino with colored, less than wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months. I shifted from rogaine, due to allergic reaction to rogaine. Now I am more than happy that I found Pura D&#x27;or. I am a woman in my late twenty, starting to lose hair. I was afraid to become bald, because I already seen my scalp under my hair. After using Pura D&#x27;or My hair significantly reduced to fall, more manageable and it gives some volume to my hair. I have to say After I started to use this shampoo and condition I agreed argan oil IS really good for hair. Plus its also lavender vanilla contained so smell is great! Everyone around me is asking what kind of hair product I am using. And I proudly answer them Pura D&#x27;or!!!</li>
            <li> I do think this is working for my hair falling out, but makes my hair feel coarse</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this I&#x27;ve just started using it and now i get compliments about my hair :))</li>
            <li> The main reason why I purchased this conditioner was because of dry hair and scalp that I have had for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve never really tried to fix it. My wife bought this product for me after she saw lots of positive reviews online and I am glad she did. I would recommend this conditioner if you are looking for silky smooth and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair softer and shinier than any other conditioner I have used. It makes my hair literally feel like silk and I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through my hair all day. The smell is also pretty great. My wife is a big fan.And to top it all of it is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best conditioner on the market hands down. I always keep an extra bottle at home in case I run out before I remember to order some more. No other conditioner touches my hair now. Great Product!!</li>
            <li> They have some great products. used this together with their shampoo and oil and my hair loss was gone as well as gaining a head of fuller looking hair as well as silkier smoother and shiny hair. great product</li>
            <li> Love this product. Since I have started using it, my natural hair is more manageable. I also have less dandruff when I comb my hair.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I am a very sensitive person, I cannot use most of the products out there because  I am allergic to so many things. But I have not had any reaction to this product. And off course it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother and she loves it says it is doing wonders.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner and shampoo based on the great reviews. I love them!!! My hair has grown back and it&#x27;s much more healthy, feels soft &amp; more manageable.  I love this product &amp; will order again. Thank you pura d&#x27;or!!!</li>
            <li> amazing on my hair.. i love it</li>
            <li> Caused more hair loss and extreme dry scalp. Would never purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good for anyone who has issues with losing a lot of hair when using conditioner however it does not do a good job of leaving your hair untangled.</li>
            <li> I have switched hair products to this brand. I am older and am looking to end my hair loss. Since using this my hair has started looking better and I have noticed less loss. I recommend this brand. You get a lot and it works.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product along with the shampoo my hair is not falling out anymore.  I also take Vibrance vitamins for hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and I have noticed that using most shampoos makes my hair fall out more. To clarify one thing - I am not talking about cheap/reasonably priced hair products you buy over the counter. Over the years I have used mostly professional line shampoos. I recently switched to herbal and organic shampoos. I have used Mane n&#x27; Tail Gro Shampoo and Conditioner for quite some time first (which is much cheaper compared to what I usually buy!!!!) and noticed that herbal shampoos help slow down my hair loss. Based on the amount of Amazon reviews I&#x27;ve decided to give Pura d&#x27;or a chance as well. I do think it&#x27;s better than my previous shampoo as I notice even less shedding when washing my hair (I do it daily). I use the conditioner as well and leave it on for about 3-5mins. In addition to these products I take a DHT blocker supplement and also apply caffeine serum to my scalp. I have not noticed any new hair growth but I do believe its a good product to help prevent hair loss (have realistic expectations people!!!) :) I gave it 4 stars because I think this is still expensive for an organic shampoo. I will try the gold label next!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on great reviews. I believe it works, although to be honest, I started a lot of other treatments at about the same time (Biotin, Fo-Ti, and Reishi). In the areas where my hair was thinning, the hairs started looking thicker. And overall my hair was softer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Works really well and smells great!</li>
            <li> So far i am loving this product. I have use  every day. I have noticed not as much Hair loss.</li>
            <li> After losing a lot of my hair, I had to stop using conditioner because it was leaving my hair heavy, greasy, weighted down and it simply looked awful.  I previously purchased a bottle of the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Shampoo not too long ago and fell in love with it the first time I used it and immediately threw out all of my other shampoos.  After seeing how incredible my hair looked and felt with the shampoo, I figured I would take a shot at the conditioner, expecting the same lousy results all the other conditioners left me with but I was dead wrong. My hair is incredibly soft, so clean, looks fuller and smells fantastic.  I need to mention something else that I noticed within one week of using the Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Shampoo; for about 5 months I had a terrible cowlick that was so bad I had to completely change my hairstyle, where I part my hair AND almost always have it in a ponytail, bun etc. because that was the only way I could hide it.  One week after using the shampoo, I was thrilled to see that the cowlick had drastically improved, even though it&#x27;s still there it is MUCH better than it was. I have no idea how the shampoo helped it but it did.  I am absolutely in love with these products. Excellent Excellent Excellent!</li>
            <li> Nice light conditioner.  If you have long hair, a complementary product may be needed for your ends.</li>
            <li> i just started using it and will find out the result in a month or so</li>
            <li> After using the organic shampoo, I use the conditioner bottle. My hair is moisturized. It really works</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, Natural ingredients that keeps your hair very moist and healthy. You don&#x27;t have to use much of leave in hair for 2 mins and feel. The scent is nice it&#x27;s not strong and over barring leaves your hair feeling great. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice product. It has a very nice smell and leaves your hair soft. It is nice to have a product with out the harsh chemicals most stores carry. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love it. I always buy the conditioner along with the shampoo. This product smells good and I my husband and my kids use it as well. I recommend it to my family members, and friends who are also struggling with hair loss. They have purchased this item and will recommend it to as many people as they can.</li>
            <li> Love purador products but this one fell short. I can&#x27;t get past the smell, it smells like baby wash. A baby powder smell. I thought with lavender and vanilla I would of hit the jackpot. I was wrong. If you love the smell than you will be enjoy this. Not me. Maybe the company can add some essential oil which I did to get past the smell to use it. I know I&#x27;m crazy, I don&#x27;t care for the baby powder smell. It&#x27;s that pink baby soft stuff the cheap one that&#x27;s what it smells like. Yuck.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so greasy as regular brand conditioners, which I guess maybe because of the lack of chemical components to help you getting the feeling of smoothness, that&#x27;s why if you do want to achieve the same kind of feeling of nourishing after bath, you have to put a bit more on your hair and let it stay for a longer time before rinsing off. However, as I have to make up my grey hair by dyeing from time to time, and so far I can&#x27;t find a hair dye product pure organic and finishing the job in an efficient way ( I really don&#x27;t have time for those Indian hannah to take several hours to effect), I decided every other hair care product I use shall be as organic as possible, so as to reduce the chemical stimulus as much as possible, that&#x27;s why I switched to this brand.</li>
            <li> Fantastic combination with Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention shampoo and my hair are really vitalised and they smell really nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan Oil for years with excellent results on my hair, but after a day or two my head would feel dry again. I&#x27;ve lived in tropical and blizzard-like climates and the same holds true. So I decided try to some Argan based but with other nutrients for the scalp etc. I&#x27;m glad I did--I&#x27;m ready for the blizzard, I&#x27;ll follow up when I get a chance to go down by the Equator.</li>
            <li> I have been using for the last month and highly recommend.  My wife loves it and thinks its a great product! A little bit goes a long way...</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry and matted.</li>
            <li> This conditioner (and shampoo) is of quality and leaves my hair feeling thicker, less dry and easily managed. My girlfriene loves the way it makes my hair smell and I do as well. I can&#x27;t say it has caused hair to grow, but it hasn&#x27;t done the opposite and for that I am happy.</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old man and I have been using this product for about 3 weeks in conduction with their hair loss shampoo. My hair loss has nearly stopped.  I can tell because I have no shedding when I comb or run my fingers through my hair.  Also the volume of my hair is substantially more.  I think this conditioner made my hair healthier.  I use to hold a mirror above my head and could see my scalp :( now I can barely see my scalp! I no longer do the combover or spend 30 minutes teasing my hair to get it just right to hide bald spots!! I will continue to use this product and have thrown away all my other conditioners.  My hair is thick, voluminous and shiny.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and it lathers very well but just does not leave my hair as soft as it could be for the price point. I would definitely buy it again however for those with thick coarse hair like myself it may require the use of more.</li>
            <li> Amazing product by purador. I used this oil because I have acne scars from my earlier years. I started using this immediately based on the feedback from other customers who have great results. The first night I used it, I could feel the nourishment provided by this oil. After just a couple of days I saw the results too. I recommend this for anyone looking for skin relief from the plague of acne.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and the conditioner made my hair so dry and actually I lost more hair! I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> great product.&lt;br /&gt;gentle and good results on preventing hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;my hair feels great and I have noticed losing less hair while shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given the product a 5 star if the price was a little more affordable.</li>
            <li> It smells good and working</li>
            <li> Love the smell. It leaves hair shiny and voluminous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or shampoo for a couple months and my hair looks great so I decided to try their conditioner even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey. It is worth it! Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but makes it easy to comb and manageable. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This stuff along with the hair loss prevention shampoo and pure argan oil have really improved the condition of my damaged hair! A hairdresser fried my hair and after a few weeks of these products it has helped with the texture and dryness tremendously. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great product! I took a 30 day before and after picture and noticed a huge difference. My barber also noticed a difference, the hair growth was thicker and was faster than normal. I used this a long with pura d&#x27;or shampoo and Biotin supplement. Will continue to use!</li>
            <li> Made my hair very easy to comb through - great smell and left my hair extra soft.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair and makes my head itch. After getting out of the shower I have to use Detangler to help brush through my hair. The shampoo works great but I won&#x27;t be buying this conditioner again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying natural remedies for hair growth for almost a month and recently I decided to try this product. It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to fully review the product. I&#x27;m still losing hair as usual. The shampoo lathers well however my hair feels dry and coarse. I guess I was used to the softness texture from the coconut oil. I will update reviews accordingly after longer periods of use.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair nice and silky smooth. I always have a difficult time finding a conditioner because my hair is curly and most conditioners leave hair snarly. I had the same experience with this conditioner. However I mix a few pumps of the Pura d&#x27;or Conditioner with my other conditioner and find that it works well. I still get the silky smooth results without all the tangles.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.It smells great and lasts for a long time. It softens and tames my hair big time. Plus it&#x27;s organic. I am very happy with the conditioner especially that it is organic.</li>
            <li> It smells good and has made my hair thicker and fuller. I used to get dry scalp after using their shampoo, but after using this conditioner I have no more dry scalp. It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. It&#x27;s not as instantly conditioning as other conditioners, but my hair feels really nice after using, and, as noted before, it smells so nice.</li>
            <li> OH my... combined with the shampoo...LOVE...LOVE...LOVE! I can go 3-4 days without washing...no weigh down...I have fine, colored hair...perfect for me....would recommend 110%</li>
            <li> Wow Sensational I have never in my life experienced so much satisfaction in coming into contact with any concept or circumstance which could yield so.</li>
            <li> I waited a good 6 weeks before posting this review as I believe a product like this takes time to see and feel genuine results.&lt;br /&gt;Will it restore your hair and grow it back? I doubt it!&lt;br /&gt;Will it keep it feeling thicker and healthier and potentially halt or slow down the balding process? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels incredible with this conditioner which I use in conjunction with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it and will continue to use it well after this review is submitted.</li>
            <li> This organic conditioner smells great and gives my hair a soft, silky texture. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a very good conditioner.  Left my hair in more tangles than it was prior to using it. Had a lot of firzzies from it.  Would have been better not to have used it at all.</li>
            <li> This conditioner in use with Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo is the perfect combination. I love the smell of the conditioner. It does its job perfectly. My hair feels very elastic, strong and is very shiny. I love both products and will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband who has been using for little over a month coupled with the anti-hair loss conditioner.  Not enough time to really see real improvement but he likes it for it&#x27;s cleaning properties.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  It has a light scent and leaves my hair soft, silky and managable.  It is wonderful to find a product that works and is also good for my hair.  I have been using it for about three weeks and like it so much that I am going to try the shampoo.  I give it an A+++.</li>
            <li> second time to buy it. Use with the shampoo will tremendously reduce hair loss. It also makes your hair soft and smell nice!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner smells good too</li>
            <li> So good. Noticed a difference in the thickness of my hair in about a month. I have tried many thickening shampoos and they just didn&#x27;t work. This one def did wonders.</li>
            <li> I am a young male with very thick but coarse, curly hair. A few months ago I decided to switch to Silk 18 which costs about $12 for a 8 ounce bottle. The conditioner made my hair spell like vanilla and feel amazingly smooth in the shower, however when my hair dried it was still dry and frizzy. With pura d&#x27;or conditioner it doesn&#x27;t feel or smell very good while in the shower but when it dries it leaves my hair much more smooth and frizz free. I love this conditioner especially since it was a bit cheaper at $20 for a 16 ounce bottle. The one downside I have to it is the smell but that isn&#x27;t a big deal really after your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Did not give any body to my hair.  Used it several times, made it very flat</li>
            <li> I really do not like this stuff.  The smell is awful!  Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> Towards the middle of 2014, I started researching oils for skin, hair, to nails to see what they were all about because so many oils were being touted as the solution to all our beauty needs. As a kid, we all opened the Vitamin E capsules and they were always great with sunburns and so forth, but that was the extent of my knowledge. I then got into Coconut anything in my teens and moved on to Jojoba and Cocoa butters. The market is flooded with bringing back oils, which not too long ago was seen as a major no-no and especially for suffers of oily skin. I suffer from combination skin and this includes my scalp’s skin where I fluctuate with what the weather and seasons bring. One Winter I could have a normal scalp and the next Winter it could be dry, so it’s also skin with a temper and if you ask me, sort of moody. To squash the moodiness, I learned that simple is better when it comes to what I put on my skin and this includes my hair and scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner smells a little stronger (aromatic) in scent from it’s shampoo counterpart, but nonetheless still very pleasant and it’s a nice clean but light scent. The vanilla and lavender combo almost works like aromatherapy because of the calming nature of both fragrances. The conditioner I focused more on application to my strands, versus the roots of my hair. I left the product on for 2 to 3 minutes, depending what styling products I had used that day. This method allows me to customize my hair’s needs because even though I try to use the most kindest of products, hair spray and even a touch of it is not so nice when comes to build-up. That is one thing this conditioner did not have, was any build up effect and especially after continuous use. You are left with soft locks that tend to need less leave-in oils/styling treatments when you get to the drying stage of your hair. Again, you will love the scent and feel your hair gets from this conditioner and if you have to choose to try just 1 product from the duo, try this conditioner!

            <li> We used it along with the shampoo of this same company. Good one to use. The hair becomes fluffier and any smell from the shampoo goes away.</li>
            <li> fantastic conditioner. Leaves hair silky and smooth. Will buy again...no doubt about it!</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner to go along with the most amazing shampoo!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. LESS HAIR FALLOUT.</li>
            <li> One of the best ever conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. Fragrance is light and fresh, and leaves the hair light as feather. Love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any improvement in my hair at all. I bought it based on the great reviews but what a disappointment. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> only used it for a short time but will keep on using it</li>
            <li> I have been using the pura d&#x27;or shampoo for a long time now and ordered the conditioner by mistake, thinking that it was the shampoo. What a pleasant surprise. I didn&#x27;t even know they had a conditioner and now I will purchase them together. I have long hair and it is simply not an option to go without conditioning. My hair was left smooth, shiny and feels great.</li>
            <li> This is a really solid hair conditioner that I find leaves my hair with a clean look and a texture that I can style.  I don&#x27;t believe that any conditioner is going to prevent hair loss, but I do believe certain ones give a much better appearance of density.  This is currently my favorite conditioner for thin hair since the original Nioxin 2 scalp therapy formula (not the new trash that they&#x27;ve been putting in bottles for the last few years).</li>
            <li> Very nice product and it goes hand in hand with the pura d&#x27;or shampoo! Love it, Love it, Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this shampoo for 8 months now. It says that it slows hair loss, and that is actually true. So that&#x27;s a plus.  A bit pricey for sure, but the bottle lasts 3 months before it is empty</li>
            <li> Great product. Love how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner and it has a great scent and leaves my hair shiny and it smell fresh &amp; clean without harmful chemicals &amp; sulfates, so its a big bonus!</li>
            <li> Two bottles and zero effects. Just high priced shampoo. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind an intense coconut scent (not lavender!) left on your hair and the fact that you need another product for detangling after applying Pura D&#x27;Or&#x27;s blue conditioner, go for it.  Also, the problem with these type of container tops is that after you manage to open the top, if kept open, water somehow gets into it and dilutes the product and they are a hassle to close.</li>
            <li> The Pura d&#x27;or shampoo is fantastic and stopped my hair loss immediately.  The conditioner is equally as wonderful.  I have received lots of compliments after using both the shampoo and conditioner.  I love the fact that the shampoo contains a DHT fighter.  My hair was literally falling out and dissolving at the same time.  I have used these products for several months now and my hair has never been better.  I have recommended these products to all of my family and friends.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it. didn&#x27;t detangle my hair and made it very hard to brush after the shower. felt a little harsh. may finish the bottle but add another conditioner to help detangle my hair more. will continue use and update later</li>
            <li> so far i have not seen any results still lots of hair in shower.  It&#x27;s hard to comb my hair after use, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not conditioning the hair.  I will keep using to finish the bottle, but do not think i will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This conditionner is awesome.  I am allergic to anything fragrance.  I have tried many different types of shampoo and conditioner.  Ever since I started used pura d&#x27;or my rashes have completely disappeared.  This is better than going to the dermatologist and using whatever  they recommended.  I love the healthy smell of the ingredients used and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for us &amp;#34;thinners.&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product, the hair look healthy and clean. If you have long hair though, it will be difficult to comb them, so you might not enjoy this product. Works great for short hair and up to the shoulders.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for what I think is a perfumy smell to this conditioner and I don&#x27;t know if it is needed with the gold shampoo for thinning hair to work good or not. I tried calling the maker of the product and they never called me back the few times I called and left a message and because of these reasons I won&#x27;t  continue to use the product if I can&#x27;t get definite answers to my questions. Others love it but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Good second act to the Gold label.  I&#x27;ve tried both shampoo&#x27;s but I think the Gold label it better with the conditioner.  Hair always feels silky and smooth after.</li>
            <li> Loved the product for what I needed in my hair to make it look shiny and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have NOT been using this with biotin as an oral supplement because I wanted to see how affective this was alone. Probably a 10% reduction in hair loss *maybe*. For the price (for the shampoo and conditioner) I expected more.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scent nor how dry it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not sure of is if the Shampoo and Conditioner products are  wheat and gluten free?? I would appreciate knowing, Thank you. Have not noticed a difference in my hair growth or thickness yet. So it&#x27;s hard for me to rate. I do like the fact this product is made with mostly organic oils. Received product on time, Thank You!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It is very creamy, and together with the shampoo, left my hair bouncy and full. The scent is very light - not overpowering, which I like.  I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner ever!! works great along with the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I just started to use the product last week.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I did not use this product as I have other issues making hair thin. I sent back as I am addressing this differently than just shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I might end up giving this product five stars, but since it&#x27;s relatively new to me, I am going for four. So far, the claims from Pura d&#x27;or appear to be true. There are no chemicals in the shampoo, it lathers up very nicely, it has a pretty nice smell, my hair does feel fuller, and the argan oil does also make my hair feel much softer. I&#x27;d love to see it slow down the loss as well. Only time will tell on that, but it is nice using a product that works so well with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week but really like it so far as my hair looks more naturally healthy, has more body and feels thicker. Initially it doesn&#x27;t feel as rich as some of the other conditioners I&#x27;ve used but the proof is in how my hair looks when its dry and styled... not when a thick conditioner is supposedly penetrating my hair follicles in the shower. I also like the fact that its all natural and better for the environment.</li>
            <li> I wanted to LOVE this conditioner as much as the shampoo. After using it, I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through my hair. I now use it sparingly as a leave in conditioner. It might be because I have chemically treated hair? Oh well, I gave it a try. I will keep using the shampoo so my hair continues to grow and stop thinning :)[[ASIN:B0079R6BD2 Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo, Brown and Blue, 16 Fluid Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to go to TJMaxx (cheap Natural hair products) or the Health Food Store and get Conditoner for Fine Hair (organic type) and use instead. So if you find that for some reason or other a conditioner does not work, try using it as a leave in. Use only a small amount. Enough to get a comb through. More in winter and less in summer.</li>
            <li> Still using  the first bottle  so far I have already seen a big difference I have  less hair loss and my curls  are coming back.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner along with the PURAD&#x27;OR shampoo.  It did not leave my hair completely soft but it works.  I want to use both in order to get better results.</li>
            <li> What a mild fragrance , I just love it. My hair look really shiny just after 2 applications. However, while applying, it didn&#x27;t give me enough confidence that my hair will be easy ti untangle but  they were. Will wait to see long term results of this product.</li>
            <li> Love thi s stuff so much! Its natural and smells fantastic. I have thick hair and it makes it so smooth!</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair.  Didn&#x27;t see that it helped with loss or regrowth.  A tablespoon or two of evening primrose oil taken internally, every day, along with fresh, organic healthy food, multi-vitamins, lots of exercise and visualization is what worked best for me.  Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> it leaves you hair shinny and healthy</li>
            <li> I have very baby fine long hair. this made my hair FLAT, made it very greasy looky, which made my color extra dull looking. Not to mention it did nothing for the thikness of my hair. EXTREMLY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product until after my hair had been colored. I use a very expensive organic hair color and I wanted to see if this conditioner was truly color safe and it is - no color residue on my white hair towels! Pura d&#x27;or Premium Organic Argan Oil Conditioner leaves my hair very silky and sleek all day long (unlike many other argan oil conditioners I&#x27;ve tried that tended to leave my hair feeling heavy) but is not too soft - it allows my hair to be manageable and holds any styling well. Treat yourself to some soothing aromatherapy while giving your hair a wonderful, pure, and organic conditioning - great product!</li>
            <li> Nice organic product.  Mild natural lavender scent.  Easy to distribute through hair.  Conditions well - leaves hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love using this product. Makes my hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li> Rated a 3 because I&#x27;m not sure yet of the results.. After washing with the Premium Pura d&#x27; anti-loss shampoo, My hair is fine texture but alot of it and after using this for about a month now, my hair is still tangled and takes awhile to come through.. I do have some hair growth, but still not totally convinced of the overall expectations.  I do color treat my hair and notice the color has retained.  Still waiting for the other results others have claimed.  Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s hair and circumstances varies.  So i&#x27;m still hopeful.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner as it is very light on my thinning, fine, curly hair. I live in a very dry climate. I use only conditioner without shampoo. I have to get used to how light the conditioner is and leave on some after rinsing. It is very mild and has a nice scent. I think that in addition to this conditioner, I may purchase the argan oil for styling.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is outstanding in every way. For me it replaces and exceeds the Progaine Shampoo which I had been using until it had become discontinued. Having tried many so called replacements, I found Pura d&#x27;or to be exactly what it purports to be. It has, after a few weeks use, really started to deal with my thinning hair by imparting great volume to it. Secondly it has stopped hair loss and seems to have begun to regain some of the loss to my great satisfaction. After each use, my hair and scalp feel \\&quot;energized,\\&quot; if that is the proper term and I am able to groom it properly. The thickness of the hair is apparent and it looks great. I strongly recommend a try of Pura d&#x27;or. I have been pleasantly surprised by its effectiveness and have become a true fan.</li>
            <li> To be truthful I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work. You here about all these shampoos and conditioners that work that help your hair from falling out. You buy it and it doesn&#x27;t work. This one did. I have valley fever and I am on a medication called fluconazole.  It makes your hair fall out in clumps.  I&#x27;ve been depressed crying and in tears every time I washed my hair or brushed it. My hair stopped falling out so much the day I started using the shampoo and conditioner. It was amazing. It is a little expensive for shampoo and conditioner but it was worth every penny. I just hope my hair starts growing back now.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have tried so many name brands before, but this one not only helps to keep your hair soft but also avoid unnecessary breakage during and after the hair wash. I recommend trying it with the shampoo because if I use it after a different brand shampoo, I do not get the same fresh smell after washing my hair due the mixed scents.</li>
            <li> Smells great and helps tame my frizzy, curly hair!!</li>
            <li> Was good and helped me comb my hair out of tangles. After the shampoo helped me comb my hair without breaking any. Also provided a shine to my hair. I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is pretty good. I bought the shampoo (LOVE THE HAIR LOSS PREVENTION SHAMPOO) and conditioner together and I can definitely see an improvement in my hair&#x27;s texture, and regrowth but I have to use Moroccan oil in addition to the conditioner after my shower to keep my hair silky smooth. I would buy it again because I have been trying to grow out my hair forever and using this combo of products over the last month, my hair has grown about an inch and a half - which is BIG for me!</li>
            <li> Great find!  Left my wife&#x27;s hair hydrated and silky and it pairs well with my hair loss prevention shampoo.  We actually don&#x27;t mind the smell out all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells good, I used few days, it&#x27;s really helped save my hair. I will continue use this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 08 months and is the best so far, besides the added benefit of it being organic I don&#x27;t have a need anymore to use gel because I love the way the hair looks after it dries out. I also recommend the shampoo by Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo - that I love.  This conditioner is OK; but if you have long hair like I do - it will not de-tangle it.</li>
            <li> Awesomely effective. I want more!!</li>
            <li> i feel a little bit dry after using it, but it helps to control oil</li>
            <li> I really like this product, my hair stopped falling out and instead I see new baby hair all over my head ! I tried many  other  products and decided to stick to this one , I highly recommend it to others 😊.  ( this is what my hair looks like shiny and healthy)</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews and purchasing this product I had a hard time coming to terms with the disappointment. But, after a few uses it was undeniable. This product was terrible, both shampoo and conditioner were dulling and drying. I use it on my dog now: ( I would not buy again or recommend, felt like detergent.</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken when it arrived. Conditioner is nice but doesn&#x27;t wash out well. Weighs hair down. Too expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> Bottom line this product will prevent your hair loss, that what I noticed for the last three weeks I&#x27;m using it with the Pura d&#x27;or hair loss prevention</li>
            <li> Great natural conditioner. Moisturizes and strengthens my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely, the best working conditioner for my hair and scalp. Doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down my already thin hair and leaves a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> Yes, and then used the Organic Conditioner.  It has a nice aroma and no harsh chemicals and additives.  My hair has more shine and is so much more manageable than before using this product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this a while back and since then, I have found it to be one of the best conditioner for my hair.  Before using it, my hair usually feels very dry.  I also really like the scent as well.  It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I won&#x27;t use anything else, ever again..it makes my hair soft &amp; silky &amp; my hair is no longer falling out by the handful &amp; is actually growing back in!</li>
            <li> Loved it fuller hair.</li>
            <li> I first used this product about a month back when I ran out of hair conditioner and my roommate had this one on the bathtub shelf. I wanted to try it out for a while before ordering one for myself. After having used for a few weeks, I feel it is a very good conditioner as compared to the other ones in the market - it&#x27;s organic and there is no SLS. I am assuming it&#x27;s true as it is written on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will have to use more to give better insights.</li>
            <li> Works well with Shampoo, leaved hair nice after wash. Smells like lavender. Would recommend product to create line with scent for men.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Helped me recover from temporary alopecia.  Helped regenerate hair regrowth in patches where I had lost it.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So far had a few uses and definitely like this product overall!  It does not leave the overly weighed down/super slick feeling on your hair (that can be good or bad based on what you like) and the smell is not knock-you-flat overwhelming, either. Feels a lot different going on than most commercial conditioners and so far my hair seems to be responding well to it.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old male I&#x27;ve been losing my hair on the front crown so I decided to try this product after reading many reviews after 6 month of use I am disappointed to see that it has not helped at all my hair Is still falling out at the same rate it was before I used this product.</li>
            <li> It is the best by far conditioner that I have put in my hair. I can honestly say, that i do not think  it will grow hair? But if you continue to use this product it will prevent you from losing  your hair! I do not know how it works, but take my word for it. The shampoo is also excellent!</li>
            <li> love this conditioner. the only thing that works for my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this conditioner after using their hair loss shampoo.  The shampoo left my hair feeling clean but the ends of my hair tangled easily.  This conditioner took care of that!  I love the scent!</li>
            <li> I moved to colorado in december 2013 from india. I started experiencing immense amount of hairfall in the initial days which added to my concern . Initially, I used a conditioner which had chemicals in it . That did not help but made the matters worse. Then i read stuff about organic shampoos and conditioners and bought one but it did not help me either. Then i read reviews about Pura d&#x27;or organic conditionerand started using it . This product has given strength to my hair and has reduced the hairfall to an extent . It is bit pricey but worth everything you spend. I will continue to use this product in the future as well</li>
            <li> I have some gray hair, so I decided to give it a try. Used it for few days and I feel my hair is getting better, but not sure if it works with gray hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> If i could give this conditioner a million starts I would! I ABSOLUTELY loved this!!! The smell, ohhh myyy!!! It smells SO good and the scent stays in your hair for days! It made my hair completely smooth and eliminated my frizz. I would go great lengths for this conditioner and am quite sure it has completely taken over my old favorites. $20 is NOTHING for a holy grail product like this and its organic and cruelty free!! Thank you Pura d&#x27;or!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> Good product. Smell very nice.</li>
            <li> I’ve got hairloss problem and I am very careful with the type of shampoo I used. Conditioner is okay but shampoo definitely a no-no. Once I used the wrong shampoo, I get dandruffs, oily hair and even more hair gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve found a way to fight my hair problem. Mon-friday I used Purador shampoo. I like it a lot, the smell is amazing after using few days I have already noticed that I am not losing hair as much as before. I really love this product. I will highly recommend to anyone who is looking for the best product. Esp. Argan oil heal your hair follicles and nourish your hair. Everyone commons how shiny my hair looks, thanks to the Purador.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to reorder and recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I loved it specially it smells great</li>
            <li> Wonderful, fair pricing and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> BEWARE!!!! A HUGE MAJORITY of these 5 star reviews are solely written by the reviewer to get a free bottle of this conditioner. BARELY ANY OF THEM TRUE.. I have used this shampoo for over 3 months with no improvement in my hair loss. It has actually dried my hair out even more than before and has given me bad dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please stay away and do not support this SCAM. I rarely write reviews, but had to write one for this SCAM.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo (gold) this conditioner (blue)  for about 5 weeks and have been very happy with both.  I like the way the conditioner leaves the texture of my hair, and the mild smell of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months and my hair looks and feels great. I love the smell. The added bonus is that I feel good knowing this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> I love trying out new and different hair care products. I also have 2 daughters that help out with the reviews for certain products, hair care is one of them. My hair is normal, a little drier than I would like from coloring and everyday wear and tear so trying to find products that actually work is always a chore. There are some tried and true brands I stick with but I do love to at least try others out. Ya never know when the next best thing will come along!&lt;br /&gt;So I was offered the opportunity to try, and review Pura d&#x27;or Hair and Body Care products.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo, Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil Premim Organic Conditioner, and the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil Body, Hair &amp;Face Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the products first and then let the girls each give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;The Premium Organic Argan Oil Based Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo is one of a kind. It contains 12 DHT Blockers, creates thicker hair and prevents from further hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;The Premium Organic Argan Oil Based Conditioner adds texture, shine and volume to hair. Our shampoos and conditioners are free from SLS, Parabens and Gluten!&lt;br /&gt; I tried the shampoo and conditioner first the day after they got here. The Pura d&#x27;or Shampoo cleaned my hair well. No residue left behind and it was easy to use. The shampoo was a thinner consistency, but nice and easy to rinse out also. It did leave my hair feeling a little dry, I guess is what I would say. I was in the shower when I used it but I think it more felt over clean...if that makes any sense. At that point I wasn&#x27;t too sure the conditioner was going to work, I assumed it was going to leave it feeling dried out too. Thankfully that was not the case. The Pura d&#x27;or Conditioner worked awesome! The conditioner has a thicker consistency and it was easy to use and rinse. No residue left behind when I used it either. The conditioner worked itself left my hair soft, smooth, and manageable. The scent of the shampoo was an earthysmell. It was a good smell but not usually a scent I would choose for my hair care products. I guess it didn&#x27;t matter too much because the conditioner smelled great. Strong enough but not too strong and overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters each tried the shampoo and conditioner too. Emmaleigh (5)  said &amp;#34;I love this stuff!&amp;#34; when she came out of the bath. She has long hair and it tends to get tangled but that wasn&#x27;t the case when she used Pura d&#x27;or. Tierney (11) loves to try anything related to hair and beauty and she loved it too. She was not as excited as Emmaleigh but she did say her hair felt smoother and it was easier to brush after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I tried the Pura d&#x27;or Argan Oil Body, Hair &amp;Face Treatment. It smelled like the shampoo, the Argan Oil does have a distinct scent. It was not oily and left no residue or flakes. The oil did help keep my face feel moisturized and fresh. Pura d&#x27;or The Pure and Organic Argan is great for skin! It&#x27;s 100% cold pressed. It helps create smoother skin, restores nutrients to cells and reduces scars.&lt;br /&gt;See FULL REVIEW HERE  ----&amp;#62; http://aimlessmoments.blogspot.com/2015/03/pura-dor-hair-body-care-review.html</li>
            <li> I am using this in conjunction with Pura D’or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo Scalp &amp; Dandruff Treatment to help sooth my scalp. It feels rich when applying it and makes my hair feel smooth and and silky as well as making it tangle free and shiny. I feel that it is helping to moisturize my scalp and battle the dryness that I have. I can honestly say that it work as well as my $30+ salon conditioner and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It really works on my hair and make my oily scalp comfortable. Other products always emphasize how merriment they will be but I don&#x27;t need it. I have an oily scalp. Thanks for the fantastic thing. Only one pro, it is a small bottle and expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and thus far I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  My hair looks thicker and feels softer when I&#x27;m using it.  I like the way it makes my hair look as well, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and buying it from groupon and love it. When I received it from Amazon both bottles were damaged and leaking.</li>
            <li> Great product, will buy again</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of weird</li>
            <li> No change noted, what a waste of money. What was I thinking when I placed this order?</li>
            <li> I purchased blue bottle Pura D&#x27;or Hair loss Prevention shampoo and found it it is real works for me. Shampoo is a bit pricey but worth the cost. Over the several weeks using it I have found less hair loss and my hair is getting thicker. I also like the natural fragrance and ingredients.  I would recommend it highly and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I think that this is better than the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and conditioner. They leave my hair soft and shiny, and reduce the amount of hair loss. I recommend it.</li>
