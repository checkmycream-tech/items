            <li> This is the only tears eye drops that last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use these all day long</li>
            <li> but those 15 minutes feel like heaven if you have burning, gritty, dry eyes like mine!!  </li>
            <li> For me, Product left residue on my eyelashes and increased frequency of foreign matter getting in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have dry eyes and wear contact lenses.</li>
            <li> you wear contacts or have dry eyes or both</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry eyes.</li>
            <li> this product soothed my dry eye discomfort.</li>
            <li> Also, it takes away the foreign object feeling.</li>
            <li> More irritating than the regular artificial tears had been.  </li>
            <li> creates extreme blurriness!  </li>
            <li> just use the drops when you have a little time to just sit and relax, or before bed.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes they burn like crazy, they are so extremely dry (especially in winter when the furnace air is blowing inside the house).  </li>
            <li> In the picture say sensitive, I did not get those really disappointed ðŸ˜¢</li>
            <li> This product has been just as, if not more irritating to my eyes that the dry eyes the Doc said I needed artificial Tears without Preservatives for.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, del&#x27;d on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, on the recommendation of my eye doc.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes and wear contact lenses. This particular refresh is too think and gooey for use except at night and I honestly don&#x27;t really like it for that use either. I&#x27;d go with Refresh P.M. for night time use and stick with Refresh contacts for daytime. This was not a winner for me.</li>
            <li> Oh man!! I have some really dry eyes, thanks to Sjogrens disease.  Sometimes they burn like crazy, they are so extremely dry (especially in winter when the furnace air is blowing inside the house).  When I use Celluvisc drops, it&#x27;s like putting out a fire.  It feels so so good.  These are the best gel drops out there.  My opthamologist told me to always use the PRESERVATIVE FREE drops because the drops that contain preservatives can end up actually irritating your eyes more!!!  So I tried these drops and wow, they are fabulous for severe dry eye.  If you happen to have Sjogrens, give these drops a try.  They will make your eyes blurry for about 15 minutes after applying, they are gel....but those 15 minutes feel like heaven if you have burning, gritty, dry eyes like mine!!  I highly recommend these drops.  Just don&#x27;t use them if you have to drive right away or do anything that requires your eyes to be clear......just use the drops when you have a little time to just sit and relax, or before bed.  Excellent product.  Best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product as stated</li>
            <li> In the picture say sensitive, I did not get those really disappointed ðŸ˜¢</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best, not the worst, it&#x27;s pretty good especially for the price.  Does what I need it to do and I guess nothing more to say after that</li>
            <li> I use these all day long</li>
            <li> Use it 2 times a day; only way my dry eyes can stay healthy. My doctor recommended it and I haven&#x27;t looked back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear contacts or have dry eyes or both</li>
            <li> I use these all the time for an eye that does not close properly and would be lost without them.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry eyes. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lubricating opth drops. This is the only tears eye drops that last for a long time. Also, it takes away the foreign object feeling. These are pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> For me, Product left residue on my eyelashes and increased frequency of foreign matter getting in my eyes.  It may work better for other persons.&lt;br /&gt;Vendor was fine (5 star).  Delivered product as ordered and on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly all the popular drops and these are the best for my eyes that get dry easily if I don&#x27;t get a full night&#x27;s sleep</li>
            <li> Refresh works wonderfully...this product soothed my dry eye discomfort. Just the right thickness.</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time and is the same quality product I always buy.</li>
            <li> These areiteraaly the only drops that work for me!</li>
            <li> creates extreme blurriness!  Not usable during the day when one needs to see!</li>
            <li> This product has been just as, if not more irritating to my eyes that the dry eyes the Doc said I needed artificial Tears without Preservatives for.  More irritating than the regular artificial tears had been.  Currently only puttingh them into eyes at bedtime instead of 4x/day as Doc wanted.  Two stars are for prompt delivery.  No problems with seller of this product, just effects</li>
            <li> Great for extreme dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worried these are counterfeit. I&#x27;ve been using celluvisc for over a year and they&#x27;ve never made my eyes feel drier!</li>
