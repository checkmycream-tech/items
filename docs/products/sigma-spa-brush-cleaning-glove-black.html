            <li>Works like the best and easiest brush cleaner</li>
            <li>Watch video and learn the best tips for use.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I especially liked the ridges where you can squeeze the brushes between finger and thumb.</li>
            <li>Marvelous cleaning glove!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I found this.</li>
            <li>so I take good care of them.</li>
            <li>Something to clean your brushes without them being ruined with your hands, great invention!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what you should have to clean your wonderful brushes!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>WHO DOESNT LOVE THAT!</li>
            <li>Perfect for cleaning my new brushes!!</li>
            <li>BECAUSE THIS GLOVE IS AMAZING</li>
            <li>I own a lot of makeup brushes and this has been a lifesaver for my hands.</li>
            <li>Some brushes are so dense and can hold a lot of product, so that came in handy.</li>
            <li>Good business, and love the product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the glove it work great</li>
            <li>The bumps wash the deeper parts of large powder brushes and foundation kabukis which is great.</li>
            <li>Also, it would be better if it came in a lighter color</li>
            <li>I guess if you use a lotion type product it would be better</li>
            <li>I have been using sigma products for a year now and love them all.</li>
            <li>Makes washing my brushes much easier and more pleasant to do.</li>
            <li>Washes my brushes very clean.</li>
            <li>so I was hoping this glove would be more efficient than my original way</li>
            <li>True, but this was more comfortable with the interior mitt, AND the rinsing grooves made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The glove is very easy to use and, I believe, does a better job in really getting the brushes clean.</li>
            <li>The glove is very handy when cleaning my brushes and makes the whole process much faster.</li>
            <li>I used baby shampoo and was delighted at how easy it was to get all the gross product build up out of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to you if you do a lot of makeup and need to clean your brushes</li>
            <li>Good, But not necessary.</li>
            <li>It also causes me to wash my brush more frequently because it is so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Also, the little microfiber insert helps keep my hand cool when I use warm water and it assists with my neurosis about spiders hiding in my gloves because I can take it out and check!</li>
            <li>Making this WELL worth the investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HAD TO TURN MY WRIST DRAMATICALLY TO GET IT TO SIT RIGHT IN MY HAND.</li>
            <li>, I GET MY BRUSHES CLEAN SOOOO MUCH FASTER, AND</li>
            <li>This really helps to clean the brush well.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what video says.  </li>
            <li>So, in the end I think its more necessary</li>
            <li>I purchased this Sigma Spa Brush Cleaning Glove to handle the many high-end brushes I use on a daily basis - including Sigma, MAC and Hourglass (foundation).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty straight forward</li>
            <li>Other than that, I use it all the time to wash my brushes and don&#x27;t need to use that much moisturizer during the day since my hands are nicely protected.</li>
            <li>I picked this as it was the right price for getting free shipping, although I&#x27;d probably pick the flat sink one now that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>I like this for my large brushes.</li>
            <li>I REALLY WANT TO GIVE THIS A FIVE STAR</li>
            <li>but it goes fast</li>
            <li>I had 50 brushes to deep clean and kept putting it off until I saw sigmas brush cleaning helpers.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have full control of the entire glove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a brand new brush!</li>
            <li>Makes washing brushes soo easy, it literally takes a couple mins per brush, 30$ well spent</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to those of you who are makeup artists and keep a collection of brushes for yourself and your makeup kit.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because a blogger I follow on Instagram highly recommended it and since I&#x27;m diligent with cleaning my makeup brushes</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t take long to clean them.</li>
            <li>so I could see my makeup cleaner which is a light pink and the consistency of water.</li>
            <li>BUT ITS DOESNT BY FAR FEEL</li>
            <li>AS NATURAL TO WEAR AS AN OVEN MIT.</li>
            <li>And that whole still deep up there if you pry the bristles apart discoloration of foundation -</li>
            <li>But unfortunately the only good thing about this glove is that it allows you to really get all the makeup out of the bristles.</li>
            <li>but honestly I&#x27;m chalking this up to another gadget I will never use again because of the poor design.</li>
            <li>I THINK THE THUMB MY BE OFF SET TO FAR BACK.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t use your bare hands.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the design of this glove is way too big, the rubber part doesn&#x27;t fit snug enough on my hand so that made it hard to use.</li>
            <li>Because of the glove being black and really too big when I poured my makeup remover on the glove it immediately runs off of it.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is this glove was not easy to use when you only have one hand to use to pour your cleanser, wipe and clean your brushes while your other hand is inside this bulky glove</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š. My daughter-in-law requested it for Christmas.  Between her, my daughter and me, we had about 15 different shapes and sizes of brushes. Didn&#x27;t take long to clean them. She loves it, now I need to get my daughter one.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the glove cuts cleaning brush time in half! I love it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the glove it work great but the second time it started to leak water to the inside the glove which I didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Amazing brush!!!! Makes washing brushes soo easy, it literally takes a couple mins per brush, 30$ well spent</li>
            <li> Makes washing my brushes much easier and more pleasant to do. I&#x27;m happy I found this. Excellent product for completing the task.</li>
            <li> I REALLY WANT TO GIVE THIS A FIVE STAR BECAUSE THIS GLOVE IS AMAZING AT WHAT IT DOES, I GET MY BRUSHES CLEAN SOOOO MUCH FASTER, AND WHO DOESNT LOVE THAT! MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS GLOVE IS ITS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR. I HAD TO TURN MY WRIST DRAMATICALLY TO GET IT TO SIT RIGHT IN MY HAND. I THINK THE THUMB MY BE OFF SET TO FAR BACK. WHEN YOU SEE THIS GLOVE YOU MIGHT THING OVEN MIT BUT ITS DOESNT BY FAR FEEL AS NATURAL TO WEAR AS AN OVEN MIT. BUT HEY I GUESS YOU DONT ACTUALLY HAVE TO WEAR THE GLOVE FOR IT TO WORK.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of makeup brushes and this has been a lifesaver for my hands. I highly recommend it to those of you who are makeup artists and keep a collection of brushes for yourself and your makeup kit.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what video says.  Works like the best and easiest brush cleaner I have ever used.  Watch video and learn the best tips for use.</li>
            <li> SO AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been fighting the brush cleaning fight for YEARS! I had just given up, and was replacing my kabuki brushes every month. That&#x27;s $20 times 3, twelve times a year! Making this WELL worth the investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty straight forward, they even printed the &#x27;directions&#x27; in the silicone. No fancy cleaning products requited. I just used my basic philosophy face wash and BOOM! It&#x27;s like a brand new brush! Seriously, took seconds! And that whole still deep up there if you pry the bristles apart discoloration of foundation - It was 100% gone. I wish Amazon had emojis because I need them to add the extreme level of enthusiasm I have for this product. Also, the little microfiber insert helps keep my hand cool when I use warm water and it assists with my neurosis about spiders hiding in my gloves because I can take it out and check! hehe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-FAST&lt;br /&gt;-EASY&lt;br /&gt;-Thorough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;NONE!</li>
            <li> Something to clean your brushes without them being ruined with your hands, great invention! Makeup artist/ cosmetologist I recommend this to you if you do a lot of makeup and need to clean your brushes</li>
            <li> Great product! Washes my brushes very clean. It also causes me to wash my brush more frequently because it is so quick and easy. The only downfall with the glove is that it is big for the hand. They should be made by sizes. This does not affect the effectivness of the product but it just does not fit snug in case anyone thought that. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleaning my new brushes!! The microfiber cloth on the inside makes it so simple. It&#x27;s what you should have to clean your wonderful brushes!</li>
            <li> I like this glove a lot. Just wish they came in different sizes, this fits waaay to big on my tiny hand. Other than that, I use it all the time to wash my brushes and don&#x27;t need to use that much moisturizer during the day since my hands are nicely protected. I used to wash my makeup brushes with lukewarm w&amp;aacute;ter rubbing with my hands and after a while my hands would get dry and my nails brittle from all the solvents and running w&amp;aacute;ter. So, in the end I think its more necessary so you don&#x27;t use your bare hands. On the technical part, I believe the cleaning areas of the glove do help makeup particles wash out faster. The bumps wash the deeper parts of large powder brushes and foundation kabukis which is great. To me it has become a part of my weekly cleaning makeup life. Hope they do offer it in different sizes soon!</li>
            <li> The glove is very handy when cleaning my brushes and makes the whole process much faster. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s too big for my hand so I don&#x27;t have full control of the entire glove.</li>
            <li> Good, But not necessary.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased. I like this for my large brushes. I use a solvent when cleaning but it is difficult with the large brushes. This really helps to clean the brush well. I definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because a blogger I follow on Instagram highly recommended it and since I&#x27;m diligent with cleaning my makeup brushes I thought I&#x27;d try it. I definitely noticed it cleaned my brushes very thoroughly compared to how I usually do it.  But unfortunately the only good thing about this glove is that it allows you to really get all the makeup out of the bristles. Your probably reading that and wondering why I only gave it 2 stars?? Keep reading... I have a lot of brushes and there not cheap so I take good care of them. I&#x27;m obsessed with MAC makeup brush cleaner but it goes fast so I was hoping this glove would be more efficient than my original way and honestly it&#x27;s worse, I wasted so much product and it made a mess. The bottom line is this glove was not easy to use when you only have one hand to use to pour your cleanser, wipe and clean your brushes while your other hand is inside this bulky glove In my opinion the design of this glove is way too big, the rubber part doesn&#x27;t fit snug enough on my hand so that made it hard to use. Also, it would be better if it came in a lighter color so I could see my makeup cleaner which is a light pink and the consistency of water.

I guess if you use a lotion type product it would be better but honestly I&#x27;m chalking this up to another gadget I will never use again because of the poor design.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Sigma Spa Brush Cleaning Glove to handle the many high-end brushes I use on a daily basis - including Sigma, MAC and Hourglass (foundation). The glove is very easy to use and, I believe, does a better job in really getting the brushes clean. And using this glove does not require a lot of brush cleanser.</li>
            <li> This saves time when cleaning my brushes. They have never felt softer.</li>
            <li> I had 50 brushes to deep clean and kept putting it off until I saw sigmas brush cleaning helpers. I picked this as it was the right price for getting free shipping, although I&#x27;d probably pick the flat sink one now that I&#x27;ve tried it. I used baby shampoo and was delighted at how easy it was to get all the gross product build up out of the brushes. I especially liked the ridges where you can squeeze the brushes between finger and thumb. Some brushes are so dense and can hold a lot of product, so that came in handy. I don&#x27;t think you need to waste extra money on the double thumb version, because it&#x27;s not a big deal to switch between sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a video review saying that you can just get a silicon oven glove for cheaper. True, but this was more comfortable with the interior mitt, AND the rinsing grooves made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Marvelous cleaning glove!</li>
            <li> Good business, and love the product. I have been using sigma products for a year now and love them all.</li>
