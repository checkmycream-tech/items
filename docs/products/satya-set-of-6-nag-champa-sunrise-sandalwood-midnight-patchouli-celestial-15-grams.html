            <li>I love satya incense and this is the best way to figure what your favorite scents are and maybe which ones don&#x27;t appeal to you before getting stuck with a large quantity of it.</li>
            <li>Nag Champa are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever burned.</li>
            <li>We think Champa, by far, is the best.</li>
            <li>Enjoy and good Karma to all of you.</li>
            <li>This brand by far has had the best quality, burn time and scent of any others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The mark of a good incense is that the flame will automatically go out after you light it.  </li>
            <li>The scents I&#x27;ve used, so far, (Patchouli Forest and Celestial)  smell exquisite.  </li>
            <li>I love this, it&#x27;s a version deal and all of the incense are amazing.</li>
            <li>They smell amazing unlit, and even better when lit.</li>
            <li>Wow this set if wonderful!</li>
            <li>the stores that carry this kind of incense in my area charge a lot more.  </li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE THIS STUFF, IT&#x27;S A NICE COPULATION OF SCENTS.  </li>
            <li>I bought additional packs for gifts for young professionals, and they were very impressed with the scents.</li>
            <li>I love the sunrise, but honestly</li>
            <li>Love getting this combo pack, the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>I will do much better to choose my own scents though.</li>
            <li>Nice to try assorted to find what one likes better.</li>
            <li>I love all of these, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>The others are all amazing too so the sandalwood is just my favorite (for now).  </li>
            <li>Did not smell like soap, came on time, burns right, smells great.</li>
            <li>They are pretty potent and they all smell so good!</li>
            <li>Some, in fact, are quite pleasant and sweet.  </li>
            <li>love love love this!</li>
            <li>Fast service, very good product, will buy again many times from this seller.</li>
            <li>Lovely aroma, great price, easy to light and to use, variation of fragrances is a delightful touch, all around great little product.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, highly recommend if you want a bit of Oriental spice in your home.</li>
            <li>I loved the scents; each set has its own distinct smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have some different options besides Nag Champa all the time (though it is unarguably the best).</li>
            <li>Not too overpriced, and all the scents are somewhat similar, but incredibly fragrant in a good way.  </li>
            <li>This is not only a great buy, but it is a great experiment in incense.  </li>
            <li>These are the best incenses for authentic, earthy aromas that are not nauseating, flowery or fruity.&lt;br /&gt;The nag champa is the one frequently used in yoga studios and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not going into too much detail on the scents because everyone has their own preference (My favorite would be Midnight), but the variety and price of this pack is great.</li>
            <li>Very cheap price for the amount you get, too.</li>
            <li>Very smooth smell, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Smelling it right now and loving it!  </li>
            <li>Nice strong scent but</li>
            <li>Great for relaxing and creating atmosphere for meditation or just to draw in positive energies.</li>
            <li>We liked some of these scents more than others, but they&#x27;re all pretty good.</li>
            <li>The incense smell nice and burn just fine.</li>
            <li>Nice selection of fine incense.</li>
            <li>Great selection and large quantity for the price.  </li>
            <li>Each one has a unique, pleasant aroma which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy.</li>
            <li>This variety pack has excellent quality incense that works with so many different moods.  </li>
            <li>It burned ok and smelled alright.</li>
            <li>This stuff did the trick but be advised that you house will smell like an Indian Bazaar :).</li>
            <li>We put together all our favorite boxes, and took a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Love this Incense.</li>

            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents, but not this brand.</li>
            <li>Be well :)</li>
            <li>i used to drive quite a distance to purchase this brand incense AND paid much more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>Some scents are better than others.</li>
            <li>Well i love this product..and have always...</li>
            <li>These have an authentic scent and burn well .</li>
            <li>I bought this sampler pack a incense so as to get a more robust sample of many smells rather than the one I always buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to find a company brand better than Satya Sai Baba.</li>
            <li>After sampling each of the scents, however, I love them all.  </li>
            <li>Everything is hand-rolled and has authentic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>and i recommend these to people, and people have told me that they like it :)</li>
            <li>a incense user for many years</li>
            <li>the price here is so much better.</li>
            <li>- both are perfumey without being interesting.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>What is wonderful is the quality and the different tones of each type.</li>
            <li>the regular nag champa has to be about the best incense i have ever smelled.   </li>
            <li>but it is the most potent smelling product I have ever bought.    </li>
            <li>i love the scents of all the kinds in this set.</li>
            <li>My favorite has to be sunrise and celestial.</li>

            <li>I suspect I will be quite satisfied with all 6.  </li>
            <li>Better than the Incense you see in stores.</li>
            <li>I will order more when I burn through all these.  </li>
            <li>I did like them all however and am glad I bought them.</li>

            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and packaged safely.</li>

            <li>glad I gave these a chance.</li>
            <li>I love the selection and pick the type I want according to mood, time of day, etc.</li>
            <li>because there was a problem with the Patchouli Forest they sent me a different one called MONEY which they said it was one of their best selling incense</li>
            <li>but im sure they will be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The Sandalwood is lovely, exactly as strong as I like it, mellow, but with presence.</li>
            <li>I love strong incense</li>
            <li>A nice bonus is the seller shipped quickly and the package arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy and so worth it compared to the cheap incense.</li>

            <li>Smells really good and is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>These all smell smell the same and don&#x27;t smell very good</li>

            <li>all natural and smell so great.</li>
            <li>mountains\\&quot;) I tend to like more light, perfume-y type incense sticks.</li>
            <li>In good Satya fashion, these are just some of the most amazing scents next to that of my child&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This is our favorite brand and everything we got in this sampler was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love the selections and really enjoy the Sunrise and Midnight scents.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these incense, I buy them all of the time, they are so fragrant that I don&#x27;t even have to light them.</li>
            <li>They all came in one bag and the smells meshed together so it didn&#x27;t really smell that good.</li>

            <li>Scent is strong with all these boxes together at once</li>
            <li>it is a bit strong...</li>
            <li>Incense Nag Champa Fortune Jasmine Patchouli Romance and Rain Forest and have a strong dislike of it.</li>
            <li>WAY too strong...</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that they might be too strong when burned.  </li>
            <li>The smoke is strong, which I like</li>
            <li>I like the midnight and sandlewood smell, others are too strong perfume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of mysterious, in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are rather strong.</li>
            <li>It has a strong odor</li>
            <li>They smell strong in the box, but once lit they are not overpowering.</li>
            <li>They are strong though and will make your room smell for 2 months even without burning them.</li>
            <li>Really strongly scented.</li>
            <li>Way too strong.</li>
            <li>Not even the nice naturally fragranced kind.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not so strong as incense does bother some</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest you give them a try.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal, and it&#x27;s nice to have a variety of different scents.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong one</li>
            <li>And not too strong.</li>

            <li>This selection of scents is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>They smell rich and fresh and burn nicely.  </li>

            <li>What a super price!</li>
            <li>They shipped with prime which is always quick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a most pleasant change from burning only nag champa each day while meditating and relaxing.</li>
            <li>The scents are strong and rich and provide an atmosphere of relaxation.  </li>
            <li>Sunrise is like the original with a strong floral kick.</li>
            <li>Plus, the additional flavors were a huge plus.    </li>
            <li>Great smelling incense, one stick burns in approximately an hour giving off a great scent.</li>
            <li>Huge assortment of incense.</li>
            <li>Maybe for a cheap skate that counts every penny twice and chooses to sacrifice his pleasures away on an altar of miserliness.</li>
            <li>The lasting smell these have is great as well.</li>
            <li>LOL Out of body spiritual beings seem to also like these incense</li>
            <li>No perfumey, cheap incense in this pack.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money. :]</li>
            <li>Bought this 6-pack to try out the Red that I read great reviews on.  </li>
            <li>This is a great selection of different scents.  </li>
            <li>very cost effective as well.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this incense.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the variety.</li>
            <li>-  Has a Light powder</li>
            <li>- Has a Light powder scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is smoke after all, it&#x27;s probably not such a great idea to breath it in all day.</li>
            <li>Real incense, smells amazing, quality product.</li>
            <li>At the fantastic price?  </li>
            <li>i prefer Free Solls.</li>
            <li>A nice variety of incense sticks at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>now send me a free pack</li>
            <li>so i can light the house up.</li>
            <li>I really like it, nice smell, almost all of them.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Fun to try, although the sandalwood wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>It came sealed in a ziploc bag, and the incense I received is fresh and lasts forever. :)</li>
            <li>This assortment very much fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>If you buy incense a lot, than here is a great deal and an opportunity to experiment with mixed scents.  </li>
            <li>You need not be a pothead to enjoy.</li>
            <li>They may be a wee bit of a challenge to light up so</li>
            <li>And it smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of great incense and this fits the mold.</li>
            <li>The Sandalwood scent included, which I normally enjoy from this incense producer, smelled like it had been damaged by water or mold.  </li>
            <li>&quot; so for that i received 2 FREE samples!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too fond of sandalwood, but I still enjoy to burn them anyways</li>
            <li>but I enjoy the &#x27;weirdness&#x27; to the odor.</li>
            <li>Light incense, blow out incense, let incense smoke billow around you and then relax.</li>
            <li>this is a genuine product.</li>
            <li>He liked them so much I went and bought him some.</li>
            <li>And this sampler is great for trying different scents.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent incense burner and have NEVER found any as good as these.  </li>
            <li>They do smell good and leave a wonderful scent after wards, but while burning they were so faint</li>
            <li>I bought these because I, too, buy incense (mostly at dollar stores lol) and this is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>if you loved one, most likely will like the rest, too.</li>
            <li>great price and fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>This incense burns slowly and fills the room with a most wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This package of incense was sooooo strong, you could smell it right threw the Amazon box!  </li>
            <li>: This is a sandalwood and vanilla based incense that has a sweet, spicy something that has quickly made it my favorite incense for relaxing at bedtime.</li>
            <li>the smell is good and pure which i like very much</li>
            <li>It is very economical.</li>
            <li>incense is very powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li>The incense was very fresh, all of the packets were.  </li>
            <li>this was very fun for my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>The fragrances are quite distinct, articulate, full bodied and bountiful while remaining subtle..never overwhelming.</li>
            <li>They smell pretty good however and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Great product, and will continue ordering them as long as they are available.</li>
            <li>A great way to sample different fragrances, without paying full price for each box.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and were the kind of  high quality incense sticks I was looking for in a variety pack.</li>
            <li>I also picked some up from Whole Foods (don&#x27;t remember the brand), and it was much milder and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I loved these incense, they smell great and are powerful (not enough to smoke you out, but nice and strong), they even arrived a few days before the estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brand of incense because it leaves a true fragrance while burning not a &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; smell like some cheap incense.</li>
            <li>They all smell really wonderful and although they are a bit shorter than other incense they burn MUCH longer!</li>
            <li>They smell great and burn a long while.</li>
            <li>I have resorted to buying just the original Nag Champa scent.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great item and at such a fair price.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more if you are just exploring incense for the first time.  </li>
            <li>so make sure you like it first.  </li>
            <li>and I was excited to find a variety pack.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these incense sticks as a means of trying to deter spiders from entering my home.</li>
            <li>So worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Each smell is particularly unique and inviting.</li>
            <li>The smell is very intoxicating even when they are not lit up! :-)</li>
            <li>Great product, just took way to long to ship</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have bought incense and I am glad I chose these.</li>
            <li>The nag champa is still my favorite incense scent by far but the other scents are wonderful as well.</li>
            <li>These burn for a very long time,and smell great.</li>
            <li>Smells great and burns a very long time</li>
            <li>When I light one of these incredible sticks, the fragrances are so calming; it is as if for a few minutes my cares have been carried away by the smoke.  </li>
            <li>I used free super saver shipping and it was</li>
            <li>By far not the best incense I&#x27;ve tried, but definitely a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>These are great, but the amount of smoke they produce may be too much for those too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have always liked nag champa and was wanting to try more along the same lines.</li>
            <li>I love incense and this is a nice variety of different aromas.</li>
            <li>Being disabled, it is so great to be able to buy these online.</li>
            <li>They are all slightly different, but pleasant.</li>
            <li>aroma was the pleasant surprise, the next morning.</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise they didn&#x27;t when I lit them individually.</li>
            <li>They all smell very nice, burn well and for a long time, and the packaging wasn&#x27;t compromised or damaged with delivery.</li>
            <li>I would assume it&#x27;s just me since I read many positive feedbacks before making a purchase.</li>
            <li>If you like a good long lasting Incense these are great.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good while it is being burned which is not always the case with some other more &#x27;perfumey&#x27; brands.  </li>
            <li>This adds a special quality to the room.</li>
            <li>These were very strong and I enjoyed the fact that they could perfume the entire house.  </li>
            <li>They make a perfect Christmas gift for those who are hard to buy for.</li>
            <li>Product definitely as expected and a great deal.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t buy incense this cheap, but I saw so many 5 stars, so I thought what the heck, just give it a try...</li>
            <li>burns well and long, fresh this year stamped and make my house smell great for a loong time.   </li>
            <li>Great quality, as expected.</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with the quality and with this purchase in general.</li>
            <li>Thanks :-)</li>
            <li>i love these incense so much.</li>
            <li>they arrived on time, but as soon as i opened the box and look at the incent sticks and the boxes were full of dust from the sticks.only about a quarter of the sticks was still burnable.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I haven&#x27;t tried all 5 scents yet.</li>
            <li>I loved every scent, especially the Nag Champa and Sunrise.</li>
            <li>Many Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have akways loved Staya incense, especially the Nag Champa!</li>
            <li>I got a got variety that should last me a good couple of month.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this package is that it is perfect for a begginer who is not experienced with the different scents from the satya brand..</li>
            <li>Very please with the price :)</li>
            <li>Even the standard incenses are so much superior.</li>
            <li>I got these safe and fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>used it on my rest room make it clear and nice</li>
            <li>instead these all&lt;br /&gt;turned out to be overpowering sweet and ultimately&lt;br /&gt;annoying.</li>
            <li>Oh sweet goodness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked them all so far.</li>
            <li>and I love them all just as much.</li>
            <li>Again, not a bad thing, but this should be considered.</li>
            <li>Speedy delivery, better than average packaging (good and protective, airtight)  quality product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are strong but not too overpowering and this little sampler is great.</li>
            <li>the quality is high, better than most, and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>Great scents, nice slow burn....when I think of incense, this is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>But I love the different scents and am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase some as my febreeze was not cutting the farts good enough.  </li>
            <li>I burn Nag Champa Super Hit all the time.</li>
            <li>2nd time purchasing these, they all smell wonderful and will definitely continue buying them!</li>
            <li>and I find that some burn too quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fairly quick.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best incense I&#x27;ve ever used, you could smell the scent as soon as you open the plastic, they are a bit smaller in length, but the odor lingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like to give this product and the seller zillion stars because both are extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed Celestial, Sunrise, Midnight, and Nag Champa the most, but ultimately, I was please with all six boxes, and will continue to purchase from this source.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I am not that experienced with incense much beyond what I have purchased at the dollar store and local fairs.  </li>
            <li>Nag Champa flavor box (2012, 11 sticks) also came with a bonus packet of two full-sized sticks of Harmony flavor incense, labelled \\&quot;free sample\\&quot; which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I feel I am going to go through these quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and would consider reordering when I&#x27;m in need of more.</li>
            <li>Took so many re-lights to get any use out of them, we proably spend more on lighter fluid than the incense.</li>
            <li>Sunrise is my favorite one so far, although I still have yet to light sandalwood, celestial, and the forest one.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed each type of incense that was included and would surely purchase this same product</li>
            <li>Be sure to ventilate the areas you burn them in - especially if you have kids! :)</li>
            <li>i realized i like all the scents, so i have not narrowed down my scent preference, but they all are great and have been giving my room a variety of cool scents.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this pack to anyone newer to incense looking to find a favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Contained both familiar and new scents of incense, all of which are great (especially the patchouli forest and celestial!)</li>
            <li>Every box has a distinct pleasant aroma and each stick is long burning.  </li>
            <li>They make great gifts especially to people whose homes you visit that might have a funny or not so funny smell to them.</li>
            <li>All the scents are nice and it generally lasts around 3 to 4 months using them around 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I have loved them all so far, most especially Midnight.</li>
            <li>I really love and totally recommend this product, the smell is soft and calming and you can tell the quality is extremely good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to incense and wasn&#x27;t sure which scents to buy.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and they all smell great</li>
            <li>I finally brought them in and put one box underneath the sink in my bathroom, which needs some consistent pleasant aroma, and it actually was nice for that.  </li>
            <li>They last long and smell awesome!</li>
            <li>Best Incense, long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for anyone who loves authentic incense!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>but I will put at number 3 in my list of which ones first to buy...~!~</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t set off smoke alarms like store-bought big ones (also better for your lungs!).</li>
            <li>At first it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are getting very much, especially when it is delivered, but I have enjoyed many hours with this set.  </li>
            <li>They really did burn for an entire hour and were all fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They last about an hour and keep an area smelling nice for a nice long while, I&#x27;ll light one at night around 11pm</li>
            <li>Great smells but a little messey when opened them.</li>
            <li>Great value, and not cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>These were offered as an Add On at a reasonable price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>These we smaller than i expected, but had awesome fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these are worth getting.</li>
            <li>Get it, its worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love all the different scents they are able to create and look forward to getting more of them in the future!</li>
            <li>All the scents are nice and should last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful after years of using &#x27;clearing house&#x27; imitators that performed poorly.</li>
            <li>By the time it reached me, all 6 scents were blended together leaving none of them smelling like their distinct aroma should be.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>The Midnight one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>The Nag Champa varieties are worth every penny, and I say that as a cheapskate.</li>
            <li>But what I loved most about it is the way it burns: it burns slowly and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>But once you actually burn them, they each have they&#x27;re own distinct scent.</li>
            <li>I had gotten a couple of these locally and really liked them.</li>
            <li>Make sure you actually light them to see how they smell, as the smoke often smells quite different from the unburned smell of the sticks.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not crazy about the Forest Patchouli, so we give that one to a friend.</li>
            <li>Even if there&#x27;s a couple types you don&#x27;t like, it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>The scents are quite pleasurable to the olfactory glands, while the burn is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>all the different odors are nice.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>it feels nice to finally have some variety.</li>
            <li>Favorite brand by far.</li>
            <li>It was worth a shot, and maybe you&#x27;ll like the scents that I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Also worth noting:</li>
            <li>It is a rare patchouli, this, and well worth the price of all the rest of the incense in this pack.</li>
            <li>For the price, even if one was off for me, still worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how many incense sticks were in the package.  </li>
            <li>They all kind of smell the same.</li>
            <li>Nice to try out some different flavors as well.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so you have a lot of different fragrances fast delivery good quality.</li>
            <li>THey always come fresh in a sealed box which come in a bag.  </li>
            <li>So Honestly though it&#x27;s not a big investment</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>my own personal preference (though three of my friends</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll light mine in a room at the corner of my house and even with the door shut and window open, it lingers around most of the house.</li>
            <li>Delicious scent, they last a lot and they are not intense at all.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand of incense, in multiple scents, with free shipping on Amazon?</li>
            <li>I initially though I wouldn&#x27;t like, now I kind of like.  </li>
            <li>I have been using incense for many years, and I have to say that this is by far the highest quality product I have used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used incense most of my adult life</li>
            <li>I wish this was only $5 because that&#x27;s all I think it&#x27;s worth, but if you want nice incense shipped to you, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Bought before, this is by far my favorite variety set.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often give 5 star ratings, but I really liked all of the different scents included.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>They smelled so fresh and lasted forever.</li>
            <li>Nice and lasting scents.</li>
            <li>I found I kind of like having different scents each day.  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, burns for an acceptably long time.</li>
            <li>Nag Champa has been a long standing favorite in my collection, and now Satya Sai Baba Incenses are offering many new fragrances to enjoy.</li>
            <li>The scent is very powerful, and really just irritated my allergies.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and very fresh.</li>
            <li>What a great Idea I was not aware that this company made so many different flavors.</li>
            <li>These are your standard, run-of-the-mill incense sticks that have that familiar \\&quot;incense\\&quot; smell most people are used to.  </li>
            <li>Love the deep rich smells that fill the room...</li>
            <li>the other scents were also good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the scent of Nag Champa, but I had never tried any other scent made by Satya Sai Baba.</li>
            <li>The scent does drift through the whole house when using them and lingers for a day but it is not overpowering like I originally feared.</li>
            <li>If you want to try other incenses by Nag Champa, this is a good mix.  </li>
            <li>Price was right too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another reviewer already described the scents of each of these flavors, so I&#x27;ll just endorse his review and mention that he&#x27;s right about the Patchouli:  </li>
            <li>and I soon bought the 100g box of it right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>However two of them choked me up right after I lit ..</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s own, distinct scent, that you can actually smell while it&#x27;s burning (instead of that mostly smoky smell from the generic kind I mentioned earlier).</li>
            <li>Threw them out, then threw out the trash right away because the trash stunk.</li>
            <li>He goes right to sleep.</li>
            <li>I have two sticks lit right now and not a drop of scent is floating aromatically in the air.  </li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s easy to give it a try and find some new loves.    </li>
            <li>The sticks burn a reasonable amount of time and relatively clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the purchase to avoid going to the Mall or if your like me driving and spending the money on gas to find something that is of equal quality, or if your lucky marginally better.   </li>
            <li>They all are very strong and smell the same to me.</li>
            <li>They almost all smell the same, and they are VERY, VERY, strong.</li>
            <li>The incense is very strong and fills my entire house with the smell from just one stick.</li>
            <li>No other brand we have tried has been as satisfying and mood setting.</li>
            <li>I live in a very damp area of northwestern Oregon and this makes my basement apartment smell so much better and covers up the mildew odor that permeates every dwelling here.  </li>
            <li>Also makes a great small gift for any occasion.</li>
            <li>Each scent is a quality stick, and a pretty fresh product.</li>
            <li>(holographic seal, authentic baggy liners in the box, apparently correct scents...</li>
            <li>, the incense burns nice and long and the scent lingers in the room for quite a while.</li>
            <li>these will make the perfect little extra for Holiday gifts, a sample for each person.  </li>
            <li>It smells like sandalwood ; However, the alcohol  level is very high and the fragrance dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I live in a one bedroom and if I light one in the bedroom, foyer &amp; Living room</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re certainly keeper&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>At the price Amazon is charging, these present such great values.</li>
            <li>I loved the black Nag Champa, so I tried this pack one day.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t burn too fast and the smells are lasting and amazing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for the other scents and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>First off, the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>shipped very fast, quality incense.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>the bundle is a very reasonable purchase if you use a lot of incense like I do.</li>
            <li>With Prime member ship it only gets better with super fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you just can&#x27;t decide on the scent you want, this is a good little mix to try.</li>
            <li>the incense has some of the best, subtle, natural aromas i have found.  </li>
            <li>Being pregnant, my nose is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>The scents reminds me of a head shop or an Asian restaurant, which is fine with me, but some of my friends don&#x27;t like it, prefering incense that smells sweet or like perfume.</li>
            <li>I wanted to switch it up a little with this variety pack, which is exactly what this is good for.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is exactly what the picture looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love &#x27;Midnight&#x27; and &#x27;Sunrise&#x27; especially so.</li>
            <li>they are very affordable!</li>
            <li>There are 2 scents that are not my favorite, but my personal perference!!</li>
            <li>However, my personal satisfaction with this stuff is more like 3 stars</li>
            <li>The seller sent me a message complaining I didn&#x27;t contact them first and suggested that I run a hair dryer over all the incense before trying to use it.</li>
            <li>When I buy incense I expect it to be ready to use, open the package, light it, enjoy.</li>
            <li>each of the 6 flavors smells great, and they burn pretty slow.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I asked for.</li>
            <li>The incense came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The real deal!   </li>
            <li>All of them are really nice incense sticks, they burn for long and they arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this item!</li>
            <li>There is only 1 that I don&#x27;t care for, and I LOVE 4 of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an incense expert, but I&#x27;ve bought some different brands that I like much better.  </li>
            <li>These look thicker and burn slower and smell better than the ones carried at my local store.</li>
            <li>I love the Nag Champa blue.  </li>
            <li>I love this incense and have re-ordered several times.</li>
            <li>I would look for something more substantial if I was a regular user of incense.</li>
            <li>Fresh and very fragrant.</li>
            <li>the whole, this 6 pack was worth every penny, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed each of the fragrances for different reasons.g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the whole, this 6 pack was worth every penny, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed each of the fragrances for different reasons.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these when I start to get low.</li>
            <li>When I first got them, I was burning maybe 3 or 4 a day.</li>
            <li>Perhaps to a more discerning person, these may smell wildly different but to me?</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is top notch and we will be purchasing again in the future.  </li>
            <li>Last a long time, smell great.</li>
            <li>This product came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I love this incense, and my husband and I have been using them for several years.</li>
            <li>:) Satya Sai Baba is the only incense for us.</li>
            <li>Long lasting fragrance and great variety of scents.</li>
            <li>If you are pretty allergic I would not recommend to lit this incense.</li>
            <li>They all smell the same and there are to many to even use...</li>
            <li>almost_ as much as a bit of chocolate or a glass of wine!  </li>
            <li>The scents are consistent too.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Nag Champa\\&quot; and instantly fell in love with it again.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not definite though, I am going to try it tonight too get a more awake sense of it and see how I feel.</li>
            <li>Great aroma - long lasting</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know which to burn first</li>
            <li>I will be buying more from this brand in the future!!!</li>
            <li>You could smell the box on the porch - exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I like these a lot more than those grocery store air fresheners because there is no chemical smell and the scent from the incense last longer after they have burnt out.</li>
            <li>I will return to buying Midnight from my local Indian store, the scent is stronger and captivating.</li>
            <li>Too short and most of the scent turned to dust at the bottom of the bag</li>
            <li>I have purchased these on many different occassions</li>
            <li>Hopefully they come out with more varieties later.</li>
            <li>Nice boxes, although incense is usually quite cheap.</li>
            <li>will be back to get more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>so i decided to try it out first</li>
            <li>Each scent has exactly that</li>
            <li>how many different smells and</li>
            <li>Very fragrant!</li>
            <li>But I just really like it!</li>
            <li>So much incense!</li>
            <li>but still they are a cut above most incense.</li>
            <li>By getting this multi-pack it let me try a few at a good price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time someplace else, these guys are good.</li>
            <li>Variety pack is good, but found there is not a huge variance in the smells of these.</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing I can see what it&#x27;s good for is if you have a strong, bad smell in your home (cooking smells, smoke, someone uses the bathroom lol)</li>
            <li>Years ago after some time I finally settled on Gonesh sticks since it was adequate for my olfactory needs and readily available even at &#x27;dollar stores&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Good for if I want to freshen up a room without leaving a strong incense scent behind.</li>
            <li>some are ok and others might leave a bad smell that kind of makes you nauseous, but these are really-really good so far.</li>
            <li>Overall, these are nice, but definitely nothing special.</li>
            <li>Good price too, better then any local head shop where even these small packages go for 3-4 dollars each.</li>
            <li>Every time I light it I am reminded of the new age stores I visited when I was younger and the intoxicating scent that filled the rooms.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>, each has it&#x27;s distinct smell, for particular times of the day, like sunset, midnight, etc.</li>
            <li>Love that and have also burned a Black so far and love that too.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this set of incense to get a good feel for a few of the different scents and fell in love with these particular ones.</li>
            <li>It provides just a hint of aroma, much less and far more pleasant than one of those commercial plug-ins.  </li>
            <li>ordered several popular brands to compare, and Hem was the clear winner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending me such lovely incense.</li>
            <li>I burn way too much incense daily and Satya is and will be my top choice.</li>
            <li>I love this variety of incense so much that this is the second time it has been ordered.</li>
            <li>very very very strong , careful where you store it</li>
            <li>More really than I plan to use for a long time, but the variety is nice and they came as expected.</li>
            <li>just from lighting the first stick I knew it was VERY high quality.</li>
            <li>These are nice , the smoke burns white , not black like some I have had..</li>
            <li>Long lasting pleasant</li>
            <li>My order was fulfilled by tom&#x27;s incense, but penny lane gift is also a positive experience.  </li>
            <li>I see others leaving positive feedback, maybe it&#x27;s hit or miss</li>
            <li>This is a great bargain and I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this pack again as well as trying some of the other assortments by this maker.</li>
            <li>This multiple scent pack is a great way to try other Satya fragances.</li>
            <li>, all Satya incense is pretty much interchangeable.  </li>
            <li>But this incense is top quality and lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li>Nag champa has been a favorite of mine for as long as i can remember</li>
            <li>The Sandalwood is a classic scent that I love but again, would not buy a larger amount of...</li>
            <li>While I appreciate that the incense is fresh and new, I don&#x27;t want a chore.</li>
            <li>Smells terrific, lights easily too.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, Becoming addicted to burning one every day.  </li>
            <li>Some people would say that the scents are strong and all smell the same.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t too strong but you can tell a big difference when you enter a room.</li>
            <li>You will find it is not as strong as some of the traditional incense scents however.</li>
            <li>Good quality and long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>It is strong and the smell lingers a day later after you have burnt it.</li>
            <li>After almost daily use, none of them seem that strong to me as they did at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really am enjoying every single essence.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t need another one when I&#x27;m trying to relax.</li>
            <li>The scent is pure and lasts.</li>
            <li>This large quantity has you covered for month after month.</li>
            <li>but I do not believe I would buy a large case of it.</li>
            <li>The other scents are nice too, particularly the sandalwood and the patchouli.  </li>
            <li>Ive used several brands in the past, and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li>I have liked everyone of them so far, and they burn for a very long time.</li>
            <li>But I find this incense smells great, not too strong or artificial or cloying as some incense can be.</li>
            <li>My only real problem with this brand is that for me, it&#x27;s too strong.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like a campfire or anything funny like many of the other brands.</li>
            <li>Very high quality scents.</li>
            <li>The sticks last easily three times longer than your average incense stick and the scents are pretty exotic to what you&#x27;re used to.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for, you get hard to find sataya flavors and the price is cheap.</li>
            <li>Perhaps because Ive only used the cheap stuff before, and these are the real deal.</li>
            <li>You may only have to relight it once, or you might have to relight it two or three times, but it&#x27;s a huge pain.  </li>
            <li>Really folks regardless how much incense you use..how truly \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; can it be?</li>
            <li>The smell permeated my whole room.  </li>
            <li>I really like patchuli and sunrise.</li>
            <li>They came fast and were well packaged.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li>The box says it comes from China; that combined with the chemical smell is just too much for me.    </li>
            <li>This incense burns really well.</li>
            <li>Helps me to fall asleep if I really need to.   </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat this price either.</li>
            <li>Very overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended     Would buy again!</li>
            <li>but it does smell very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am by no means an incense aficionado, and I don&#x27;t know much about them.</li>
            <li>I burn so much incense</li>
            <li>The price for this package deal is very competitive.  </li>
            <li>, I am very please with the quality and the price of my purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The real deal.</li>
            <li>Burns kinda fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that people have their preferences in scent and those preferences usually don&#x27;t much transcend the barriers of type: floral, woody, spicy, citrus, and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this is quality incense, reasonably long-lasting and not too smoky.  </li>
            <li>Such a great variety for such a low price!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend for those not used to Nag Champa to go smell some at a metaphysical store before buying or even Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it, I am an incense fanatic so this really came in handy.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing also.</li>
            <li>Even with shipping charges they are still reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>and I can highly recommend each one!</li>
            <li>But are you really going to return a $7 item??</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know which scents i wanted to order for my son&#x27;s burner.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t know there was a difference until I read some reviews that explained how it is made vs the cheaper ones from discount stores.</li>
            <li>Would rate 5, but not qualified to really judge incense.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to getting some quality incense.</li>
            <li>For me, each stick lasts are 15 minutes, but the scent lingers for much longer.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>very disappointed)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This incense has a very stong, cloying aroma.  </li>
            <li>Every one of these scents is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they use to scent these, but I immediately threw the whole thing away as soon as I opened it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d light and then a few seconds later would go out on their own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want my incense smelling like soap.  </li>
            <li>The or very relaxing woody and smokey.</li>
            <li>However, these were a gift for my son and he really enjoys them.</li>
            <li>Was very exited about this however very dissapointed</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very flaky.</li>
            <li>they were shipped promptly, and whole.  </li>
            <li>Burns very well and does the trick.  </li>
            <li>It is also financially reasonable.</li>
            <li>These incese tend to fall apart, the incense itself turns to powder and is very brittle.</li>
            <li>Patchouli forest smells like patchouli without leaving you and your whole house smelling like a hippie den permanently.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>high quality!</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable because you are getting quality in return.</li>
            <li>You really cant smell the difference in the incense......</li>
            <li>These r the real deal.</li>
            <li>They are the real deal from India.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering again from this seller very soon.</li>
            <li>but we stopped using as much after learning how the smoke can be harmful to your health.</li>
            <li>The sticks also occasionally go out, though for the most part they burn completely with one lighting.    </li>
            <li>The price was far better than those in the stores locally.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and it burns slow compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li>and they weren&#x27;t as thick, nor did they smell that good.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is too plain for me, but the rest are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I previously bought some charcoal incense from the dollar store, and it didn&#x27;t smell very good and got my hands all black.</li>
            <li>Such a good choice over other incense, I will be buying again when I&#x27;m done with these.</li>
            <li>Good quality, but aroma is pretty weak.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; aroma that is both common yet exotic.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but not overpowering, and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Stay with this particular brand of Nag Champa though as others just are not as pure smelling.</li>
            <li>The rest of them are okay, but they don&#x27;t have that organic, mood-setting quality other incense I&#x27;ve used has.</li>
            <li>is that yes, the blue box original \\&quot;Nag Champa\\</li>
            <li>I will most likely order these when I have two boxes left, which should be very soon!</li>
            <li>Due to my skin condition, I&#x27;m very rarely able to bathe.  </li>
            <li>Usually I just go with incense from my local market... been doing that for a couple years, but i&#x27;ve not found incense that smell that great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to those who wants to relax and meditate.</li>
            <li>The incense is of high quality and has a very pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>For less than a ten spot, you get six 15 gram boxes of quality incense, and all of these scents have something good to offer, though mileage will of course vary.</li>
            <li>The quality has really deteriorated tremendously from the last time I bought it.</li>
            <li>Not new professional boxes, more like store overstock/returns.</li>
            <li>It made her birthday complete they have a long lasting smell and light easily</li>
            <li>it made the house smell nice, but not sure which ones smelled which way.  </li>
            <li>Their quality is consistent and I trust this brand completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad smelling, just not big Patchouli fans here.</li>
            <li>There is not a bad scent in any of the different boxes.  </li>
            <li>Nag Champa is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li>love Nag Champa and never realized there were other scents!  </li>
            <li>Very strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried when I ordered this pack that I wouldn&#x27;t like several of the scents, despite the good ratings.  </li>
            <li>As another wrote they do take a little longer to light but still worth it..</li>
            <li>Those were longer, hardly created smoke at all, weren&#x27;t messy at all, and had wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li>and I remember always enjoying the smell of burning incense for some odd reason.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lighter scent, and more uplifting, less meditative than the others.</li>
            <li>I got a black top which I did not order.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like Sunrise and Midnight.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any particular problem with the incense.</li>
            <li>Others were decent.</li>
            <li>and bring a vibrant energy to the home.</li>
            <li>Extremely quick delivery and cheaper than going to my local Health Food store to buy it.  </li>
            <li>A classic that is missed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more soon enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the fact that wood is used, but the resulting fragrance excuses any inconvenience...</li>
            <li>The celestial and midnight are particularly stimulating.  </li>
            <li>I keep forgetting that I only like nag champa and super hit</li>
            <li>I will definitely stock up on more when I begin to run low.</li>
            <li>and it being the same quality as most of the products I&#x27;ve found recently.  </li>
            <li>Considering the local stores around me that sell these, I&#x27;m lucky to spend $3.99 on one pack.</li>
            <li>these are lovely and despite what some say I think that the scents are very different, not at all the same - i like!</li>
            <li>I know It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li>Outside of the blue box Nag Champa these varieties are ok.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t fall in love with any of them and even the blue box seems to have been made from a different recipe from what I remember of it.</li>
            <li>I personally like the Nag Champa the most, it is very relaxing after long days of work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a frequent incense user, and this one has strong chemical smell, not natural.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are looking to change the atmosphere of your household.   </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into burning incense, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I suspect the incense started out as high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to burn incense.</li>
            <li>I will definatly order these again and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this set.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i am highly dissapointed with this.</li>
            <li>This is really high quality stuff.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Product is high quality.</li>
            <li>and i highly suggest them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and are of high quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand and flavored incense.</li>
            <li>These are all high quality sticks.</li>
            <li>They are highly fragranced.</li>
            <li>Does not smell like high- quality incense.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand and this seller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, it just smells a little like an older woman&#x27;s perfume.    </li>
            <li>I have some other &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; incense that is waaaay too strong.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid that I might not like the smell, but, I loved it right away!   </li>
            <li>All of the boxes were dry, clean, neat, sealed, undamaged.  </li>
            <li>and i was surprised that they came here fast even tho</li>
            <li>We got several scents that we are having fun smelling.</li>
            <li>and i guess its worth the couple bucks extra just to keep the cat litter smell at bay.</li>
            <li>It is perfectly normal for the intensity of the smell to fade over time.</li>
            <li>Normally I like the smell of these fire sticks.  </li>
            <li>Mellow yet powerful at the same time.</li>
            <li>The smells are powerful enough to be noticed, but not overpowering like a lot of incense.</li>
            <li>Like most burning incense from India, these are messy; they shed all over the place.  </li>
            <li>the ones I normally get, but</li>
            <li>My favorite is Sunrise and Midnight, although there were none that I disliked.</li>
            <li>They all pretty much smell the same as well.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>make sure you let the incense burn a few seconds before you blow out the spark.</li>
            <li>Love the scents, they last a long time.</li>
            <li>It burns nice a slowly without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Another good thing is they are thin</li>
            <li>Each stick is nice and thick, and burns for upwards of an hour, plus the scent lingers for quite a while afterwards without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you like Nag Champa, you will almost certainly enjoy the other flavors since their quality, richness, and subtle blends are just as fine as the original.  </li>
            <li>I must confess i am a new comer to the world that is mediation and am learning more everyday..</li>
            <li>Unless you burn one or more every day, this pack will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li>and they last a very long time :}</li>
            <li>Forest\\&quot; next which is as strong as the Nag Champa blue box with a woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>Not much else to really say about these incense other than they smell nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something new to rotate my normal Nag Champa</li>
            <li>As of right now, the strength of the scent only lasts one day.</li>
            <li>All the scents are terrific, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Now if we can only get his formula right.</li>
            <li>Very long lasting scent, burns evenly, each stick lasts sa long time and the scents are real and authentic!</li>
            <li>You sit down, and just have to wonder why they think I want to smell that strong cleaning chemical while I eat.    </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to continually burn them to enjoy them as with some other incense sticks.  </li>
            <li>But given that there are five other ones I love, I give it an excuse of only a star, and it&#x27;s more than likely</li>
            <li>They all smell just like every head or new age shop</li>
            <li>I do live in apartment, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to incense, but these burn substantially longer than all others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped immediately and all items are brand new and sealed.</li>
            <li>I have a preemie brand new to the home.</li>
            <li>Midnight after the sun goes down on Friday night, Sandal Wood just because I love Sandalwood sooooo sooothing, Sunrise when I meditate in the mornings before getting ready for work and Celestial for my Spiritual Well Being and quite time.</li>
            <li>They last very long and the smell is so amazing it keeps in your room even the next day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scents are naturalistic, which is great because I hate flowery/overly-artificial incense scents.</li>
            <li>I have only used half a stick so far but these smell amazing..</li>
            <li>the smell is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>I found out if I &#x27;nearly&#x27; light the entire thing, by going over it with a flame, some moisture will bubble out and it will in fact burn all the way without having to be lit a second time.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Celestial: This is a subtle fragrance that I&#x27;ve found useful for balancing out strong, single-note fragrances like Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s Jasmine Blossom.</li>
            <li>I got green pants but no green top.</li>
            <li>I had to use nearly 5-6 incense sticks of Nag Champa to get a decent aroma.</li>
            <li>This is usually a decent low-priced Indian incense product; but the set of 6 x 15g boxes I received seemed... old.  </li>
            <li>Out of the box, these sticks smell great which only makes it worse when you burn them and are stunned by how they smell nothing like before you burned them.</li>
            <li>now many sticks i get for so little money!</li>
            <li>I burn incense on very, very rare occasions and then only briefly.  </li>
            <li>(This can happen if the incense gets moist or very old; I have a feeling the seller just sent me a very, very old sampler box of this</li>
            <li>Very natural scent</li>
            <li>I burn a lot of incense, and these sticks last more than the average time, and burn steadily and evenly.</li>
            <li>Strong but doesn&#x27;t linger long enough.</li>
            <li>Very little punk-type odor, not excessively smoky as most India-type (dung-based) sticks tend to be.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>We love almost every scent that they make, but we think that they&#x27;ve recently the formula to their Agarbatti (blue box) scent, that specific incense seems to give me a headache now, which it never used to do in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each incense smells almost exactly the same, they all contain a powder smell.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Do not buy the 100g boxes of the exact same stuff.  </li>
            <li>Burn long and omit a powerful scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the original Nag Champa incense (in the blue box) for years from our local &#x27;novelty&#x27; shop.</li>
            <li>Mystical, Transcendental, and Peaceful are some of the thoughts these scents inspire in myself personally..</li>
            <li>that were present when I first arrived.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would request a return as &#x27;defective&#x27; but for the cheap price I paid, it&#x27;s not worth my time.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was expecting - this is the only incense I use.</li>
            <li>I was worried after reading some reviews about how the incense all smell the same and when I first opened the package I assumed it would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure why most people use this type of product, I used it to help me meditate and pray.  </li>
            <li>Nice variety of smells - the incense sticks are very durable none have broken so far</li>
            <li>These are my favorite incense especially the regular blue nagchampa &amp; midnight nag champa.</li>
            <li>Good quality, long burning and the scent is soft and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the patchouli forest--it is a little too strong and perfumey for me.</li>
            <li>And since there are only 2 and one sells one kind and the other only sells 3</li>
            <li>only burned a couple, but so far they burn longer and smell better than the other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, there are a couple of varieties in this bundle that don&#x27;t really smell particularly good (at least to me).  </li>
            <li>Is a strong mixed of Indian spices  not suitable for everybody,specially for those with a mild sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>I bought the variety pack to sample new scents so far</li>
            <li>Long burning (usually about an hour), clean smelling (never smells \\&quot;burned\\&quot; like some cheap incense does).  </li>
            <li>The sticks fit in my coffin burner and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Fresh too, not stale dried out or impaired scent.</li>
            <li>The package of Nag Champa is filled about an inch and a half from the bottom with nothing but the flakes.</li>
            <li>I Recommend this to any one who likes a variety of incense,  they burn slowly and last long and smell great.</li>
            <li>Slow burning for a long lasting scent, and this package has a great variety of scent.</li>
            <li>We usually burn these near the litter box for obvious reasons,but they&#x27;re really nice anytime,anywhere.</li>
            <li>A little too much smoke and burns far too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Some are a little strong, but overall they work very well.</li>
            <li>and I still have more than half of them left.</li>
            <li>We will just keep getting these and the Japanese incense, which do not have the bamboo stick in it, but tend to have more subdued fragrance (less smoke,</li>
            <li>There were only a pair of scents which were less than appealing to me.</li>
            <li>I had only had the blue box and super hit from Champa.  </li>
            <li>I usually just bought the blue champa incense box from my local indian market, I saw these on lot and figured why not give them all a try, every last one is great</li>
            <li>The Midnight and Celestial are a little too light and perfumey for me</li>
            <li>I received the incense in record time and it was well packaged, There was a little crushing at the end of the boxes, but it did not damage the incense sticks.</li>
            <li>They are a very slow burn incense which is nice</li>
            <li>Box-in-a-box packaging was weird, but for the price, this is a great sampler pack or regular buy if you like them all.</li>
            <li>Burn one in the office every morning to clear the air.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised and absolutely fancied the variety of the different smells.</li>
            <li>I have enough of those thanks.</li>
            <li>no cloying flowery fragrances...just soft, dreamy scents</li>
            <li>WOW..</li>
            <li>much* cheaper than psychically buying the same amount in a store.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give 5 stars, is because some of them have too much mositure in them.</li>
            <li>Really like the different scents in this variety pack!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference in the 6 different scents.</li>
            <li>If you can find these at a store (try looking near the beach or close to college campuses), I&#x27;d suggest buying one or two sticks of each and seeing if you like them before you order.  </li>
            <li>THIS is the patchouli you smelled that time in somebody&#x27;s dorm room and asked what it was and was surprised by the answer you got.</li>
            <li>The 1st purchase surprised me, a lot.</li>
            <li>I placed the set of six boxes on my trunk, that&#x27;s near my headboard.&lt;br /&gt;Their</li>
            <li>When I saw this combination near Christmas time, I knew I was going to be getting it for hubby to give to me.</li>
            <li>these smell natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old hippie type, and have used incense since the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to try s few differnt ones and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>The sticks burn for a considerable amount of time which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;sometimes goes out before burning completely.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick to the old standby after they run out,.</li>
            <li>With this purchase, literally every stick so far has burned out after a couple minutes and needed to be relit.  </li>
            <li>After buying this for my daughter, I can tell the superiority in quality that this brand offers.</li>
            <li>so far come out with almost all of the incense flaked off.</li>
            <li>if you haven&#x27;t tried this brand of incense before, i think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The longest so far was an hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>so far it is one of my favorites tied with MIDNIGHT which also smells</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble keeping it lit.</li>
            <li>This may be good quality Indian incense, but it is also quite expensive.</li>
            <li>i knew this was going to be a good set because you can never go wrong nag champa.</li>
            <li>i ordered these and some of them burn a little too quick and are a little strong.</li>
            <li>I have three fragrances I already like and am familiar with in this six-pack, such as Sandalwood, but the other three new kinds of incense are also inviting.  </li>
            <li>its very hard to find the right scents for the right price you will not be disappointed these incenses are amazing strong and you dont have to burn the whole incense to scent a room or etc</li>
            <li>These are strong and flavorful - with very little smoke.  </li>
            <li>Since in general this is not true, I think you are better off buying these individually with the scent you like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to incense generally.  </li>
            <li>The different scents are different-not just named different and smell pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>The scents are very fragrant but not so much so that they will burn your eyes and nose if you burn a whole one in a small (12&#x27; x 10&#x27;) room.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the original Nag Champa incense by Satya is the Gold standard by which all other incense should be compared.  </li>
            <li>Stays fresh longer then some other brands.</li>
            <li>Some may consider the Sandalwood to be too subtle but I find it to be elegant without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>love the subtle variety.</li>
            <li>i particularly like the yellow pack.</li>
            <li>But if you are wishing a particular incense aroma, but them individually!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of incense and sometimes I get tired of only being able to buy the same thing from the local places that sell incense.</li>
            <li>no black smoke.</li>
            <li>This the the classic blue box incense, and if you&#x27;re shopping for incense you&#x27;ve no doubt heard of it, if not smelled it for yourself.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this sampler.</li>
            <li>Long lasting scent, but I felt like they pretty much all smelled about the same.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find nice incense in this quantity for such a low price.</li>
            <li>They really do burn for a long time.</li>
            <li>The only thing negative I can say about this product is that the incense doesn&#x27;t light as fast and&lt;br</li>
            <li>And they are smaller than your normal incense sticks</li>
            <li>I have always purchased these from my local new age store and</li>
            <li>Incense sticks are impossible to find these days, and this variety pack is a great value.  </li>
            <li>and they last pretty long, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for a couple of them, but overall it&#x27;s a solid set of aromas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This set of fragrances not only took me back to my days in the dorms, but it also really helped with my problem.  </li>
            <li>There simply is no other incense I&#x27;ve found that compares.</li>
            <li>I will just look around at other dollar stores ;)</li>
            <li>Was hard getting it lit, but once it got going it was fine.</li>
            <li>First time i ever tried the other scents by Nag Champa</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this product from Amazon because I had a hard time finding burn incenses in other stores (not every store carries this kind of incenses).</li>
            <li>classic incense scents , I&#x27;ve tried three boxes and their scent is similar to each other, there isn&#x27;t much difference</li>
            <li>It served its purpose, but it was usually nothing special.</li>
            <li>Although I initially agreed with other reviewers who say some of the scents are too &amp;#34;soapy,&amp;#34; or strong, after a couple of tries I no longer felt that way.  </li>
            <li>I had been craving some amazing smelling incense but was skeptical to order them online.</li>
            <li>I generally preferred the \\&quot;Ocean\\&quot; fragrance in Gonesh sticks.</li>
            <li>For the price, number and general quality, the Nag Champa&#x27;s can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>they last quite long in my opinion and you can really feel the smell.</li>
            <li>I barely could smell them no matter how close in I brought them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a nose for incense apparently.</li>
            <li>I have only tried one scent so far (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried two boxes so far</li>
            <li>I was a big fan of everything, sandlewood is by far</li>
            <li>Just be careful opening the paper because they really load the sticks with and powder.</li>
            <li>Although I did not purchase any peppermint incense (which is apparently the incense recommended for ridding yourself of spiders)</li>
            <li>So far I only care for one scent.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this for someone getting their feet wet with incense, or a seasoned individual looking for some variety.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of the scents, not all of them yet, but so far, they&#x27;re VERY pleasing!</li>
            <li>That is approximately 10 times more than you are paying for say Morning Star&#x27;s sandalwood incense at ~2 cents a stick.</li>
            <li>Nothing too heavy or strong and the scents last a long time after burning.</li>
            <li>delivery came quickly, none broken, I love all the scents, no favorite one.</li>
            <li>Because the scent is so heavy, don&#x27;t sit right in front of it or you will get a headache.</li>
            <li>Very hard to keep it burning or lit, I can say that mostly of their customers made that complaint and is true.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that after setting it on fire, it creates strong smells, but the actual process of lighting it is very easy, and as long as I use these outdoors with a fan on, the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, at the price Amazon is charging, you get a lot of different flavors in large quantity that is going to last you a long time.</li>
            <li>Much smokier than other brands that I have used.</li>
            <li>Very well dipped and extremely fragrant.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I run into one or two sticks that do not stay lit, but that is hardly a bother since I still have dozens of sticks to enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Not a single one smells bad or pungent,  and they are well worth their cheap price!</li>
            <li>-The sticks all take a ridiculous amount of time to light.</li>
            <li>So subtle, I forget that I am burning incense and proceed to light another before I realize a stick is still burning.</li>
            <li>Nag Champa is real incense, not some artificially perfumed stick like you find in most stores in the U.S. these days.  </li>
            <li>They came to us nice and fresh-no need to constantly re-light these sticks, what a pain that is getting stale incense.  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong but not too weak either.  </li>
            <li>(Some people say the same thing about stick incense in general, but think that is an exaggeration.)  </li>
            <li>Also surprised how long they burned.</li>
            <li>I do not want to buy a chore, if new \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; incense indeed doesn&#x27;t burn well then the seller should do whatever is necessary to dry it out before shipping it.</li>
            <li>The scents were ok and the incense dust is a little excessive.</li>
            <li>Long lasting scent and filled not only the room but other distant parts of the house, two floors away!  </li>
            <li>I have purchased tons of incense over the past few years and this is my favorite variety pack.  </li>
            <li>Each pack comes with about 10 sticks, and they burn super slow (each stick lasts at least half an hour, probably more like 45 minutes).</li>
            <li>They are very hard to light.</li>
            <li>The bottom of each box is filled with at least two inches of shaken off powdery fragrance; so you&#x27;re left with old, dried out, and mostly bare sticks.  </li>
            <li>They were very dry, must have been old...</li>
            <li>The sticks can be a little crumbly, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the real thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky about odors and the little nuances in them.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad per se, just not as good as the others.</li>
            <li>So far the only one I don&#x27;t care for too much is the sandalwood incense which is strange because I usually like sandalwood scents.</li>

            <li> Great item and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I love satya incense and this is the best way to figure what your favorite scents are and maybe which ones don&#x27;t appeal to you before getting stuck with a large quantity of it.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever burned.</li>
            <li> We think Champa, by far, is the best.</li>
            <li> Enjoy and good Karma to all of you.</li>
            <li> This brand by far has had the best quality, burn time and scent of any others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The mark of a good incense is that the flame will automatically go out after you light it.  </li>
            <li> The scents I&#x27;ve used, so far, (Patchouli Forest and Celestial)  smell exquisite.  </li>
            <li> I love this, it&#x27;s a version deal and all of the incense are amazing.</li>
            <li> They smell amazing unlit, and even better when lit.</li>
            <li> Wow this set if wonderful!</li>
            <li> the stores that carry this kind of incense in my area charge a lot more.  </li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE THIS STUFF, IT&#x27;S A NICE COPULATION OF SCENTS.  </li>
            <li> I bought additional packs for gifts for young professionals, and they were very impressed with the scents.</li>
            <li> I love the sunrise, but honestly</li>
            <li> Love getting this combo pack, the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> I will do much better to choose my own scents though.</li>
            <li> Nice to try assorted to find what one likes better.</li>
            <li> I love all of these, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> The others are all amazing too so the sandalwood is just my favorite (for now).  </li>
            <li> Did not smell like soap, came on time, burns right, smells great.</li>
            <li> They are pretty potent and they all smell so good!</li>
            <li> Some, in fact, are quite pleasant and sweet.  </li>
            <li> love love love this!</li>
            <li> Fast service, very good product, will buy again many times from this seller.</li>
            <li> Lovely aroma, great price, easy to light and to use, variation of fragrances is a delightful touch, all around great little product.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, highly recommend if you want a bit of Oriental spice in your home.</li>
            <li> I loved the scents; each set has its own distinct smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have some different options besides Nag Champa all the time (though it is unarguably the best).</li>
            <li> Not too overpriced, and all the scents are somewhat similar, but incredibly fragrant in a good way.  </li>
            <li> This is not only a great buy, but it is a great experiment in incense.  </li>
            <li> These are the best incenses for authentic, earthy aromas that are not nauseating, flowery or fruity.&lt;br /&gt;The nag champa is the one frequently used in yoga studios and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not going into too much detail on the scents because everyone has their own preference (My favorite would be Midnight), but the variety and price of this pack is great.</li>
            <li> Very cheap price for the amount you get, too.</li>
            <li> Very smooth smell, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Smelling it right now and loving it!  </li>
            <li> Nice strong scent but</li>
            <li> Great for relaxing and creating atmosphere for meditation or just to draw in positive energies.</li>
            <li> We liked some of these scents more than others, but they&#x27;re all pretty good.</li>
            <li> The incense smell nice and burn just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of fine incense.</li>
            <li> Great selection and large quantity for the price.  </li>
            <li> Each one has a unique, pleasant aroma which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy.</li>
            <li> This variety pack has excellent quality incense that works with so many different moods.  </li>
            <li> It burned ok and smelled alright.</li>
            <li> This stuff did the trick but be advised that you house will smell like an Indian Bazaar :).</li>
            <li> We put together all our favorite boxes, and took a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents, but not this brand.</li>
            <li> Be well :)</li>
            <li> i used to drive quite a distance to purchase this brand incense AND paid much more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Some scents are better than others.</li>
            <li> Well i love this product..and have always...</li>
            <li> These have an authentic scent and burn well .</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack a incense so as to get a more robust sample of many smells rather than the one I always buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to find a company brand better than Satya Sai Baba.</li>
            <li> After sampling each of the scents, however, I love them all.  </li>
            <li> Everything is hand-rolled and has authentic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> and i recommend these to people, and people have told me that they like it :)</li>
            <li> a incense user for many years</li>
            <li> the price here is so much better.</li>

            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> What is wonderful is the quality and the different tones of each type.</li>
            <li> the regular nag champa has to be about the best incense i have ever smelled.   </li>
            <li> but it is the most potent smelling product I have ever bought.    </li>
            <li> i love the scents of all the kinds in this set.</li>
            <li> My favorite has to be sunrise and celestial.</li>
            <li> I love every \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; in this pack of 6.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> The packaging was okay.</li>
            <li> The Nag Champa and Midnight are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Namast&amp;eacute;! :)</li>
            <li> I suspect I will be quite satisfied with all 6.  </li>
            <li> Better than the Incense you see in stores.</li>
            <li> I will order more when I burn through all these.  </li>
            <li> I did like them all however and am glad I bought them.</li>

            <li> /&gt;That said, sandalwood is the one that initially smelled best to me and</li>
            <li> still the one I like most.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burning incense for years and this is my favorite brand by par.  </li>
            <li> They are nowhere near the best incense sticks I purchased, but they are so cheap I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I love these incense.</li>
            <li> .i love that</li>
            <li> I decided to see what amazon had to offer and these were among the top rated so decided to give it a go.  </li>
            <li> Me and the girl love the midnight and forest scents the most.  </li>
            <li> They are of MUCH BETTER quality than some of the incense sold as singles so you can pick and choose your scents.</li>
            <li> Good variety, powerful incense.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but it smells like a smoke shop, which is OK I guess.</li>
            <li> I love incense and always buy this brand.</li>
            <li> They said they love them one two three</li>
            <li> and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I love the names on the boxes and of course the incense in them.  </li>
            <li> i doubt you can find anything much better.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> These are so much better.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell, but I have to keep relighting the stick every five minutes.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>

            <li> I found this to better and longer burning.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite brand of incense and midnight and forest patchouli are my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I was looking for incense comparable in quality to what I buy at the Renaissance Festival every year from a couple of my favorite vendors.</li>
            <li> glad I gave these a chance.</li>
            <li> I love the selection and pick the type I want according to mood, time of day, etc.</li>
            <li> because there was a problem with the Patchouli Forest they sent me a different one called MONEY which they said it was one of their best selling incense</li>
            <li> but im sure they will be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> WAY too strong...</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that they might be too strong when burned.  </li>
            <li> The smoke is strong, which I like</li>
            <li> I like the midnight and sandlewood smell, others are too strong perfume.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of mysterious, in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are rather strong.</li>
            <li> It has a strong odor</li>
            <li> They smell strong in the box, but once lit they are not overpowering.</li>

            <li> Really strongly scented.</li>
            <li> Way too strong.</li>
            <li> Not even the nice naturally fragranced kind.  </li>

            <li> What a super price!</li>
            <li> They shipped with prime which is always quick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a most pleasant change from burning only nag champa each day while meditating and relaxing.</li>
            <li> The scents are strong and rich and provide an atmosphere of relaxation.  </li>
            <li> Sunrise is like the original with a strong floral kick.</li>
            <li> Plus, the additional flavors were a huge plus.    </li>
            <li> Great smelling incense, one stick burns in approximately an hour giving off a great scent.</li>
            <li> Huge assortment of incense.</li>
            <li> Maybe for a cheap skate that counts every penny twice and chooses to sacrifice his pleasures away on an altar of miserliness.</li>
            <li> The lasting smell these have is great as well.</li>
            <li> LOL Out of body spiritual beings seem to also like these incense</li>

            <li> Overall, I am happy with the variety.</li>
            <li> -  Has a Light powder</li>
            <li> - Has a Light powder scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is smoke after all, it&#x27;s probably not such a great idea to breath it in all day.</li>
            <li> Real incense, smells amazing, quality product.</li>
            <li> At the fantastic price?  </li>
            <li> i prefer Free Solls.</li>

            <li> now send me a free pack</li>
            <li> so i can light the house up.</li>

            <li> Overall, I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Fun to try, although the sandalwood wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> It came sealed in a ziploc bag, and the incense I received is fresh and lasts forever. :)</li>
            <li> This assortment very much fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> If you buy incense a lot, than here is a great deal and an opportunity to experiment with mixed scents.  </li>
            <li> You need not be a pothead to enjoy.</li>
            <li> They may be a wee bit of a challenge to light up so</li>
            <li> And it smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of great incense and this fits the mold.</li>
            <li> The Sandalwood scent included, which I normally enjoy from this incense producer, smelled like it had been damaged by water or mold.  </li>
            <li> &quot; so for that i received 2 FREE samples!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too fond of sandalwood, but I still enjoy to burn them anyways</li>
            <li> but I enjoy the &#x27;weirdness&#x27; to the odor.</li>
            <li> Light incense, blow out incense, let incense smoke billow around you and then relax.</li>
            <li> this is a genuine product.</li>
            <li> He liked them so much I went and bought him some.</li>
            <li> And this sampler is great for trying different scents.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent incense burner and have NEVER found any as good as these.  </li>
            <li> They do smell good and leave a wonderful scent after wards, but while burning they were so faint</li>
            <li> I bought these because I, too, buy incense (mostly at dollar stores lol) and this is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> if you loved one, most likely will like the rest, too.</li>
            <li> great price and fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> This incense burns slowly and fills the room with a most wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This package of incense was sooooo strong, you could smell it right threw the Amazon box!  </li>
            <li> : This is a sandalwood and vanilla based incense that has a sweet, spicy something that has quickly made it my favorite incense for relaxing at bedtime.</li>
            <li> the smell is good and pure which i like very much</li>
            <li> It is very economical.</li>
            <li> incense is very powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li> The incense was very fresh, all of the packets were.  </li>
            <li> this was very fun for my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li> The fragrances are quite distinct, articulate, full bodied and bountiful while remaining subtle..never overwhelming.</li>
            <li> They smell pretty good however and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Great product, and will continue ordering them as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> A great way to sample different fragrances, without paying full price for each box.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and were the kind of  high quality incense sticks I was looking for in a variety pack.</li>
            <li> I also picked some up from Whole Foods (don&#x27;t remember the brand), and it was much milder and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I loved these incense, they smell great and are powerful (not enough to smoke you out, but nice and strong), they even arrived a few days before the estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brand of incense because it leaves a true fragrance while burning not a &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; smell like some cheap incense.</li>
            <li> They all smell really wonderful and although they are a bit shorter than other incense they burn MUCH longer!</li>
            <li> They smell great and burn a long while.</li>
            <li> I have resorted to buying just the original Nag Champa scent.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great item and at such a fair price.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more if you are just exploring incense for the first time.  </li>
            <li> so make sure you like it first.  </li>
            <li> and I was excited to find a variety pack.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these incense sticks as a means of trying to deter spiders from entering my home.</li>
            <li> So worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Each smell is particularly unique and inviting.</li>
            <li> The smell is very intoxicating even when they are not lit up! :-)</li>
            <li> Great product, just took way to long to ship</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have bought incense and I am glad I chose these.</li>
            <li> The nag champa is still my favorite incense scent by far but the other scents are wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> These burn for a very long time,and smell great.</li>
            <li> Smells great and burns a very long time</li>
            <li> When I light one of these incredible sticks, the fragrances are so calming; it is as if for a few minutes my cares have been carried away by the smoke.  </li>
            <li> I used free super saver shipping and it was</li>
            <li> By far not the best incense I&#x27;ve tried, but definitely a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> These are great, but the amount of smoke they produce may be too much for those too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have always liked nag champa and was wanting to try more along the same lines.</li>
            <li> I love incense and this is a nice variety of different aromas.</li>
            <li> Being disabled, it is so great to be able to buy these online.</li>
            <li> They are all slightly different, but pleasant.</li>
            <li> aroma was the pleasant surprise, the next morning.</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise they didn&#x27;t when I lit them individually.</li>
            <li> They all smell very nice, burn well and for a long time, and the packaging wasn&#x27;t compromised or damaged with delivery.</li>
            <li> I would assume it&#x27;s just me since I read many positive feedbacks before making a purchase.</li>
            <li> If you like a good long lasting Incense these are great.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good while it is being burned which is not always the case with some other more &#x27;perfumey&#x27; brands.  </li>
            <li> This adds a special quality to the room.</li>
            <li> These were very strong and I enjoyed the fact that they could perfume the entire house.  </li>
            <li> They make a perfect Christmas gift for those who are hard to buy for.</li>
            <li> Product definitely as expected and a great deal.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t buy incense this cheap, but I saw so many 5 stars, so I thought what the heck, just give it a try...</li>
            <li> burns well and long, fresh this year stamped and make my house smell great for a loong time.   </li>
            <li> Great quality, as expected.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with the quality and with this purchase in general.</li>
            <li> Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> i love these incense so much.</li>
            <li> they arrived on time, but as soon as i opened the box and look at the incent sticks and the boxes were full of dust from the sticks.only about a quarter of the sticks was still burnable.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I haven&#x27;t tried all 5 scents yet.</li>
            <li> I loved every scent, especially the Nag Champa and Sunrise.</li>
            <li> Many Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have akways loved Staya incense, especially the Nag Champa!</li>
            <li> I got a got variety that should last me a good couple of month.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this package is that it is perfect for a begginer who is not experienced with the different scents from the satya brand..</li>
            <li> Very please with the price :)</li>
            <li> Even the standard incenses are so much superior.</li>
            <li> I got these safe and fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> used it on my rest room make it clear and nice</li>
            <li> instead these all&lt;br /&gt;turned out to be overpowering sweet and ultimately&lt;br /&gt;annoying.</li>
            <li> Oh sweet goodness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked them all so far.</li>
            <li> and I love them all just as much.</li>
            <li> Again, not a bad thing, but this should be considered.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, better than average packaging (good and protective, airtight)  quality product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are strong but not too overpowering and this little sampler is great.</li>
            <li> the quality is high, better than most, and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> Great scents, nice slow burn....when I think of incense, this is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> But I love the different scents and am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase some as my febreeze was not cutting the farts good enough.  </li>
            <li> I burn Nag Champa Super Hit all the time.</li>
            <li> 2nd time purchasing these, they all smell wonderful and will definitely continue buying them!</li>
            <li> and I find that some burn too quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fairly quick.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best incense I&#x27;ve ever used, you could smell the scent as soon as you open the plastic, they are a bit smaller in length, but the odor lingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like to give this product and the seller zillion stars because both are extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed Celestial, Sunrise, Midnight, and Nag Champa the most, but ultimately, I was please with all six boxes, and will continue to purchase from this source.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I am not that experienced with incense much beyond what I have purchased at the dollar store and local fairs.  </li>
            <li> Nag Champa flavor box (2012, 11 sticks) also came with a bonus packet of two full-sized sticks of Harmony flavor incense, labelled \\&quot;free sample\\&quot; which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I feel I am going to go through these quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and would consider reordering when I&#x27;m in need of more.</li>
            <li> Took so many re-lights to get any use out of them, we proably spend more on lighter fluid than the incense.</li>
            <li> Sunrise is my favorite one so far, although I still have yet to light sandalwood, celestial, and the forest one.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed each type of incense that was included and would surely purchase this same product</li>
            <li> Be sure to ventilate the areas you burn them in - especially if you have kids! :)</li>
            <li> i realized i like all the scents, so i have not narrowed down my scent preference, but they all are great and have been giving my room a variety of cool scents.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this pack to anyone newer to incense looking to find a favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Contained both familiar and new scents of incense, all of which are great (especially the patchouli forest and celestial!)</li>
            <li> Every box has a distinct pleasant aroma and each stick is long burning.  </li>
            <li> They make great gifts especially to people whose homes you visit that might have a funny or not so funny smell to them.</li>
            <li> All the scents are nice and it generally lasts around 3 to 4 months using them around 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I have loved them all so far, most especially Midnight.</li>
            <li> I really love and totally recommend this product, the smell is soft and calming and you can tell the quality is extremely good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to incense and wasn&#x27;t sure which scents to buy.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and they all smell great</li>
            <li> I finally brought them in and put one box underneath the sink in my bathroom, which needs some consistent pleasant aroma, and it actually was nice for that.  </li>
            <li> They last long and smell awesome!</li>
            <li> Best Incense, long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone who loves authentic incense!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> but I will put at number 3 in my list of which ones first to buy...~!~</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t set off smoke alarms like store-bought big ones (also better for your lungs!).</li>
            <li> At first it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are getting very much, especially when it is delivered, but I have enjoyed many hours with this set.  </li>
            <li> They really did burn for an entire hour and were all fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They last about an hour and keep an area smelling nice for a nice long while, I&#x27;ll light one at night around 11pm</li>
            <li> Great smells but a little messey when opened them.</li>
            <li> Great value, and not cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> These were offered as an Add On at a reasonable price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> These we smaller than i expected, but had awesome fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are worth getting.</li>
            <li> Get it, its worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love all the different scents they are able to create and look forward to getting more of them in the future!</li>
            <li> All the scents are nice and should last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful after years of using &#x27;clearing house&#x27; imitators that performed poorly.</li>
            <li> By the time it reached me, all 6 scents were blended together leaving none of them smelling like their distinct aroma should be.</li>
            <li> Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> The Midnight one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> The Nag Champa varieties are worth every penny, and I say that as a cheapskate.</li>
            <li> But what I loved most about it is the way it burns: it burns slowly and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> But once you actually burn them, they each have they&#x27;re own distinct scent.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a couple of these locally and really liked them.</li>
            <li> Make sure you actually light them to see how they smell, as the smoke often smells quite different from the unburned smell of the sticks.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not crazy about the Forest Patchouli, so we give that one to a friend.</li>
            <li> Even if there&#x27;s a couple types you don&#x27;t like, it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> The scents are quite pleasurable to the olfactory glands, while the burn is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> all the different odors are nice.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it feels nice to finally have some variety.</li>
            <li> Favorite brand by far.</li>
            <li> It was worth a shot, and maybe you&#x27;ll like the scents that I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Also worth noting:</li>
            <li> It is a rare patchouli, this, and well worth the price of all the rest of the incense in this pack.</li>
            <li> For the price, even if one was off for me, still worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how many incense sticks were in the package.  </li>
            <li> They all kind of smell the same.</li>
            <li> Nice to try out some different flavors as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> so you have a lot of different fragrances fast delivery good quality.</li>
            <li> THey always come fresh in a sealed box which come in a bag.  </li>
            <li> So Honestly though it&#x27;s not a big investment</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> my own personal preference (though three of my friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll light mine in a room at the corner of my house and even with the door shut and window open, it lingers around most of the house.</li>
            <li> Delicious scent, they last a lot and they are not intense at all.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand of incense, in multiple scents, with free shipping on Amazon?</li>
            <li> I initially though I wouldn&#x27;t like, now I kind of like.  </li>
            <li> I have been using incense for many years, and I have to say that this is by far the highest quality product I have used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used incense most of my adult life</li>
            <li> I wish this was only $5 because that&#x27;s all I think it&#x27;s worth, but if you want nice incense shipped to you, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Bought before, this is by far my favorite variety set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often give 5 star ratings, but I really liked all of the different scents included.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> They smelled so fresh and lasted forever.</li>
            <li> Nice and lasting scents.</li>
            <li> I found I kind of like having different scents each day.  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, burns for an acceptably long time.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa has been a long standing favorite in my collection, and now Satya Sai Baba Incenses are offering many new fragrances to enjoy.</li>
            <li> The scent is very powerful, and really just irritated my allergies.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and very fresh.</li>
            <li> What a great Idea I was not aware that this company made so many different flavors.</li>
            <li> These are your standard, run-of-the-mill incense sticks that have that familiar \\&quot;incense\\&quot; smell most people are used to.  </li>
            <li> Love the deep rich smells that fill the room...</li>
            <li> the other scents were also good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the scent of Nag Champa, but I had never tried any other scent made by Satya Sai Baba.</li>
            <li> The scent does drift through the whole house when using them and lingers for a day but it is not overpowering like I originally feared.</li>
            <li> If you want to try other incenses by Nag Champa, this is a good mix.  </li>
            <li> Price was right too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reviewer already described the scents of each of these flavors, so I&#x27;ll just endorse his review and mention that he&#x27;s right about the Patchouli:  </li>
            <li> and I soon bought the 100g box of it right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> However two of them choked me up right after I lit ..</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s own, distinct scent, that you can actually smell while it&#x27;s burning (instead of that mostly smoky smell from the generic kind I mentioned earlier).</li>
            <li> Threw them out, then threw out the trash right away because the trash stunk.</li>
            <li> He goes right to sleep.</li>
            <li> I have two sticks lit right now and not a drop of scent is floating aromatically in the air.  </li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s easy to give it a try and find some new loves.    </li>
            <li> The sticks burn a reasonable amount of time and relatively clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the purchase to avoid going to the Mall or if your like me driving and spending the money on gas to find something that is of equal quality, or if your lucky marginally better.   </li>
            <li> They all are very strong and smell the same to me.</li>
            <li> They almost all smell the same, and they are VERY, VERY, strong.</li>
            <li> The incense is very strong and fills my entire house with the smell from just one stick.</li>
            <li> No other brand we have tried has been as satisfying and mood setting.</li>
            <li> I live in a very damp area of northwestern Oregon and this makes my basement apartment smell so much better and covers up the mildew odor that permeates every dwelling here.  </li>
            <li> Also makes a great small gift for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Each scent is a quality stick, and a pretty fresh product.</li>
            <li> (holographic seal, authentic baggy liners in the box, apparently correct scents...</li>
            <li> , the incense burns nice and long and the scent lingers in the room for quite a while.</li>
            <li> these will make the perfect little extra for Holiday gifts, a sample for each person.  </li>
            <li> It smells like sandalwood ; However, the alcohol  level is very high and the fragrance dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I live in a one bedroom and if I light one in the bedroom, foyer &amp; Living room</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re certainly keeper&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> At the price Amazon is charging, these present such great values.</li>
            <li> I loved the black Nag Champa, so I tried this pack one day.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t burn too fast and the smells are lasting and amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the other scents and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> First off, the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> shipped very fast, quality incense.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> the bundle is a very reasonable purchase if you use a lot of incense like I do.</li>
            <li> With Prime member ship it only gets better with super fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you just can&#x27;t decide on the scent you want, this is a good little mix to try.</li>
            <li> the incense has some of the best, subtle, natural aromas i have found.  </li>
            <li> Being pregnant, my nose is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> The scents reminds me of a head shop or an Asian restaurant, which is fine with me, but some of my friends don&#x27;t like it, prefering incense that smells sweet or like perfume.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch it up a little with this variety pack, which is exactly what this is good for.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is exactly what the picture looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love &#x27;Midnight&#x27; and &#x27;Sunrise&#x27; especially so.</li>
            <li> they are very affordable!</li>
            <li> There are 2 scents that are not my favorite, but my personal perference!!</li>
            <li> However, my personal satisfaction with this stuff is more like 3 stars</li>
            <li> The seller sent me a message complaining I didn&#x27;t contact them first and suggested that I run a hair dryer over all the incense before trying to use it.</li>
            <li> When I buy incense I expect it to be ready to use, open the package, light it, enjoy.</li>
            <li> each of the 6 flavors smells great, and they burn pretty slow.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I asked for.</li>
            <li> The incense came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The real deal!   </li>
            <li> All of them are really nice incense sticks, they burn for long and they arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this item!</li>
            <li> There is only 1 that I don&#x27;t care for, and I LOVE 4 of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an incense expert, but I&#x27;ve bought some different brands that I like much better.  </li>
            <li> These look thicker and burn slower and smell better than the ones carried at my local store.</li>
            <li> I love the Nag Champa blue.  </li>
            <li> I love this incense and have re-ordered several times.</li>
            <li> I would look for something more substantial if I was a regular user of incense.</li>
            <li> Fresh and very fragrant.</li>
            <li> the whole, this 6 pack was worth every penny, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed each of the fragrances for different reasons.g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the whole, this 6 pack was worth every penny, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed each of the fragrances for different reasons.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of these when I start to get low.</li>
            <li> When I first got them, I was burning maybe 3 or 4 a day.</li>
            <li> Perhaps to a more discerning person, these may smell wildly different but to me?</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is top notch and we will be purchasing again in the future.  </li>
            <li> Last a long time, smell great.</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I love this incense, and my husband and I have been using them for several years.</li>
            <li> :) Satya Sai Baba is the only incense for us.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance and great variety of scents.</li>
            <li> If you are pretty allergic I would not recommend to lit this incense.</li>
            <li> They all smell the same and there are to many to even use...</li>
            <li> almost_ as much as a bit of chocolate or a glass of wine!  </li>
            <li> The scents are consistent too.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Nag Champa\\&quot; and instantly fell in love with it again.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not definite though, I am going to try it tonight too get a more awake sense of it and see how I feel.</li>
            <li> Great aroma - long lasting</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know which to burn first</li>
            <li> I will be buying more from this brand in the future!!!</li>
            <li> You could smell the box on the porch - exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot more than those grocery store air fresheners because there is no chemical smell and the scent from the incense last longer after they have burnt out.</li>
            <li> I will return to buying Midnight from my local Indian store, the scent is stronger and captivating.</li>
            <li> Too short and most of the scent turned to dust at the bottom of the bag</li>
            <li> I have purchased these on many different occassions</li>
            <li> Hopefully they come out with more varieties later.</li>
            <li> Nice boxes, although incense is usually quite cheap.</li>
            <li> will be back to get more.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> so i decided to try it out first</li>
            <li> Each scent has exactly that</li>
            <li> how many different smells and</li>
            <li> Very fragrant!</li>
            <li> But I just really like it!</li>
            <li> So much incense!</li>
            <li> but still they are a cut above most incense.</li>
            <li> By getting this multi-pack it let me try a few at a good price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time someplace else, these guys are good.</li>
            <li> Variety pack is good, but found there is not a huge variance in the smells of these.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing I can see what it&#x27;s good for is if you have a strong, bad smell in your home (cooking smells, smoke, someone uses the bathroom lol)</li>
            <li> Years ago after some time I finally settled on Gonesh sticks since it was adequate for my olfactory needs and readily available even at &#x27;dollar stores&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Good for if I want to freshen up a room without leaving a strong incense scent behind.</li>
            <li> some are ok and others might leave a bad smell that kind of makes you nauseous, but these are really-really good so far.</li>
            <li> Overall, these are nice, but definitely nothing special.</li>
            <li> Good price too, better then any local head shop where even these small packages go for 3-4 dollars each.</li>
            <li> Every time I light it I am reminded of the new age stores I visited when I was younger and the intoxicating scent that filled the rooms.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> , each has it&#x27;s distinct smell, for particular times of the day, like sunset, midnight, etc.</li>
            <li> Love that and have also burned a Black so far and love that too.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this set of incense to get a good feel for a few of the different scents and fell in love with these particular ones.</li>
            <li> It provides just a hint of aroma, much less and far more pleasant than one of those commercial plug-ins.  </li>
            <li> ordered several popular brands to compare, and Hem was the clear winner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending me such lovely incense.</li>
            <li> I burn way too much incense daily and Satya is and will be my top choice.</li>
            <li> I love this variety of incense so much that this is the second time it has been ordered.</li>
            <li> very very very strong , careful where you store it</li>
            <li> More really than I plan to use for a long time, but the variety is nice and they came as expected.</li>
            <li> just from lighting the first stick I knew it was VERY high quality.</li>
            <li> These are nice , the smoke burns white , not black like some I have had..</li>
            <li> Long lasting pleasant</li>
            <li> My order was fulfilled by tom&#x27;s incense, but penny lane gift is also a positive experience.  </li>
            <li> I see others leaving positive feedback, maybe it&#x27;s hit or miss</li>
            <li> This is a great bargain and I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this pack again as well as trying some of the other assortments by this maker.</li>
            <li> This multiple scent pack is a great way to try other Satya fragances.</li>
            <li> , all Satya incense is pretty much interchangeable.  </li>
            <li> But this incense is top quality and lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Nag champa has been a favorite of mine for as long as i can remember</li>
            <li> The Sandalwood is a classic scent that I love but again, would not buy a larger amount of...</li>
            <li> While I appreciate that the incense is fresh and new, I don&#x27;t want a chore.</li>
            <li> Smells terrific, lights easily too.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, Becoming addicted to burning one every day.  </li>
            <li> Some people would say that the scents are strong and all smell the same.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too strong but you can tell a big difference when you enter a room.</li>
            <li> You will find it is not as strong as some of the traditional incense scents however.</li>
            <li> Good quality and long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> It is strong and the smell lingers a day later after you have burnt it.</li>
            <li> After almost daily use, none of them seem that strong to me as they did at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying every single essence.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t need another one when I&#x27;m trying to relax.</li>
            <li> The scent is pure and lasts.</li>
            <li> This large quantity has you covered for month after month.</li>
            <li> but I do not believe I would buy a large case of it.</li>
            <li> The other scents are nice too, particularly the sandalwood and the patchouli.  </li>
            <li> Ive used several brands in the past, and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li> I have liked everyone of them so far, and they burn for a very long time.</li>
            <li> But I find this incense smells great, not too strong or artificial or cloying as some incense can be.</li>
            <li> My only real problem with this brand is that for me, it&#x27;s too strong.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like a campfire or anything funny like many of the other brands.</li>
            <li> Very high quality scents.</li>
            <li> The sticks last easily three times longer than your average incense stick and the scents are pretty exotic to what you&#x27;re used to.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask for, you get hard to find sataya flavors and the price is cheap.</li>
            <li> Perhaps because Ive only used the cheap stuff before, and these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> You may only have to relight it once, or you might have to relight it two or three times, but it&#x27;s a huge pain.  </li>
            <li> Really folks regardless how much incense you use..how truly \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; can it be?</li>
            <li> The smell permeated my whole room.  </li>
            <li> I really like patchuli and sunrise.</li>
            <li> They came fast and were well packaged.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> The box says it comes from China; that combined with the chemical smell is just too much for me.    </li>
            <li> This incense burns really well.</li>
            <li> Helps me to fall asleep if I really need to.   </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat this price either.</li>
            <li> Very overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended     Would buy again!</li>
            <li> but it does smell very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am by no means an incense aficionado, and I don&#x27;t know much about them.</li>
            <li> I burn so much incense</li>
            <li> The price for this package deal is very competitive.  </li>
            <li> , I am very please with the quality and the price of my purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The real deal.</li>
            <li> Burns kinda fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that people have their preferences in scent and those preferences usually don&#x27;t much transcend the barriers of type: floral, woody, spicy, citrus, and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this is quality incense, reasonably long-lasting and not too smoky.  </li>
            <li> Such a great variety for such a low price!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend for those not used to Nag Champa to go smell some at a metaphysical store before buying or even Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it, I am an incense fanatic so this really came in handy.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing also.</li>
            <li> Even with shipping charges they are still reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> and I can highly recommend each one!</li>
            <li> But are you really going to return a $7 item??</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know which scents i wanted to order for my son&#x27;s burner.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t know there was a difference until I read some reviews that explained how it is made vs the cheaper ones from discount stores.</li>
            <li> Would rate 5, but not qualified to really judge incense.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to getting some quality incense.</li>
            <li> For me, each stick lasts are 15 minutes, but the scent lingers for much longer.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> very disappointed)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This incense has a very stong, cloying aroma.  </li>
            <li> Every one of these scents is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they use to scent these, but I immediately threw the whole thing away as soon as I opened it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d light and then a few seconds later would go out on their own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want my incense smelling like soap.  </li>
            <li> The or very relaxing woody and smokey.</li>
            <li> However, these were a gift for my son and he really enjoys them.</li>
            <li> Was very exited about this however very dissapointed</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very flaky.</li>
            <li> they were shipped promptly, and whole.  </li>
            <li> Burns very well and does the trick.  </li>
            <li> It is also financially reasonable.</li>
            <li> These incese tend to fall apart, the incense itself turns to powder and is very brittle.</li>
            <li> Patchouli forest smells like patchouli without leaving you and your whole house smelling like a hippie den permanently.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> high quality!</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable because you are getting quality in return.</li>
            <li> You really cant smell the difference in the incense......</li>
            <li> These r the real deal.</li>
            <li> They are the real deal from India.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering again from this seller very soon.</li>
            <li> but we stopped using as much after learning how the smoke can be harmful to your health.</li>
            <li> The sticks also occasionally go out, though for the most part they burn completely with one lighting.    </li>
            <li> The price was far better than those in the stores locally.</li>
            <li> The quality is good and it burns slow compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t as thick, nor did they smell that good.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is too plain for me, but the rest are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I previously bought some charcoal incense from the dollar store, and it didn&#x27;t smell very good and got my hands all black.</li>
            <li> Such a good choice over other incense, I will be buying again when I&#x27;m done with these.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but aroma is pretty weak.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; aroma that is both common yet exotic.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but not overpowering, and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Stay with this particular brand of Nag Champa though as others just are not as pure smelling.</li>
            <li> The rest of them are okay, but they don&#x27;t have that organic, mood-setting quality other incense I&#x27;ve used has.</li>
            <li> is that yes, the blue box original \\&quot;Nag Champa\\</li>
            <li> I will most likely order these when I have two boxes left, which should be very soon!</li>
            <li> Due to my skin condition, I&#x27;m very rarely able to bathe.  </li>
            <li> Usually I just go with incense from my local market... been doing that for a couple years, but i&#x27;ve not found incense that smell that great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to those who wants to relax and meditate.</li>
            <li> The incense is of high quality and has a very pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> For less than a ten spot, you get six 15 gram boxes of quality incense, and all of these scents have something good to offer, though mileage will of course vary.</li>
            <li> The quality has really deteriorated tremendously from the last time I bought it.</li>
            <li> Not new professional boxes, more like store overstock/returns.</li>
            <li> It made her birthday complete they have a long lasting smell and light easily</li>
            <li> it made the house smell nice, but not sure which ones smelled which way.  </li>
            <li> Their quality is consistent and I trust this brand completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad smelling, just not big Patchouli fans here.</li>
            <li> There is not a bad scent in any of the different boxes.  </li>
            <li> Nag Champa is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li> love Nag Champa and never realized there were other scents!  </li>
            <li> Very strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I ordered this pack that I wouldn&#x27;t like several of the scents, despite the good ratings.  </li>
            <li> As another wrote they do take a little longer to light but still worth it..</li>
            <li> Those were longer, hardly created smoke at all, weren&#x27;t messy at all, and had wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> and I remember always enjoying the smell of burning incense for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter scent, and more uplifting, less meditative than the others.</li>
            <li> I got a black top which I did not order.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like Sunrise and Midnight.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any particular problem with the incense.</li>
            <li> Others were decent.</li>
            <li> and bring a vibrant energy to the home.</li>
            <li> Extremely quick delivery and cheaper than going to my local Health Food store to buy it.  </li>
            <li> A classic that is missed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more soon enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the fact that wood is used, but the resulting fragrance excuses any inconvenience...</li>
            <li> The celestial and midnight are particularly stimulating.  </li>
            <li> I keep forgetting that I only like nag champa and super hit</li>
            <li> I will definitely stock up on more when I begin to run low.</li>
            <li> and it being the same quality as most of the products I&#x27;ve found recently.  </li>
            <li> Considering the local stores around me that sell these, I&#x27;m lucky to spend $3.99 on one pack.</li>
            <li> these are lovely and despite what some say I think that the scents are very different, not at all the same - i like!</li>
            <li> I know It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li> Outside of the blue box Nag Champa these varieties are ok.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fall in love with any of them and even the blue box seems to have been made from a different recipe from what I remember of it.</li>
            <li> I personally like the Nag Champa the most, it is very relaxing after long days of work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a frequent incense user, and this one has strong chemical smell, not natural.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are looking to change the atmosphere of your household.   </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into burning incense, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I suspect the incense started out as high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to burn incense.</li>
            <li> I will definatly order these again and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this set.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i am highly dissapointed with this.</li>
            <li> This is really high quality stuff.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product is high quality.</li>
            <li> and i highly suggest them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and are of high quality.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand and flavored incense.</li>
            <li> These are all high quality sticks.</li>
            <li> They are highly fragranced.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like high- quality incense.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand and this seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, it just smells a little like an older woman&#x27;s perfume.    </li>
            <li> I have some other &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; incense that is waaaay too strong.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that I might not like the smell, but, I loved it right away!   </li>
            <li> All of the boxes were dry, clean, neat, sealed, undamaged.  </li>
            <li> and i was surprised that they came here fast even tho</li>
            <li> We got several scents that we are having fun smelling.</li>
            <li> and i guess its worth the couple bucks extra just to keep the cat litter smell at bay.</li>
            <li> It is perfectly normal for the intensity of the smell to fade over time.</li>
            <li> Normally I like the smell of these fire sticks.  </li>
            <li> Mellow yet powerful at the same time.</li>
            <li> The smells are powerful enough to be noticed, but not overpowering like a lot of incense.</li>
            <li> Like most burning incense from India, these are messy; they shed all over the place.  </li>
            <li> the ones I normally get, but</li>
            <li> My favorite is Sunrise and Midnight, although there were none that I disliked.</li>
            <li> They all pretty much smell the same as well.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> make sure you let the incense burn a few seconds before you blow out the spark.</li>
            <li> Love the scents, they last a long time.</li>
            <li> It burns nice a slowly without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Another good thing is they are thin</li>
            <li> Each stick is nice and thick, and burns for upwards of an hour, plus the scent lingers for quite a while afterwards without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> If you like Nag Champa, you will almost certainly enjoy the other flavors since their quality, richness, and subtle blends are just as fine as the original.  </li>
            <li> I must confess i am a new comer to the world that is mediation and am learning more everyday..</li>
            <li> Unless you burn one or more every day, this pack will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> and they last a very long time :}</li>
            <li> Forest\\&quot; next which is as strong as the Nag Champa blue box with a woodsy scent.</li>
            <li> Not much else to really say about these incense other than they smell nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something new to rotate my normal Nag Champa</li>
            <li> As of right now, the strength of the scent only lasts one day.</li>
            <li> All the scents are terrific, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Now if we can only get his formula right.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting scent, burns evenly, each stick lasts sa long time and the scents are real and authentic!</li>
            <li> You sit down, and just have to wonder why they think I want to smell that strong cleaning chemical while I eat.    </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to continually burn them to enjoy them as with some other incense sticks.  </li>
            <li> But given that there are five other ones I love, I give it an excuse of only a star, and it&#x27;s more than likely</li>
            <li> They all smell just like every head or new age shop</li>
            <li> I do live in apartment, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to incense, but these burn substantially longer than all others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped immediately and all items are brand new and sealed.</li>
            <li> I have a preemie brand new to the home.</li>
            <li> Midnight after the sun goes down on Friday night, Sandal Wood just because I love Sandalwood sooooo sooothing, Sunrise when I meditate in the mornings before getting ready for work and Celestial for my Spiritual Well Being and quite time.</li>
            <li> They last very long and the smell is so amazing it keeps in your room even the next day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scents are naturalistic, which is great because I hate flowery/overly-artificial incense scents.</li>
            <li> I have only used half a stick so far but these smell amazing..</li>
            <li> the smell is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> I found out if I &#x27;nearly&#x27; light the entire thing, by going over it with a flame, some moisture will bubble out and it will in fact burn all the way without having to be lit a second time.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Celestial: This is a subtle fragrance that I&#x27;ve found useful for balancing out strong, single-note fragrances like Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s Jasmine Blossom.</li>
            <li> I got green pants but no green top.</li>
            <li> I had to use nearly 5-6 incense sticks of Nag Champa to get a decent aroma.</li>
            <li> This is usually a decent low-priced Indian incense product; but the set of 6 x 15g boxes I received seemed... old.  </li>
            <li> Out of the box, these sticks smell great which only makes it worse when you burn them and are stunned by how they smell nothing like before you burned them.</li>
            <li> now many sticks i get for so little money!</li>
            <li> I burn incense on very, very rare occasions and then only briefly.  </li>
            <li> (This can happen if the incense gets moist or very old; I have a feeling the seller just sent me a very, very old sampler box of this</li>
            <li> Very natural scent</li>
            <li> I burn a lot of incense, and these sticks last more than the average time, and burn steadily and evenly.</li>
            <li> Strong but doesn&#x27;t linger long enough.</li>
            <li> Very little punk-type odor, not excessively smoky as most India-type (dung-based) sticks tend to be.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> We love almost every scent that they make, but we think that they&#x27;ve recently the formula to their Agarbatti (blue box) scent, that specific incense seems to give me a headache now, which it never used to do in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each incense smells almost exactly the same, they all contain a powder smell.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Do not buy the 100g boxes of the exact same stuff.  </li>
            <li> Burn long and omit a powerful scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the original Nag Champa incense (in the blue box) for years from our local &#x27;novelty&#x27; shop.</li>
            <li> Mystical, Transcendental, and Peaceful are some of the thoughts these scents inspire in myself personally..</li>
            <li> that were present when I first arrived.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would request a return as &#x27;defective&#x27; but for the cheap price I paid, it&#x27;s not worth my time.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting - this is the only incense I use.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading some reviews about how the incense all smell the same and when I first opened the package I assumed it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure why most people use this type of product, I used it to help me meditate and pray.  </li>
            <li> Nice variety of smells - the incense sticks are very durable none have broken so far</li>
            <li> These are my favorite incense especially the regular blue nagchampa &amp; midnight nag champa.</li>
            <li> Good quality, long burning and the scent is soft and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the patchouli forest--it is a little too strong and perfumey for me.</li>
            <li> And since there are only 2 and one sells one kind and the other only sells 3</li>
            <li> only burned a couple, but so far they burn longer and smell better than the other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, there are a couple of varieties in this bundle that don&#x27;t really smell particularly good (at least to me).  </li>
            <li> Is a strong mixed of Indian spices  not suitable for everybody,specially for those with a mild sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> I bought the variety pack to sample new scents so far</li>
            <li> Long burning (usually about an hour), clean smelling (never smells \\&quot;burned\\&quot; like some cheap incense does).  </li>
            <li> The sticks fit in my coffin burner and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Fresh too, not stale dried out or impaired scent.</li>
            <li> The package of Nag Champa is filled about an inch and a half from the bottom with nothing but the flakes.</li>
            <li> I Recommend this to any one who likes a variety of incense,  they burn slowly and last long and smell great.</li>
            <li> Slow burning for a long lasting scent, and this package has a great variety of scent.</li>
            <li> We usually burn these near the litter box for obvious reasons,but they&#x27;re really nice anytime,anywhere.</li>
            <li> A little too much smoke and burns far too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Some are a little strong, but overall they work very well.</li>
            <li> and I still have more than half of them left.</li>
            <li> We will just keep getting these and the Japanese incense, which do not have the bamboo stick in it, but tend to have more subdued fragrance (less smoke,</li>
            <li> There were only a pair of scents which were less than appealing to me.</li>
            <li> I had only had the blue box and super hit from Champa.  </li>
            <li> I usually just bought the blue champa incense box from my local indian market, I saw these on lot and figured why not give them all a try, every last one is great</li>
            <li> The Midnight and Celestial are a little too light and perfumey for me</li>
            <li> I received the incense in record time and it was well packaged, There was a little crushing at the end of the boxes, but it did not damage the incense sticks.</li>
            <li> They are a very slow burn incense which is nice</li>
            <li> Box-in-a-box packaging was weird, but for the price, this is a great sampler pack or regular buy if you like them all.</li>
            <li> Burn one in the office every morning to clear the air.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised and absolutely fancied the variety of the different smells.</li>
            <li> I have enough of those thanks.</li>
            <li> no cloying flowery fragrances...just soft, dreamy scents</li>
            <li> WOW..</li>
            <li> much* cheaper than psychically buying the same amount in a store.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give 5 stars, is because some of them have too much mositure in them.</li>
            <li> Really like the different scents in this variety pack!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference in the 6 different scents.</li>
            <li> If you can find these at a store (try looking near the beach or close to college campuses), I&#x27;d suggest buying one or two sticks of each and seeing if you like them before you order.  </li>
            <li> THIS is the patchouli you smelled that time in somebody&#x27;s dorm room and asked what it was and was surprised by the answer you got.</li>
            <li> The 1st purchase surprised me, a lot.</li>
            <li> I placed the set of six boxes on my trunk, that&#x27;s near my headboard.&lt;br /&gt;Their</li>
            <li> When I saw this combination near Christmas time, I knew I was going to be getting it for hubby to give to me.</li>
            <li> these smell natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old hippie type, and have used incense since the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try s few differnt ones and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> The sticks burn for a considerable amount of time which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;sometimes goes out before burning completely.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to the old standby after they run out,.</li>
            <li> With this purchase, literally every stick so far has burned out after a couple minutes and needed to be relit.  </li>
            <li> After buying this for my daughter, I can tell the superiority in quality that this brand offers.</li>
            <li> so far come out with almost all of the incense flaked off.</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t tried this brand of incense before, i think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The longest so far was an hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> so far it is one of my favorites tied with MIDNIGHT which also smells</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble keeping it lit.</li>
            <li> This may be good quality Indian incense, but it is also quite expensive.</li>
            <li> i knew this was going to be a good set because you can never go wrong nag champa.</li>
            <li> i ordered these and some of them burn a little too quick and are a little strong.</li>
            <li> I have three fragrances I already like and am familiar with in this six-pack, such as Sandalwood, but the other three new kinds of incense are also inviting.  </li>
            <li> its very hard to find the right scents for the right price you will not be disappointed these incenses are amazing strong and you dont have to burn the whole incense to scent a room or etc</li>
            <li> These are strong and flavorful - with very little smoke.  </li>
            <li> Since in general this is not true, I think you are better off buying these individually with the scent you like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to incense generally.  </li>
            <li> The different scents are different-not just named different and smell pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> The scents are very fragrant but not so much so that they will burn your eyes and nose if you burn a whole one in a small (12&#x27; x 10&#x27;) room.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the original Nag Champa incense by Satya is the Gold standard by which all other incense should be compared.  </li>
            <li> Stays fresh longer then some other brands.</li>
            <li> Some may consider the Sandalwood to be too subtle but I find it to be elegant without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> love the subtle variety.</li>
            <li> i particularly like the yellow pack.</li>
            <li> But if you are wishing a particular incense aroma, but them individually!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of incense and sometimes I get tired of only being able to buy the same thing from the local places that sell incense.</li>
            <li> no black smoke.</li>
            <li> This the the classic blue box incense, and if you&#x27;re shopping for incense you&#x27;ve no doubt heard of it, if not smelled it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this sampler.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent, but I felt like they pretty much all smelled about the same.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find nice incense in this quantity for such a low price.</li>
            <li> They really do burn for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing negative I can say about this product is that the incense doesn&#x27;t light as fast and&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they are smaller than your normal incense sticks</li>
            <li> I have always purchased these from my local new age store and</li>
            <li> Incense sticks are impossible to find these days, and this variety pack is a great value.  </li>
            <li> and they last pretty long, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for a couple of them, but overall it&#x27;s a solid set of aromas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This set of fragrances not only took me back to my days in the dorms, but it also really helped with my problem.  </li>
            <li> There simply is no other incense I&#x27;ve found that compares.</li>
            <li> I will just look around at other dollar stores ;)</li>
            <li> Was hard getting it lit, but once it got going it was fine.</li>
            <li> First time i ever tried the other scents by Nag Champa</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product from Amazon because I had a hard time finding burn incenses in other stores (not every store carries this kind of incenses).</li>
            <li> classic incense scents , I&#x27;ve tried three boxes and their scent is similar to each other, there isn&#x27;t much difference</li>
            <li> It served its purpose, but it was usually nothing special.</li>
            <li> Although I initially agreed with other reviewers who say some of the scents are too &amp;#34;soapy,&amp;#34; or strong, after a couple of tries I no longer felt that way.  </li>
            <li> I had been craving some amazing smelling incense but was skeptical to order them online.</li>
            <li> I generally preferred the \\&quot;Ocean\\&quot; fragrance in Gonesh sticks.</li>
            <li> For the price, number and general quality, the Nag Champa&#x27;s can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> they last quite long in my opinion and you can really feel the smell.</li>
            <li> I barely could smell them no matter how close in I brought them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a nose for incense apparently.</li>
            <li> I have only tried one scent so far (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried two boxes so far</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of everything, sandlewood is by far</li>
            <li> Just be careful opening the paper because they really load the sticks with and powder.</li>
            <li> Although I did not purchase any peppermint incense (which is apparently the incense recommended for ridding yourself of spiders)</li>
            <li> So far I only care for one scent.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this for someone getting their feet wet with incense, or a seasoned individual looking for some variety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the scents, not all of them yet, but so far, they&#x27;re VERY pleasing!</li>
            <li> That is approximately 10 times more than you are paying for say Morning Star&#x27;s sandalwood incense at ~2 cents a stick.</li>
            <li> Nothing too heavy or strong and the scents last a long time after burning.</li>
            <li> delivery came quickly, none broken, I love all the scents, no favorite one.</li>
            <li> Because the scent is so heavy, don&#x27;t sit right in front of it or you will get a headache.</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep it burning or lit, I can say that mostly of their customers made that complaint and is true.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that after setting it on fire, it creates strong smells, but the actual process of lighting it is very easy, and as long as I use these outdoors with a fan on, the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, at the price Amazon is charging, you get a lot of different flavors in large quantity that is going to last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Much smokier than other brands that I have used.</li>
            <li> Very well dipped and extremely fragrant.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I run into one or two sticks that do not stay lit, but that is hardly a bother since I still have dozens of sticks to enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Not a single one smells bad or pungent,  and they are well worth their cheap price!</li>
            <li> -The sticks all take a ridiculous amount of time to light.</li>
            <li> So subtle, I forget that I am burning incense and proceed to light another before I realize a stick is still burning.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is real incense, not some artificially perfumed stick like you find in most stores in the U.S. these days.  </li>
            <li> They came to us nice and fresh-no need to constantly re-light these sticks, what a pain that is getting stale incense.  </li>
            <li> It is not too strong but not too weak either.  </li>
            <li> (Some people say the same thing about stick incense in general, but think that is an exaggeration.)  </li>
            <li> Also surprised how long they burned.</li>
            <li> I do not want to buy a chore, if new \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; incense indeed doesn&#x27;t burn well then the seller should do whatever is necessary to dry it out before shipping it.</li>
            <li> The scents were ok and the incense dust is a little excessive.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent and filled not only the room but other distant parts of the house, two floors away!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased tons of incense over the past few years and this is my favorite variety pack.  </li>
            <li> Each pack comes with about 10 sticks, and they burn super slow (each stick lasts at least half an hour, probably more like 45 minutes).</li>
            <li> They are very hard to light.</li>
            <li> The bottom of each box is filled with at least two inches of shaken off powdery fragrance; so you&#x27;re left with old, dried out, and mostly bare sticks.  </li>
            <li> They were very dry, must have been old...</li>
            <li> The sticks can be a little crumbly, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the real thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about odors and the little nuances in them.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad per se, just not as good as the others.</li>
            <li> So far the only one I don&#x27;t care for too much is the sandalwood incense which is strange because I usually like sandalwood scents.</li>
            <li> The stick hold the incense together clearly overpowers any other smell.</li>
            <li> whatever strange smells waft through the apartment when we open the door to the outside world.</li>
            <li> Should last me a long time (as I don&#x27;t burn them daily).  </li>
            <li> They last plenty long - sometimes I put one out midway and relight the next day.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and fill home with the traditional Indian scents.  </li>
            <li> This package delivers the true incense experience, made naturally, smells sublime, not overpowering like fake floral types.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty hard to beat.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving 4 out of 5 stars is because some of the sticks can be broken, most likely in transportation however that can become a little bit of an annoyance.</li>
            <li> I ordered this incense on Saturday, with standard shipping, and was pleasantly surprised to see it on Monday, half the time predicted.</li>
            <li> They seem to be working as they should, though I&#x27;m not sure I can really tell the difference between scents.</li>
            <li> The scents last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> These will last me for a long, long time and the price was so low.</li>
            <li> - Won&#x27;t buy these again as long as the their quality remains so low.</li>
            <li> My housemates also have incense sticks of a different brand and some of them have sort of a too intense smokey/acidic smell that makes it not very pleasant to smell for an extended time.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> They last a long time, are a bit smokey (what do you expect though, they&#x27;re incense!)</li>
            <li> but i have not liked it as much as the last two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the various &#x27;flavors&#x27; that come in this package, I like every single one of them.</li>
            <li> My faves are Celestial and Midnight; both are rich, heavy, complex scents.</li>
            <li> It has been said that these sticks are smaller than other brands but they actually last longer.</li>
            <li> This was so artificial and over the top.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa sticks will give you an aura of peace, serenity and an alluring aromatic experience that lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just what I need after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get here.</li>
            <li> They burned a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t burn as long as I thought they would.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting ripped off for way too long, I am so grateful I turned to Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> It lasts long and has a comforting smell.</li>
            <li> Each one is long burning, and the scent lingers long after burning.</li>
            <li> They burn well with minimal ash left.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of nag champa incenses for a long time.</li>
            <li> Although some of the scents smell roughly the same, they all smell like you are in the maharaja&#x27;s palace.</li>
            <li> I have been trying new stick Incence out of late this was next.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred less alcohol , a smaller bottle but a longer lasting frragrance.  </li>
            <li> Half of the boxes were opened, a couple of those were crushed and they all were old.</li>
            <li> Find a stick or other similar piece of old dead wood.</li>
            <li> And they do not last as long as some of my other incense.</li>
            <li> these sticks may be a little shorter than some I&#x27;ve purchased from local shops, but they last twice as long at 1 hr each, and have  robust scents with staying power.  </li>
            <li> I was always a big fan of nag champa, but never tried the other ones before.</li>
            <li> Going to try the other sampler next time.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this brand for long time...excellent!</li>
            <li> and they burn for a really long time!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t shipping either as they came within a larger Amazon box with other stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also last longer than other incenses I used to buy at stores.</li>
            <li> Smells very bad with a very cheap perfume like smell that is very off putting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had this set very long</li>
            <li> I will stick with the single pack of the 3</li>
            <li> But the smell was definitely way too strong, therefore unpleasant for me.</li>
            <li> The one in the dark blue box, I think its called \\&quot;Forest\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> They all have a similar base, and then each have a different quality on top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brands from various import stores, some more expensive, some less, but they all pale by comparison.  </li>
            <li> The material is loosely packed onto the sticks.  </li>
            <li> It is not nearly as high a quality as Anna&#x27;s Incense.</li>
            <li> the incense sticks are very messy, and burns a little too fast.</li>
            <li> I use these alot and can burn half a stick and smells till next day.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve had to hassle either a specialty store, or an import store at our local Mall, so having this delivered in only a couple of days</li>
            <li> It is a shock to your senses that can instantly \\&quot;center\\&quot; you if you sit and breathe it in for a little bit.</li>
            <li> It works better than any air freshener and masks any bad smell.</li>
            <li> I use incense around my house to get rid of cooking odors or the stink of a wet dog every now and again.  </li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> thought for closed up winter time.)</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected</li>
            <li> I opened it up and have burned quite a few from the various scents.</li>
            <li> There is not really anything I needed to know before ordering because I have had this before.</li>
            <li> but it was only a few</li>
            <li> Seems a bit expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> My complaint is they are difficult to start, but that may have more to do with my inexperience than the product itself.  </li>
            <li> variety is very \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; which I don&#x27;t care for, and each scent smelled nearly the same to each other (I guess they use the same base?).</li>
            <li> Long lasting, heady, and just plain smells divine!</li>
            <li> A little shorter, but long burning, fewer sticks, but well worth it, expensive, but extreme quality.</li>
            <li> All the other scents so far { I have not tried them all ] are just way to perfumy, if you know what i mean.</li>
            <li> If you are at all sensitive to artificial scents I highly recommend you stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> the sticks burn slowly and have a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting incense that burns slowly and</li>
            <li> so the scent did not get on my other items in the box</li>
            <li> Who knew there were other scents of this brand.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, and they smell like cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try other brands.</li>
            <li> The only small problem was that a couple of the boxes of incense did not continue to burn and had to be re-lit a number of times.  </li>
            <li> Other than this, I do not like the scents AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Incense at local smoke shops.</li>
            <li> I usually have to burn two at the same time of other brands With this brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nag Champa for years, but have never tried the other scents.  </li>
            <li> i am an incense snob and I will not buy other incense again.</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> Not smoky like some other brands.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of being a teenager again burning incense listening to Pink Floyd!</li>
            <li> All of the other sets were not matches.</li>
            <li> Finding anything other than Nagchampa or Superhit in a retail store is unheard of.</li>
            <li> In other words, these aren&#x27;t sample-sized.  </li>
            <li> The number os sticks per box is inconsistent, some had 10 sticks, an other had 13.</li>
            <li> I still have it and use it with other brands.</li>
            <li> I took this incense as a try and see product with the other incense I bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the past and always end up back with Satya Baba.  </li>
            <li> so i figured id try out some other scents.</li>
            <li> mine was a little dry and smelled like burned wood and charcoal.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the sticks crumbled and a some the incense powder fell off the stick, very messy unless you know and open them over the sink.</li>
            <li> I bought some cheap incense from the store and they were very overpowering and horrible.</li>
            <li> Smoky and messy and dry and powdery.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to make a mess just pulling them out of the package.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment was that all the different scents seemed to smell the same.</li>
            <li> Individual packs are at least $2 in the store</li>
            <li> the sticks burn for a long time and are not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll clear that up for anyone else who is confused.  </li>
            <li> I think Nag Champa is one of those things people either love or hate, but everyone recognizes it.</li>
            <li> It burns slowly and smells devine,ill definitely be buying this bundle again!</li>
            <li> Here is how it went down.  </li>
            <li> Burnin&#x60; Down The House.</li>
            <li> If you like Gag Champa, try some other flavors!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating because the scents of all the packages are very pleasing.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t quit half way down the stick.</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong, there are a few that i am not real crazy about</li>
            <li> and it lets me burn less at a time because of how well it fills the room with smoke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Midnight (black box)</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try the other variety pack offered by them and experience the other scents.</li>
            <li> so calming and do not smell like firework smoke (I bought 30 from black market minerals, vanilla, blueberry etc</li>
            <li> They burn longer than a lot of the store bought ones i have had previously</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever have to eat a cow again!</li>
            <li> I previously ordered the set of 12- something like that</li>
            <li> When they are lit, they will burn for less than a minute and then just go out.</li>
            <li> They burn well but are very messy, the powder around the incense is loose.</li>
            <li> Quality products as after burning, don&#x27;t leave too much mess ashes.</li>
            <li> I did so over my sink so that the mess was contained.  </li>
            <li> There were a little less in the box than i thought there would be.</li>
            <li> They burn slowly without the smell of the wooden stick inside and you will not be disappointed with any of the fragrances, there are high quality essential oils in these hand made sticks.</li>
            <li> Not even a little.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the little cones, but ended up getting the incense sticks.  </li>
            <li> They burn out just a little faster then</li>
            <li> maybe hey should be a little heftier.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other incense sticks I&#x27;ve had, these don&#x27;t leave your home smelling excessively smoky, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I usually just burn Nag Champa, thought I would try some other scents.  </li>
            <li> The scent sticks around a little while after you&#x27;re finished burning it, too.</li>
            <li> One of the packs was a little defective and it took a few lit threw burning to use it all up.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to give it a poor rating just because of my personal preference.</li>
            <li> I burn about a 1/2 stick before extinguishing it for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks.</li>
            <li> A few of them I&#x27;d never smelled before.  </li>
            <li> and I will not buy this product again or recommend that anyone else waste their money on this product either.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t harsh like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> , materials rolled onto the stick and then dried.</li>
            <li> I get a few boxes for Christmas gifts every year.</li>
            <li> I use incense everyday for meditation</li>
            <li> (I think it was called \\&quot;orchards and vines\\&quot; and \\&quot;green</li>
            <li> - Has a heavy powder scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Patchouli Forest (green box) - Has a powder &amp; apple cider</li>
            <li> -  Has a Heavy powder scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Took a few days to get the smell out of my house.</li>
            <li> A few sticks had trouble staying lit</li>
            <li> and they just needed to be re-lit a few times.</li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
            <li> The celestial and sunrise are quite nice but the Sandalwood is awful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other Nag Champa sets (with Sunset and other scents that smell terrible) but these are the closest to being like the original with slight variants.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and very strong.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I was a major Patchouly lover, this does not do it for me.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s hard to even walk down the fabric softener aisle).</li>
            <li> Ok so just a little heads up when they arrive and you arent burning them the smell horrible</li>
            <li> The low reviews must&#x27;ve gotten a bad batch or got it from a different vendor, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> am a youth pastor and have burned these on two different occasions to provide a deep experience for the youth, as well as help eliminate some bad musty smells in the \\&quot;youth room\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but I would say a stick burns for at least a half hour, and probably up to an hour.</li>
            <li> But it was an add - on item that cost very little .</li>
            <li> very little product for the price.</li>
            <li> The sticks don&#x27;t burn like they were damp, there is very little aroma.</li>
            <li> But then, I usually prefer earthy scents...</li>
            <li> :/    </li>
            <li> I do not know what to do with these :\</li>
            <li> I have a fairly small 2 bedroom apartment.</li>
            <li> usually 30-35 minutes) per stick.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure about Nag Champa then consider my advice.  </li>
            <li> scent that is not overwhelming</li>
            <li> Each box comes with about 14 sticks that burn at the usual rate.</li>
            <li> They were the most awful thing I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Our family stays away from artificial scents and we have become sensitive to them</li>
            <li> , so I can&#x27;t tell if these are fake reproductions of Satya Sai Baba or not, but they definitely appear legitimate to me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to write this since I don&#x27;t like incense, especially these scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried room deodorizers for years that don&#x27;t last and are expensive.</li>
            <li> Their a little thin, and burn a little faster than others that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I came across these though and decided to give them a chance, even though a lot of incense I buy prepackaged has a very harsh smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I got them because I was expecting them to last for around 45 minutes like some of the reviews stated, but that&#x27;s my fault for going off other peoples reviews and not the product description.</li>
            <li> I believe it likely that this is due to having gotten a bad batch, rather than being representative of Sai Baba&#x27;s sandalwood incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is minor thing but not perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say at least an hour, if not more, per stick.</li>
            <li> Not very pleasant to me.    </li>
            <li> Seriously though, all of these masala-heavy Sai Baba varieties have very little variation between them at all.  </li>
            <li> But as variety packs go, it&#x27;s hard to beat this one.  </li>
            <li> Hardly finished one box,  </li>
            <li> kinda disappointed that 1 out of the 6 boxes was considerably smashed, but still five stars because I just saved that one for me!!  </li>
            <li> -The midnight scent reminds of cheap cologne you might smell at a nasty nightclub or something.</li>
            <li> After you burn one in a room, you can smell it for at least 12-24 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this pack at least 3 times and will do it again soon.</li>
            <li> they all smell different and will not leave unhappy (if your sane)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, this was the only disappointing incense purchase I&#x27;ve ever had from an Amazon seller; and it could have just been a fluke.</li>
            <li> I like that these burn slowly.</li>
            <li> not sure I like it yet or not, but got plenty to go through!</li>
            <li> I now realize other incense I have purchased may have been stale.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes all of the other incense i used to burn look and smell like a bad imitation.   </li>
            <li> but this incense smells so much better than the crap you can find locally in the U.S. at terrible places like Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt you would like these either.</li>
            <li> i wish it was less expensive .A</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into a subtle aroma from your incense look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The scent is too subtle.</li>
            <li> relaxing subtle scents but</li>
            <li> They seem a little expensive but it is probably Amazon Prime subsidizing the cost of shipping into the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> maybe if I had a bigger space, it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.  </li>
            <li> I would describe the scent to be similar to an Iranian prostitute&#x27;s sandals in mid-summer or a bad Indian restaurant.</li>
            <li> For the price, this isn&#x27;t a bad pick up considering all the variations of scents that you get, but you could probably find a larger quantity of just one scent for cheaper.</li>
            <li> Usually the tip gets all charred black before it will stay lit, and sometimes it lets off an unpleasant burnt smell.</li>
            <li> The amount you receive for the price is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> In a small town it was difficult to find this incense.</li>
            <li> The weak links in the combo are Sunrise and Midnight  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this line of incense, but am disappointed with this batch.</li>
            <li> I feel like cheaper incense smells like that dirty bleach soacked towel that some restruaunts use to wipe down tables.</li>
            <li> They seem to be a little on the skinny side, but none of them have an artificial smell to me.</li>
            <li> By itself, the Celestial reminds me of Frankincense and Myrrh, only lighter, with a wood base that might be sandalwood.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t understand the popularity of this miserably poor quality brand.</li>
            <li> Got these a while ago and have been totally addicted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve never experienced Incense you will get a feel for the type of things you like.</li>
            <li> These incense are poorly made.</li>
            <li> While I could live with that I was very disappointed with the sticks.  </li>
            <li> worst of the lot, by far, was the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all six boxes are clearly labeled as a batch from \\&quot;2011\\&quot; and smell terrible!  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the quality of these incense.  </li>
            <li> It smelled nothing like Sandalwood incense I&#x27;ve encountered before; it has a sort of subtle, but incredibly unpleasant mildewy smell.</li>
            <li> Expensive?  </li>
            <li> All the sticks smell the same... and they smell awful!!     </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> , I can not tolerate this terrible product, totally throw them away</li>
            <li> They are wrong.</li>
            <li> Possibly one of the worst incense I have ever smelled!!  </li>
            <li> am not impressed</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t care for the product.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Nothing weird.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> can never go wrong with Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> I decided against returning them as they weren&#x27;t that expensive but after trying to burn them I noticed they also cause a sore throat which I haven&#x27;t had from others.</li>
            <li> Mediocre --- do not always burn all the way.</li>
            <li> and they all have a heavy sandalwood base smell.</li>
            <li> Midnight was disappointing...</li>
            <li> If you burn incense for use during meditation, this is infuriating.  </li>
            <li> This incense was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy but the incense calms him.</li>
            <li> These scents do have somewhat of an artificial scent I didn&#x27;t expect from this brand</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong buying this product!</li>
            <li> All together, it is not an unpleasant combination.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The patchouli was unpleasant and gave my girlfriend a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are champa incense, cant go bad with that.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a bad move.</li>
            <li> It was not as bad by any means.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it was a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> they get rid of any bad smell and they are hand rolled and not pressed by a machine.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a bad batch?</li>
            <li> Like, bad soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that sai baba makes any bad scents, the products burn well and stay burning</li>
            <li> I have grown sick of nag champa as it seems to be everywhere</li>
            <li> I have burned Nag champa since my childhood and have never grown sick of it.</li>
            <li> -I thought the sandalwood stinks!</li>
            <li> Not one scent disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed doesn&#x27;t begin to explain how I feel.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that it did not come with a patchouli flavor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad about this product and the bargain price too!</li>
            <li> If you burn it just to season the air or create a mood, well, it is still extremely annoying.  </li>
            <li> THEY ARE WORTHLESS.</li>
            <li> Hated the fragances... not for  my taste.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality, it imposible to lighting</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> these, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Before I chose this seller I ordered from another and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a fan of incense, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this mix of scents!!!</li>
            <li> This will cover up even the worst \\&quot;skunk\\&quot; smells</li>
            <li> Some smells were nasty and unbearable.</li>
            <li> no way i could give this a bad review..if you have Never used Nag Champa I suggest you buy it NOW!!!</li>
            <li> The Satya, isn&#x27;t horrible, so I won&#x27;t give it 1 star, but it&#x27;s just not for me.  </li>
            <li> terrible value do not buy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible order fulfillment.</li>
            <li> These smell absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This package of incense was sooooo strong, you could smell it right threw the Amazon box!  And all the scents seemed to blend together.  I had to put them in the garage so not to be overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> Great variety of scents. what was really good about the packaging/ they put the incense in a plastic bag so the scent did not get on my other items in the box</li>
            <li> This variety pack has excellent quality incense that works with so many different moods.  I particularly like Sunrise and Midnight.</li>
            <li> Nice strong scent but the incense sticks are very messy, and burns a little too fast. But I love the different scents and am pleased with the product. Will order again</li>
            <li> These we smaller than i expected, but had awesome fragrance.  I would most definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> they are champa incense, cant go bad with that.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, and came on time! Such a good choice over other incense, I will be buying again when I&#x27;m done with these.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any particular problem with the incense. It burned ok and smelled alright. The only disappointment was that all the different scents seemed to smell the same. Since in general this is not true, I think you are better off buying these individually with the scent you like. I don&#x27;t think these are worth getting.</li>
            <li> All of the incense included in this pack smell good and add a relaxing fragrance to any room.  I like burning incense once in a while instead of candles because it reminds me of my house when I was a child.  My mom used to burn incense and add a smoky incense fragrance to our house and I remember always enjoying the smell of burning incense for some odd reason. I recommend this brand of incense because it leaves a true fragrance while burning not a &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; smell like some cheap incense.</li>
            <li> Well packaged. Scent is strong with all these boxes together at once but after they are out, loved them all! Would get again!</li>
            <li> So I have not used incense in years.. I decided to purchase some as my febreeze was not cutting the farts good enough.  This stuff did the trick but be advised that you house will smell like an Indian Bazaar :).</li>
            <li> So my wife and I purchased a 12 or 15 (different incense flavor) sampler from Nag Champa.  We put together all our favorite boxes, and took a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what the picture looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were our favorite six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will never happen, again; however, this is a beautiful stroke of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all the favorites in one package and soooo cheap!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, good combination of scents. I am a big fan of Nag Champa but now I am also hooked on Sandelwood and Pacholli!  Love love love.</li>
            <li> They all are very strong and smell the same to me.</li>
            <li> Love this Incense. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> They all smell strong and wonderful.  I live in a one bedroom and if I light one in the bedroom, foyer &amp; Living room the scent fill the whole place in just a few minutes then lingers for hours.  Get it, its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa always a good seller</li>
            <li> Really folks regardless how much incense you use..how truly \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; can it be? I have used incense for over 35 years. As a \\&quot;child of the Woodstock Nation&#x27; I know my incense after all this time. Years ago after some time I finally settled on Gonesh sticks since it was adequate for my olfactory needs and readily available even at &#x27;dollar stores&#x27;. I generally preferred the \\&quot;Ocean\\&quot; fragrance in Gonesh sticks. Now...after so many years I have switched to Nag Champa. Why? one word - QUALITY. Try them and see for yourself. The fragrances are quite distinct, articulate, full bodied and bountiful while remaining subtle..never overwhelming. They never &#x27;intrude&#x27; they always &#x27;enhance&#x27;. I have tried 3 of the 6 fragrances and I love &#x27;Midnight&#x27; and &#x27;Sunrise&#x27; especially so. Using an upright burner these sticks last 50-60 minutes in my environment. Expensive?  Maybe for a cheap skate that counts every penny twice and chooses to sacrifice his pleasures away on an altar of miserliness. Had to say that!  Try them my friends...Nag Champa sticks will give you an aura of peace, serenity and an alluring aromatic experience that lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-ps they are very affordable!</li>
            <li> The incense was great quality and have been using it to meditate and relax, works great - good price as well.</li>
            <li> Nice selection, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> When I light one of these incredible sticks, the fragrances are so calming; it is as if for a few minutes my cares have been carried away by the smoke.  I have three fragrances I already like and am familiar with in this six-pack, such as Sandalwood, but the other three new kinds of incense are also inviting.  Occasionally I run into one or two sticks that do not stay lit, but that is hardly a bother since I still have dozens of sticks to enjoy.  This is just what I need after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> i particularly like the yellow pack. the smell is nice and subtle. it&#x27;s really good for meditation. i also appreciate the method they are produced manually according to the highest standard of traditional incense making, using entirely organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> At the price Amazon is charging, these present such great values. Each scent is individually boxed and sealed in a plasticy bag inside the boxes so the scents do not mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all smell incredible. Some soothing, some refreshing, some are lighter and some are very rich in scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, at the price Amazon is charging, you get a lot of different flavors in large quantity that is going to last you a long time. With Prime member ship it only gets better with super fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1+ to amazon and its products &amp; services.</li>
            <li> I love the product. There are 2 scents that are not my favorite, but my personal perference!!</li>
            <li> The best Incense box set your going to find in the market. I really am enjoying every single essence. They last very long and the smell is so amazing it keeps in your room even the next day. Love them !!! Was the most beautiful gift From my husband!</li>
            <li> I found This to be  a nice deal on Amazon, and I felt it was a good deal to take advantage of. So I say it was a good deal for the buck.  SW</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  When the package came, it made the office it was in smell.  I took it home, unwrapped it and put the boxes in my closet.  The smell permeated my whole room.  I had to set the boxes outside on the porch for awhile.  I finally brought them in and put one box underneath the sink in my bathroom, which needs some consistent pleasant aroma, and it actually was nice for that.  I haven&#x27;t even lit a stick yet.. it is a bit strong...not sure I like it yet or not, but got plenty to go through!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a big incense burner, but occasionally I will buy a pack here and there. I do know the difference between good- and poor-quality incense. I will say that this is quality made.    However, my personal satisfaction with this stuff is more like 3 stars but I didn&#x27;t want to give it a poor rating just because of my personal preference. Some nags:    -Each variety is very \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; which I don&#x27;t care for, and each scent smelled nearly the same to each other (I guess they use the same base?). They all smell sort of like frankencense to me, which I like, but again is too perfumey. They all smell just like every head or new age shop I&#x27;ve ever been in.    -The sticks all take a ridiculous amount of time to light. Usually the tip gets all charred black before it will stay lit, and sometimes it lets off an unpleasant burnt smell. The sticks also occasionally go out, though for the most part they burn completely with one lighting.    -I thought the sandalwood stinks! And I like sandalwood, too! One of my favorite scents, but not this brand. It&#x27;s the one scent in this pack I&#x27;ll probably throw away.     -The midnight scent reminds of cheap cologne you might smell at a nasty nightclub or something. Not very pleasant to me.    The rest of them are okay, but they don&#x27;t have that organic, mood-setting quality other incense I&#x27;ve used has. But then, I usually prefer earthy scents...rain, pine, coconut, et al. I will say the nag champa was nice and mellow, but still not what I&#x27;m looking for. I will not be buying again!</li>
            <li> So I left a review already, saying the incense doesn&#x27;t burn. The seller sent me a message complaining I didn&#x27;t contact them first and suggested that I run a hair dryer over all the incense before trying to use it. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! I do not want to buy a chore, if new \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; incense indeed doesn&#x27;t burn well then the seller should do whatever is necessary to dry it out before shipping it. Run it all on a conveyer belt under a heating lamp or some heating element or something. When I buy incense I expect it to be ready to use, open the package, light it, enjoy. While I appreciate that the incense is fresh and new, I don&#x27;t want a chore. I have enough of those thanks. I certainly don&#x27;t need another one when I&#x27;m trying to relax.</li>
            <li> These smell so good! Made the perfect stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> I have loved them all so far, most especially Midnight. It&#x27;s been a most pleasant change from burning only nag champa each day while meditating and relaxing. They&#x27;re certainly keeper&#x27;s! Although a word of caution...If you dislike the scent of nag champa I seriously doubt you would like these either. Be well :)</li>
            <li> Trust all the reviews about how great this stuff is, because I couldnt be more happy with it.  Very long lasting scent, burns evenly, each stick lasts sa long time and the scents are real and authentic!</li>
            <li> I love these they smell great and are very strong. I use these alot and can burn half a stick and smells till next day. This will cover up even the worst \\&quot;skunk\\&quot; smells LOL</li>
            <li> I love all the different scents they are able to create and look forward to getting more of them in the future!</li>
            <li> This may be good quality Indian incense, but it is also quite expensive. At $12 for the 6 boxes of 10 sticks each, you are paying ~20 cents for each stick. That is approximately 10 times more than you are paying for say Morning Star&#x27;s sandalwood incense at ~2 cents a stick.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t stay lit or burn</li>
            <li> In a small town it was difficult to find this incense. However, since Amazon is known to have \\&quot;the earth&#x27;s biggest selection\\&quot; we were extremely pleased to find Nag Champa at a great price. Plus, the additional flavors were a huge plus.    Note that cost effectiveness is greater with free shipping (or Prime Membership).</li>
            <li> Burns well, smells great. Would buy these again</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are looking to change the atmosphere of your household.   The scents are strong and rich and provide an atmosphere of relaxation.  We usually only use them for about 20 minutes and that sets the tone for the entire day.  Then we save the rest for another time.  It is very economical.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but aroma is pretty weak.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good buy.  But it was not!!    All the sticks smell the same... and they smell awful!!     I had also bought a burner which came with samples of the same brand ... and it was the same deal with them.  They smelt the same and just couldn&#x27;t stand them.  They made our eyes burn, which no incense has ever done.</li>
            <li> wonderful variety!  quality incense</li>
            <li> i used to drive quite a distance to purchase this brand incense AND paid much more.  then i discovered it at Amazon and what a plus for me.  thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> These incense are the best. Nag Champa are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever burned.</li>
            <li> Champa is a good product. We got several scents that we are having fun smelling. The scents are very different and aromatic from others we have tried. We think Champa, by far, is the best.</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of Nag incense for years (left over hippie)..these are a perfect way to try all the scents to find a favorite..have a nice rich scent...not cheap or headachy..no cloying flowery fragrances...just soft, dreamy scents</li>
            <li> A little shorter, but long burning, fewer sticks, but well worth it, expensive, but extreme quality. There simply is no other incense I&#x27;ve found that compares.</li>
            <li> they last quite long in my opinion and you can really feel the smell. The only reason why it gets 4 stars and not 5 stars is because it causes some nasal congestion if overexposed to it, and it is not only to me. It is minor thing but not perfect.</li>
            <li> each of the 6 flavors smells great, and they burn pretty slow. i will be buying these again</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my FAVORITE incense! The smells are really strong and beautiful. Definitely recommend for anyone who loves authentic incense!</li>
            <li> They all came in one bag and the smells meshed together so it didn&#x27;t really smell that good. Some smells were nasty and unbearable. Others were decent.</li>
            <li> I tried one stick per week to test the scent and I must say these smell very unique. Very good product, highly recommend if you want a bit of Oriental spice in your home.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with these.  Well made and like the variety.</li>
            <li> WOW..these incense are the bomb. Very strong and long lasting. I am a frequent incense burner and have NEVER found any as good as these.  Will definitely be ordering again. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Very good for meditation.</li>
            <li> I have not burned these, as they are a gift, but they smell amazing.  i hope I get to be around and the person I got them for burns one.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on-time and in good shape.  Contents were undamaged.  Attractive boxes, well-made incense that burns for 30-40 minutes.  Very little punk-type odor, not excessively smoky as most India-type (dung-based) sticks tend to be. 20 sticks per box.  Great value, and not cheaply made.  I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I just started using incenses on a regular basis and got this to see what i like and don&#x27;t. Well this helped in some ways... i realized i like all the scents, so i have not narrowed down my scent preference, but they all are great and have been giving my room a variety of cool scents. I would suggest this for someone getting their feet wet with incense, or a seasoned individual looking for some variety.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get the variety of this wonderful incense. It is not easy to find. Not one scent disappointed. Lovely amount to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I burn Nag Champa Super Hit all the time. I wanted to switch it up a little with this variety pack, which is exactly what this is good for. Some scents are better than others. I really like patchuli and sunrise.</li>
            <li> Wow! A lot of incense for such a low price. All the scents are nice and should last quite awhile. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Well i love this product..and have always...no way i could give this a bad review..if you have Never used Nag Champa I suggest you buy it NOW!!! It is the best.</li>
            <li> i knew this was going to be a good set because you can never go wrong nag champa. the other scents were also good. I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a good variety of nice aromas. They came fast and were well packaged. I would buy them again and recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> I have been trying new stick Incence out of late this was next. But, after buying and useing the Set of 6 Incense Nag Champa Fortune Jasmine Patchouli Romance and Rain Forest and have a strong dislike of it. I thought this might be a bad move. It was not as bad by any means. The scent is just not me and for me the scent has no staying power. Others may like it and be very happy. For me I will just keep looking.</li>
            <li> Buy it.  It&#x27;s cheap, smells great and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Who knew there were other scents of this brand.  Happy to have a variety pack.  They burn well and make the house smell nice.  Best I do not have to worry if I forget to blow them out like I always do with candles.</li>
            <li> Wonderful after years of using &#x27;clearing house&#x27; imitators that performed poorly. These have an authentic scent and burn well . Customers like them!</li>
            <li> Just got my order of Satya incense......just from lighting the first stick I knew it was VERY high quality. The incense I buy at the grocery store is nothing compared to this. Where I had been using 3-4 stick, the Satya accomlishes in ONE stick. Smells terrific, lights easily too. I am going to be a constant customer for this product !!!</li>
            <li> These are without a doubt the best incense I&#x27;ve ever had. Every scent is unique and smells awesome. The lasting smell these have is great as well. After you burn one in a room, you can smell it for at least 12-24 hours. Each pack comes with about 15 incense in it which amounts to about 90 in total. Unless you burn one or more every day, this pack will last you a very long time. If you&#x27;re into burning incense, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack a incense so as to get a more robust sample of many smells rather than the one I always buy. I&#x27;ve been looking for something new to rotate my normal Nag Champa smell with. By getting this multi-pack it let me try a few at a good price. I did find some in it i will be ordering separately in the future in a bigger box. So my test worked out well for me. I&#x27;ve yet to find a company brand better than Satya Sai Baba.</li>
            <li> Fast service, very good product, will buy again many times from this seller. Price is very good. Don&#x27;t waste your time someplace else, these guys are good. Enjoy and good Karma to all of you.</li>
            <li> Scents are wonderful but SUPER strong.  Item arrived on a rainy day wrapped in plastic inside a box and the scent permeated through it all.  I left the package in my room and the scent remained even after I removed it.  Product definitely as expected and a great deal.</li>
            <li> If you like incense you will like these. A good variety for a good price. They make great gifts especially to people whose homes you visit that might have a funny or not so funny smell to them. LOL Out of body spiritual beings seem to also like these incense so if you like being visited then definitely get yours now!</li>
            <li> Love all the scents!  Even all together they are amazing.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I ordered this pack that I wouldn&#x27;t like several of the scents, despite the good ratings.  You never quite know what \\&quot;Midnight\\&quot; or \\&quot;Sunrise\\&quot; is going to smell like.  After sampling each of the scents, however, I love them all.  In fact, Midnight is one of my favorites.  No perfumey, cheap incense in this pack.  Everything is hand-rolled and has authentic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This incense is very powerful stuff.  I burn about a 1/2 stick before extinguishing it for a few hours.  The scents last for a long time.  This is a great bargain and I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this pack again as well as trying some of the other assortments by this maker.</li>
            <li> Usually I just go with incense from my local market... been doing that for a couple years, but i&#x27;ve not found incense that smell that great. some are ok and others might leave a bad smell that kind of makes you nauseous, but these are really-really good so far. glad and i guess its worth the couple bucks extra just to keep the cat litter smell at bay.</li>
            <li> The package arrived promptly; Incense sticks were well shipped and arrived with all intact pieces. I got exactly what I asked for. C:</li>
            <li> This variety pack is the bomb. What more can you ask for, you get hard to find sataya flavors and the price is cheap. Individual packs are at least $2 in the store and here you are getting 6 packs for under ten bucks. I prefer midnight and sunrise the best. They work well to cover any funky smells you might have at your place.</li>
            <li> 2nd time purchasing these, they all smell wonderful and will definitely continue buying them!</li>
            <li> They smell great, they come in a good amount, about 60 and they last pretty long, about 45 minutes. They are strong and smell good and i recommend these to people, and people have told me that they like it :)</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t buy incense this cheap, but I saw so many 5 stars, so I thought what the heck, just give it a try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;horrible chemical smells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;extremely low quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a incense user for many years, I can not tolerate this terrible product, totally throw them away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy. you never know what you are going to inhale by using this product.</li>
            <li> I suspect the incense started out as high quality. However, they were shipped with all six enclosed in the same sealed platic bag. By the time it reached me, all 6 scents were blended together leaving none of them smelling like their distinct aroma should be. All together, it is not an unpleasant combination. But if you are wishing a particular incense aroma, but them individually!</li>
            <li> They are pretty potent and they all smell so good! I would definiterly order this product again. I think i would like them if they had an even stronger smell that lingered for days. As of right now, the strength of the scent only lasts one day. This is not a criticism, just an observation. It is perfectly normal for the intensity of the smell to fade over time. Anyway, I love the product!</li>
            <li> Normally I like the smell of these fire sticks.  This is no different.  Not even a little.  I can confirm with my hand on a bible or radiator that I do like these.  Here is how it went down.  I placed the order online.  I waited patiently.  I checked my mail. I opened them, took ONE out, and lit the fat end on fire.  Then I smelled the smoke.  WA-LA!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this brand of incense.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a campfire or anything funny like many of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the scent of Nag Champa, but I had never tried any other scent made by Satya Sai Baba. Thought this assortment might be a nice introduction to the brand.     The incense came exactly as described. Very cheap price for the amount you get, too. There&#x27;s around 90 sticks of incense in this assortment. Absolutely loved pretty much every kind except Celestial. It&#x27;s not terrible, it just smells a little like an older woman&#x27;s perfume.    Very much worth the price. I used free super saver shipping and it was *much* cheaper than psychically buying the same amount in a store. It probably is still cheaper even with the cost of shipping added to the price.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased these from my local new age store and the price here is so much better. They came in a timely manner and were in great condition. Awesome scents that will relax you.</li>
            <li> Great product my house feels clean and smells good.</li>
            <li> WAY too strong... these need to be burned in a big open space... they are VERY STRONG!  And, I don&#x27;t care for the odor of any of them.  Too overpowering.</li>
            <li> These incense are incredible! They all smell really wonderful and although they are a bit shorter than other incense they burn MUCH longer! They&#x27;re an amazing deal for the price!!!</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this incense!!!  I can&#x27;t get enough of it!  Will order it again soon. Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> A great sampler - I went on to buy more!</li>
            <li> Satya is one of my favorite brands and this is a great selection of their scents.  Nag Champa is well known as one of the best, but Patchouli Forest, Celestial, and Sandalwood are also outstanding.  Some may consider the Sandalwood to be too subtle but I find it to be elegant without being overpowering.  The weak links in the combo are Sunrise and Midnight  - both are perfumey without being interesting.  But as variety packs go, it&#x27;s hard to beat this one.  The sticks are well made and will burn for 45 minutes, give or take.  Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this sampler.</li>
            <li> Love these. They have a great aroma.     I have tried other brands, and they smell like cleaner. I feel like cheaper incense smells like that dirty bleach soacked towel that some restruaunts use to wipe down tables. You sit down, and just have to wonder why they think I want to smell that strong cleaning chemical while I eat.    The only reason I did not give 5 stars, is because some of them have too much mositure in them. if they do, they will not burn without being relit multiple times. I found out if I &#x27;nearly&#x27; light the entire thing, by going over it with a flame, some moisture will bubble out and it will in fact burn all the way without having to be lit a second time.    Great stuff...</li>
            <li> By far not the best incense I&#x27;ve tried, but definitely a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this incense on Saturday, with standard shipping, and was pleasantly surprised to see it on Monday, half the time predicted. I am very pleased with the speed at which the package arrived, as well as the varied scents of incense. Each one has a unique, pleasant aroma which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll enjoy. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to burn incense.</li>
            <li> Well if you want really strong incense that you don&#x27;t even need to light to smell,these are the ones.They smell great and they don&#x27;t give you that headache alot of people get from the cheaper ones.For the money this is a great product.I will definatly order these again and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> love Nag Champa and never realized there were other scents!  these will make the perfect little extra for Holiday gifts, a sample for each person.  kinda disappointed that 1 out of the 6 boxes was considerably smashed, but still five stars because I just saved that one for me!!  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I purchased this incense as an ad-on product. Although I have not tried all the boxes of incense in the pack, I have found the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve burnt to be very pleasant. The Midnight one is my favorite so far. I burn a lot of incense, and these sticks last more than the average time, and burn steadily and evenly. A good value! Product was delivered on time, and in great condition.</li>
            <li> This brand by far has had the best quality, burn time and scent of any others I have tried.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am an admitted cheapskate. But this is excellent incense! The Nag Champa varieties are worth every penny, and I say that as a cheapskate. What is wonderful is the quality and the different tones of each type. You can experience something different about each box. I now have my favorite and will hoard these...especially when Amazon places them on sale!</li>
            <li> Beautiful aromas just as described. You can tell a good incense by the pure scents without the cheap perfume like smells that gag! Mellow yet powerful at the same time. Love every one of them!</li>
            <li> The real deal!   this stuff makes all of the other incense i used to burn look and smell like a bad imitation.   dont get me wrong, there are a few that i am not real crazy about but even those smell pretty good in comparison.   but the ones that do smell good? they smell REAL good.   burns well and long, fresh this year stamped and make my house smell great for a loong time.   arrived ontime and well packed and would buy again! great way to get a sample and pick a winner before buying more!   the regular nag champa has to be about the best incense i have ever smelled.   A++ impulse buy.</li>
            <li> an amazing deal for amazing scents. love the subtle variety. a great addition to my morning. Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> Great smells but a little messey when opened them. And they do not last as long as some of my other incense.</li>
            <li> I usually just bought the blue champa incense box from my local indian market, I saw these on lot and figured why not give them all a try, every last one is great, each has it&#x27;s distinct smell, for particular times of the day, like sunset, midnight, etc. Or you can just use them whenever you feel like using them! they last about an hour. and bring a vibrant energy to the home.</li>
            <li> I received this pack and it smells like SOAP.  Very potent soap, almost like the 6 boxes and product inside were soaked in detergent.  I don&#x27;t know why that is but it is the most potent smelling product I have ever bought.    Because of this I didn&#x27;t even burn the Incense, I am going to throw them away.  Why?  Because anything that smells like chemicals that strongly CANNOT be good for your health.    The box says it comes from China; that combined with the chemical smell is just too much for me.    I plan on buying some organic incense instead.</li>
            <li> This set of Insents are splendid and created swell mood for my company a I, also my family was impressed by the sent of my resident</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product from Amazon because I had a hard time finding burn incenses in other stores (not every store carries this kind of incenses). I loved the scents; each set has its own distinct smell. But what I loved most about it is the way it burns: it burns slowly and lasts longer. You can still smell the scent in the air hours after and it is a very pleasant sensation. I bought different kinds/brands before and I find that some burn too quickly. I like that these burn slowly. The price is also great for this many sets. Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> They are good while they are burning  but I was expecting them to be longer and the smell goes away as soon as it stops buning. I would still buy more products from you!</li>
            <li> Great variety in this pack. This incense burns really well. The smells are powerful enough to be noticed, but not overpowering like a lot of incense.</li>
            <li> Nice variety and pleasing scents.</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling incenses at a affordable price at that! With the this range of scents, it is very good to find the right incense for the right mood. :)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been buying this set of incense for quite awhile. i love the scents of all the kinds in this set. the sticks burn for a long time and are not overwhelming. the authentic boxes are sort a plus to me, though i don&#x27;t know why! great product.</li>
            <li> These incense have lasted me months. It was a great way for me to figure out which kinds of incense scents I liked the best. My favorite has to be sunrise and celestial. I am not a fan of the patchouli forest--it is a little too strong and perfumey for me.</li>
            <li> Personal opinion, but I love every \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; in this pack of 6. Sandalwood and Midnight being my top favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like burning incense, GET THIS! You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> They all come packaged together and smell fairly similar. very very very strong , careful where you store it lol</li>
            <li> If you are already familiar with the Nag Champa line, then this assortment should be enjoyed by those who like to use incense.</li>
            <li> First off, the shipping was super fast. I tracked it&#x27;s shipping this morning and it said it wouldn&#x27;t be here for another two days.. But when I went to check the mail, SUPRISE. It was here. The packaging was okay. I could smell it as soon as I opend the mail box. Some people would say that the scents are strong and all smell the same. They are wrong. While they are in the packages they do smell the same. But once you actually burn them, they each have they&#x27;re own distinct scent. The Nag Champa and Midnight are my favorite. I highly reccomend this product. It&#x27;s well worth the money. :]</li>
            <li> This the best of the samplers that is offered by Satya. I tried the Romance Sampler and wasn&#x27;t impressed at all. This set of Sunrise , Sandalwood , Midnight ,Patchouli and Celestial were made the traditional way from masala instead of from being dipped. I give this incense a rating of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get here. A few weeks. While I could live with that I was very disappointed with the sticks.  They do smell good and leave a wonderful scent after wards, but while burning they were so faint I barely could smell them no matter how close in I brought them. They burned a long time. All in all very nice, but I will not buy them again for awhile. I&#x27;ll try other brands.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is/will always be my favorite, but there isn&#x27;t one I don&#x27;t love here!  A few of them I&#x27;d never smelled before.  Very pleasant aromas.  If you like Nag Champa anyway, you&#x27;ll like the twist on something you know is wonderful.  I will be ordering more. Namast&amp;eacute;! :)</li>
            <li> Possibly one of the worst incense I have ever smelled!!  Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> This is a great assortment of Nag Champa incense.  Nothing too heavy or strong and the scents last a long time after burning.</li>
            <li> All of them are really nice incense sticks, they burn for long and they arrived fast.</li>
            <li> This is the most outstanding incense you will buy, ANYWHERE, and Amazon sells it for the best price.  Long burning (usually about an hour), clean smelling (never smells \\&quot;burned\\&quot; like some cheap incense does).  Bought this 6-pack to try out the Red that I read great reviews on.  Love that and have also burned a Black so far and love that too.  I suspect I will be quite satisfied with all 6.  Stay with this particular brand of Nag Champa though as others just are not as pure smelling.</li>
            <li> Better than the Incense you see in stores. I was recommended these from a friend and found my quality incense I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I might not like the smell, but, I loved it right away!   I highly recommend it to those who wants to relax and meditate. Helps me to fall asleep if I really need to.   Very good purchase !</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer noted, they all DO smell the same. It&#x27;s like they somehow have combined all the scents together inadvertently.&lt;br /&gt;I am not impressed and I will not buy this product again or recommend that anyone else waste their money on this product either.</li>
            <li> I bought for my son for Christmas who loves incense. The selection is wonderful and smell great. My son was very happy.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a couple of these locally and really liked them. I found them on here and well now I have them. If you like a good long lasting Incense these are great. They all have a great aroma. I will order more when I burn through all these.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping mosquitoes away. Really like the different scents in this variety pack!</li>
            <li> These are very strongly scented...we had these wrapped and under our christmas tree and you could smell them just walking by the tree.  I was concerned that they might be too strong when burned.  The scent does drift through the whole house when using them and lingers for a day but it is not overpowering like I originally feared. You don&#x27;t have to continually burn them to enjoy them as with some other incense sticks.  I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a nose for incense apparently. I couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference in the 6 different scents. I did like them all however and am glad I bought them. They weren&#x27;t harsh like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I got these to spice up the smell of my recording studio.&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of choices with the 6 different boxes and they work well/last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I love nag-champa and this was a pleasant surprise. The fragrances are good and very strong. Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> Potent fragrance. Good smells.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever walked into a store that sells and/or burns incense, you&#x27;ve probably run into these at some point.  These are your standard, run-of-the-mill incense sticks that have that familiar \\&quot;incense\\&quot; smell most people are used to.  On the plus side, they&#x27;re affordable and most of the varieties smell pleasant.  On the other hand, there are a couple of varieties in this bundle that don&#x27;t really smell particularly good (at least to me).  If you can find these at a store (try looking near the beach or close to college campuses), I&#x27;d suggest buying one or two sticks of each and seeing if you like them before you order.  Make sure you actually light them to see how they smell, as the smoke often smells quite different from the unburned smell of the sticks.  Overall, these are nice, but definitely nothing special.</li>
            <li> If you need a variety or an ambiance of good smelling smoke! Incense we trust! Get it now! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is our second time ordering this selection here. To me, they don&#x27;t smell alike at all. They have similarities, but I can definitely tell them apart. I think this is a great sampling of Satya blends. I was always a big fan of nag champa, but never tried the other ones before. At this price, it&#x27;s easy to give it a try and find some new loves.    I now like some of the others even more than Nag Champa. My faves are Celestial and Midnight; both are rich, heavy, complex scents. The Sandalwood is lovely, exactly as strong as I like it, mellow, but with presence. The Sunrise is well named, as it seems best in the morning. It&#x27;s a lighter scent, and more uplifting, less meditative than the others. The Nag Champa, well, what to say? It&#x27;s one of my all time faves. I think Nag Champa is one of those things people either love or hate, but everyone recognizes it. We&#x27;re not crazy about the Forest Patchouli, so we give that one to a friend. It&#x27;s not bad smelling, just not big Patchouli fans here. :/    The sticks can be a little crumbly, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the real thing, materials rolled onto the stick and then dried. You can get \\&quot;clean\\&quot; sticks if you prefer blanks dipped in synthetic scent oils. I don&#x27;t like those. You really can&#x27;t beat this price either. The low reviews must&#x27;ve gotten a bad batch or got it from a different vendor, I don&#x27;t know. We haven&#x27;t had any of the issues described.    I highly recommend trying this set. Even if there&#x27;s a couple types you don&#x27;t like, it&#x27;s still worth it. If you can&#x27;t smell the difference between them, maybe it isn&#x27;t the incense that&#x27;s to blame. :|</li>
            <li> This is a great selection of different scents.  It comes in the boxes as pictured so you know which is which.  They arrived pretty fast and make my apartment smell great!</li>
            <li> Amazing, will be ordering from them again</li>
            <li> I love every flavor in this 6 pack of incense. Nag Champa has been a long standing favorite in my collection, and now Satya Sai Baba Incenses are offering many new fragrances to enjoy. The burn time and price are unbeatable. Thanks for offering this item!</li>
            <li> Great variety of incense at a very competitive price. There is only 1 that I don&#x27;t care for, and I LOVE 4 of them. Just give the boxes you don&#x27;t want to friends and they&#x27;ll be appreciative. I&#x27;ve bought this pack at least 3 times and will do it again soon. Also makes a great small gift for any occasion. I get a few boxes for Christmas gifts every year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burning Satya Nag Champa for years and I have yet to find another incense I like as well. Long lasting, heady, and just plain smells divine! This multiple scent pack is a great way to try other Satya fragances. Price was right too. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> does what it says it will, if you like incense</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the quality of these incense.  The material is loosely packed onto the sticks.  When I take them out of the box the powder crumbles off into my hands.  Also, they don&#x27;t burn as long as I thought they would.  They smell pretty good however and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I have gotten into the routine of lightning incense every morning and again at nite, and this is my favorite stuff.  Extremely quick delivery and cheaper than going to my local Health Food store to buy it.  The assortment of scents is nice, too.</li>
            <li> The seller, and delivery on this are 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t care for the product.  I&#x27;m not an incense expert, but I&#x27;ve bought some different brands that I like much better.  My only real problem with this brand is that for me, it&#x27;s too strong.  I also picked some up from Whole Foods (don&#x27;t remember the brand), and it was much milder and pleasant.  The Satya, isn&#x27;t horrible, so I won&#x27;t give it 1 star, but it&#x27;s just not for me.  The smell is so over powering that I get a headache.  I do live in apartment, so maybe if I had a bigger space, it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.  I wouldn&#x27;t rule this product out entirely, but for the foreseeable future, I&#x27;ll stick with another brand.</li>
            <li> No issues, packaged well. Thank you</li>
            <li> These are wonderful scents, they arrive quickly and in perfect shape (mine did) and for the paltry price, you have weeks worth of aroma that you&#x27;ll not soon forget. Try them you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> The mark of a good incense is that the flame will automatically go out after you light it.  These do that.  I bought some cheap incense from the store and they were very overpowering and horrible. Then I got these.  Very smooth smell, not overpowering at all. The smells don&#x27;t match the description, but if you ignore that, they are good smells.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Beautifully scented. The smoke is strong, which I like and it lets me burn less at a time because of how well it fills the room with smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are naturalistic, which is great because I hate flowery/overly-artificial incense scents.</li>
            <li> Simply the best! The scents are quite pleasurable to the olfactory glands, while the burn is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Go outside in your yard. Find a stick or other similar piece of old dead wood. Set it on fire. Take a big whiff. Now you know what ALL of these smell like.</li>
            <li> These look thicker and burn slower and smell better than the ones carried at my local store. I&#x27;ve been getting ripped off for way too long, I am so grateful I turned to Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> Great for all your incense needs. Gives you a chance to try before stocking up with any one variety. Great!</li>
            <li> I like that there are so many in the pack and all the different odors are nice.  Got these exactly when I was told I would get them in good condition.</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried any of these scents but they smell great in the package and they came as described.</li>
            <li> Nice selection, I liked all the aromas.  I burn incense on very, very rare occasions and then only briefly.  BUT I keep one on my desk, not burning.  It provides just a hint of aroma, much less and far more pleasant than one of those commercial plug-ins.  Good for a couple of days and still good for burning.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and they all smell great</li>
            <li> I liked this buy a lot. It is definitely worth the money. I am a huge fan of incense and sometimes I get tired of only being able to buy the same thing from the local places that sell incense. And since there are only 2 and one sells one kind and the other only sells 3 it feels nice to finally have some variety.</li>
            <li> If you want to try other incenses by Nag Champa, this is a good mix.  They are all slightly different, but pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love the Nag Champa blue.  It reminds me of my college days.  I use incense around my house to get rid of cooking odors or the stink of a wet dog every now and again.  I bought one of these packs about three months ago and burn about one stick a day.  I&#x27;ve still got one unopened pack.  A great deal cheaper than a candle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my senses like burning wax.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> My package had two Midnight and no Nag Champa.  A classic that is missed.  Long lasting scent and filled not only the room but other distant parts of the house, two floors away!  The post about flaking may have been talking about the powder seen on most like this.  Otherwise it was a bad batch.  No Nag Champa cost a star is the only thing.</li>
            <li> I have yet to run out of this item after about 2 months. I still have an adequate supply and the smell and quality is superb. Would definitively buy again.</li>
            <li> i love these incense so much. they get rid of any bad smell and they are hand rolled and not pressed by a machine. no black smoke. all natural and smell so great.</li>
            <li> They really did burn for an entire hour and were all fairly pleasant. Plus i got a couple of samples of nitiraj original, and that stuff smelt pretty good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and long burning. Great assortment of scents and a good value. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It all smells great. Already need to buy some more, cause I can&#x27;t stop burning this stuff!</li>
            <li> I will never buy another brand of incense again! These all smell divine! Can&#x27;t wait to get a bigger box.</li>
            <li> Love this set!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a fan of incense, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this mix of scents!!! Awesome price and great quality!</li>
            <li> I love this incense and have re-ordered several times. I love all of the fragrances. The orders I place are handled promptly and shipped the same day. I will re-order again.</li>
            <li> the incense smelled lovely and burned great. they arrived within no time at all thankyou</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more soon enough. They smell great and burn a long while. Give them a try!!</li>
            <li> I favor this incense and like the variety.  The only small problem was that a couple of the boxes of incense did not continue to burn and had to be re-lit a number of times.  However, in the majority of cases - it&#x27;s very good. Delivery was fairly quick.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister. The set comes with great scents, including her favorites, nag champa and midnight. It is also a great price for a set of 6, as I have seen them retail for $2.50 each. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Favorite brand by far.</li>
            <li> I use incense everyday for meditation and I love this brand.  It lasts long and has a comforting smell.</li>
            <li> This combo of scents is just what I was looking for in my home....very cost effective as well. You can burn a combination at one time and they blend well.</li>
            <li> Being pregnant, my nose is super sensitive. All of these scents are effective at covering the smell of vomit, feces, stinky dog, and whatever strange smells waft through the apartment when we open the door to the outside world.</li>
            <li> These are great, but the amount of smoke they produce may be too much for those too sensitive. Also, the smell lingers. Again, not a bad thing, but this should be considered.</li>
            <li> I like the midnight and sandlewood smell, others are too strong perfume.  Quality products as after burning, don&#x27;t leave too much mess ashes.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa.  About 2 of these scents I am not a very big fan of.  It was worth a shot, and maybe you&#x27;ll like the scents that I didn&#x27;t.  I have resorted to buying just the original Nag Champa scent.  It&#x27;s a great value though!</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance . A little too much smoke and burns far too quickly.  But it was an add - on item that cost very little . I would look for something more substantial if I was a regular user of incense.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I, too, buy incense (mostly at dollar stores lol) and this is not what I expected. They almost all smell the same, and they are VERY, VERY, strong. It gives me a headache. Very overpowering smell. As another reviewer said on here, it does kind of remind me of taking a piece of wood and burning it. The incense I am used to getting (and love) my dollar store does not carry anymore (I think it was called \\&quot;orchards and vines\\&quot; and \\&quot;green mountains\\&quot;) I tend to like more light, perfume-y type incense sticks. I do not know what to do with these :\ The ONLY thing I can see what it&#x27;s good for is if you have a strong, bad smell in your home (cooking smells, smoke, someone uses the bathroom lol) then this will definitely take over the smell. Other than this, I do not like the scents AT ALL. I will just look around at other dollar stores ;)</li>
            <li> What can you say  it smells good. My cat likes watching the smoke. This is my second purchase. Enough said.</li>
            <li> smells good will be buying again</li>
            <li> Great price on an assortment of incense to sample. Fresh and very fragrant.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best incense I&#x27;ve ever used, you could smell the scent as soon as you open the plastic, they are a bit smaller in length, but the odor lingers.&lt;br /&gt;They delivery came quickly, none broken, I love all the scents, no favorite one.</li>
            <li> This selection of scents is pretty nice. My list from best to worst is: Sandalwood, Sunrise, Nag Champa, Celestial, Patchouli Forest, then Midnight. Sunrise is like the original with a strong floral kick. Celestial is a very nice incense when you don&#x27;t want a strong scent. Midnight was disappointing... mine was a little dry and smelled like burned wood and charcoal. Going to try the other sampler next time.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal for what you get. It&#x27;s nice to have some different options besides Nag Champa all the time (though it is unarguably the best). We liked some of these scents more than others, but they&#x27;re all pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great Variety of Scents, Fantastic Quality!    Highly Recommended     Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is real incense, not some artificially perfumed stick like you find in most stores in the U.S. these days.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This 6 pack of Satya Sai Baba scents is a great bargain. For less than a ten spot, you get six 15 gram boxes of quality incense, and all of these scents have something good to offer, though mileage will of course vary. Also worth noting: most of the vendors offering this 6 pack also offer the Super Saver Shipping on this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nag Champa: This the the classic blue box incense, and if you&#x27;re shopping for incense you&#x27;ve no doubt heard of it, if not smelled it for yourself. You know what you&#x27;re getting with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli Forest: This is NOT the patchouli from the drugstore deodorant aisle, the patchouli that made you feel that if you never smelled patchouli again it would be too soon. THIS is the patchouli you smelled that time in somebody&#x27;s dorm room and asked what it was and was surprised by the answer you got. It is a rare patchouli, this, and well worth the price of all the rest of the incense in this pack. But wait! There&#x27;s more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight: This is a sandalwood and vanilla based incense that has a sweet, spicy something that has quickly made it my favorite incense for relaxing at bedtime. It&#x27;s kind of mysterious, in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood: A very good sandalwood incense, not my personal favorite sandalwood but it does smell very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise: As I&#x27;ve taken to using the Midnight before bed, I&#x27;ve also been enjoying the Sunrise upon waking. There&#x27;s a good dose of vanilla and something else that makes me think of baked goods for some reason. Kind of reminds me of allspice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celestial: This is a subtle fragrance that I&#x27;ve found useful for balancing out strong, single-note fragrances like Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s Jasmine Blossom. Burning the Celestial alongside of it gives it more depth. By itself, the Celestial reminds me of Frankincense and Myrrh, only lighter, with a wood base that might be sandalwood. It&#x27;s a nice choice if you&#x27;re kind of in the mood for some incense, but nothing that might be overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, this 6 pack was worth every penny, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed each of the fragrances for different reasons.g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, this 6 pack was worth every penny, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed each of the fragrances for different reasons.</li>
            <li> I really love and totally recommend this product, the smell is soft and calming and you can tell the quality is extremely good.</li>
            <li> There were a little less in the box than i thought there would be. Their a little thin, and burn a little faster than others that I&#x27;ve had.  But they all smell soo good. I loved them all, which can be rare when purchasing a variety pack.  I would defiantly purchase them again.</li>
            <li> i am highly dissapointed with this. they arrived on time, but as soon as i opened the box and look at the incent sticks and the boxes were full of dust from the sticks.only about a quarter of the sticks was still burnable. i will never buy something from this seller again</li>
            <li> My order was fulfilled by tom&#x27;s incense, but penny lane gift is also a positive experience.  The incense was very fresh, all of the packets were.  I was impressed and none of them were that strong and over powering.  I love them for meditationg.  For the price, even if one was off for me, still worth the money.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Incense at local smoke shops. I have a fairly small 2 bedroom apartment. I usually have to burn two at the same time of other brands With this brand I did not have to. Just one does it. They are rather strong. I have only tried one scent so far (The one in the dark blue box, I think its called \\&quot;Forest\\&quot;) I have never seen incense like these. They have a bit of moisture to them, and seem to have been coated in something that is slighty fuzzy. Perhaps because Ive only used the cheap stuff before, and these are the real deal. I will be purchasing more of these when I start to get low. Cant wait to try the others!! :)</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this incense. As another wrote they do take a little longer to light but still worth it.. They really do burn for a long time.</li>
            <li> This assortment of incense is great for any occasion and allow you to choose how you want your place to smell on any given day. They all smell great, can&#x27;t say I dislike any of them!</li>
            <li> some sticks kept failing to burn all the way. I had to keep reigniting the stick.</li>
            <li> I am by no means an incense aficionado, and I don&#x27;t know much about them. I just know that I like the smell of incense burning once in a while when I am trying to relax. These sticks all smell pretty good. They seem to be a little on the skinny side, but none of them have an artificial smell to me. They all smell like exotic herbs. Overall, I am happy with the variety.</li>
            <li> The scents I&#x27;ve used, so far, (Patchouli Forest and Celestial)  smell exquisite.  I live in a very damp area of northwestern Oregon and this makes my basement apartment smell so much better and covers up the mildew odor that permeates every dwelling here.  I&#x27;ve used the Nag Champa for years, but have never tried the other scents.  Good quality, long burning and the scent is soft and not overwhelming.  I was surprised to see how many incense sticks were in the package.  These will last me for a long, long time and the price was so low.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE MY FAVORITE! i am an incense snob and I will not buy other incense again. here is where it is at.</li>
            <li> Never dissapointed with this brand of product!</li>
            <li> couldve been a lot better</li>
            <li> The sticks fit in my coffin burner and last a long time. The smell is very strong. The scent will stay around for hours. I personally like the smell of incense lingering around...</li>
            <li> did use yet, may good&lt;br /&gt;Set of 6 x 15g Boxes Incense Nag Champa Sunrise Sandalwood Midnight..Set of 6 x 15g Boxes Incense Nag Champa Sunrise Sandalwood Midnight..</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this set together! I burn so much incense all the time so getting this huge set was awesome and it smells sooooooooooo good!!!! Love, Love, Love!!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Nag Champa incense for about four years now. We love almost every scent that they make, but we think that they&#x27;ve recently the formula to their Agarbatti (blue box) scent, that specific incense seems to give me a headache now, which it never used to do in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package from Amazon comes with five boxes of incense:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agarbatti (blue box) - Has a heavy powder scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli Forest (green box) - Has a powder &amp; apple cider scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celestial (maroon red box) -  Has a Light powder scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight (black box) -  Has a Heavy powder scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise (purple box ) - Has a Light powder scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Burns slow.&lt;br /&gt;- Long lasting pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Each incense smells almost exactly the same, they all contain a powder smell.&lt;br /&gt;- The packaging squashes easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: India (Bengaluru)</li>
            <li> Good smelling incense but beware that these are mega strong. I love strong incense but the wife complains all the time. I rush to burn them before she gets home!</li>
            <li> Good selection of aromas, relaxing.  Good price.  Last for a while after it has burned out.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> However, everything in moderation. When I first got them, I was burning maybe 3 or 4 a day. I started getting a scratchy feeling in my throat. It is smoke after all, it&#x27;s probably not such a great idea to breath it in all day. When I cut back, the pain went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the various &#x27;flavors&#x27; that come in this package, I like every single one of them. Perhaps to a more discerning person, these may smell wildly different but to me? They all kind of smell the same. I was okay with that.</li>
            <li> Many are based on that sexy yummy smell. Great price as well! Good to stock up on the incense supply...</li>
            <li> Assortment of scents is a nice touch with this packaging option.</li>
            <li> The wife an I were looking for a nice mix of scents and comparing prices.  The price for this package deal is very competitive.  The quality of the product is top notch and we will be purchasing again in the future.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Last a long time, smell great. Nothing weird. No duds. Box-in-a-box packaging was weird, but for the price, this is a great sampler pack or regular buy if you like them all.</li>
            <li> excellent scents, nice smooth and aromatic. Not much else to really say about these incense other than they smell nice</li>
            <li> The package arrived timely and in excellent condition. The sticks burn a reasonable amount of time and relatively clean. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the fact that wood is used, but the resulting fragrance excuses any inconvenience... I really enjoyed the selection - if you loved one, most likely will like the rest, too.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, Becoming addicted to burning one every day.  Each one is long burning, and the scent lingers long after burning.</li>
            <li> I love this, it&#x27;s a version deal and all of the incense are amazing.</li>
            <li> Actually not that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a frequent incense user, and this one has strong chemical smell, not natural.</li>
            <li> These burn for a very long time,and smell great. I use one in my dining room, and it literally smells up the next two rooms also. Very good price too.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa &#x27;nuf said! Nice to try out some different flavors as well.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and I love the variety of scents to burn that you receive with this package! All are heavenly to burn!</li>
            <li> This brand is total garbage and you might as well burn sticks from the forest.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered several popular brands to compare, and Hem was the clear winner.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t understand the popularity of this miserably poor quality brand.</li>
            <li> Does the job, and then some.  I buy these every time I run out.  Can&#x27;t be beat for the price.  Fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> The assortment of scents is wonderful. With this brand of imported incense I can always count on being happy with my purchase. Each scent is a quality stick, and a pretty fresh product. They burn slowly without the smell of the wooden stick inside and you will not be disappointed with any of the fragrances, there are high quality essential oils in these hand made sticks. I could smell the shipping box across the room when the package arrived!</li>
            <li> Its jells great even when not lighted. Just move around it and you can smell the beautiful aroma of sandal!</li>
            <li> Love these. Better to buy them here than in the store.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this set before and love it. It smells great and I love the variety. I will continue to get this !</li>
            <li> Really great scents and comes with tons of sticks. I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year and I still have more than half of them left.</li>
            <li> the best incense brand ive ever bought smells great and stays tat way for a long time i am very happy with this purchase a +++</li>
            <li> The very best scents ,a very exotic aroma</li>
            <li> nice good smelling incense, definitely much cheaper than the stores and much higher quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like the lavender and sandalwood the best personally</li>
            <li> They all smell so great!</li>
            <li> Satya makes amazing incense, I could smell it through the box when I went to check the mail. Not too overpriced, and all the scents are somewhat similar, but incredibly fragrant in a good way.  I have yet to find a Satya scent that I didn&#x27;t like, I am very please with the quality and the price of my purchase.</li>
            <li> I Recommend this to any one who likes a variety of incense,  they burn slowly and last long and smell great.</li>
            <li> Every box has a distinct pleasant aroma and each stick is long burning.  This is quality incense and I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it makes me feel relaxed and I even feel it takes negativity away in my house :) one a day for me its enough or whenever you feel you need it too :)</li>
            <li> In good Satya fashion, these are just some of the most amazing scents next to that of my child&#x27;s. I&#x27;m really picky about odors and the little nuances in them. But I love them all!</li>
            <li> The smells weren&#x27;t the greatest only liked one of the smells, the shipped was great but...other then that there really wasn&#x27;t anything great about it, there are a million smells out there you can get so I recommend finding others.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband. He  loves the way that they smell. The scent is pure and lasts. Not smoky like some other brands. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent customer service.  I will definitely order from this vendor in the future.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend these wonderful incenses.  Their perfume are awesome and pure of their essences.  I would like to give this product and the seller zillion stars because both are extraordinary.  This is the best seller ever.  I bought the incenses on Wednesday , August 7th and arrived on Thursday, August 8th 2013. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used Nag Champa for decades so I decided to try this assortment .very nice all of them ,not overpowering like the cheaper ones are.great for every mood</li>
            <li> Nice price for a bunch of incense. They seem to be working as they should, though I&#x27;m not sure I can really tell the difference between scents.</li>
            <li> The scent is very powerful, and really just irritated my allergies. The product came as advertised and I gave them to a friend.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the little cones, but ended up getting the incense sticks.  Like them anyway!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this brand for long time...excellent!</li>
            <li> Got these for my girlfriend for Christmas, she was very pleased. They all smell great and really these are the best incense you can buy if you ask me. Good price too, better then any local head shop where even these small packages go for 3-4 dollars each.</li>
            <li> This is really high quality stuff. I&#x27;ve only tried two boxes so far and I think this set is good value for your money.</li>
            <li> Great quality and aroma.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love incense?</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I haven&#x27;t tried all 5 scents yet. Of the 3 I tried, they all smell great. I&#x27;m new to incense, but these burn substantially longer than all others I&#x27;ve tried. I haven&#x27;t timed it out but I would say a stick burns for at least a half hour, and probably up to an hour. They&#x27;re fantastic quality and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Gourmet burning sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real deal.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent, but I felt like they pretty much all smelled about the same.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Pungent fragrance even while still wrapped in plastic! Love each smell and they turn well. Great buy. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this brand of Nag Champa.  I&#x27;ve never found another brand that smells this amazing.  The other scents are nice too, particularly the sandalwood and the patchouli.  Definitely worth the price.  I&#x27;d also recommend just buying the biggest box of Nag Champa available, as that&#x27;s easily the best scent.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> A very nice collection!</li>
            <li> I found these scents to be exceptional.  The celestial and midnight are particularly stimulating.  I didn&#x27;t care much for a couple of them, but overall it&#x27;s a solid set of aromas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned!  Do not buy the 100g boxes of the exact same stuff.  There&#x27;s a production problem or something and the 100g boxes contain what can only be described as hell on Earth.  So do your nose a favor and pick up this set of 6.</li>
            <li> The 1st purchase surprised me, a lot. I placed the set of six boxes on my trunk, that&#x27;s near my headboard.&lt;br /&gt;Their aroma was the pleasant surprise, the next morning. Lovely, scents to start any day, well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> The service was great.  And the incense is wonderful!  I have some other &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; incense that is waaaay too strong.  These scents are delicious and delightfully mild.  I&#x27;ll order again when these are all gone.  (Which will be soon!)</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as pictured. It burns nice a slowly without being overpowering. I loved every scent, especially the Nag Champa and Sunrise. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> terrible value do not buy. they stink. they burn very quickly. And they are smaller than your normal incense sticks</li>
            <li> I love the smell of earthy incense. And I have always loved this brand. It was a great deal for the variety pack and Im extremely pleased</li>
            <li> These are all variations of Nag Champa Incense fragrance and are all fabulous and easy to use ! They burn well with minimal ash left.</li>
            <li> Everything came pre-wrapped together and opening the package there was an instant aroma which was very pleasant. The incense burn quicker than thought (usually 30-35 minutes) per stick. I was a big fan of everything, sandlewood is by far my favorite followed my midnight, however, pustule did not do it for me.</li>
            <li> I love this incense, and my husband and I have been using them for several years. They smell amazing unlit, and even better when lit. No other brand we have tried has been as satisfying and mood setting.They aren&#x27;t too strong but you can tell a big difference when you enter a room. Great product, and will continue ordering them as long as they are available. :) Satya Sai Baba is the only incense for us. Thank you for such a great item and at such a fair price.</li>
            <li> Burns kinda fast but what an Amazing scent!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brand of incense.  I really enjoyed the variety.  Each one is excellent.  This adds a special quality to the room. Many Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa? Awesome and we&#x27;re all used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli Forest smelled like neither patchouli or a forest.&lt;br /&gt;Midnight smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood was terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise and Celestial both smell very similar.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite brand and everything we got in this sampler was fantastic. My favorite one has got to be sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I like everything about the incense set. Good value for the set. Nice variety, smells great. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in no way an incense expert, but these sticks smell just great. My housemates also have incense sticks of a different brand and some of them have sort of a too intense smokey/acidic smell that makes it not very pleasant to smell for an extended time.&lt;br /&gt;These instead are just perfect, and I&#x27;ve received compliments many times about how good my room smells since I&#x27;ve started using them. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like this stuff.  It&#x27;s just that whever you get an assortment, you take what you get.  I&#x27;ve found that people have their preferences in scent and those preferences usually don&#x27;t much transcend the barriers of type: floral, woody, spicy, citrus, and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This assortment does.  It includes all of those categories.  I wish it didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;d like to see assortments within those types so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use up scents I don&#x27;t like so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is quality incense, reasonably long-lasting and not too smoky.  When there is a woody assortment, or even a spicy-woody, please let me know!  I&#x27;ll buy that, but I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> great price and fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> Real incense, smells amazing, quality product.</li>
            <li> Like most burning incense from India, these are messy; they shed all over the place.  Also, they are rather smokey, and they&#x27;re rather short.  The scents are fine.  Some, in fact, are quite pleasant and sweet.  I wish somebody out there—like World Market—would pick up the Heritage line again.  Those were longer, hardly created smoke at all, weren&#x27;t messy at all, and had wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> This incense are great they smell real nice and you get 6 boxes so you have a lot of different fragrances fast delivery good quality. Thank you .</li>
            <li> I have akways loved Staya incense, especially the Nag Champa! It&#x27;s nice to get a variety which all smell delightful, escpecially at such a great price. I will definately be ordering from this seller again!</li>
            <li> These things smell great! They make a perfect Christmas gift for those who are hard to buy for. They were wrapped under the tree but I could still smell their scent in the air!</li>
            <li> They last about an hour give or take 5-10 minutes. The combination of scents is really great. Would definitely recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: The bigger variety pack or even the combo with &amp;#34;Super Hit&amp;#34; is NOT recommended.</li>
            <li> My housemates and I enjoyed all of these scents, and it was a great combination to try out the Satya brand scents.  They all have a similar base, and then each have a different quality on top.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more if you are just exploring incense for the first time.  Afterwards, we were able to pick out our favorites to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> Hated the fragances... not for  my taste.</li>
            <li> As expected.  Good packaging, good variety.  Should last me a long time (as I don&#x27;t burn them daily).  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Such a great variety for such a low price!! I&#x27;ve had the bundle for about a year now and I&#x27;m not going to be running out anytime soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this deal stays around for a while!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to buy these sticks, but after the reviews, I couldn&#x27;t hold myself. They&#x27;re just perfect! Très magnifiques!</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the original Nag Champa incense by Satya is the Gold standard by which all other incense should be compared.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brands from various import stores, some more expensive, some less, but they all pale by comparison.  This stuff smells good while it is being burned which is not always the case with some other more &#x27;perfumey&#x27; brands.  Once you&#x27;ve used this there&#x27;s no going back.</li>
            <li> this was very fun for my girlfriend.  it made the house smell nice, but not sure which ones smelled which way.  she took them all out of the box and mixed them together...</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, better than average packaging (good and protective, airtight)  quality product.  I would recommend for those not used to Nag Champa to go smell some at a metaphysical store before buying or even Whole Foods.  If you like what you smell then order from this seller.  I am used to all the Nag Champa flavors (scents) and recognize that this is quality and legitimate Nag Champa incense.  At the fantastic price?  Snap it up now.  If you&#x27;re not sure about Nag Champa then consider my advice.  It has a strong odor so make sure you like it first.  I personally love it and most the scents.  It even makes you smell like the incense!</li>
            <li> If you love incense then this is a pretty good deal. I&#x27;m not going to go into huge detail, but all of the scents are great, even the Patchouli one smells good! Get it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I reorder it all the time. The scents are divine...great variety and quality...Everyone asks what smells so good...This is my go to incense and has been for years!</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Reminds me of the 1970&#x27;s.  When I run out I will reorder.  Quality brand at fair price.</li>
            <li> scents are meh. i prefer Free Solls.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the boxes come damaged, but the sticks are very good.</li>
            <li> Smell amazing!!!  I had only had the blue box and super hit from Champa.  These all smell amazing!!  Looking for bigger boxes of all!!!!</li>
            <li> Well worth it, I am an incense fanatic so this really came in handy. I got a got variety that should last me a good couple of month. They burn out just a little faster then the ones I normally get, but I like the variety more than anything.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent. Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells very good.  It is not too strong but not too weak either.  Very relaxing also.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the other scents and have been very pleased.  I have grown sick of nag champa as it seems to be everywhere so was very happy to have a variety.  Burn long and omit a powerful scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells great, burns perfect, and lingers for hours. Everything I wanted. Just be careful opening the paper because they really load the sticks with and powder.</li>
            <li> I was diaappointed. I could smell the wood stick burning through toe incense.  maybe hey should be a little heftier.</li>
            <li> Love this. I&#x27;m a big nag champa scent fan, and when I was running low I thought, why not check out amazon instead of finding it in a store. Well now I&#x27;m in love with all of these scents. Awesome price too!</li>
            <li> Great deal, good selection of incenses.  This is my favorite brand of incense and I was excited to find a variety pack.</li>
            <li> All the scents are delicious! It is so inexpensive to get such good quality incense! You will find it is not as strong as some of the traditional incense scents however. Good for if I want to freshen up a room without leaving a strong incense scent behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the original Nag Champa incense (in the blue box) for years from our local &#x27;novelty&#x27; shop. I love it. When I saw this combination near Christmas time, I knew I was going to be getting it for hubby to give to me. (He&#x27;s an amazing man, but I do all the shopping--we&#x27;re both happier that way.) I&#x27;ve tried a few of the scents, not all of them yet, but so far, they&#x27;re VERY pleasing!</li>
            <li> for meditating or just a nice smell.  these are great.  no yucky perfume smells.  these smell natural.  makes you feel like you are in another part of the world.</li>
            <li> The seller provided an excellent product and got it to me quickly. I am very pleased with the transaction and would be more than happy to buy from him again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best incense out there! Long lasting fragrance and great variety of scents. Stays fresh longer then some other brands. Burn it in every room in the house!!</li>
            <li> These fragrances are a great sampling -- ALL WONDERFUL fragrances.  Do not hesitate -- a great bargain and delightful experience.</li>
            <li> These are sensual and spiritual scents . They smell really good. I like all of them. I have been a fan of nag champa incenses for a long time. The economically priced samplars are the best. Even with shipping charges they are still reasonable cost. Thanks for sending me such lovely incense. It makes me dream of exotic places like india and i love that.</li>
            <li> Always the best brand for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent assortment of incense. This large quantity has you covered for month after month.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Strong but doesn&#x27;t linger long enough. That&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me though....I still like it.</li>
            <li> I love these. I cook a lot, and I have two cats that literally have competitions on who can poop the most - so sometimes it&#x27;s nice to just light up one of these babies and relax.</li>
            <li> I keep forgetting that I only like nag champa and super hit</li>
            <li> Great scents! Came quickly!!!</li>
            <li> GOTTA LIKE SANDWOOD &amp; PATCHULI SCENT IF YOUR GONNA GET THESE,  WHICH I DO HAPPEN TO LOVE THESE SCENTS.  EVEN IN THE BOX YOU CAN STILL SMELL THEM!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand incense.  THey always come fresh in a sealed box which come in a bag.  They are very potent and burn nice and uniformly.  I recommend the variety pack like this one so you can figure out which you prefer.</li>
            <li> This was a really really good value. The incense smell nice and burn just fine. I would order these again.</li>
            <li> If you are pretty allergic I would not recommend to lit this incense.Is a strong mixed of Indian spices  not suitable for everybody,specially for those with a mild sensitive nose. Unless you are used to this incense this gets you a headache.Very hard to keep it burning or lit, I can say that mostly of their customers made that complaint and is true.Do not leave it unattended,you will need to relit it many times.You can not go wrong,is Nag Champa brand ,no surprises.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this wonderful incense and I can highly recommend each one! What a super price!</li>
            <li> Good price , good quality...</li>
            <li> Excellent value, quality incense. You won&#x27;t find a deal this good anywhere else in town. I enjoyed Celestial, Sunrise, Midnight, and Nag Champa the most, but ultimately, I was please with all six boxes, and will continue to purchase from this source.</li>
            <li> Great deal and the smell is great, will continue to buy&lt;br /&gt;Good for aroma therapy or relaxation&lt;br /&gt;Plesent scent that is not overwhelming</li>
            <li> nice assortment of incense.  love them.  scent lingers in our room for a couple of days.  very pleasant smells.  not too perfume-y or cloying.</li>
            <li> Smells great, got here extremely quickly! Product is high quality. I would definitely buy this product again or purchase it for a friend.</li>
            <li> They were very dry, must have been old... a lot of DUST (from the incense) in each bag.  But are you really going to return a $7 item?? Meh thinks not.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know which scents i wanted to order for my son&#x27;s burner. This selection is perfect. Some scents are relaxing and others are energizing. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them! Thank you - It made her birthday complete they have a long lasting smell and light easily</li>
            <li> These incense smell great and they burn for a really long time! I will defiantly be buying more of these great incense!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought these incense sticks as a means of trying to deter spiders from entering my home. Although I did not purchase any peppermint incense (which is apparently the incense recommended for ridding yourself of spiders) I settled for these as an experiment. Well, I honestly haven&#x27;t seen any insects of any variety since using these incense sticks, so perhaps they worked after all! But aside from that, these incense sticks smell beyond heavenly. They are extremely potent, but they smell so wonderful that you don&#x27;t mind the scent filling your entire home. Unlike some other incense sticks I&#x27;ve had, these don&#x27;t leave your home smelling excessively smoky, which I appreciate. I haven&#x27;t even had this set very long and I&#x27;m already on my second box! Each box has plenty of sticks inside, so I know I have quite awhile to go before running out. And when I do, I will be ordering some more!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. Haven&#x27;t used incense in Years except for an occasional store brand. Really didn&#x27;t know there was a difference until I read some reviews that explained how it is made vs the cheaper ones from discount stores. These were offered as an Add On at a reasonable price and free shipping. I like getting a sample of each. My favorite is Sunrise and Midnight, although there were none that I disliked. Also surprised how long they burned. Reminds me of being a teenager again burning incense listening to Pink Floyd!</li>
            <li> They all smell the same and there are to many to even use...</li>
            <li> this is quality incense</li>
            <li> I loved the black Nag Champa, so I tried this pack one day. I love all of the scents, and this is now what I restock with.</li>
            <li> Love these, will order again.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE...I JUST LOVE CANDLES AND INCENSES, THEY SET THE MOOD FOR ANYTHING OR ANYTIME...ALL THESE ARE SMOOTHING FOR THE SOUL AND SPIRIT</li>
            <li> can never go wrong with Nag Champa. If you like incense you&#x27;ll love Nag Champa. Smells great and burns a very long time</li>
            <li> Love the variety and the price.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Excellent  quality and fragrance  burns a long time</li>
            <li> The quality appears good but I only received one of the matching sets I ordered. All of the other sets were not matches. I got maroon pants but not a maroon top. I got green pants but no green top. I got a black top which I did not order.  I got scarlet pants today(1/18) and the scarlet shirt is not scheduled to arrive until 1/27. Absolutely terrible order fulfillment.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase. Quick shipment. Great scent and an abundance of the product for the money. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This incense is OK, but some of the sticks do not even burn. It is not nearly as high a quality as Anna&#x27;s Incense. There is simply no comparison.</li>
            <li> A nice variety of incense sticks at a reasonable price. My favorites are Nag Champa (of course!) and Patchouli Forest. I cook a lot of fish, so any of these scents are not just liked by me but needed after each fish dinner.</li>
            <li> Wow this set if wonderful! The scents are fabulous and I am ordering another set today! I am so getting my zen on...</li>
            <li> Mystical, Transcendental, and Peaceful are some of the thoughts these scents inspire in myself personally.. I must confess i am a new comer to the world that is mediation and am learning more everyday.. I feel that these incense are like tools are to craftsman they help to set the mood and create a enviorment that fits with the ultimate goal.. Of attaining relaxation, on the technical side i have been burning the sunrise in the morning and switching between midnight and celestial before bed.. The patchouli forest is perfect burning for meditation and just relaxing.. The great thing about this package is that it is perfect for a begginer who is not experienced with the different scents from the satya brand.. Also the delivery of this package as a add-on item with amazon prime was delivered in 2 days.. Cannot be dissapointed with that!!..</li>
            <li> The variety is very good for Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> I love all the smells of this product, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. I use it for my rituals and aroma therapy, relaxation, and meditation. I will definitely stock up on more when I begin to run low.</li>
            <li> Great smelling incense! &amp; great price!</li>
            <li> classic incense scents , I&#x27;ve tried three boxes and their scent is similar to each other, there isn&#x27;t much difference</li>
            <li> i love it the smell is good and pure which i like very much so i use it every day</li>
            <li> These are the best smelling incense on earth.  Midnight and Celestial smell good and they don&#x27;t even smell like smoke, they have a indescribable scent, these incense are the best smelling thing on earth! and i highly suggest them</li>
            <li> I keep ordering this over and over for myself and friends that come in my home and rave over the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for a set of 6 incense sticks. One of the best incense purchases I&#x27;ve made. It&#x27;s a perfect buy if you want a variety of really good smelling incense.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> Five great scents, my favorite is celestial.  Sandalwood is too plain for me, but the rest are amazing.  Great deal, perfect buyer experience, I burn this with [[ASIN:B0043SK4AQ Artisan Incense Tower]].  See my review on that item.  This combination provides an amazing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a youth pastor and have burned these on two different occasions to provide a deep experience for the youth, as well as help eliminate some bad musty smells in the \\&quot;youth room\\&quot; that were present when I first arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Burning this incense relaxes me _almost_ as much as a bit of chocolate or a glass of wine!  All the scents are terrific, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old hippie type, and have used incense since the 1960&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t say this is the best smelling, but at this price and speed of shipping and delivery it&#x27;s pretty hard to beat. In the past I&#x27;ve had to hassle either a specialty store, or an import store at our local Mall, so having this delivered in only a couple of days and it being the same quality as most of the products I&#x27;ve found recently.  So Honestly though it&#x27;s not a big investment it&#x27;s worth the purchase to avoid going to the Mall or if your like me driving and spending the money on gas to find something that is of equal quality, or if your lucky marginally better.   I think we know if you want fine incense you&#x27;re going to pay for it, but this is a very nice daily use product with a great selection of scents at a great price.</li>
            <li> I am not that experienced with incense much beyond what I have purchased at the dollar store and local fairs.  Very please with the price :) Very pleased with the scents from each box. Would rate 5, but not qualified to really judge incense.  I just know what I like and I like these.</li>
            <li> Very nice deal here. I just wanted to try s few differnt ones and this fit the bill. I haven&#x27;t burned through a lot, but they have lasted close to year in their packages and still work great.</li>
            <li> These are a gift for my mom, she loves these things. They smell great. 👍</li>
            <li> excellent! have purchased twice and will again...</li>
            <li> There were 6 boxes, each had about 10 sticks in each. Burn slowely and smell nice. Worth every penny. Nag champa smelled heavenly</li>
            <li> Good product and smells nice!</li>
            <li> It smells like sandalwood ; However, the alcohol  level is very high and the fragrance dissipates quickly. I would have preferred less alcohol , a smaller bottle but a longer lasting frragrance.  It&#x27;s ok for the price, I guess.</li>
            <li> i like it has a good sent to it. now send me a free pack so i can light the house up. thank you.</li>
            <li> Slow burning for a long lasting scent, and this package has a great variety of scent. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> What a great deal!  VERY NICE indeed!  Love the deep rich smells that fill the room...this incense is truly pleasing to the senses.</li>
            <li> Great value for intense incense. Each box comes with about 14 sticks that burn at the usual rate. Although some of the scents smell roughly the same, they all smell like you are in the maharaja&#x27;s palace. It&#x27;s a rich &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; aroma that is both common yet exotic. For the price, number and general quality, the Nag Champa&#x27;s can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Half of the boxes were opened, a couple of those were crushed and they all were old. Not new professional boxes, more like store overstock/returns. It wasn&#x27;t shipping either as they came within a larger Amazon box with other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. I decided against returning them as they weren&#x27;t that expensive but after trying to burn them I noticed they also cause a sore throat which I haven&#x27;t had from others. They all pretty much smell the same as well. I was really looking forward to getting some quality incense. I see others leaving positive feedback, maybe it&#x27;s hit or miss, mine are a big miss.</li>
            <li> Wonderful set of fragrances at a great price.</li>
            <li> I really like it, nice smell, almost all of them.</li>
            <li> This maker of incense is amazing in my books.  Scents are concentrated and seem to be fairly light and smell really nice.  Have been a fan for almost twenty years.  They came to us nice and fresh-no need to constantly re-light these sticks, what a pain that is getting stale incense.  The different scents are different-not just named different and smell pretty much the same.  We will just keep getting these and the Japanese incense, which do not have the bamboo stick in it, but tend to have more subdued fragrance (less smoke, thought for closed up winter time.) The scents are consistent too. You know that when you pick one it will smell like it did the last time you lit that scent.</li>
            <li> Bought some in Thailand and loved it. Bought variety to see if I like one best. Easy problem free purchase.</li>
            <li> only burned a couple, but so far they burn longer and smell better than the other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Considering the local stores around me that sell these, I&#x27;m lucky to spend $3.99 on one pack. This is a good buy and so worth it compared to the cheap incense.</li>
            <li> I loved these incense, they smell great and are powerful (not enough to smoke you out, but nice and strong), they even arrived a few days before the estimated delivery time. The ONLY thing I complain about are the Sandalwood incense. They were the most awful thing I have ever smelled. I would describe the scent to be similar to an Iranian prostitute&#x27;s sandals in mid-summer or a bad Indian restaurant. But given that there are five other ones I love, I give it an excuse of only a star, and it&#x27;s more than likely my own personal preference (though three of my friends agreed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last about an hour and keep an area smelling nice for a nice long while, I&#x27;ll light one at night around 11pm and I&#x27;ll still smell it at 5pm the next day. It does expand, though. I&#x27;ll light mine in a room at the corner of my house and even with the door shut and window open, it lingers around most of the house.</li>
            <li> All of the scents are pretty good and you get several of each (around 8 sticks but it varies since it&#x27;s based on weight). I was a little disappointed when I got them because I was expecting them to last for around 45 minutes like some of the reviews stated, but that&#x27;s my fault for going off other peoples reviews and not the product description. For me, each stick lasts are 15 minutes, but the scent lingers for much longer. For the price, this isn&#x27;t a bad pick up considering all the variations of scents that you get, but you could probably find a larger quantity of just one scent for cheaper.</li>
            <li> This item has the most interesting reviews I ever read! How could I not buy this? Did not smell like soap, came on time, burns right, smells great. I burn way too much incense daily and Satya is and will be my top choice. Finding anything other than Nagchampa or Superhit in a retail store is unheard of. If your looking for Satya scents you wont find elsewhere buy this... they all smell different and will not leave unhappy (if your sane)</li>
            <li> Best Incense I have ever gotten.  All of them smell great, esp the Patchouli Forest and the Sandalwood sents.  Will buy again when I run out.  GREAT VALUE!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this pack multiple times. The most appealing aspect for me is the blend of scents. It seems no matter what mood I&#x27;m in or what mood I&#x27;m trying to get in there is always a incense that compliments me. The sticks burn for a considerable amount of time which is an added bonus. The reason I&#x27;m giving 4 out of 5 stars is because some of the sticks can be broken, most likely in transportation however that can become a little bit of an annoyance. Otherwise bravo!!</li>
            <li> Great smelling incense, one stick burns in approximately an hour giving off a great scent. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting incense that burns slowly and the scents smell good.  The value for the price is excellent,&lt;br /&gt;because the stores that carry this kind of incense in my area charge a lot more.  This product also arrived very&lt;br /&gt;quickly.  The only thing negative I can say about this product is that the incense doesn&#x27;t light as fast and&lt;br /&gt;sometimes goes out before burning completely.  Overall, I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great value and the incense smell great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heaven smelling these various Nag Champas!!! It&#x27;s a great find and buy. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fun to try, although the sandalwood wasn&#x27;t my favorite. I think I&#x27;ll stick to the old standby after they run out,.</li>
            <li> Love this different scents, this is the best brand of incense.  Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Amazing incense. Fast delivery. I recommend.</li>
            <li> very little product for the price. quality controll varies...</li>
            <li> Some are a little strong, but overall they work very well.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy, these boxes tend to be pricey in stores. I also like the variety of smells that come with this pack, really happy I got this and I&#x27;ll be back to buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember what weight I bought in the store compared to what I was ordering online so I&#x27;ll clear that up for anyone else who is confused.  The 15 gram boxes in this set each hold 10 or 11 sticks of incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 6 boxes in the set, each a different \\&quot;flavor.\\&quot;  5 of the 6 boxes I got had 11 sticks, one had 10 sticks.  The sticks are the same length and width as sold in retail stores.  In other words, these aren&#x27;t sample-sized.  4 of the boxes had year 2011 sealing stickers on them, 2 had 2012.  All of the boxes were dry, clean, neat, sealed, undamaged.  All of the incense looks great.  They smell rich and fresh and burn nicely.  If you like Satya brand, you will be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nag Champa flavor box (2012, 11 sticks) also came with a bonus packet of two full-sized sticks of Harmony flavor incense, labelled \\&quot;free sample\\&quot; which is pretty cool. Of course you can&#x27;t be guaranteed to find this prize in your box...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer already described the scents of each of these flavors, so I&#x27;ll just endorse his review and mention that he&#x27;s right about the Patchouli:  it&#x27;s marvelous!  If you like Nag Champa, you will almost certainly enjoy the other flavors since their quality, richness, and subtle blends are just as fine as the original.  I definitely feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Satya&#x27;s Sai Baba standard Nag Champa (the blue box) for years and have never had this problem.  With this purchase, literally every stick so far has burned out after a couple minutes and needed to be relit.  You may only have to relight it once, or you might have to relight it two or three times, but it&#x27;s a huge pain.  If you burn incense for use during meditation, this is infuriating.  If you burn it just to season the air or create a mood, well, it is still extremely annoying.  I have tried sticks from every box in the set except for one and they ALL have this problem.  I would request a return as &#x27;defective&#x27; but for the cheap price I paid, it&#x27;s not worth my time.  Just AVOID BUYING, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, all Satya incense is pretty much interchangeable.  (Some people say the same thing about stick incense in general, but think that is an exaggeration.)  Seriously though, all of these masala-heavy Sai Baba varieties have very little variation between them at all.  Just stick with the easy-to-find Nag Champa in the blue box and save yourself the hassle of buying incense sticks that don&#x27;t burn, through the mail..</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of incense to get a good feel for a few of the different scents and fell in love with these particular ones. Patchouli Forest in particular smells great. I highly suggest this pack to anyone newer to incense looking to find a favorite scent.</li>
            <li> have been buying this  pack over n over. i love the assortment &amp; so does everyone else.  sticks last about 45min-1hr i think</li>
            <li> I rediscovered my love for incense recently and I have to say that this set of scents is wonderful and at a great price. I&#x27;ve always loved Nag Champa but hadn&#x27;t had the pleasure of experiencing all of these essences. So far the only one I don&#x27;t care for too much is the sandalwood incense which is strange because I usually like sandalwood scents. But others have said they like it. It&#x27;s all about personal preference. But this incense is top quality and lasts a LONG time. It has been said that these sticks are smaller than other brands but they actually last longer. I&#x27;d say at least an hour, if not more, per stick. I am anxious to try the other variety pack offered by them and experience the other scents.</li>
            <li> I am not going into too much detail on the scents because everyone has their own preference (My favorite would be Midnight), but the variety and price of this pack is great. They all burned nicely and lasted a while (about an hour). You can&#x27;t beat the price of these. Local shops can&#x27;t even beat the price for these. I would have liked one scent that was a little more floral (Lavender or Jasmine) but the scents I got were great!</li>
            <li> I bought this set looking for pine incense and came upon the Nag Champa things. Then I remembered, \\&quot;THAT&#x27;s the incense I liked!\\&quot; When the set came I immediately lit the blue box \\&quot;Nag Champa\\&quot; and instantly fell in love with it again. I tried the \\&quot;Patchouli Forest\\&quot; next which is as strong as the Nag Champa blue box with a woodsy scent. The \\&quot;Sunrise\\&quot; is nice for the morning but I do not believe I would buy a large case of it. That&#x27;s not definite though, I am going to try it tonight too get a more awake sense of it and see how I feel. The Sandalwood is a classic scent that I love but again, would not buy a larger amount of... but if you are looking for Sandalwood, this is the one. The Midnight and Celestial are a little too light and perfumey for me but I&#x27;ve been burning them together which isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found out from this scent is that yes, the blue box original \\&quot;Nag Champa\\&quot; scent is indeed the most divine aroma and I soon bought the 100g box of it right here on Amazon. Every time I light it I am reminded of the new age stores I visited when I was younger and the intoxicating scent that filled the rooms.&lt;br /&gt;It calms me and clears my head at the same time. It is a shock to your senses that can instantly \\&quot;center\\&quot; you if you sit and breathe it in for a little bit. You&#x27;d be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in order of favorites... 1)Nag Champa 2)Sandalwood 3)Patchouli Forest 4) Sunrise and 5+6) Celestial and Midnight.&lt;br /&gt;But to find your favorites, I would definitely start with this set.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the incense burns nice and long and the scent lingers in the room for quite a while. So worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Best incense we have found in years!</li>
            <li> Great aroma - long lasting</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is the leading name in incense.</li>
            <li> Very high quality scents.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting - this is the only incense I use. Each smell is particularly unique and inviting. It came sealed in a ziploc bag, and the incense I received is fresh and lasts forever. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed!  I&#x27;ve had the Nag Champa from this brand before...but forgot how good they are...these sticks may be a little shorter than some I&#x27;ve purchased from local shops, but they last twice as long at 1 hr each, and have  robust scents with staying power.  Each box in the set comes with 9 or 10 sticks, and each stick measures 8 inches tip to tip, with 6.5 inches of incense to burn.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are the best I have ever bought.  The smell is very intoxicating even when they are not lit up! :-)</li>
            <li> Celestial is my favorite!! I didn&#x27;t know which to burn first so I went by smell. I have only used half a stick so far but these smell amazing.. so calming and do not smell like firework smoke (I bought 30 from black market minerals, vanilla, blueberry etc and they smell like firework smell.. very disappointed)&lt;br /&gt;But these are amazing. I have never used incense before and I think this purchase was a great one! I will only use this brand from now on :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell so.. relaxing and again... no smokey smell</li>
            <li> This is truly a great brand!!! They smell strong in the box, but once lit they are not overpowering. I will be buying more from this brand in the future!!!</li>
            <li> I like incense and these smell so good. My favorite brand. They are strong though and will make your room smell for 2 months even without burning them. I&#x27;m not complaining though.... It&#x27;s so relaxing. And 60% of the time, it works EVERY time.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service</li>
            <li> I was looking for an introductory assortment of incense for my gear room, something that would give me an array of different scents.  This assortment very much fit the bill.  I have also found that using this assortment I can mix and match sticks of incense and vary the sweetness or the pungent tang of the different types by burning 2 different sticks at once .  This is not only a great buy, but it is a great experiment in incense.  If you&#x27;re just starting out as an incense buyer than this is definitly for you. If you buy incense a lot, than here is a great deal and an opportunity to experiment with mixed scents.  There is not a bad scent in any of the different boxes.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> they were delivered before the time they said  and we will buy again  we love these</li>
            <li> You could smell the box on the porch - exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Got these a while ago and have been totally addicted. The scents are great, very rustic and earthy. The incense is very strong and fills my entire house with the smell from just one stick. The scents reminds me of a head shop or an Asian restaurant, which is fine with me, but some of my friends don&#x27;t like it, prefering incense that smells sweet or like perfume.</li>
            <li> Really strongly scented.</li>
            <li> i love all the variety . they smell Great !!! i wish it was less expensive .A MUST HAVE</li>
            <li> Ambrosia of flowers and musk.</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE THIS STUFF, IT&#x27;S A NICE COPULATION OF SCENTS.  REMINDS ME OF MY HIPPIE DAYS IN SAN FRANCISCO</li>
            <li> This incense has a very stong, cloying aroma.  I did not really enjoy it.  If you&#x27;re into a subtle aroma from your incense look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I feel I am going to go through these quickly. They smell great and bring a nice ambiance to the place!</li>
            <li> lots of incence for the price, beats anything i could have purchased at the local healthfood store in terms of price point and quality</li>
            <li> The product smells nice at first then you burn it and your realize that smell that you thought was good is crap.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with these but I am satisfied. They burn for about an hour and smell very good. I like these a lot more than those grocery store air fresheners because there is no chemical smell and the scent from the incense last longer after they have burnt out. I personally like the Nag Champa the most, it is very relaxing after long days of work. They seem a little expensive but it is probably Amazon Prime subsidizing the cost of shipping into the cost of the product. Either way, I am pretty happy with these and would recommend them to anyone who likes their home to smell good!</li>
            <li> The incense smells great however won&#x27;t burn all the way. They&#x27;ll stop burning after a while and I have to continuously check on them.</li>
            <li> Loved this variety pack.  Smells great and has a very concentrated scent to all of them.  I would recomment it.</li>
            <li> I buy this incense all the time and it is great. I would say that is is something someone else would like.</li>
            <li> Good Deal. Burns nice. Most are pleasant. Hey, its incense. Can&#x27;t get to worked up about it. It is good quality.</li>
            <li> thus was a great deal and did not know there is this many styles&lt;br /&gt;and makes the house smell great.</li>
            <li> I love these.  Incense sticks are impossible to find these days, and this variety pack is a great value.  You need not be a pothead to enjoy.</li>
            <li> They all smell like mold</li>
            <li> Way too strong. So far I only care for one scent. I should&#x27;ve gotten lavender or oils.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this line of incense, but am disappointed with this batch. Maybe I received a bad batch? The scent is too subtle. So subtle, I forget that I am burning incense and proceed to light another before I realize a stick is still burning. I will return to buying Midnight from my local Indian store, the scent is stronger and captivating.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it was cheaper but this incense smells so much better than the crap you can find locally in the U.S. at terrible places like Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but all the incense smell the same...</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed. Remember buying these years ago thought I wouldn&#x27;t find them. Delicious scent, they last a lot and they are not intense at all.</li>
            <li> For a very good deal, same type of incense I would buy in the store at a much better discounted price.</li>
            <li> Great value and product smells great</li>
            <li> I love Nga Champa and this set does not disappoint! Each variety smells wonderful and burns great! What a steal! Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I now realize other incense I have purchased may have been stale. Every one of these scents is very pleasing. Burn time is also very good. They all just smell &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; if you can use that word with incense. I bought additional packs for gifts for young professionals, and they were very impressed with the scents.</li>
            <li> Love this set. Been getting them for a year now. Almost every aroma smells great and covers doggie odor.</li>
            <li> The Nag Champa smelled best of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celestial and sunrise smell pretty good. Midnight is okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patchouli was unpleasant and gave my girlfriend a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst of the lot, by far, was the sandalwood. It smelled nothing like Sandalwood incense I&#x27;ve encountered before; it has a sort of subtle, but incredibly unpleasant mildewy smell. I believe it likely that this is due to having gotten a bad batch, rather than being representative of Sai Baba&#x27;s sandalwood incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has turned me on to Nag Champa, which I&#x27;ll stick to buying separately from now on.</li>
            <li> i ordered these and some of them burn a little too quick and are a little strong. The house smells nice though.</li>
            <li> I like the scents in this assortment and the sticks burn well.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and would consider reordering when I&#x27;m in need of more.</li>
            <li> This incense pack has lasted me about a year. It&#x27;s great. Some of the scents like &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34; are sort of synthetic-smelling, but others like &amp;#34;super hit&amp;#34; are amazing. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> its very hard to find the right scents for the right price you will not be disappointed these incenses are amazing strong and you dont have to burn the whole incense to scent a room or etc and they last a very long time :}</li>
            <li> I usually just burn Nag Champa, thought I would try some other scents.  Nope, just burn the Nag Champa for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they use to scent these, but I immediately threw the whole thing away as soon as I opened it. Upon reflection, I should have returned it for a refund, but honestly the smell was that offending I just wanted to be rid of it. Our family stays away from artificial scents and we have become sensitive to them (it&#x27;s hard to even walk down the fabric softener aisle). This was so artificial and over the top. I wanted a variety pack to see which scent I liked, and I also purchased a couple Shoyeido brand incense variety packs to try. I love the Shoyeido brand. If you are at all sensitive to artificial scents I highly recommend you stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The scent seems to be the same on all sticks no matter what the description. Upon opening the sticks crumbled and a some the incense powder fell off the stick, very messy unless you know and open them over the sink. Defonitely will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> This incense was quite disappointing. Some of the aromas were not at all what they should be, and all the sticks in several of the boxes would not stay lighted. They&#x27;d light and then a few seconds later would go out on their own. Took so many re-lights to get any use out of them, we proably spend more on lighter fluid than the incense. - Won&#x27;t buy these again as long as the their quality remains so low.</li>
            <li> Used the blue one for mediation and prayers. The entire room is now has a heavenly atmosphere. Good for prayer halls as well.</li>
            <li> Good quality and long lasting smell. Not overly woodsy or perfumey like a lot of incense can be. I use these for meditation as well as, around my home for a nice fragrant smell. I&#x27;m quite happy with these incense and will continue to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> These are the best incenses for authentic, earthy aromas that are not nauseating, flowery or fruity.&lt;br /&gt;The nag champa is the one frequently used in yoga studios and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are strong but not too overpowering and this little sampler is great.</li>
            <li> Best incense ever. Love every scent they make.</li>
            <li> Huge assortment of incense. I used these for some art projects and demonstrating how my incense holders work. So this inexpensive, huge variety was perfect for my budget and projects.</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected</li>
            <li> some of the best smelling incense on the market. My favorite is Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> i like every fragrance, and always keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I have been burning this brand of incense for years, and the quality of the actual product has never degraded. Wonderful fragrances, and wonderful price for this set. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and very strong. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to incense and wasn&#x27;t sure which scents to buy.  I love the selections and really enjoy the Sunrise and Midnight scents.  The scents are not too obnoxious and they linger for a while after burned out. I don&#x27;t think they were pricey, each stick lasts about an hour or so?</li>
            <li> i have pets and i love to use incense to neutralize the pet odor in the house. i love this brand. the sticks burn slowly and have a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I have always liked nag champa and was wanting to try more along the same lines. These are all wonderful!</li>
            <li> Its hard to find nice incense in this quantity for such a low price. It&#x27;s a good variety and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Too short and most of the scent turned to dust at the bottom of the bag</li>
            <li> My favorite brand of incense, in multiple scents, with free shipping on Amazon? I&#x27;ll take two please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not an incense connoisseur, so I can&#x27;t tell if these are fake reproductions of Satya Sai Baba or not, but they definitely appear legitimate to me! (holographic seal, authentic baggy liners in the box, apparently correct scents...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is awesome, considering the multi-pack appeal of this particular listing.</li>
            <li> All of the scents included smell wonderful, and were not opened. A great variety.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff. It all smells like soap. Like, bad soap. Not even the nice naturally fragranced kind.  Had to toss it b/c I don&#x27;t really want my incense smelling like soap.  Waste of money.  Moral: Smell the incense before you buy it.  Cheers.</li>
            <li> These are strong and flavorful - with very little smoke.  I love the sunrise, but honestly - they&#x27;ll all beautiful scents!  I&#x27;ll be buying again!</li>
            <li> All of the scents smell very good. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This collection of six different scents is the best value for your money.  I have purchased these on many different occassions and I keep coming back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the Midnight Patchouli and the celestial.  The or very relaxing woody and smokey.</li>
            <li> I purchased these incense&#x27;s around Christmas and loved them so much, that I got them again!  They last long and smell awesome!</li>
            <li> Love the incense. They may be a wee bit of a challenge to light up so make sure you let the incense burn a few seconds before you blow out the spark. And it smells FANTASTIC. It is strong and the smell lingers a day later after you have burnt it. They are a very slow burn incense which is nice so they last longer. It&#x27;s just a most lovely way to infuse warmth and peace into your home. I LOVE them, I have and will continue to buy again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I use them.&lt;br /&gt;- Burn one in the office every morning to clear the air.&lt;br /&gt;- Use it in my yoga studio before yoga.&lt;br /&gt;- Burn it in the kitchen if we have cooked fish or something similar.&lt;br /&gt;- Burn before guests come so the after-effect lingers but it&#x27;s not so strong as incense does bother some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Great variety and great aroma coming from these incense sticks. I like lighting two different sticks and mixing them. Works great for relaxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to incense generally.  Although I initially agreed with other reviewers who say some of the scents are too &amp;#34;soapy,&amp;#34; or strong, after a couple of tries I no longer felt that way.  My guess is that incense is a kind of &amp;#34;acquired taste.&amp;#34;  Some of the scents I initially though I wouldn&#x27;t like, now I kind of like.  After almost daily use, none of them seem that strong to me as they did at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, sandalwood is the one that initially smelled best to me and still the one I like most.</li>
            <li> The smells are very pleasant and a high quality product.</li>
            <li> It is what it is.... The number os sticks per box is inconsistent, some had 10 sticks, an other had 13. Not the best deal - but its nice and I didn&#x27;t have to drive into town to shop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted. Fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burning incense for years and this is my favorite brand by par.  Nag Champa is hands down my favorite.  Seller shipped immediately and all items are brand new and sealed.</li>
            <li> shipped very fast, quality incense. distributor of these products seems to actually want your business and to try to keep it.</li>
            <li> Best price. And a arrived just as described.  No surprises. I will purchase this product again.  These incense smell great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to write this since I don&#x27;t like incense, especially these scents. However, these were a gift for my son and he really enjoys them. The price was far better than those in the stores locally.</li>
            <li> The quality has really deteriorated tremendously from the last time I bought it. I cannot believe this was the same thing I bought last year. Even the standard incenses are so much superior. The sticks don&#x27;t burn like they were damp, there is very little aroma. I had to use nearly 5-6 incense sticks of Nag Champa to get a decent aroma. I still have it and use it with other brands. I would probably not buy this again.</li>
            <li> They burn well but are very messy, the powder around the incense is loose. There are 6 perfumes, yet they all smell the same to me when they burn (might be my nose too...). They are nowhere near the best incense sticks I purchased, but they are so cheap I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I have purchased tons of incense over the past few years and this is my favorite variety pack.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love these incense. They burn longer than a lot of the store bought ones i have had previously and I am very happy with the scents. I will definitely be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> I have been using incense for many years, and I have to say that this is by far the highest quality product I have used.  The value for the price cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> I got these safe and fast in the mail. I knew it was these in the mail because I could smelled them through the box they came in. If you burn lots of incense this is one  bundle to buy.</li>
            <li> used it on my rest room make it clear and nice .i love that .make my room nice and wonderful</li>
            <li> What can I say?  I love my apartment smelling good.  I&#x27;ve had boxes upon boxes of incense flavors over the years.  I decided to see what amazon had to offer and these were among the top rated so decided to give it a go.  I was blown away by the quality of this brand.  The sticks last easily three times longer than your average incense stick and the scents are pretty exotic to what you&#x27;re used to.  Me and the girl love the midnight and forest scents the most.  I&#x27;ve ordered these twice now and will continue to do so.  Hopefully they come out with more varieties later.</li>
            <li> Best Incense, long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY. ALL INCENSES IN THE BOX WERE TOO SOFT AND FEEL WET.</li>
            <li> The incense burns well and I like the variety of the different scents</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a great deal this was. A great way to sample different fragrances, without paying full price for each box.</li>
            <li> I love these incense! Considering they&#x27;d be about $3 a box elsewhere, you&#x27;re saving a bunch of money. They are of MUCH BETTER quality than some of the incense sold as singles so you can pick and choose your scents. I&#x27;ve never been as happy with those as I am with this set. The scents are very fragrant but not so much so that they will burn your eyes and nose if you burn a whole one in a small (12&#x27; x 10&#x27;) room. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product. A nice bonus is the seller shipped quickly and the package arrived ahead of schedule. I will come back here when I run out.</li>
            <li> Nice variety!  Great assortment of incense.</li>
            <li> They are vegan, and the assortment was nice. They all smelled great! Words things stuff items roofs floors carpet scales.</li>
            <li> Good variety, powerful incense. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> Love getting this combo pack, the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells very bad with a very cheap perfume like smell that is very off putting. Was very exited about this however very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I bought these for one reason, to make my room smell different. It gets the job done, but it smells like a smoke shop, which is OK I guess.</li>
            <li> I love incense and always buy this brand. MMMMMMM!!!  Smelling it right now and loving it!  Can&#x27;t go wrong buying this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome sample pack. Gave it to pothead stepkid and her loser boyfriend. They said they love them one two three</li>
            <li> My sister loves incense, and I bought this pack for her for Christmas. She loved it! The smell is strong but not overpowering, and it lasts for a long time. Good price too.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of great incense and this fits the mold.I received my order in three days and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. Great prize and great smell. They also last longer than other incenses I used to buy at stores.</li>
            <li> I have treated myself to this 2x and bought them for my sister - I love the names on the boxes and of course the incense in them.  They last a long time, are a bit smokey (what do you expect though, they&#x27;re incense!) and are of high quality.  I burn incense almost every day and these last me about 4 months.</li>
            <li> This was another gift I purchased for my daughter. I&#x27;ve used incense most of my adult life and I&#x27;d never heard of this brand. After buying this for my daughter, I can tell the superiority in quality that this brand offers. When it&#x27;s time, I will purchase this brand exclusively.</li>
            <li> wonderful scents, long lasting, great price. Fresh too, not stale dried out or impaired scent. Great buy, great to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with these incense sticks. They&#x27;re very flaky. I have to be careful not to make a mess just pulling them out of the package. I&#x27;ve had a couple sticks so far come out with almost all of the incense flaked off. The package of Nag Champa is filled about an inch and a half from the bottom with nothing but the flakes. The smell also isn&#x27;t that great, I smell what reminds me of a fireplace at times.</li>
            <li> smell so great!  definitely will buy again.  not too smokey.  nice variety pack.  no problems with them going out before theyve finished burning</li>
            <li> I ordered these with an incense holder and they were great.  They all smell amazing and it was a great variety.  They shipped with prime which is always quick!</li>
            <li> i use this incense for the purpose of meditation.  the incense has some of the best, subtle, natural aromas i have found.  the quality is high, better than most, and very pleasing.  i doubt you can find anything much better.  they were shipped promptly, and whole.  arrived in perfect shape.  this is the one i&#x27;ll keep buying.</li>
            <li> I love incense and this is a nice variety of different aromas.We usually burn these near the litter box for obvious reasons,but they&#x27;re really nice anytime,anywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought these with an enclosed type incent holder, and these dont stay lit. They stay lit for 5 min then burn out. These are the only ones that ive had issues with</li>
            <li> Nag Champa makes a good incense and this is a good way to find your favorite.</li>
            <li> Just as you&#x27;d expect. Good ol incense.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality, it imposible to lighting (looks that is humid) and it doesnt smell any fragance. I would like to returned but I already throw away the boxes...</li>
            <li> GREAT FRAGRANCE…I enjoyed all 6!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, but the boxes were all bent and so where some of the stick in them:/</li>
            <li> These incense sticks are simply awesome. I use them all the time just to make the house smell wonderful. I strongly suggest you give them a try.</li>
            <li> Great scents, nice slow burn....when I think of incense, this is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> This incense burns slowly and fills the room with a most wonderful fragrance.  You can actually tell one scent from another.  I will definately be buying this package again.  It will make a great gift too.</li>
            <li> The reviwers said the Patchouly Forrest was like we all remember in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s. Sorry, I was a major Patchouly lover, this does not do it for me. All the other scents so far { I have not tried them all ] are just way to perfumy, if you know what i mean. I will go ahead and burn the stuff eventualy and five some away. I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> Good quality incense!</li>
            <li> These things stink....up my whole house with real nice smells!!</li>
            <li> Mediocre --- do not always burn all the way.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome!  Need to reorder!  Best incense ever!</li>
            <li> Burns very well and does the trick.  I really like a few of the scents, but I also dislike a couple.  I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you buy a variety 6-pack.  But overall it&#x27;s a good product and a fair price.</li>
            <li> Great variety pack. Ordered to find out what my favorites would be, I really liked Patchouli Forest! Great for anyone new to Nag Champa!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and very fresh. I am loving these.</li>
            <li> Best incense I have ever been around. Love it. Lighting one of these is like lighting three of the dollar store kind,and the smell lasts longer</li>
            <li> Sub par quality for all these flavors. I was hoping for&lt;br /&gt;more relaxing subtle scents but instead these all&lt;br /&gt;turned out to be overpowering sweet and ultimately&lt;br /&gt;annoying.Not for meditation.I Do Not reccomend these.</li>
            <li> this is a perfect way to gift Incense without looking cheap. Nice boxes, although incense is usually quite cheap. I believe you are paying a bit for the packaging. For home use I would skip it but for a gift it is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this set of incense.  Each box had a smaller box inside with even more incense- nice surprise! The amount you receive for the price is hard to beat! We will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> Nag Champa when I get home from work, Patchouli  Forest  Saturday Afternoon with tea, Midnight after the sun goes down on Friday night, Sandal Wood just because I love Sandalwood sooooo sooothing, Sunrise when I meditate in the mornings before getting ready for work and Celestial for my Spiritual Well Being and quite time. You can lose.</li>
            <li> These incense smell so good. I previously bought some charcoal incense from the dollar store, and it didn&#x27;t smell very good and got my hands all black. These are so much better. They smell good, they&#x27;re easy on your lungs unlike charcoal, and they&#x27;re just pleasant to light. Each pack comes with about 10 sticks, and they burn super slow (each stick lasts at least half an hour, probably more like 45 minutes). Sunrise is my favorite one so far, although I still have yet to light sandalwood, celestial, and the forest one. I wish this was only $5 because that&#x27;s all I think it&#x27;s worth, but if you want nice incense shipped to you, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of fine incense.</li>
            <li> This is usually a decent low-priced Indian incense product; but the set of 6 x 15g boxes I received seemed... old.  The Sandalwood scent included, which I normally enjoy from this incense producer, smelled like it had been damaged by water or mold.  (This can happen if the incense gets moist or very old; I have a feeling the seller just sent me a very, very old sampler box of this incense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this was the only disappointing incense purchase I&#x27;ve ever had from an Amazon seller; and it could have just been a fluke.</li>
            <li> I love satya incense and this is the best way to figure what your favorite scents are and maybe which ones don&#x27;t appeal to you before getting stuck with a large quantity of it.</li>
            <li> I love good smelling incense these are wonderful.  bought my.first box in myrtle beach they smelled so good, I ordered more from here</li>
            <li> These incense are a must!  They always are quality and have freshness.  I have burned incense for over 20 years.  I highly recommend this brand and flavored incense.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell, but I have to keep relighting the stick every five minutes. Since I use incense for meditation, it&#x27;s a pain to have to keep checking on it. I&#x27;m going to stick with HEM brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Bought before, this is by far my favorite variety set. I&#x27;ve bought other Nag Champa sets (with Sunset and other scents that smell terrible) but these are the closest to being like the original with slight variants. Very natural scent and they all have a heavy sandalwood base smell.</li>
            <li> Great Pack of incense..Has all the fragances I wanted !!!</li>
            <li> This is a good deal, and it&#x27;s nice to have a variety of different scents.  I had never come across the majority of them, but all are interesting and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!  Arrived on time and were the kind of  high quality incense sticks I was looking for in a variety pack. I will be buying them again and again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what you would expect when you order some Nag Champa incense. Great smell and an even burn. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and packaged safely. I absolutely love this product, as it exceeded all my expectations. It is a well made product.</li>
            <li> I took this incense as a try and see product with the other incense I bought. I found this to better and longer burning. It does not choke. I plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often give 5 star ratings, but I really liked all of the different scents included. They all smell very nice, burn well and for a long time, and the packaging wasn&#x27;t compromised or damaged with delivery. Probably about 1-1.5 hours of burn time per stick. I recommend this blend; they&#x27;re all very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I had been craving some amazing smelling incense but was skeptical to order them online. However, I was pleasantly surprised and absolutely fancied the variety of the different smells. Great product and will order again.</li>
            <li> well worth the money. if you haven&#x27;t tried this brand of incense before, i think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised. this is my favorite brand of incense and midnight and forest patchouli are my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Nice collection of scents</li>
            <li> Lovely aroma, great price, easy to light and to use, variation of fragrances is a delightful touch, all around great little product.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of India. Oh sweet goodness, so great I don&#x27;t think I will ever have to eat a cow again!</li>
            <li> Out of the box, these sticks smell great which only makes it worse when you burn them and are stunned by how they smell nothing like before you burned them. The stick hold the incense together clearly overpowers any other smell. Disappointed doesn&#x27;t begin to explain how I feel. Do yourself a favor and look for incense that does not contain a wooden core, or find a place that lets you test one out before buying.</li>
            <li> Over all these are fine..However two of them choked me up right after I lit ..I will stick with the single pack of the 3 I did not have a problem with ..These are nice , the smoke burns white , not black like some I have had..I like these but I will put at number 3 in my list of which ones first to buy...~!~</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t be my last. This is THE BEST combo if you love incense.&lt;br /&gt;I will be back to get more. Promise.</li>
            <li> I was looking for incense comparable in quality to what I buy at the Renaissance Festival every year from a couple of my favorite vendors. They make the incense themselves, and they smell amazing. I came across these though and decided to give them a chance, even though a lot of incense I buy prepackaged has a very harsh smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I gave these a chance. I could smell the incense through the package box, they smelt very good. I opened it up and have burned quite a few from the various scents. I have liked everyone of them so far, and they burn for a very long time. The longest so far was an hour and 15 minutes. Even just sitting in their package I can smell them every time I come in my room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend you give them a chance. I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Love the Nag!  An incredibly priced variety that is a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; purchase.</li>
            <li> I just placed my 2nd order....they lasted for several months, and I use them regularly. I highly recommend them!! Ive used several brands in the past, and by far this is the best.</li>
            <li> Love this incense! You can smell it through the packaging when it arrives.</li>
            <li> What a great Idea I was not aware that this company made so many different flavors. I love them all and it has made me very happy . I use them at home in my practice and when I am visiting some where or staying in a hotel. love love love this!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this set and I still love it! All the scents are nice and it generally lasts around 3 to 4 months using them around 3 times a week. The scent sticks around a little while after you&#x27;re finished burning it, too.</li>
            <li> This package delivers the true incense experience, made naturally, smells sublime, not overpowering like fake floral types. Another good thing is they are thin so they don&#x27;t set off smoke alarms like store-bought big ones (also better for your lungs!). They last plenty long - sometimes I put one out midway and relight the next day. I love the selection and pick the type I want according to mood, time of day, etc. Great for relaxing and creating atmosphere for meditation or just to draw in positive energies. Being disabled, it is so great to be able to buy these online. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this variety of incense so much that this is the second time it has been ordered. Every scent smells wonderful and for every time of day and night. There is not really anything I needed to know before ordering because I have had this before. The quality is good and it burns slow compared to others I have used. I will always keep this incense in my home to burn.</li>
            <li> I got these today and i was surprised that they came here fast even tho there was a \\&quot;delay\\&quot; so for that i received 2 FREE samples!&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with the incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And because there was a problem with the Patchouli Forest they sent me a different one called MONEY which they said it was one of their best selling incense so i decided to try it out first and i absolutely LOVED the smell of it,so far it is one of my favorites tied with MIDNIGHT which also smells GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried SANDALWOOD but i have not liked it as much as the last two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have to try out the rest of them but im sure they will be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying again after i run out!!</li>
            <li> Ok so just a little heads up when they arrive and you arent burning them the smell horrible but when you bur the they smell wonderful</li>
            <li> These are nice quality incenses, but I wish they told us what each of the the incense were for.  E.g - sandalwood is for &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t state that on this package (have to research what each is online).</li>
            <li> Love the nag champa scents, I bought this set and a set with more than 6 scents about 4 seperate times. This ones best scents are midnight, nag champa and celestial and sunrise. I&#x27;m not too fond of sandalwood, but I still enjoy to burn them anyways and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad per se, just not as good as the others. Patchouli forest is great for masking any smells or smoke odor. It&#x27;s a strong one but I enjoy the &#x27;weirdness&#x27; to the odor.</li>
            <li> Light incense, blow out incense, let incense smoke billow around you and then relax.</li>
            <li> The nag champa is still my favorite incense scent by far but the other scents are wonderful as well. These sticks burn for quite a while, too.</li>
            <li> you know you&#x27;ll go through them eventually, so you might as well buy a lot at once.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that sai baba makes any bad scents, the products burn well and stay burning they don&#x27;t quit half way down the stick. I bought the variety pack to sample new scents so far I like them all. Quality brand!!</li>
            <li> I like the scent because it helps create a mood for meditation. It is also financially reasonable.If yu like Nag champ incense for meditation or is an odor neutralizer, this six-box collection will do the trick and save you money. i recommend it.</li>
            <li> This selection of incense is top quality and smells great even with out burning. Last a long time and fill home with the traditional Indian scents.  Variety pack is good, but found there is not a huge variance in the smells of these. all are good.</li>
            <li> My friends love the way these incense smells and so do I.  I think these are from India and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m there.</li>
            <li> For me, home isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; without good, quality incense.  I reordered more.  I&#x27;m mad about this product and the bargain price too!</li>
            <li> 6 months later I still haven&#x27;t put a dent in it!</li>
            <li> These incese tend to fall apart, the incense itself turns to powder and is very brittle. They are very hard to light.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of incense...More really than I plan to use for a long time, but the variety is nice and they came as expected. Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> 6 different scents here. All of them smell slightly similar yet different somehow. Patchouli forest smells like patchouli without leaving you and your whole house smelling like a hippie den permanently.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I have experienced a real migraine before until I lit these insense sticks. I would assume it&#x27;s just me since I read many positive feedbacks before making a purchase. But the smell was definitely way too strong, therefore unpleasant for me. Hardly finished one box,  will try it again in the summer... to keep the mosquitos away!</li>
            <li> This variety pack of incense is great. Not too smoky or oily. They burn very cleanly and light easily. Very pleasant. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a baby boomer who experienced the 60s. I constantly burned incense. I&#x27;ve tried room deodorizers for years that don&#x27;t last and are expensive. One stick of incense leaves a pleasant aroma throughout my home. The scent is not overbearing and lasts amost all day.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading some reviews about how the incense all smell the same and when I first opened the package I assumed it would. It overpowered me! To my pleasant surprise they didn&#x27;t when I lit them individually. They smelled so fresh and lasted forever. I do enjoy some scents more than others (nag champa, sandlewood) but it was nice to try them all out. Such a great deal!</li>
            <li> Gave to my son for Christmas but I could smell the aromas before the boxes were even opened.  Great selection and large quantity for the price.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> There were only a pair of scents which were less than appealing to me. But I suppose its merely personal preference rather than quality of product. I will do much better to choose my own scents though. Thanks</li>
            <li> good sampling pack  I really enjoyed each type of incense that was included and would surely purchase this same product</li>
            <li> this is a genuine product. high quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this pack for a while and I&#x27;ve enjoyed all the scents.  My complaint is they are difficult to start, but that may have more to do with my inexperience than the product itself.  At first it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are getting very much, especially when it is delivered, but I have enjoyed many hours with this set.  I&#x27;m not entirely sure why most people use this type of product, I used it to help me meditate and pray.  So, use this if you&#x27;ve never experienced Incense you will get a feel for the type of things you like.</li>
            <li> these are lovely and despite what some say I think that the scents are very different, not at all the same - i like!</li>
            <li> Much smokier than other brands that I have used. Overwhelming. Needed to have the window open.</li>
            <li> Nice variety found in this set of incense &amp; it is made&lt;br /&gt;by one of the best incense makers in the world. The price is reasonable because you are getting quality in return.</li>
            <li> This was perfect. The shipping was very fast. They all smell wonderful, my boyfriend got me these for valentines day. He liked them so much I went and bought him some.</li>
            <li> All of these smell really beautiful and a great way to help relax after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> If you like Gag Champa, try some other flavors! I&#x27;ve liked them all so far.</li>
            <li> These incense are poorly made. You really cant smell the difference in the incense......they All Smell the Same. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice to try assorted to find what one likes better.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this set of Nag Champa incense, I got by on the store-bought stuff you can buy by the stick. It served its purpose, but it was usually nothing special. However, this stuff is a game-changer for me. Each scent has exactly that - it&#x27;s own, distinct scent, that you can actually smell while it&#x27;s burning (instead of that mostly smoky smell from the generic kind I mentioned earlier). Each stick is nice and thick, and burns for upwards of an hour, plus the scent lingers for quite a while afterwards without being overpowering. For the price, you get 6 great scents, and plenty of each at that. If you&#x27;re looking for incense, Nag Champa is the way to go.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of incense and I like all the scents in this set.</li>
            <li> Variety is the spice of life, and I have never bought an incense from this maker that I didn&#x27;t like. These are all high quality sticks. Only the best ingredients are used, and I have been using these for many years. Their quality is consistent and I trust this brand completely. Try the different variety packs and see which ones you like best.</li>
            <li> Great item and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item several times.  Always a great addition to my home and office.</li>
            <li> These smell absolutely horrible. Threw them out, then threw out the trash right away because the trash stunk. Took a few days to get the smell out of my house.</li>
            <li> These are great. We love incense in our house. One of the packs was a little defective and it took a few lit threw burning to use it all up.</li>
            <li> quick shipping, great price and it&#x27;s so nice to receive what I was expecting....aromatic!</li>
            <li> Nice variety of smells - the incense sticks are very durable none have broken so far and they burn for a nice amount of time! Excellent quality and love how many different smells and now many sticks i get for so little money!</li>
            <li> Very fragrant! Great quality!</li>
            <li> Awful. Smoky and messy and dry and powdery. Not what I think of when I think &amp;#34;quality incense.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These r the real deal. They are highly fragranced. They are from India as well. Every scent in this package smells incredible. I will be ordering more of these. You cant beat the price either. I have a preemie brand new to the home. He was in Nicu for about a week. Call me crazy but the incense calms him. I put it in my bedroom I am in a 1000 square foot apt....I don&#x27;t want the smoke to bother him. The scent reaches the living room. He goes right to sleep. Now if we can only get his formula right.We have the relaxing environment candles lots of love r incense now need the correct formula And we r set. This is a delightful mix of earthy scents. My fiance doesn&#x27;t even like incense but he loves these. Great buy!! Loving the midnight incense right now!!!</li>
            <li> lots of incense for a great price!</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with these was that they wouldn&#x27;t always stay lit. The scents were ok and the incense dust is a little excessive.</li>
            <li> Contained both familiar and new scents of incense, all of which are great (especially the patchouli forest and celestial!)... I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the past and always end up back with Satya Baba.  Fast shipping, good service. I will definitely be reordering from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Was hard getting it lit, but once it got going it was fine. Smells really good and is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> got a lot for my money</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy these and thought they might be junk. But they are great and they smell very good. They burn for a while as well. Good stuff</li>
            <li> These were very strong and I enjoyed the fact that they could perfume the entire house.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great bang for the buck! Not a single one smells bad or pungent,  and they are well worth their cheap price!</li>
            <li> Best deal EVER! I love all of these, it&#x27;s amazing all of the variety you get and once you start turning one on you can never stop!</li>
            <li> I previously ordered the set of 12- something like that and they weren&#x27;t as thick, nor did they smell that good. These are amazing. They cover up the cigarette odor. I will most likely order these when I have two boxes left, which should be very soon!</li>
            <li> Great combination of scents! Love my nag champa!!! You really are getting great quality incense for the price!! Love that I can get them delivered to my door without having to get into my car and drive over to the Venice Beach boardwlk! So convenient!!!</li>
            <li> All of these smell so good!! Well made and burn for a while, I havent tried all of them but the boxes smell amazing and the few Ive burned are great!!</li>
            <li> Not the best incense in the world but smells good and burns well for the most part. A few sticks had trouble staying lit but it was only a few and they just needed to be re-lit a few times.</li>
            <li> Great product, just took way to long to ship</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these incense, I buy them all of the time, they are so fragrant that I don&#x27;t even have to light them. I love walking into my room, it always smells great.</li>
            <li> Love the variety pack! Nice and lasting scents. And not too strong.</li>
            <li> I received the incense in record time and it was well packaged, There was a little crushing at the end of the boxes, but it did not damage the incense sticks. The smell fills the entire house! I have had no trouble keeping it lit. I will be ordering incense again from Nag Champa! Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> Best smells I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have bought incense and I am glad I chose these. They all smell great and are in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like high- quality incense.</li>
            <li> Great quality, as expected.</li>
            <li> I burn incense every morning when I wake up to start my day and fill the house with pleasantness.  For years I have ordered the Nag Champa incense from Amazon but declded to try this 6 pack for variety.  I found I kind of like having different scents each day.  The sandalwood in particular is awesome!  The others are all amazing too so the sandalwood is just my favorite (for now).  Namaste!</li>
            <li> Placed my order on Dec 23rd, 2012.  Five days later the item was delivered.  Unfortunately, all six boxes are clearly labeled as a batch from \\&quot;2011\\&quot; and smell terrible!  The bottom of each box is filled with at least two inches of shaken off powdery fragrance; so you&#x27;re left with old, dried out, and mostly bare sticks.  Tried burning the Sandalwood and it made our house smell like burning hair and mold!!  I had to air out the rooms for an entire afternoon/evening.  Will not purchase again.  (Sold by: XTREMEK)</li>
            <li> Great scents and nice packing. Great burn time. Seems a bit expensive but well worth it. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> All of these smell fantastical!</li>
            <li> People who know incense know more about this product than I do. But I find this incense smells great, not too strong or artificial or cloying as some incense can be. It&#x27;s just great stuff. I know It&#x27;s a classic. But I just really like it! And this sampler is great for trying different scents.</li>
            <li> Not the 12 box pack, but a pretty good sampler. Smells pretty good, burns for an acceptably long time. Pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this set because each day I do yoga I use a different package and then I can mix and match and get a totally different infusion. I highly recommend this brand and this seller.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my incenses! I love the options you are given!! I love Sandalwood by the way!! Everything worked out great!! I think I might buy another set! :)</li>
            <li> Burnin&#x60; Down The House.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ALL OF THESE WONDERFUL SMELLS</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and burns a long time! Love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they were the smaller incense sticks but I still love them. They are the real deal from India. I will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The sandalwood is a lovely scent. The sticks burn long and smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> These are good incense. A good variety of nice scents that are not too overpowering. A good purchase if you like incense.</li>
            <li> Smell great and made a wonderful gift.</li>
            <li> best incense. i recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Before I chose this seller I ordered from another and was very disappointed. That is not the case here. The incense smell like the description and every scent is great. They don&#x27;t burn too fast and the smells are lasting and amazing. Will be ordering again from this seller very soon.</li>
            <li> Came fast smells great will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love these! All my favorite smells!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  GREAT, FABULOUS sellers.</li>
            <li> Purchased as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite incense especially the regular blue nagchampa &amp; midnight nag champa. Great deal</li>
            <li> So much incense! Great quality, great price.</li>
            <li> Love the scents, they last a long time. the bundle is a very reasonable purchase if you use a lot of incense like I do.</li>
            <li> Gift for sister, she loves,...these are very very Very strong smell...be ware...I had them wrapped in christmas paper they smelled so strong I moved them into garage until Christmas day came.</li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.  I took a stick out of the box and all the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; fell off.  thank goodness I did so over my sink so that the mess was contained.  Ditto for all the rest of the sticks and ones in box #2 too.  I am scare to open the others. I have two sticks lit right now and not a drop of scent is floating aromatically in the air.  DON&#x27;T BUY THESE  THEY ARE WORTHLESS.</li>
            <li> I am just getting into aromatherapy so I decided to try incense. Excellent scents, high quality product. It works better than any air freshener and masks any bad smell. Because the scent is so heavy, don&#x27;t sit right in front of it or you will get a headache. Very nice set that would be favorable to anyone.</li>
            <li> The incense is of high quality and has a very pleasing scent. However, three of the boxes (Midnight, Sunrise and Celestial) have a problem. In the case of each one, the incense sticks just won&#x27;t burn. When they are lit, they will burn for less than a minute and then just go out. Repeatedly trying to burn them results in the same outcome, so that we finally gave up. It&#x27;s very frustrating because the scents of all the packages are very pleasing. If only they would burn!</li>
            <li> Good smells but a lot of packaging for just a couple sticks per box.</li>
            <li> Great deal, smelled them before I opened the box, The drawer I store them in is so fragrant, even after removing the incense. Very well dipped and extremely fragrant.</li>
            <li> I gave these to my daughter for Christmas - she says to give them a five!!!</li>
            <li> If you just can&#x27;t decide on the scent you want, this is a good little mix to try. Very good value for what you get! We are very pleased with the quality and with this purchase in general.</li>
            <li> Ive got no complaints on this product. It burns slowly and smells devine,ill definitely be buying this bundle again! Nag champa has been a favorite of mine for as long as i can remember so i figured id try out some other scents. I must say this was a good decision :)</li>
            <li> I have burned Nag champa since my childhood and have never grown sick of it. First time i ever tried the other scents by Nag Champa and I love them all just as much. Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it a lot because I mostly use candles. But this product is very nice. All the scents are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this brand of incense. They arrived quickly and smell great! A lot of the reviews said the smell is too overpowering but that&#x27;s kind of the point of incense.</li>
            <li> Outside of the blue box Nag Champa these varieties are ok. The celestial and sunrise are quite nice but the Sandalwood is awful it isn&#x27;t even remotely related to sandalwood.  These scents do have somewhat of an artificial scent I didn&#x27;t expect from this brand but still they are a cut above most incense. I didn&#x27;t fall in love with any of them and even the blue box seems to have been made from a different recipe from what I remember of it. I will probably purchase the blue box from time to time in the future but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this set again.</li>
            <li> These smell great but we stopped using as much after learning how the smoke can be harmful to your health. Be sure to ventilate the areas you burn them in - especially if you have kids! :)</li>
            <li> These all smell smell the same and don&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li> Legit incense, great scent choices, and cheap!</li>
            <li> Due to my skin condition, I&#x27;m very rarely able to bathe.  This leaves me with a pernicious and tempestuous odor which my boyfriend has described as &#x27;like dying&#x27;.  This set of fragrances not only took me back to my days in the dorms, but it also really helped with my problem.  I was a bit disappointed that it did not come with a patchouli flavor.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that after setting it on fire, it creates strong smells, but the actual process of lighting it is very easy, and as long as I use these outdoors with a fan on, the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I would definitely recommend this product if you like using a lighter and are outdoors.</li>
