            <li>Really great foundation!!</li>

            <li>They gave me very good service.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was great as always.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happy with your order!</li>
            <li>It is so good that you can apply it with your fingers</li>
            <li>If you have a light skin tone this BB cream would be perfect for you!</li>
            <li>The color is very light which is nice because I am very fair and have had difficulty finding a bb cream that matches my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>This product made my skintone even , took away the redness, made my pores invisible (and I have very large noticible pores) and this product is just perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency for my oily skin and, more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>This is a very good quality product, it blend in very well and has a very nice tint.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend to all!</li>
            <li>And the one thing I really love about it is the fact that it does not irritate my skin!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re sparing with it, (I wasn&#x27;t, it felt so nice</li>
            <li>It oxidizes nicely.</li>
            <li>I have purchased all the drugstore ones too and this is by far THE BEST.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a red-head with very fair and sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m hooked on this product.</li>
            <li>Plus, it applies (and moisturizes) more like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>but it is not my favorite</li>
            <li>This product works great and blends really well with my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this bb cream and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>and i love the coverage without the weight.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear this...from strangers on the street, to family and friends..</li>
            <li>I love this bb cream.</li>
            <li>This is great and dont worry they sell the real one.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased that it does not rub off easily.</li>
            <li>A little gray to start which gave me pause but oxidized to perfectly match my skin tone (m.a.c. nc25).  </li>
            <li>, I just wish it came paraben free.  </li>
            <li>I 100% recommend the Skin79 product, and as long as you do your seller research and make sure they have good feedback</li>
            <li>Great product love the coverage but dosent feel heavy.</li>
            <li>Order right from the skin79 website and save ur money!</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel as good on my skin as either of the other two.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and gets red very easily!</li>
            <li>At first the color didn&#x27;t match my face at all</li>
            <li>but since I have only been using Korean products my face has gotten lighter and brighter and now it looks better on me.</li>
            <li>but maybe it&#x27;s because my skin is kind of pink</li>
            <li>It gives you the illusion that there&#x27;s a lot more in there than there actually is.  </li>
            <li>Considering I&#x27;m pretty rosy underneath, the gray offsets my rosy undertones.</li>
            <li>even several makeup artists and estheticians have commented on how healthy and radiant my skin looks while I&#x27;m wearing this.</li>
            <li>so it really won&#x27;t look good if you have a medium to dark skin tone.</li>
            <li>it is super light and despite the fact that i am pale, it is still loo light.</li>
            <li>but this one is real thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing Skin79 Hot Pink for about 5 years now and I love it.</li>
            <li>The consistency is very creamy, It feels like a moisturizer when it goes on.</li>
            <li>every one of them has been the real SKIN79 product.</li>
            <li>It really does blend in well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has improved so much after using this that I no longer put concealer on every day.</li>
            <li>If you want the real deal don&#x27;t risk it.</li>
            <li>Skin79 hot pink covers really well, almost like foundation but feels light and never ever irritated my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I live in florida, so it gets so hot and even when I sweat this makeup does not run or rub off.</li>
            <li>This, like the others is easy to dispense and only takes a partial pump to supply an ample amount of makeup to cover and smooth my complexion.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and black dyed hair and blue eyes.</li>
            <li>I am a minimalist when it comes to applying makeup and have always used a dry facecloth to lightly remove excess makeup after applying it.  </li>
            <li>It oxidizes to match skin tone very very well, looks natural and gives me that soft dewy coverage I like so much.</li>
            <li>Very light everyday coverage.</li>
            <li>It actually feels GOOD to put on, relieves redness and irritation and just gives me an overall even tone that I can&#x27;t seem to get with other products from the US.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pink version does tend to be very dewy, so if you want a more matte look, I suggest getting one of the BB powder pacts to set it, or trying one of the versions that&#x27;s less dewy.</li>
            <li>As previous stated in other reviews the color is kind of gray</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Evens out my skin and not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>This foundation is very moisturizing and blends in well with Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li>At first it was grey but it matches your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on evenly and a perfect base for any makeup.  </li>
            <li>The product has a very grey tone to it at first, but don&#x27;t let that deter you.</li>
            <li>I wish the whole bottle was full of it, that way it would last a little</li>
            <li>Most times the cloth would have a noticeable amount of makeup on it but with this Skin79 Hot Pink BB Cream there is hardly any color that rubs off.  </li>
            <li>The fakes have a much more liquid-y consistency and far worse color/coverage/quality control.</li>
            <li>It feels like a moisturizer on the skin, and does not dry it out!</li>
            <li>I recently ran out and am using Skinfood&#x27;s Aloe Sun BB Cream which is much lighter and doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;The only issue I have is how BIG the bottle is V.S. how little product is actually in there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with this seller for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> There also is a lot of product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Now I know there is a lot of talk about real vs fake BB creams on Amazon, but as far as I can tell most of these are legit.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try one of the other Skin79 Creams next.</li>
            <li> There is about 2 1/2 inches of empty space in all the pink plastic, and about 1 inch of actual product.</li>
            <li> Looks a little gray initially, but if you pat it on, it&#x27;ll oxidize and match your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I buy this Skin79 Pink over and over again.</li>
            <li> It is thick and long lasting.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way though, so</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> Other products would cause my skin to itch or sting, and cause breakouts and pimples.</li>
            <li> This last time I went with another seller who had marked it down slightly cheaper but the bottle I received was totally fake.</li>
            <li> color is too dark to me</li>
            <li> fake do not buy this is not the real product.</li>
            <li> Other people have complained that it goes a little grey</li>
            <li> it should last you at least a few months.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I got the Hologram Pearl powder pact, its a little sparkly</li>
            <li> Wasted my money trying to save a $1.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday moisturizer/foundation.  </li>
            <li> I do notice it seems to make me really pale</li>
            <li> I have always purchased my makeup from the drugstore and usually wore Loreal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, matches my skin tone well, and doesn&#x27;t look like makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other expensive brands and this one beats them all!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never experienced that</li>
            <li> * broken out.</li>
            <li> Some are fakes, so be wary.</li>
            <li> Its a fake one iam so upset wait for a hole month for fake bb</li>
            <li> That is a plus for me because I really hate to see makeup on a persons clothes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really great foundation!! I&#x27;ve tried other expensive brands and this one beats them all!</li>
            <li> I have purchased just about every BB cream on the market. I have purchased all the drugstore ones too and this is by far THE BEST.  I have fair skin and black dyed hair and blue eyes. My skin is very sensitive and gets red very easily! This product made my skintone even , took away the redness, made my pores invisible (and I have very large noticible pores) and this product is just perfect. I live in florida, so it gets so hot and even when I sweat this makeup does not run or rub off. The consistency is very creamy, It feels like a moisturizer when it goes on. It is so good that you can apply it with your fingers but I apply mine with a brush! A definite must try!</li>
            <li> The only concealer I wear, or want to wear. It&#x27;s subtle, matches my skin tone well, and doesn&#x27;t look like makeup. Plus, it applies (and moisturizes) more like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered this several times from Amazon, from different suppliers. Some are fakes, so be wary. The fakes have a much more liquid-y consistency and far worse color/coverage/quality control.</li>
            <li> I recently started using Korean skin care products and makeup. As previous stated in other reviews the color is kind of gray so it really won&#x27;t look good if you have a medium to dark skin tone. At first the color didn&#x27;t match my face at all but since I have only been using Korean products my face has gotten lighter and brighter and now it looks better on me. If you have a light skin tone this BB cream would be perfect for you!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from KATE THE BABE before and every one of them has been the real SKIN79 product. I&#x27;m sticking with this seller for as long as I can. This last time I went with another seller who had marked it down slightly cheaper but the bottle I received was totally fake. Wasted my money trying to save a $1. I tossed that one out immediately and got another one from her. Shipping was great as always. Thank you KATE.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Korean BB cream makeup that I purchased and am reviewing. I have always purchased my makeup from the drugstore and usually wore Loreal.  I don&#x27;t know why I decided to try these Korean BB creams but I&#x27;m glad I did. I like this product and like the way my skin looks when I&#x27;m wearing it but it is not my favorite and I can&#x27;t explain why.  It just doesn&#x27;t feel as good on my skin as either of the other two. This, like the others is easy to dispense and only takes a partial pump to supply an ample amount of makeup to cover and smooth my complexion. It really does blend in well and I am pleased that it does not rub off easily. I am a minimalist when it comes to applying makeup and have always used a dry facecloth to lightly remove excess makeup after applying it.  Most times the cloth would have a noticeable amount of makeup on it but with this Skin79 Hot Pink BB Cream there is hardly any color that rubs off.  That is a plus for me because I really hate to see makeup on a persons clothes.</li>
            <li> This product works great and blends really well with my skin. I love it and would recommend to all! Thanks</li>
            <li> Beblesh cream: Sounds like something you put on a rash on a private part. But this one does the job well and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has improved so much after using this that I no longer put concealer on every day.</li>
            <li> Skin79 hot pink covers really well, almost like foundation but feels light and never ever irritated my super sensitive skin. The color is very light which is nice because I am very fair and have had difficulty finding a bb cream that matches my skin tone.  Other people have complained that it goes a little grey but I&#x27;ve never experienced that but maybe it&#x27;s because my skin is kind of pink and they neutralize eachother. I love this bb cream and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality product, it blend in very well and has a very nice tint.  They gave me very good service.  I do recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> eventually blends in with your skin…to a point. it is super light and despite the fact that i am pale, it is still loo light. regardless, it is a deal and it works and i love the coverage without the weight. i have sensitive skin and i have *never* broken out.</li>
            <li> Has been using this product close to 3 years, I will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> color is too dark to me</li>
            <li> A little gray to start which gave me pause but oxidized to perfectly match my skin tone (m.a.c. nc25).  This is my everyday moisturizer/foundation.  Evens out my skin and not heavy at all.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m a red-head with very fair and sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m hooked on this product. It oxidizes to match skin tone very very well, looks natural and gives me that soft dewy coverage I like so much. It feels like a moisturizer on the skin, and does not dry it out! And the one thing I really love about it is the fact that it does not irritate my skin! Other products would cause my skin to itch or sting, and cause breakouts and pimples. It actually feels GOOD to put on, relieves redness and irritation and just gives me an overall even tone that I can&#x27;t seem to get with other products from the US.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the American BB creams...blech. They are just greasy tinted moisturizers, and they all made me break out! :(&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because it actually improves your skin, and doesn&#x27;t exacerbate problems.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is how BIG the bottle is V.S. how little product is actually in there. It gives you the illusion that there&#x27;s a lot more in there than there actually is.  There is about 2 1/2 inches of empty space in all the pink plastic, and about 1 inch of actual product. I wish the whole bottle was full of it, that way it would last a little longer!&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way though, so if you&#x27;re sparing with it, (I wasn&#x27;t, it felt so nice I just slapped it on all the time) it should last you at least a few months.&lt;br /&gt;This Pink version does tend to be very dewy, so if you want a more matte look, I suggest getting one of the BB powder pacts to set it, or trying one of the versions that&#x27;s less dewy. I got the Hologram Pearl powder pact, its a little sparkly but I like it. ^_^</li>
            <li> This foundation is very moisturizing and blends in well with Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li> Item as described, thank you.</li>
            <li> And has the same coverage as Mac. Looks a little gray initially, but if you pat it on, it&#x27;ll oxidize and match your skin tone. Considering I&#x27;m pretty rosy underneath, the gray offsets my rosy undertones.</li>
            <li> I like the product, I just wish it came paraben free.  Not a fan of putting parabens on my skin.</li>
            <li> fake do not buy this is not the real product. If you want the real deal don&#x27;t risk it. Order right from the skin79 website and save ur money!</li>
            <li> Its a fake one iam so upset wait for a hole month for fake bb</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my beauty regimine.  Excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing Skin79 Hot Pink for about 5 years now and I love it. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency for my oily skin and, more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t break me out. The product has a very grey tone to it at first, but don&#x27;t let that deter you. Within 5-10 minutes it will adjust to match your skintone. I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear this...from strangers on the street, to family and friends..even several makeup artists and estheticians have commented on how healthy and radiant my skin looks while I&#x27;m wearing this. It&#x27;s definitely a staple in my collection. Now I know there is a lot of talk about real vs fake BB creams on Amazon, but as far as I can tell most of these are legit. I haven&#x27;t noticed any differences in product, packaging or performance with any of the orders I&#x27;ve places. I 100% recommend the Skin79 product, and as long as you do your seller research and make sure they have good feedback I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happy with your order!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy this BB and it is definitely a part of my daily routine. It creamy and absorbs without feeling tacky or thick.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on evenly and a perfect base for any makeup.  There also is a lot of product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I buy this Skin79 Pink over and over again. I get a lot of compliments. It is thick and long lasting. I do notice it seems to make me really pale but I still keep buying it. I recently ran out and am using Skinfood&#x27;s Aloe Sun BB Cream which is much lighter and doesn&#x27;t last as long. I think I&#x27;ll try one of the other Skin79 Creams next.</li>
            <li> Great product love the coverage but dosent feel heavy. Blends well</li>
            <li> Very light everyday coverage. Never makes me break out!</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream. At first it was grey but it matches your skin. It oxidizes nicely. This is great and dont worry they sell the real one. They dont put the authentication sticker anymore but this one is real thank you so much!</li>
