            <li>I Love this cleanser!!!!</li>
            <li>excellent product...</li>
            <li>I use this every time I wash my hair (2-3 days) and that seems to be perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>The product is the best for me.</li>
            <li>So much of a better deal to get the 24 oz!!!</li>

            <li>Product was received as described and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for skin even if you don&#x27;t have acne.  </li>
            <li>and we are using it on our body as well as our face with great results.</li>
            <li>Great shipping</li>

            <li>fair price.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say it came quickly and everything on the business end was great no complaints.</li>
            <li>so the \\&quot;super size\\&quot; was a great find.</li>
            <li>This is a good, fine grain exfoliant</li>
            <li>I have tried many face cleansers and this is by far the best for acne.</li>
            <li>The product shipped quickly and was a good deal as compared to the kiosk at the mall.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>I ordered two days ago - selected free shipping, and still got it today!</li>
            <li>and I love the product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love the size of this product.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for me, since I only seem to go through about one bottle a year!</li>
            <li>Love ProActiv.</li>
            <li>AWESOME product and only thing I use.</li>
            <li>It looks nothing like the original picture!</li>
            <li>I have used this product before, and, it was/is an excellent way to resolve acne problems when used with the other Proactive products.  </li>
            <li>Order shipped very quickly and arrived the day before the delivery window.</li>
            <li>Proactiv has definately kept my skin pimple &amp; blemish free.</li>
            <li>If you have never-ending acne, light or heavy..just f-ing try it.</li>
            <li>My one main concern about Proactive is the cost of the products, and, Amazon.com is the best way I&#x27;ve found to get the specific items I need.</li>
            <li>I have compaired the prices of these products of proactive against the products of the original site of proactive...  </li>
            <li>- people say it is stronger than the Original Renewing Cleanser</li>
            <li>all the testimonies are true.</li>
            <li>it came quick and</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>company shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and does a fair job of cleaning my skin.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv Solution Deep Cleansing Wash 24 Oz is SO MUCH CHEAPER and is amazing</li>
            <li>i save a couple of dollars for the bigger size and it is nice not to have to buy it as often since i don&#x27;t go to the mall very often.</li>
            <li>Once I started Pro-Active it all changed and I know enjoy clear skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this bigger bottle because it lasts me forever.</li>
            <li>When you use it in the shower you can really rinse it so it doesn&#x27;t stain your towels!</li>
            <li>I first used proactiv when I was 16</li>
            <li>this is the first time i ordered it from amazon.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier buying through Amazon</li>
            <li>you end up with way too much product.  </li>
            <li>All these reviews have been very informative to me....</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think the medicated aspect really works for my type of acne.</li>
            <li>You have to buy the whole kit.</li>
            <li>It was not the REAL Proactiv Renewing Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I took it with me to a REAL Proactiv vendor in my mall</li>
            <li>Thanks Proactive.</li>
            <li>i was cautious about the different sized bottle, but when i read other reviews that going with a bigger bottle is better, since you get more for your dollar, i decided to go ahead.</li>
            <li>I go through the regular size bottles quickly</li>
            <li>These prices are outrageously high.</li>
            <li>Just to add a little more information, the 4oz costs $12.95, the step 3 which is the repairing treatment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new product now because I won&#x27;t be bullied into buying something I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>Every time I think I want to try something new</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>ProActiv was the first product she ever tried that actually worked!  </li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s even safe, and I wonder if it is truly a Proactiv brand product.</li>
            <li>First thing I bought that actually cleared up my face.  </li>
            <li>I too got sucked into the Proactiv campaign for clear skin.</li>
            <li>To make that clear.</li>
            <li>I have been using proactive for several years - it works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>Completely clears my face up.</li>
            <li>Use old towels that can be bleached.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only thing that has every really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I&#x27;ve ever had about ProActive has been the price, but I&#x27;ve never been comfortable spending much on beauty supplies.</li>
            <li>The cost was the same as buying direct.</li>
            <li>Item was as described, however it seemed a little different in texture as my previous ones I ordered from the actual proactiv website were more grainy.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think i will be purchasing this item from amazon again - extremely misleading (store said new) -</li>
            <li>Despite me trying to save money by using many other less expensive products, ProActiv always wins.</li>

            <li> Despite me trying to save money by using many other less expensive products, ProActiv always wins.</li>
            <li> And no, I am not a proactive rep....just a woman who does   not like to pay high prices if I can obtain them for less elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who is responsible, but expired product is UNACCEPTABLE.</li>
            <li> Not sure why other reviewers said they didnt get the right size.</li>
            <li> Proactive is great, albeit expensive, but at least buying it here saves a few bucks...</li>
            <li> Granted the 6 oz bottle is a lot larger than the other Proactiv products, but the whopping 24 oz is a must.</li>
            <li> I dont know what the other reviewers were saying when they said they did not recieve a 6oz cleanser, and only a 4oz cleanser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the other two steps, only the cleanser</li>
            <li> The two 1 oz bottles of clarifying cleaner contain a different active ingredient and will NOT work for me.     </li>
            <li> When I stop using it, I get blackheads which was never really a problem with my skin before use.</li>
            <li> I recently   purchased Proactiv from Amazon.com and it completely dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for a few years now, and the bottle is different from all the other Proactiv cleansers I have used.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected, and though the product amount is the same, I am not sure that I would have paid $34.50 for three mini-bottles.</li>
            <li> It has helped my pour size and other blemishes on my skin reduce</li>
            <li> I am just another voice and there will be people  out there that will disregard this, but for those of you that depend on Proactive to keep our faces clean of those  ugly lil&#x27; visitors &amp; to save on cost, I do suggest to   become a proactive member, you can adjust your shipments to YOUR liking, they are flexable with the months in which you would like your shipment to be sent and as   well as with the items you prefer.</li>
            <li> The shipping is less than   $5.95 if one item is ordered, $5.95 if three items are ordered.</li>
            <li> I have come onto this site to compare prices, IF in case they were less.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals is less drying than Proactiv and much less abrasive while getting my skin 10x cleaner looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> this product came within a few days.</li>
            <li> i thought maybe there was a chance that the bottle would have a seal broken or something, since it&#x27;s not a standard size, but it came sealed with a plastic outer covering and everything.</li>
            <li> Started working within a few days of beginning use.</li>
            <li> A few days of using and dryness was gone as well as the blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all the exfoliant grains are just stuck at the bottom of the bottle or what, but it was a lot softer than usual.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but I would be bothered by significant breakouts once a month.</li>
            <li> when in fact they shipped 2 samples and another very small bottle of the face wash.</li>
            <li> So with that said I&#x27;m a little skeptical on the authenticity of this product.</li>
            <li> Helps with difficult to treat acne it just ruins your towels!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it went bad, but since I just was out of the other one I could tell a bid difference that I had to hold nose to try it.</li>
            <li> The product I received was FAKE.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re desperate, try a milder cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am actually afraid to use it/</li>
            <li> The product is very questionable.</li>
            <li> It was so bad I cannot use it.</li>
            <li> I just opened this cleanser yesterday as I was out of mine and the smell was horrible.</li>
            <li> awful!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Pro-Active for years...all the testimonies are true. I struggled for years and felt embarrassed about my face during the best years of life. Once I started Pro-Active it all changed and I know enjoy clear skin.  I love this bigger bottle because it lasts me forever. I am at the point where I just wash my face at night and only use the astringent sometimes.  It&#x27;s so much easier buying through Amazon then Pro-Active themselves.....you end up with way too much product.  This size is great for those who don&#x27;t want to order al the time....company shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> All these reviews have been very informative to me....I have compaired the prices of these products of proactive against the products of the original site of proactive...  the price of the 6oz Step 1 which is the renewing cleanser is $19.95, once you become a member and there is no cost to become a member. The shipping is less than   $5.95 if one item is ordered, $5.95 if three items are ordered. Just to add a little more information, the 4oz costs $12.95, the step 3 which is the repairing treatment,  2oz is priced at $16.95 and the 3.5oz is priced at $24.95. Of course if you are not a member, which costs nothing to become a member, it will cost you almost double   the price. I have come onto this site to compare prices, IF in case they were less. These prices are outrageously high. I am just another voice and there will be people  out there that will disregard this, but for those of you that depend on Proactive to keep our faces clean of those  ugly lil&#x27; visitors &amp; to save on cost, I do suggest to   become a proactive member, you can adjust your shipments to YOUR liking, they are flexable with the months in which you would like your shipment to be sent and as   well as with the items you prefer. (example: 1 reapair lotin and 2 renewal cleansers as a kit or just one item). And no, I am not a proactive rep....just a woman who does   not like to pay high prices if I can obtain them for less elsewhere.</li>
            <li> this product came within a few days. delivery was great. i was cautious about the different sized bottle, but when i read other reviews that going with a bigger bottle is better, since you get more for your dollar, i decided to go ahead. i thought maybe there was a chance that the bottle would have a seal broken or something, since it&#x27;s not a standard size, but it came sealed with a plastic outer covering and everything. i didn&#x27;t bother to comment on the proactive product itself, since if you&#x27;re considering buying this big bottle, you probably already know if proactiv works for you.</li>
            <li> I Love this cleanser!!!! I have been using proactiv for a year and I love it! I buy the big sizes because they last longer. Proactiv has definately kept my skin pimple &amp; blemish free.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Proactiv. This is the only thing that has EVER worked for me. Since I was a teenager I have struggled with acne and nothing helped till this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Product was received as described and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Proactive is great, albeit expensive, but at least buying it here saves a few bucks... I&#x27;d recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it came quickly and everything on the business end was great no complaints. I just opened this cleanser yesterday as I was out of mine and the smell was horrible. It smelled like rotting wood. I am not sure if it went bad, but since I just was out of the other one I could tell a bid difference that I had to hold nose to try it. It was so bad I cannot use it. I guess I am going to have to see how to return it now.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife, who has had a problem with acne for years.  ProActiv was the first product she ever tried that actually worked!  She couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> excellent product...I go through the regular size bottles quickly so the \\&quot;super size\\&quot; was a great find. fair price. shipped as promised.</li>
            <li> I too got sucked into the Proactiv campaign for clear skin. I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but I would be bothered by significant breakouts once a month. I quit using their entire line and switched to SkinCeuticals clarifying cleanser. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. My skin has NEVER looked better!! SkinCeuticals is less drying than Proactiv and much less abrasive while getting my skin 10x cleaner looking and feeling. I have had 2 zits in 3 months. I&#x27;ll never go back to Proactiv.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for skin even if you don&#x27;t have acne.  It has helped my pour size and other blemishes on my skin reduce</li>
            <li> This is a good, fine grain exfoliant but I don&#x27;t think the medicated aspect really works for my type of acne. When I stop using it, I get blackheads which was never really a problem with my skin before use. Unless you&#x27;re desperate, try a milder cleanser.</li>
            <li> Proactiv Solution Deep Cleansing Wash 24 Oz is SO MUCH CHEAPER and is amazing - people say it is stronger than the Original Renewing Cleanser but it seems to be the same and we are using it on our body as well as our face with great results. So much of a better deal to get the 24 oz!!! Never again will I pay $30 for a 6 oz bottle! Granted the 6 oz bottle is a lot larger than the other Proactiv products, but the whopping 24 oz is a must.</li>
            <li> I dont know what the other reviewers were saying when they said they did not recieve a 6oz cleanser, and only a 4oz cleanser. I ordered two days ago - selected free shipping, and still got it today! Great shipping and I love the product. I got the 6 OUNCE one. To make that clear. Not sure why other reviewers said they didnt get the right size. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love proactiv products, unfortunately the store that i purchased from on amazon said this was for a 6 oz item - when in fact they shipped 2 samples and another very small bottle of the face wash. i don&#x27;t think i will be purchasing this item from amazon again - extremely misleading (store said new) - and you dont know what you are getting. awful!!! buyers beware!!!</li>
            <li> The product was out of date when it was shipped to me. I&#x27;m not sure who is responsible, but expired product is UNACCEPTABLE. The cost was the same as buying direct.</li>
            <li> I have tried many face cleansers and this is by far the best for acne. I have come back to this again and again over the years. I don&#x27;t use the other two steps, only the cleanser and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using ProActiv for 15+ years. Despite me trying to save money by using many other less expensive products, ProActiv always wins. If you have never-ending acne, light or heavy..just f-ing try it. If you use it properly, it will work. Twice a day. Follow the directions. You will have great skin. Go ahead. Just do it....go on...you know you want to...or you wouldn&#x27;t still be reading this...</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair (2-3 days) and that seems to be perfect for my skin. When you use it in the shower you can really rinse it so it doesn&#x27;t stain your towels!</li>
            <li> Is working great for son. Started working within a few days of beginning use. It&#x27;s not drying out his skin.</li>
            <li> Order shipped very quickly and arrived the day before the delivery window. However, I ordered one 6 oz. bottle of renewing cleanser and received three 2 oz. bottles instead. Not exactly what I expected, and though the product amount is the same, I am not sure that I would have paid $34.50 for three mini-bottles.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the product that works for me and I&#x27;m satisfied with it. It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it is worth trying and giving at least 60 days to decide if it is improving acne. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Package came in about 4 business days. Item was as described, however it seemed a little different in texture as my previous ones I ordered from the actual proactiv website were more grainy. I&#x27;m not sure if all the exfoliant grains are just stuck at the bottom of the bottle or what, but it was a lot softer than usual. So with that said I&#x27;m a little skeptical on the authenticity of this product. However, it does smell and look like proactive. I wouldn&#x27;t be too worried about it though. Generous sized bottle and does the job.</li>
            <li> I first used proactiv when I was 16 and I couldn&#x27;t remeber why I stopped. I recently   purchased Proactiv from Amazon.com and it completely dried my skin out. Now I see why I stopped using it years ago.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this product.  It lasts a long time and does a fair job of cleaning my skin.  The product arrived as advertised and in great shape.  All in all, I will definitely purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item (6 oz. renewing cleanser) and I was sent a 4 oz. renewing cleanser and two bottles of 1 oz clarifying cleaners.  This is NOT the same item.  The two 1 oz bottles of clarifying cleaner contain a different active ingredient and will NOT work for me.     What a rip off.</li>
            <li> I have been using proactive for several years - it works really well for me.  this is the first time i ordered it from amazon.  it came quick and i like that it comes in 6 oz - i save a couple of dollars for the bigger size and it is nice not to have to buy it as often since i don&#x27;t go to the mall very often.</li>
            <li> The product is very questionable. It looks nothing like the original picture! I have been using Proactiv for a few years now, and the bottle is different from all the other Proactiv cleansers I have used. The cleanser it&#x27;s self is different in texture and smell. I am actually afraid to use it/ not sure if it&#x27;s even safe, and I wonder if it is truly a Proactiv brand product. Never again will I buy something like this.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Arrived quickly. It seems to be the same product they sell at the booths in malls, and through the subscription service, only without a subscription! Perfect for me, since I only seem to go through about one bottle a year!</li>
            <li> The product is the best for me. Completely clears my face up. The reason I bought it here is they don&#x27;t sell it in there vending machines anymore. You have to buy the whole kit. I&#x27;m looking for a new product now because I won&#x27;t be bullied into buying something I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> I like proactive products. Helps with difficult to treat acne it just ruins your towels! Use old towels that can be bleached.</li>
            <li> I ordered Proactiv Renewing Cleanser through this seller.  The product I received was FAKE. It was not the REAL Proactiv Renewing Cleanser.  I took it with me to a REAL Proactiv vendor in my mall and she told me it was FAKE, to stop using it and be sure to return it. It didn&#x27;t even have the same ingredients and the bottle was different. DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it&#x27;s the only thing that has every really helped my skin. I&#x27;ve tried everything from over the counter washes and creams to prescription pills and creams and nothing has worked as well. Every time I think I want to try something new I&#x27;m back to using ProActive by the end of the week. The only complaint I&#x27;ve ever had about ProActive has been the price, but I&#x27;ve never been comfortable spending much on beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly and was a good deal as compared to the kiosk at the mall.  Seems to work the same</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, and, it was/is an excellent way to resolve acne problems when used with the other Proactive products.  My one main concern about Proactive is the cost of the products, and, Amazon.com is the best way I&#x27;ve found to get the specific items I need.</li>
            <li> Love ProActiv. First thing I bought that actually cleared up my face.  The drying out of skin is just in the beginning.  A few days of using and dryness was gone as well as the blemishes.  AWESOME product and only thing I use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.  Unless I want to look like I&#x27;m wearing the surface of Mars, I have to have it.  Thanks Proactive.</li>
