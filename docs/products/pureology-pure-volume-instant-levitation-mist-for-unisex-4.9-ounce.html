            <li> It makes my baby fine hair look thick.  </li>
            <li> I returned the product to the place I had bought it from and they told me that they have had several other similar comments.  </li>
            <li> Tried it on damp and dry hair, but no success.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It left my hair a little sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> When sprayed on wet hair it becomes a sticky tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this product from my salon and was currently using it when I found it on Amazon for half the price!!</li>
            <li> It does give my hair volume yet does not weight it down.</li>
            <li> It has a odd euculyptus odor which remains in the hair even overpowering hair spray.  </li>
            <li> As previous responders have said, it leaves my hair a sticky mess</li>
            <li> It was sticky and hard to get my brush through as I was drying my hair and it gave it absolutely NO volume.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Why mess with something that works!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> My hair was flat and horrible after my first use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair sticky,stiff and dull.</li>
            <li> Worse, it does not thicken at all and leaves hair completely dull and stringy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  </li>

            <li> Bought this because it is phosphate ffree it isn&#x27;t heavy at all. It&#x27;s ok but not what I am looking for...</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of their thickening spray before they changed the formula and came out with this Pure Volume Levitation Mist.  It&#x27;s awful.  I have very fine &amp; thin hair.  It was sticky and hard to get my brush through as I was drying my hair and it gave it absolutely NO volume.  I returned the product to the place I had bought it from and they told me that they have had several other similar comments.  Bring back the old formula please!</li>
            <li> The product is different from the original formular but it is fine. It has more scent than before but I do not find that objectable. Overall  I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This was shipped very quickly from the seller.  I am not crazy about the product as I feel it makes my hair slightly tacky, but it holds really well.</li>
            <li> You had a fabulous product.  When I found it I was thrilled that FINALLY I had a product that worked on my fine color treated hair.  I got many compliments.  You changed the packaging, but you say that the formula remained the same. It does not react the same way at all on my hair.  As previous responders have said, it leaves my hair a sticky mess and I will no longer recommend or buy your products.  Why mess with something that works!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair sticky,stiff and dull. Tried it on damp and dry hair, but no success.  Would definitely not recommend spending $20 on this product!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  When sprayed on wet hair it becomes a sticky tangled mess.  It has a odd euculyptus odor which remains in the hair even overpowering hair spray.  Worse, it does not thicken at all and leaves hair completely dull and stringy.  My hair was flat and horrible after my first use. The Pure Volume Thickening Spray was wonderful and worked whereas the Levitation Spray does not.  Money in the trash can.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  My hairdresser used it on my hair and I just had to have some.  It makes my baby fine hair look thick.  I LOVE IT!!  And, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  Just nice full soft hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve used in ages.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes my thin hair look so much better!</li>

            <li> It left my hair a little sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy for my fine hair.  Gives me the needed lift without being sticky. Pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this product from my salon and was currently using it when I found it on Amazon for half the price!!

            <li> I love this hair care product. It does give my hair volume yet does not weight it down.</li>
            <li> I have very straight, thin, fine hair. I have tried so many products and most end up being a waste of money. I love this product! It&#x27;s a pump and not an aerosol. I also love that pureology doesn&#x27;t use all of the chemicals that other brands do. My salon sells this for $25 and I paid $15 on Amazon. It definitely adds volume without leaving a lot of residue.</li>
