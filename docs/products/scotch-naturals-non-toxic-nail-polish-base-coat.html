    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The tacky finish attracts lint and dirt, which is not the best look.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent foundation for Scotch nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors - and no fumes!</li>
            <li>I was nervous because of the price, but am very happy with the quality of the polish.</li>
            <li>Colored coats glide over it beautifully and stay put.  </li>
            <li>It looks great going on, but never, ever, ever, ever dries.</li>
            <li>: I am a Scotch Naturals convert and enthusiastic supporter!  </li>
            <li>Color is great, stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>You walk around with sticky nails until you can&#x27;t stand it any more and just remove</li>
            <li>That probably is great for holding polish in place, but I was looking for something clear to wear on its own.</li>
            <li>So, but the top coat if you want something to wear alone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to invest in their polish and top coat as well.</li>
            <li>I have become Scotch Naturals&#x27; number one fan, and I want other health-conscious consumers to know that it&#x27;s an excellent product, BUT IT MUST BE APPLIED CORRECTLY.</li>
            <li>I put it on &amp; it wasn&#x27;t smooth, looked cheaped, &amp; pealed off!-FireCracker</li>
            <li>This product is okay, but it has a really tacky finish.</li>
            <li>I opened the nail polish and was greeted with a jar full of goo the consistency of a marshmallow.  </li>
            <li>The product has strong chemical smell and doesnt has the original label, only a bar code label.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the high price, but bought it anyway thinking I would get my moneys worth for not having harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>It looks good and lasts for about a week or two with me being very active and barefoot in the summer.</li>
            <li>My polish looks great for 4-5 days, which is a new record for me, because solvent-based polishes always peeled and cracked on me within a few days.</li>
            <li>This excellent and NON-TOXIC base coat applies evenly, flows smoothly, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, packaged very well in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>And my lungs are much happier also.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I found that this does not dry quickly,</li>
            <li>I finally made the jump to a healthier nail polish when I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last a day - scratches right off.  </li>
            <li>This base coat is step 1 in having a perfect all natural nail polish experience!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product itself or if what I bought from the seller was just old...</li>
            <li>Seems pretty limited to me.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;ll never last as long as regular nail polish - the fact that I&#x27;m not seeping chemicals into my body and smelling that nail polish smell is worth it!</li>
            <li>At first  I did my own thing, used another brand&#x27;s base coat (safe but not water-based), didn&#x27;t follow directions, and got nail polish that peeled right off, as other SN reviewers have complained.</li>
            <li>I had to learn new techniques for water-based polish, but it actually takes me LESS TIME now to do my nails because the water evaporates so fast and the polish is dry!</li>
            <li>Good idea, but bad product.  </li>

            <li> Good idea, but bad product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;AT NIGHT, BEFORE BED, I buffed my nails to make the surface as smooth as I could; I applied base coat, 2 coats color, and top coat, waiting only a few minutes in between coats as directed.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this nail polish brand chips in really odd places (see pics) even when I applied the top coat daily.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed since the polish dries very quickly, colors are rich and saturated, and there is no smell.</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t used non-toxic&#x27;s in the past, this is new to me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it as a base coat usually is used--to give a clear coating, natural shinny look, to fill in dimples and ridges giving a smooth appearance, to fortify my natural nails, without color.</li>
            <li> can see that other users have assumed that this polish is just like solvent-based polish, but it isn&#x27;t: it works entirely differently.</li>
            <li> This base takes forever to dry and peels off in warm water.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a set that had this base coat, three colors, and the top coat.</li>
            <li> is very thin, rubs off fast, and dirt and lint actually stick to it--even days after applying it.</li>
            <li> It certainly is not worth the money...save it.</li>
            <li> But it is hard as rocks ONLY after a few hours and should not be exposed to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I knew I was in trouble.  </li>
            <li> this is only designed to be used as a base coat and not worn as a clear polish.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat!  </li>
            <li> But this stuff was hard as rocks after it cured overnight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NO ODOR, NO TOXINS, DRIES IN MINUTES, HARD FINISH</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed so far, but will continue to give it a try--at least until the bottle is used up.</li>
            <li> THIS STICKY BASE COAT DOES NOT DRY AND CAN&#x27;T BE WORN ALONE!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Nail polish arrived dried up and useless.</li>
            <li> This base coat is the ONLY way you will have Scotch Naturals nail color longer than 2 days.</li>
            <li> When this base is used a second color coat is optional in my experience.  </li>
            <li> received bottle dried up and unusable... twice.  :(</li>
            <li> Do not skip this step or you will be sorry!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is absolutely useless!  </li>
            <li> I am so mad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a non-toxic nail polish line and decided to start with this Base Coat.</li>
            <li> (And, she doesn&#x27;t get complaints about Mom getting sick when she does her nails anymore!)  </li>

            <li> This base coat is step 1 in having a perfect all natural nail polish experience! Do not skip this step or you will be sorry!</li>
            <li> Nail polish arrived dried up and useless.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this purchase. It looks great going on, but never, ever, ever, ever dries. You walk around with sticky nails until you can&#x27;t stand it any more and just remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible this is only designed to be used as a base coat and not worn as a clear polish. If that&#x27;s the case ... what&#x27;s up with that? Seems pretty limited to me.</li>
            <li> I have become Scotch Naturals&#x27; number one fan, and I want other health-conscious consumers to know that it&#x27;s an excellent product, BUT IT MUST BE APPLIED CORRECTLY. At first  I did my own thing, used another brand&#x27;s base coat (safe but not water-based), didn&#x27;t follow directions, and got nail polish that peeled right off, as other SN reviewers have complained. Then I went to Scotch Naturals website and followed their directions to the letter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AT NIGHT, BEFORE BED, I buffed my nails to make the surface as smooth as I could; I applied base coat, 2 coats color, and top coat, waiting only a few minutes in between coats as directed. My polish looks great for 4-5 days, which is a new record for me, because solvent-based polishes always peeled and cracked on me within a few days. And I am talking about the more expensive brands like Mac and Clinique.  But this stuff was hard as rocks after it cured overnight. I did exercise caution and used gloves when I did dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see that other users have assumed that this polish is just like solvent-based polish, but it isn&#x27;t: it works entirely differently. THIS STICKY BASE COAT DOES NOT DRY AND CAN&#x27;T BE WORN ALONE!!!!!  I had to learn new techniques for water-based polish, but it actually takes me LESS TIME now to do my nails because the water evaporates so fast and the polish is dry! But it is hard as rocks ONLY after a few hours and should not be exposed to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO ODOR, NO TOXINS, DRIES IN MINUTES, HARD FINISH THAT LASTS (on properly prepared nails) AND STUNNINGLY-UNIQUE COLORS: I am a Scotch Naturals convert and enthusiastic supporter!  And my lungs are much happier also.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is absolutely useless!  I cleaned my nails throughly with alcohol before I tried the polish.  STILL the polish just bubbled up on my nails.  I will never buy this junk again!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, packaged very well in bubble wrap. Though it&#x27;ll never last as long as regular nail polish - the fact that I&#x27;m not seeping chemicals into my body and smelling that nail polish smell is worth it!</li>
            <li> This base coat is the ONLY way you will have Scotch Naturals nail color longer than 2 days.</li>
            <li> I am so mad I wasted my money on this product. I put it on &amp; it wasn&#x27;t smooth, looked cheaped, &amp; pealed off!-FireCracker</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but it has a really tacky finish. That probably is great for holding polish in place, but I was looking for something clear to wear on its own. The tacky finish attracts lint and dirt, which is not the best look. So, but the top coat if you want something to wear alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a non-toxic nail polish line and decided to start with this Base Coat. It worked very well. I&#x27;m going to invest in their polish and top coat as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last a day - scratches right off.  Good idea, but bad product.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money. I wish I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 1 star because it is unusable. I opened the nail polish and was greeted with a jar full of goo the consistency of a marshmallow.  When I had to pry the wand out which was attached to a giant wod of white marshmallow like glue I knew I was in trouble.  This product is totally unusable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product itself or if what I bought from the seller was just old...but this congealed after 3 months and is now unusable.</li>
            <li> Color is great, stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and arrived within the specified time frame.</li>
            <li> This base takes forever to dry and peels off in warm water.  It certainly is not worth the money...save it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times. I am disappointed so far, but will continue to give it a try--at least until the bottle is used up. I was looking for a non toxic polish.

I found that this does not dry quickly, is very thin, rubs off fast, and dirt and lint actually stick to it--even days after applying it. Not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This excellent and NON-TOXIC base coat applies evenly, flows smoothly, and dries quickly. It is an excellent foundation for Scotch nail polishes. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a set that had this base coat, three colors, and the top coat. Beautiful colors - and no fumes! unfortunately, this nail polish brand chips in really odd places (see pics) even when I applied the top coat daily. Very disappointed since the polish dries very quickly, colors are rich and saturated, and there is no smell.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give a review on this but it was shattered into pieces upon arrival...</li>
            <li> I love this base coat!  Colored coats glide over it beautifully and stay put.  When this base is used a second color coat is optional in my experience.  My teen daughter loves it too.  (And, she doesn&#x27;t get complaints about Mom getting sick when she does her nails anymore!)  We are into our second bottle and plan to reorder.</li>
            <li> The product has strong chemical smell and doesnt has the original label, only a bar code label. I&#x27;m allergic to the chemists and i had to take it right-away.</li>
            <li> received bottle dried up and unusable... twice.  :(</li>
            <li> I finally made the jump to a healthier nail polish when I found out I was pregnant. I was nervous because of the price, but am very happy with the quality of the polish. It looks good and lasts for about a week or two with me being very active and barefoot in the summer. I followed the instructions on the website and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
