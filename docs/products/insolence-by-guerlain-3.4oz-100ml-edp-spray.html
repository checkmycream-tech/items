            <li>Very Happy.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for firth time and i&#x27;am very happy with it!</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li>But this one is beautiful too.  </li>
            <li>I loved this scent from the moment I found it.</li>
            <li>Upon a hug everyone comments how good I smell.</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>I recommend it you will love this perfume!</li>
            <li>Worth the cost to me!!!</li>
            <li>I love Guerlain, and I think this is one of their best modern offerings.</li>
            <li>However I think I like the eau da toilette better than this one.  </li>
            <li>I love Insolence.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to wear this during colder months or in the evening, because of its opaque nature it feels a bit overwhelming in the heat.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and get compliments wherever I go.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance of all time.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this purchase - pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Not too strong either</li>
            <li>it was 100% genuine.  </li>
            <li>Now it is one of my favorite ,my sister paid twice more for the same one in a duty free store!</li>
            <li>I rather go to a store, pay some more and have the real deal.</li>
            <li>but everyone tells me it smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Guerlain is a very well-known perfume house; the only way to get a more lasting scent is to buy the perfume, which must cost a great deal more than the eau de parfum.</li>
            <li>I love that the violets last into the drydown, which is rare.</li>
            <li>My husband choose this product for me ten years ago and I have enjoyed wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased Insolence eau de parfum from Amazon and prefer it to Insolence eau de toilette because it lasts longer and is an interesting scent, with a middle note of violets, which I love.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and am using it for the last 6 years or so</li>
            <li>I was so worried this was going to stink, but it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Not as powdery as My Insolence, but it&#x27;s a very grown scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it</li>
            <li>The scent is a thoroughly modern take on an old theme though--</li>
            <li>lovely violets, bolstered by iris, berries, orange blossom, and the base, for me anyway, is mostly vanilla/tonka.</li>

            <li> it is old school in the sense that it has nuclear sillage, is quite complex, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This was expensive and next time I will not buy this item,time for a new perfume.</li>
            <li> Perfume is too weak and doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume everyday for years.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not for the faint of heart--</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this purchase.</li>

            <li> This is a beautiful feminine fragrance. However I think I like the eau da toilette better than this one.  But this one is beautiful too.  Just a lil different.</li>

            <li> This perfume is not for the faint of heart-- it is old school in the sense that it has nuclear sillage, is quite complex, and lasts forever.

            <li> I have worn this perfume everyday for years. The compliments never stop. Upon a hug everyone comments how good I smell. The perfume is not overbearing and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Perfume is too weak and doesn&#x27;t last at all.This was expensive and next time I will not buy this item,time for a new perfume.My girlfriend was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so worried this was going to stink, but it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Not as powdery as My Insolence, but it&#x27;s a very grown scent. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the cost and quality.  As it was a gift I wanted to insure it was 100% genuine.  Very Happy.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and get compliments wherever I go. I just love it!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Insolence eau de parfum from Amazon and prefer it to Insolence eau de toilette because it lasts longer and is an interesting scent, with a middle note of violets, which I love. I disagree with the person who was &amp;#34;disappointed&amp;#34; with this fragrance. Guerlain is a very well-known perfume house; the only way to get a more lasting scent is to buy the perfume, which must cost a great deal more than the eau de parfum. Very satisfied with this purchase - pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance of all time. I can&#x27;t really describe it but everyone tells me it smells fresh and clean. Not too strong either and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this purchase. I love this perfume and am using it for the last 6 years or so but this bottle definitely does not have the same intensity of scent. In fact I think it&#x27;s watered down considerably. Will never buy it on line again. I rather go to a store, pay some more and have the real deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for firth time and i&#x27;am very happy with it! Now it is one of my favorite ,my sister paid twice more for the same one in a duty free store! I recommend it you will love this perfume!</li>
