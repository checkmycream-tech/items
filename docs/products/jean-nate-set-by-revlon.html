    <ol>
            <li>I forgot the wonderful summer scent.  </li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Hydrating Body Lotion is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Products were great, and a great value.</li>
            <li>I am so happy Revlon is till producing these wonderfulproducts.</li>
            <li>Very nice set for the price</li>
            <li>My Jean Nate&#x27; products are just as wonderful now as they were when I used them many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the good ol days</li>
            <li>Love the odor!  </li>
            <li>The great Jean Nate odor, but a rich lotion too.  </li>
            <li>will enjoy her happiness always</li>
            <li>But, it is so much more convenient to be able to just purchase it via Amazon, then going out to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was exactly as shown and smeeled as good as I remember.</li>
            <li>Having a horse, I need a good rich lotion and this is very very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Jean Nate!</li>
            <li>Just the the right thing after a warm bath.</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>I have not worn good old Jean Nate in years.</li>
            <li>I love the mild, clean scent of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a clean citrus.  </li>
            <li>BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO SRONG AND TOO SWEET.  </li>
            <li>The fragrant fresh lemon type scent is unique and always brings compliments.</li>
            <li>Well it smells just as clean and fresh now as it did then.</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT ICKY SWEET OR OVERPOWERINGLY STRONG.  </li>
            <li>Light citrus tones and the lotion is very moisterizing.</li>
            <li>Better than most of the more *expensive spreads.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT HAS A VERY PLESANT AROMA.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for selling it.</li>
            <li>This came just as described and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This was not a imitation, but the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Now this took me back to the first body spash I was permitted to use in the 7th grade.</li>
            <li>They both have a strong chemical smell, not at all like the Jean Nate bath powder I already have or the Jean Nate products I remember from years past.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> All these things were gifts.</li>
            <li> Products were great, and a great value.</li>
            <li> I have not worn good old Jean Nate in years. I forgot the wonderful summer scent.  Very nice set for the price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s what she wanted.  simple gal with simple taste.  You just can beat it can you.  will enjoy her happiness always</li>
            <li> This product has been around for a long time, but is still one of my favorits.  The fragrance is a clean citrus.  Just the the right thing after a warm bath.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS A VERY PLESANT AROMA.  IT IS NOT ICKY SWEET OR OVERPOWERINGLY STRONG.  i DON&#x27;T BELIEVE IT WOULD OFFEND ANYONE.  I AM OFTEN MADE NASEUS BY SOME SCENTS THAT OTHER WOMEN WEAR BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO SRONG AND TOO SWEET.  THIS PRODUCT SMELLS LIKE LEMON BLOSSOMS AND IS A HAS A NATURE SCENT.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND IN STORES.</li>
            <li> These Jean Nate products, body lotion and body spray, smell terrible !  They both have a strong chemical smell, not at all like the Jean Nate bath powder I already have or the Jean Nate products I remember from years past.  I&#x27;d return them but its not worth the effort and cost.</li>
            <li> One cannot find Jean Nate lotion in the stores any longer. I was delighted to find it on Amazon. The fragrant fresh lemon type scent is unique and always brings compliments. Thanks for selling it. Revlon is making a mistake by discontinuing this lotion.</li>
            <li> My Jean Nate&#x27; products are just as wonderful now as they were when I used them many years ago.  I am so happy Revlon is till producing these wonderfulproducts.</li>
            <li> I love the mild, clean scent of this lotion.  I only wish I could find it sold separately.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as shown and smeeled as good as I remember.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this scent and I buy it for her every year.  This came just as described and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the good ol days</li>
            <li> Now this took me back to the first body spash I was permitted to use in the 7th grade. Everyone had it in their bathroom. Well it smells just as clean and fresh now as it did then. This was not a imitation, but the real deal.  Light citrus tones and the lotion is very moisterizing. Looks like I will be continuing tradition and keeping it in stock in my bath area. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Jean Nate.  Love the odor!  Have used it for years!  But, it is so much more convenient to be able to just purchase it via Amazon, then going out to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hydrating Body Lotion is awesome!  The great Jean Nate odor, but a rich lotion too.  Better than most of the more *expensive spreads.*  Having a horse, I need a good rich lotion and this is very very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Jean Nate!</li>
            <li> smells like chemicals</li>
