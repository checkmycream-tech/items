            <li>Perfect in every way!</li>
            <li>These ear tips works great for both.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>these fit perfectly on my ADC animal stethoscope and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great product that is oh so comfortable on the ears.  </li>
            <li>great acoustics and comfortable.</li>
            <li>nice feels and great fit.</li>
            <li>PERFECT replacement for my old eartips, fit and work great.</li>
            <li>They fit my stethoscope perfectly and now I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed when one of the Dr&#x27;s wants to borrow my stethoscope.</li>
            <li>Adscope kindly sent me eartips with the threaded cores, and the Amazon vendor allowed me to ship the returned eartips for free.  </li>
            <li>The Littman self seal eartips fall off and I have been looking for a better solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the company listened to the feedback from customers.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>better than the OG&#x27;s</li>
            <li>These are just as comfortable, just as good for sound, and more durable than the original ear tips.</li>
            <li>They are not as soft as my original ones but still a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>They fit great, soft in the ears and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>They block out all background noise and make it easy to hear.</li>
            <li>They work fine.  </li>
            <li>I suppose these eartips would be fine if they actually fit my daughter&#x27;s stethoscope.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and I received it within 3 business days!  :)</li>
            <li>These are really comfortable.</li>
            <li>I found the trick is get a cheap roll of Teflon Tape and tape the scope ends.</li>
            <li>Sometimes these cheap ADC scopes have thread problems and this is like a 1 buck fix instead of having your ear tip roll off over the floor while you are doing clinicals.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this product and bought 3 sets of replacement eartips.  </li>
            <li>Glad I was able to replace my ear-tips on my stethoscope, as I continue through medical school.</li>
            <li>These were an add on so did not arrive as quickly as most Prime does, but I did get them soon enough.</li>
            <li>Their customer service was very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and quality.</li>
            <li>I really like that they screw onto my scope.</li>
            <li>What can you really say, except it was shipped with prime and it works.</li>
            <li>A little more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>They hold up really well to disinfection solutions that I use frequently.</li>
            <li>They are not too thin and keep a good seal when I use my stethoscope.</li>
            <li>Plus its ADC and not a Fitman, so no one steals it and this steth comes right back to me every time i misplace it.</li>
            <li>I have small ears and most eartips are too big.</li>
            <li>I love my adscope stethoscope, but I have had difficulty finding replacement eartips and I have had to substitute Littman eartips which do not last very long as they do not fit as well.  </li>
            <li>Over all ok but little stiff.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These replacement one stayed on well.  I think I will have to replace them only when they wear out instead of when they fall off like my previous ones.</li>
            <li> The eartips should have had a metal, threaded core to attach to the stethoscope, and these did not.  I contacted Adscope and they confirmed that something was wrong with the ones I received in this order.  Adscope kindly sent me eartips with the threaded cores, and the Amazon vendor allowed me to ship the returned eartips for free.  Their customer service was very helpful.</li>
            <li> I lost an eartip to my ADC Adscope stethescope, but was not sure of the model number.  I ordered the 602-08 small black, but it did not fit my stethescope, the hole in the eartip is too large.  It was also not a threaded eartip.  I will return it and hopefully get a refund.  In searching online for another eartip, I was surprised at how much less expensive this product is on other websites.</li>
            <li> Sturdier than my originals, they were shredded before I bought these. They fit my stethoscope perfectly and now I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed when one of the Dr&#x27;s wants to borrow my stethoscope. These were an add on so did not arrive as quickly as most Prime does, but I did get them soon enough.</li>
            <li> I have 3 stethoscopes. I replace my eartips every year. I have small ears and most eartips are too big. These are really comfortable. I really like the texture and quality. They are not too thin and keep a good seal when I use my stethoscope. I really like that they screw onto my scope. The Littman self seal eartips fall off and I have been looking for a better solution. They hold up really well to disinfection solutions that I use frequently. All three of my stethoscopes are different brands and the tips work on all of them. I&#x27;m glad the company listened to the feedback from customers.</li>
            <li> Great product that is oh so comfortable on the ears.  They block out all background noise and make it easy to hear.</li>
            <li> bought to replace gray ear tips that came with ADC stethoscope. These are just as comfortable, just as good for sound, and more durable than the original ear tips.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace the ear tips that came with my stethoscope. They are not as soft as my original ones but still a perfect fit. It screws on just like the ones I had.</li>
            <li> I love my adscope stethoscope, but I have had difficulty finding replacement eartips and I have had to substitute Littman eartips which do not last very long as they do not fit as well.  I was excited to find this product and bought 3 sets of replacement eartips.  They fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> I had one ADC steth and the ear tips had finally given out.  What can you really say, except it was shipped with prime and it works.</li>
            <li> PERFECT replacement for my old eartips, fit and work great.</li>
            <li> They work fine.  And three pairs in the package should last a while.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and I received it within 3 business days!  :)</li>
            <li> I have (2) ADC stethoscopes, 1) ADC Adscope 603; 2) ADC Adscope 606. These ear tips works great for both. If you find they come off I found the trick is get a cheap roll of Teflon Tape and tape the scope ends. Sometimes these cheap ADC scopes have thread problems and this is like a 1 buck fix instead of having your ear tip roll off over the floor while you are doing clinicals.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to replace my ear-tips on my stethoscope, as I continue through medical school. Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> Just took a very long time to recieve.  A little more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Over all ok but little stiff.</li>
            <li> I suppose these eartips would be fine if they actually fit my daughter&#x27;s stethoscope. I searched for ear tips for her brand of stethoscope and these were in the results, but will not go on for anything. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> i have had my ADC steth for almost 8 years now, use it everyday and see a lot of patients small from 1 kilogram to 100 kgs. great acoustics and comfortable. Plus its ADC and not a Fitman, so no one steals it and this steth comes right back to me every time i misplace it.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to replace a lost earpiece on my ADSCOPE lite stethoscope!  They fit great, soft in the ears and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement tips after the ones that came with my ADC ones slipped off and got lost. these fit perfectly on my ADC animal stethoscope and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> nice feels and great fit. better than the OG&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way!</li>
