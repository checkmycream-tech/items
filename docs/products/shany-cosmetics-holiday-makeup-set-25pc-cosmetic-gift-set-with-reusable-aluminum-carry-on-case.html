            <li>When I opened it, all of the makeup looked beautiful, however, the box fell apart as soon as I opened the side drawer.</li>
            <li>Also the case is great; but it does not give you room to add any makeup that you may already have.</li>
            <li>So I am soo happy lots of makeup and great  colorfull makeup</li>
            <li>There is a great selection of shadows and brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>Very nice silver make-up case.</li>
            <li>But for a kids gift, it is most awesome and impressive, good for hours of fun and laughter.  </li>
            <li>It is a perfect item to take as you travel, because it fits so much inside it &amp; all closes up to a beautiful case.</li>
            <li>A+ very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Great item :)</li>
            <li>(also keeps toddlers out of the precious kit...!)</li>
            <li>It was great for my granddaughter&#x27;s first makeup kit.</li>
            <li>Very good, I&#x27;m happy because it was the birthday of my daughter but would recommend that the drawers of the case were a little stronger and better.</li>
            <li>Cute idea, but didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup kit.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, and more.  </li>
            <li>She pulls it out when there&#x27;s sleepovers, and the girls do enjoy all this has to offer, from face to nails!</li>
            <li>I want it please I need it for play practice in May 1 2 3 when will it come more of them</li>
            <li>I just wish it was either deeper for storage, and more advanced with the shelves, but I&#x27;m not hating I love it</li>
            <li>, it works fine for me and considering buying one for my 14 year who is going on 15 this year 2014.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>You even need a steel wool pad to clean it off whatever surface you might find it on.</li>
            <li>Wife loved this and can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the cosmetics included...</li>
            <li>It has to be the best purchase - everything is in the one place, she also has things loosely stored in an open basket, and our puppy decided to chew up some things, but he cant get into the case!</li>
            <li>This make up case is really compact and cool.</li>
            <li>and this is my first box, but</li>
            <li>This makeup kit is exactly what I thought I would get after looking at the picture.  </li>
            <li>It fits all the makeup and brushes inside it so well.. the colors provided are vibrant and the colors can be used for different looks, from natural to more colorful.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>My teen daughter felt like a professional makeup artist, walking through the airport with this stylish case.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to open the other side drawer.</li>
            <li>I bought this set as a Christmas gift for my 18-year old daughter and she just loves it!  </li>
            <li>My 12 yr old wanted this for Christmas, so we indulged her.</li>

            <li> Got this as a gift for my mom, and she absolutely loved it! She wanted to practice her makeup skills and this had everything she needed.</li>
            <li> Returned mine, drawers didn&#x27;t shut.  Cute idea, but didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I like this product. However one of the nails did come out the second day. Also the case is great; but it does not give you room to add any makeup that you may already have.</li>
            <li> Was broken wen I got it and the makeup stinks don&#x27;t buy this product what ever you do. Remember BROKEN!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This box appears to be sturdy but quite the contrary. When I opened it, all of the makeup looked beautiful, however, the box fell apart as soon as I opened the side drawer. I wasn&#x27;t even able to open the other side drawer. Sent it back immediately.</li>
            <li> Wife loved this and can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the cosmetics included... A+ very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup kit. I am in my 30&#x27;s and this is my first box, but second makeup kit. I just wish it was either deeper for storage, and more advanced with the shelves, but I&#x27;m not hating I love it, it works fine for me and considering buying one for my 14 year who is going on 15 this year 2014.</li>
            <li> So I am soo happy lots of makeup and great  colorfull makeup</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and more.  Not great quality at all (had to return one for missing drawer, and the second also had the drawer which was defective, and other poor packaging damage).  But for a kids gift, it is most awesome and impressive, good for hours of fun and laughter.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old wanted this for Christmas, so we indulged her. She pulls it out when there&#x27;s sleepovers, and the girls do enjoy all this has to offer, from face to nails! By the end of the night they are washing it off. It has to be the best purchase - everything is in the one place, she also has things loosely stored in an open basket, and our puppy decided to chew up some things, but he cant get into the case! (also keeps toddlers out of the precious kit...!) This was a great buy - i recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very nice silver make-up case. My teen daughter felt like a professional makeup artist, walking through the airport with this stylish case. It was the perfect Christmas gift. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This make up case is really compact and cool. It fits all the makeup and brushes inside it so well.. the colors provided are vibrant and the colors can be used for different looks, from natural to more colorful.This makeup kit comes with every item you need from lip glosses, mascara, brushes &amp; lots of eye shadow color choices.It is a perfect item to take as you travel, because it fits so much inside it &amp; all closes up to a beautiful case.I really like this product the texture &amp; quality of the products are amazing!!! Great item :)</li>

            <li> I bought this for my daughter so she could have fun making her self up, but this makeup is impossible to get out of clothing. You even need a steel wool pad to clean it off whatever surface you might find it on. Avoid this.</li>
            <li> Very good, I&#x27;m happy because it was the birthday of my daughter but would recommend that the drawers of the case were a little stronger and better.</li>
            <li> I want it please I need it for play practice in May 1 2 3 when will it come more of them</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is exactly what I thought I would get after looking at the picture.  I was not disappointed at all.  It was great for my granddaughter&#x27;s first makeup kit.</li>
