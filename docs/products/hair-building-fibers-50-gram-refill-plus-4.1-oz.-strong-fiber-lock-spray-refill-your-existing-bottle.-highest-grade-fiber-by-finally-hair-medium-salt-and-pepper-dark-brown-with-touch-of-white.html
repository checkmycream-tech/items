            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Ordered medium brown and color is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great value!</li>
            <li>I find the best way to use it is via the Toppik &amp;#34;puffer&amp;#34; that blows product into your hair.</li>
            <li>this is a great product!  </li>
            <li>Great price and very good product.  </li>
            <li>Great seller.</li>
            <li>Prompt service, great delivery.</li>
            <li>Works great, Dr. brown and Med. brown.  </li>
            <li>This is incredibly cost effective.</li>
            <li>Once you figure out the right color, this is the best ever.</li>
            <li>Worked so good, I ordered more.</li>
            <li>Its price is also very attractive since I need so much of it.</li>
            <li>Makes for a nice look.  </li>
            <li>I found even with a special spray or shaker fibers fly everywhere and clump...</li>
            <li>each stay on much better.  </li>
            <li>The price was great, shipping time was reasonable,</li>
            <li>Confirmed when I tried to apply it!</li>
            <li>pretty good for the price, but I will be using this in emergency situations when I run out of the better stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it and the price was fantastic</li>
            <li>This stuff goes EVERYWHERE because it is so fine and lightweight.</li>
            <li>The variety in hair color also made for a much more authentic match resulting in a more natural look.</li>
            <li>My light fixtures are now full of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Unless you want to clean your bathroom every time you use it, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true what they say:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried two shades, hoping for better coverage in the darker shade, but the other finer fiber brands work best, I had to go back.</li>
            <li>When I first received the product, I was excited because of the price &amp;</li>
            <li>The product has a wider selection of hair colors (which I liked), but the fibers are not as fine as the other brands.</li>
            <li>So even though it may be cheaper, you end up using twice as much to get adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick to the hair the way the higher end brands do.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the color was not a match to what I have been using.</li>
            <li>I guess if your are dealing w/ a coaster size (or smaller) area to fill in, it could be ok.  </li>
            <li>Toppixved yourproduct will most definitely order again.</li>
            <li>but I prefer finally hair so much more.</li>
            <li>It seems more messy than Toppik, and more fibers end up on my sink counter, but again, for the price, I can live with that.</li>
            <li>This product really makes hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>how much you get with it compared to the name brands.</li>
            <li>It happens even when applying gently.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this stuff, I really did.</li>
            <li>Toppik is a superior product, but yes, costs at least 6 times as much as this crud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my main color that I use for mixing and matching my hair color.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out how his product has been rated so highly.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make a huge hot mess, whereas as every particle of this stuff ends up on the pillow.  </li>
            <li>i dont know how to explain it except that I am using an old toppik bottle to apply it, and this stuff gets EVERYWHERE.  </li>
            <li>These fibers are a little more noticeable than Toppic but not enough for me to return to Toppik, because it would cost about $80 for the same amount.</li>
            <li>This amazon page is covered in fake positive reviews and comments from the company**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many of these keratin hair fiber brands.</li>
            <li>I have male pattern baldness, have had a couple of implant surgeries to establish a nice front hairline and then evenly spread a thin layer of hair</li>
            <li>Plus I have white that I use for the  hair around my face which is natural blond.  </li>
            <li>so hair shake adheres and gives me a nice fake head of hair.  </li>
            <li>better than the more expensive name brands!!!</li>
            <li>Works good, the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the ingredients it contains, i have no idea how bad that could be for your health?</li>

            <li> Works good, the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the ingredients it contains, i have no idea how bad that could be for your health?</li>
            <li> First, It&#x27;s very messy as the fibers go flying all over your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this product on line, unfortunately it was short lived.</li>
            <li> Second it didn&#x27;t apply well as the other products nor did in last long on my head.</li>
            <li> Again, It IS NOT AT ALL like toppik or other brands of keratin fibers and the medium brown color made my hair look RED.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this thinking you are saving money, it is not the same product that other companies sell.</li>
            <li> The other brands have some heft, so the fibers aren&#x27;t blowing all over the room.</li>
            <li> The other name brands it&#x27;s not needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth your time or money whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I bought two bags of this, one med brown and one dark as i like to mix to achieve desired color.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to put hair spray on my head with that smell mostly.</li>
            <li> If you are used to other hair fiber products, this may take a little practice, but be patient.  </li>
            <li> Use toppik, I have been using for 5 years and have tried several products this is more of  a powder than a fiber and provides terrible coverage.</li>
            <li> and when the dust settled, so to speak, there were just little splotches of it here and there on my scalp.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, this is what I came up with.</li>
            <li> It IS NOT MADE of natural looking keratin fibers, it is very thin and powder like.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on cabooki!</li>
            <li> It also clumps on your scalp, which is something I&#x27;ve never experienced with other brands.</li>
            <li> Compared to the expensive stuff, this works the same, If not better!</li>
            <li> The instructions say to shake it on, but that&#x27;s not effective.</li>
            <li> The ingredient Polymer made me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless to me.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair does not look thin any longer!!!</li>

            <li> If you have thinning hair like I do, this product is a life saver!</li>
            <li> *This amazon page is covered in fake positive reviews and comments from the company**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many of these keratin hair fiber brands. I don&#x27;t like this one at all. It IS NOT MADE of natural looking keratin fibers, it is very thin and powder like. So even though it may be cheaper, you end up using twice as much to get adequate coverage. It also clumps on your scalp, which is something I&#x27;ve never experienced with other brands. Again, It IS NOT AT ALL like toppik or other brands of keratin fibers and the medium brown color made my hair look RED.

DO NOT buy this thinking you are saving money, it is not the same product that other companies sell. It&#x27;s not worth your time or money whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Ordered medium brown and color is perfect. Great value!</li>
            <li> Color on picture darker.</li>
            <li> Use toppik, I have been using for 5 years and have tried several products this is more of  a powder than a fiber and provides terrible coverage.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this product on line, unfortunately it was short lived. The first thing I noticed was that the color was not a match to what I have been using. Second it didn&#x27;t apply well as the other products nor did in last long on my head. Third I thought I was purchasing another Keratin product but I see on the ingredients it says &amp;#34;MAY CONTAIN KERATIN&amp;#34; not that it is keratin. The ingredient Polymer made me uncomfortable. I am really disappointed. I guess it&#x27;s true what they say: You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Great seller. This product really makes hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> These fibers are a little more noticeable than Toppic but not enough for me to return to Toppik, because it would cost about $80 for the same amount. This is incredibly cost effective. It seems more messy than Toppik, and more fibers end up on my sink counter, but again, for the price, I can live with that. I find the best way to use it is via the Toppik &amp;#34;puffer&amp;#34; that blows product into your hair. The instructions say to shake it on, but that&#x27;s not effective.</li>
            <li> When I first received the product, I was excited because of the price &amp; how much you get with it compared to the name brands. After using it for a few days, this is what I came up with. First, It&#x27;s very messy as the fibers go flying all over your bathroom. My light fixtures are now full of this stuff. It happens even when applying gently. Second, they don&#x27;t seem to bond in place, as you have to keep applying. That&#x27;s why hair spray is recommended. I hate having to put hair spray on my head with that smell mostly. The other name brands it&#x27;s not needed. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. pretty good for the price, but I will be using this in emergency situations when I run out of the better stuff.</li>
            <li> Worked so good, I ordered more. Compared to the expensive stuff, this works the same, If not better!</li>
            <li> Great price and very good product.  If you are used to other hair fiber products, this may take a little practice, but be patient.  The variety in hair color also made for a much more authentic match resulting in a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how his product has been rated so highly.  I guess if your are dealing w/ a coaster size (or smaller) area to fill in, it could be ok.  I have male pattern baldness, have had a couple of implant surgeries to establish a nice front hairline and then evenly spread a thin layer of hair so hair shake adheres and gives me a nice fake head of hair.  Toppik is a superior product, but yes, costs at least 6 times as much as this crud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toppik (and Caboki) each stay on much better.  This stuff blows out w/ the wind.  I can sleep at my ladies and toppik doesn&#x27;t make a huge hot mess, whereas as every particle of this stuff ends up on the pillow.  She demanded that i switch back.  Also, in the delivery, if you apply toppik correctly, you will not have any invisible cloud that ends up getting everywhere in your bathroom.  Not possible w/ this stuff.  It seems to be lighter, or doesn&#x27;t have the material to sink - i dont know how to explain it except that I am using an old toppik bottle to apply it, and this stuff gets EVERYWHERE.  God forbid im breathing it in.  I bought two bags of this, one med brown and one dark as i like to mix to achieve desired color.  It&#x27;s useless to me.  So any of you five star raters want to drop me a line, i will sell it to you for cost of shipping only.  Otherwise, im dumping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am bummed, too, because rather than spend 150 every three months, i could be spending 25.  oh well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this stuff, I really did. The price was great, shipping time was reasonable, no problems there. My issue: it is literally just brown dust. Not fibers. Dust. So I put the product in a shaker, and as I was pouring it in there, I could already tell there was something funky about the consistency. Confirmed when I tried to apply it! Brown dust flying all through the air, all over my vanity, I&#x27;m breathing it in.....and when the dust settled, so to speak, there were just little splotches of it here and there on my scalp. Really disappointing. Maybe I got a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34;? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Once you figure out the right color, this is the best ever. It is not toxic, anddoes not come off on the pillow. Its price is also very attractive since I need so much of it.</li>
            <li> I love it and the price was fantastic</li>
            <li> The product has a wider selection of hair colors (which I liked), but the fibers are not as fine as the other brands. I found even with a special spray or shaker fibers fly everywhere and clump...I&#x27;ve tried two shades, hoping for better coverage in the darker shade, but the other finer fiber brands work best, I had to go back. Prompt service, great delivery. But now I have two shades I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Toppixved yourproduct will most definitely order again. I have been using Tp but I prefer finally hair so much more.</li>
            <li> this is a great product!  better than the more expensive name brands!!! don&#x27;t waste your money on cabooki!</li>
            <li> This is my main color that I use for mixing and matching my hair color.  Works great, Dr. brown and Med. brown.  Plus I have white that I use for the  hair around my face which is natural blond.  Makes for a nice look.  My hair does not look thin any longer!!!</li>
            <li> Works good, the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the ingredients it contains, i have no idea how bad that could be for your health? otherwise it does puff up your hair.</li>
