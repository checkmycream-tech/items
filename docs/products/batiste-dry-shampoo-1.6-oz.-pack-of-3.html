            <li>Works great on light colored hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, just spray at the roots, brush and go.</li>
            <li>This takes care of it and even holds curls better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love bringing these along for my multi-leg, 20-hour plane journeys.</li>
            <li>It is the best dry shampoo available.</li>
            <li>My hair gets greasy very quickly (within 12 hours of being washed or within 10 minutes on a windy day).</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine hair and my bangs and hair by my ears gets greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is great and does not create frizz.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair a very bright red, so the less washes, the better.</li>
            <li>Works great even on dark hair!</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and works great for fragile hair that can&#x27;t be shampooed daily.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a lot of dry shampoo in them, but they&#x27;re great for occasional use.  </li>
            <li>Nothing pleasant or otherwise (and obviously nothing lasting).</li>
            <li>Its fine, leaves some white in the hair</li>
            <li>Great for a little touch-up in the airport bathroom prior to stepping out at your destination.</li>
            <li>but I feel like there wasn&#x27;t much inside to begin with.</li>
            <li>As for the scent, I don&#x27;t really pick up on one.</li>
            <li>Rubbing the spray residue makes my hand feel a bit gross, but washing my hands fixes that quickly.</li>
            <li>I use the full size of this dry shampoo, but wanted some for cosmetic travel bag and gym bag.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several dry shampoos  and dislike ones that make my hair feel like straw (looking at you, Big Sexy Hair).  </li>
            <li>I love this brand and its hard to find.</li>
            <li>This purchase was my first dry shampoo purchase.</li>
            <li>I usually use the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; one of this, but needed travel size, so using the original for this.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. This is my fav dry shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my fault but pic was misleadingâ€¦ these are the tiny 1.6 ounce travel size.</li>
            <li> I use the full size of this dry shampoo, but wanted some for cosmetic travel bag and gym bag.  These are perfect!  There&#x27;s not a lot of dry shampoo in them, but they&#x27;re great for occasional use.  Will be purchasing again soon!</li>

            <li> My husband loves this for travel.</li>
            <li> I usually use the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; one of this, but needed travel size, so using the original for this.  I have tried several dry shampoos  and dislike ones that make my hair feel like straw (looking at you, Big Sexy Hair).  Batiste has a really good product - and great price.</li>
            <li> Its fine, leaves some white in the hair but i&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  The size is perfect for travel or your purse.  I can go another day or two without shampooing when I use this product.  I have shoulder length fine hair and my bangs and hair by my ears gets greasy looking.  This takes care of it and even holds curls better.</li>
            <li> I do like the dry shampoo and this travel size but I feel like there wasn&#x27;t much inside to begin with.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it all of the time. smells great!</li>
            <li> Got this for my fianc&amp;eacute; she loves the stuff.  Great price</li>
            <li> This purchase was my first dry shampoo purchase. I dye my hair a very bright red, so the less washes, the better. My hair gets greasy very quickly (within 12 hours of being washed or within 10 minutes on a windy day). This shampoo does a great job on making my hair look and feel clean! Rubbing the spray residue makes my hand feel a bit gross, but washing my hands fixes that quickly. All the white from the spray does not easily go away, but it isn&#x27;t too noticeable. The 1.6 ounce can does not last however! It felt like it lasted a week and a half. I definitely recommend getting the 6.73 ounce bottle. I ordered this 3 pack on July 11th, and I finished it the last week of July. I did however use it 3-4 times a week (once in the morning). As for the scent, I don&#x27;t really pick up on one. Nothing pleasant or otherwise (and obviously nothing lasting). I think what matters is that it makes your hair look, feel, and smell presentable.</li>
            <li> Love bringing these along for my multi-leg, 20-hour plane journeys. Great for a little touch-up in the airport bathroom prior to stepping out at your destination. Perfect travel size.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Works great even on dark hair!</li>
            <li> Needed this size for air travel. I love this brand and its hard to find. Works great on light colored hair.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works pretty good. I&#x27;ve been trying to wash my hair less due to some over processing. After I use this I realized my scalp feels a bit itchy and irritated.  I just looked at the ingredients. ...butane! Propane! Wth! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been spraying this on my head! I think I&#x27;ll stick with baby powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fine hair and have hated all dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. This one works. Spray it on, rub it around (immediately), and enjoy looking awesome and receiving compliments about how good you smell.</li>
