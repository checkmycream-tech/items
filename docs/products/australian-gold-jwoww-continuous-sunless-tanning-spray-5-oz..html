            <li>I absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>am very fair skinned and this gives me a ton of color.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>Also I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this on very fair skin people.</li>
            <li>one of the best on the market at a good price.</li>
            <li>I spray tan in the salons and this product is great for touch-ups and works great on my face as well.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>However, for the $$$ savings you get, this spray is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for color</li>
            <li>this was great.</li>
            <li>but the smell is not too great.</li>
            <li>Great color.</li>
            <li>It looks great.</li>
            <li>PAULY D&#x27;S SPRAY TAN IS 50 TIMES BETTER!!</li>
            <li>Love this!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s awesome. :-)</li>
            <li>I wish there was a pleasant fragrance added because I can smell it until I wash it off</li>
            <li>This tanner will leave you a bright orange color, seriousley, like an oompa-loompa.</li>
            <li>the prices is good</li>
            <li>Fair skin tone</li>
            <li>And it does smell good.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and freckles, and try to stay out of the tanning bed, so i&#x27;ve always used a spray tanner.</li>
            <li>The one good thing I do have to say about this is the color isn&#x27;t ORANGE.</li>
            <li>that is a gorgeous color!!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Wears off on bath towels - otherwise good stuff -</li>
            <li>like it because it smells good and you can apply in layers.</li>
            <li>Smells great, applies smoothly, immediate good color, and after about 4 hours AMAZING color!</li>
            <li>I have a real good, fresh looking tan -</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but it worked great.</li>
            <li>I find that if you use the JWOWW spray tan and Snooki&#x27;s tanning lotion afterwards it leaves you with the perfect golden tan.</li>
            <li>smell isnt that great, but if your only looking for color, great product and great price!</li>
            <li>Love this tanning spray!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>More than 5 stars here!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more today!</li>
            <li>sure you price shop on this one!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Firstly it would be best to spray yourself in the shower because this stuff will spray and stain the bathroom floor or your surroundings.</li>
            <li>I put this spray on after I had a spray tan done at TanPro and the color turned out amazing,</li>
            <li>All of JWOWW&#x27;s products are amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Very impressed, a great product that I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>This spray does produce a nice color... not orange like a lot of self-tanners.</li>
            <li>This tanning  spray is veryl effective and tans immediately.  </li>
            <li>but it does work for a nice tan.</li>
            <li>my own fault</li>
            <li>it kind of just splatters out.</li>
            <li>A lot of customers liked it.</li>
            <li>I have liked it a lot, but with sunless tanners there is always a drawback, they may say they won&#x27;t streak or when you sweat it will stay put, that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because of all of the great reviews on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product, i have used many self tanners and this one sets in a nice tan.</li>
            <li>color shows up right away and continues to develop through out the day!!!</li>
            <li>This was by far the best smelling spray ever.</li>
            <li>I have to say by far this one is the BEST!</li>
            <li>I have used self tanning spray for years and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>amazing product .. :))))</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the effort of buying online for sure!!</li>
            <li>, It worked great thanks!</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and leaves a pretty good color, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>Ok color</li>
            <li>SURE JWOWW</li>
            <li>I love this spray tan.</li>
            <li>I have used so many different sprays and if you have a tan and need a kick to it this is perfect.</li>
            <li>i had much better result when i used  the Dior Bronzer....</li>
            <li>save your money  :))</li>
            <li>This product is the best and provides instant results!!!  </li>
            <li>Love you Jwoww</li>
            <li>The streaks are much more noticeable than a lot of self-tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Snooki&#x27;s is much better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>the color looked more orangy compared to snookies sunless tanning spray.</li>
            <li>So all I have to say is don&#x27;t buy something just because it has a famous persons name on the front.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so I ingeniously over applied it all over and ended up looking like an orange dalmatian.</li>
            <li>I actually LOVE those two products but thought there&#x27;s always room for improvment.</li>
            <li>I love the color, just wish I could get it blended well and not streaky.</li>
            <li>she rubs lotion all over her body to make sure there&#x27;s no streaks.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wash your hands immediately after applying.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>But tan much better after washing bronzer away.</li>
            <li>I used it before going into work to have a glow on top of my tan.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than the VersaSpa self-tanning macine at the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on my tan.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Parts where my skin was more dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>JWOWW&#x27;s spray tan is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good</li>
            <li>This product has nice colour, but be sure and rub in immediately to make sure you get an even tan, and to prevent streaking, then wash hands right away.</li>
            <li>when i use this people have gone so far as to assume i&#x27;m Mediteranean (lol)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get a smooth color on my legs, even with the help of a friend to apply it.</li>
            <li>If you spray the self tanner on correctly, gives you a great natural looking tan that stays on for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I swear by this stuff its a quick way to get awesome color, especially if you&#x27;re not as tan as you&#x27;d like to be.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, if you do it right.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The bottle sprays evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>really strong odor.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing and sprays out very well!</li>
            <li>the California Tan bronzer spray does, it&#x27;s a really fine mist that covers evenly, with no streaks or spots.</li>
            <li>More like a spray and &#x27;quickly smear all over yourself before it drips on your floor and stains.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I will stick to regular brands that worked fine, just had to give this one a shot because it was supposed to be so great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skin btw, don&#x27;t really tan naturally at all, but</li>
            <li>the important note to</li>
            <li>Very runny, but the color is nice.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too light.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m overall happy with this product.</li>
            <li>overall worked great.</li>
            <li>I would just go with snookie or my favorite right now, St. Tropez tanning moose</li>
            <li>like I originally planned on doing.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how to do it the first time</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that it comes off on my sheets (mostly just the first night) but for a even tan - that looks real and not orange.</li>
            <li>When I first put this product on it looked very good and nature but after the first shower (which was over 12 hours later)</li>
            <li>The tan lasts for a pretty long time and it&#x27;s a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>True Jersey woman speaking on the product too..</li>
            <li>I love sunless tanning, as I&#x27;m very concerned about saving my skin from the harmful sun.  </li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a good product to spray and go.</li>
            <li>Nice deep tan, sans streaks or strong odor...</li>
            <li>However, it fades quickly and as it fades it sometimes becomes a bit orange and patchy.</li>
            <li>Like super orange.</li>
            <li>Which was lucky for me but means it also does not stay on like</li>
            <li>I love the beach smell not the normal sunless smell</li>
            <li>I would recommend the spray, using sparingly, because it gives great dark color with 1 coat.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After I had all that down, the product is great.</li>
            <li>I am very pale and do not tan easily, and this product worked great for me.</li>
            <li>I have used many self tanners and this one is my new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy for touch-ups, not only on spray tans, but also if you were going somewhere and wanted a glow on top of your tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very glowy!!</li>
            <li>I bought this awhile back and love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky!</li>
            <li>Even, instant color, coverage allows you to see where you are spraying and provides a great natural glow.</li>
            <li>So my advice for my fair skinned sisters be careful, don&#x27;t over apply, and read up on tips and tricks for this.</li>
            <li>And I rarely tanned to begin with.</li>
            <li>I spray it on, and imeadiatly have a  blow dryer handy to get it to dry quick so it doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li>The color shows up right away (no need to spray in advance...</li>
            <li>I had my husband spray for me thinking I just wasn&#x27;t doing it right...</li>
            <li>thankfully it washed right off even after the day I gave it to set.</li>
            <li>I have tried many but none has ever looked as pretty or natural as this one.</li>
            <li>This is my favourite sunless tanning spray - it gives you a beautiful golden tan, looks natural and lasts longer than other products.</li>
            <li>LIVE BY THIS STUFF FOR QUICK FACE GLOW!</li>
            <li>considering I&#x27;m dark skinned good product it washes off a lot in the shower</li>
            <li>Another product that I have loved over the uses is the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Beach Sexy tanning spray.</li>
            <li>Jwoww is my favorite castmember of the Jersey Shore, next to Deena</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding a different and better sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product numerous times and have always been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>i am sorry not the best product out there..........</li>
            <li>only product I&#x27;ve used that I like better is the VersaSpa touch up spray.</li>
            <li>I went to work the next day with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>If it were my first time spray tanning I would think it&#x27;s just me...</li>
            <li>Like most sunless tanning products they simply cannot hold up to their claims.</li>
            <li>I can reach then stand in tub(no water:) and spray back etc.</li>
            <li>Instead, try a product like Fake Bake Flawless or Banana Boat.</li>
            <li>It will come out more evenly too the further it is sprayed from your body.</li>
            <li>but it sometimes squirted at me other than that really nice color</li>
            <li>I bought this the other day (because I realllly liked the jwoww tanning lotion).</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone needing a quick natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>I have no idea how the other users have had such great experiences with it</li>
            <li>Love this product and lasts long time even through showering.</li>
            <li>It really does look more natural than any i&#x27;ve tried before, but i do two coats, at least 18 hours apart, for a really nice, even &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get a hang of it if you don&#x27;t spray at a certain pace you get blotches.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful how much you spray; you can easily turn yourself into an oompa-loompa!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need much to cover certain areas.</li>
            <li>I recently bought the \\&quot;Jwoww 2012 Australian Gold Sunless Tanning Spray\\&quot; and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray too much in one spot.</li>
            <li>If you use it on your face, wear a hair net or towel over your head and close your eyes and lightly spray your face.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>After reading all the \\&quot;rave\\&quot; reviews about this product,I was looking very forward to trying it.</li>
            <li>It was also was very streaky and would wash off.</li>
            <li>Also, move it fast as you&#x27;re spraying, otherwise it will start running because you&#x27;ll have too much in one place.</li>
            <li>i have light skin with red undertones.</li>
            <li>It turned my skin orange and was very streaky</li>
            <li>I actually rarely like spray tans or tanners because they make me orange and self conscious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used every fake tanner and this is BY FAR the BEST TANNER I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Did not like the smell of the tan right after application and after the tan had developed.</li>
            <li>WHEN I GOT IT, IT HAD NO TOP, CAUSING MOST OF IT TO SPILL IN THE PACKAGE.!</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t get that nice dark tan I was hoping for, it is the Gold color that it is marked to be; no orange.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t give you a dark model tan, but it&#x27;s good for evening out any washed out parts of your body, especially the face (IF APPLIED CORRECTLY).</li>
            <li>: Easy to use, inexpensive, even application, quick drying, long lasting color</li>
            <li>It looks pretty natural</li>
            <li>If you are already dark i think you might lik it more.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this is the lasting color, only lasts for about a week or so.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t have good luck with any self-tanning product, but this one was easy to use and dried evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>My orange stained finger and toe nails on the other hand were a different story I actually was really happy with it aside from that.</li>
            <li>did find that since it&#x27;s so deep, you have to be extra cautious to make sure it doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 mainly because you do need to rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>It certainly got rid of my left over bikini lines from over the summer and has made my skin a lovely soft-looking single tone which is a plus.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t streak and dried super quick which was a bonus.</li>
            <li>At least Snookis bronzer lotion has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>: be sure to FULLY exfoliate all areas of your skin before using this product, and every few days exfoliate again and reapply product to avoid streaking or blotchy color.</li>
            <li>However, the overspray is pretty dramatic, similar to Mystic tan, which I really don&#x27;t like, so I&#x27;m still looking for a good tanner in a can where I won&#x27;t have issues with overspray.</li>
            <li>so it might not look right on really white skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure you leave it on for at least 4 hours for your tan to really develop.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking color.</li>
            <li>; It looks so natural, didn&#x27;t leave me orange at all &amp; no streaks!</li>
            <li>The spray tan comes out really easily and evenly, but somehow it does end up a little blotchy in some places.</li>
            <li>I have used many other similar products in the past and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Because this did happen to me but only in certain spots on my body.</li>
            <li>The color was great but the application is a little to hard to do by yourself.</li>
            <li>I have to be more careful with application as it will come out blotchy if you arent careful.</li>
            <li>Looks like a natural tan.</li>
            <li>It sprays on streaky, even if you hold the can far away.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the all natural self tanner by Alba Botanicals</li>
            <li>My friends and family are all like \\&quot;wow how did you get so</li>
            <li>I have found that by using lotion and keeping your body very moisturized starting the day after You spray yourself, this does help.</li>
            <li>The tanner is messy, so be sure to hold it further away from your body than what they recommend.  </li>
            <li>Kind of wet and messy.</li>
            <li>no mess and</li>
            <li>My boyfriend actually thought I had a new perfume on.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous trying this bronzer for the first time, I&#x27;ve always used the tanning bed &amp; thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>I looked 2 shades darker instantly and the rest of my tan developed over a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>This comes out pretty dark</li>
            <li>and yes it gave you that nice orange fake  glow ...</li>
            <li>I do not notice it right away however in a few hours</li>
            <li>Works a little bit better in my opinion and doesn&#x27;t come out as concentrated so you can start out with a little and build upon it.</li>
            <li>This is a very dark self tanner and one that is applied directly without rubbing in so it can be easy to mess up.  </li>
            <li>My feet looked alien after the first time I sprayed!  </li>
            <li>And made a HUGE mess all in my shower!!!</li>
            <li>Be aware the spray soaks in quickly (not talking about drying time), especially in areas like your toes, knees, ankles, etc., where skin is tougher.  </li>
            <li>Normally I just use the cheap stuff from walmart (banana boat) or the rub on stuff called fake bake.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchase sunless tanner from some where other than Walmart, and it was money well spent.</li>
            <li>when spraying it is make sure you are further away then said on the bottle (only by a little), otherwise you will notice little streaks when wet.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> am very fair skinned and this gives me a ton of color.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> Also I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this on very fair skin people.</li>
            <li> one of the best on the market at a good price.</li>
            <li> I spray tan in the salons and this product is great for touch-ups and works great on my face as well.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> However, for the $$$ savings you get, this spray is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for color</li>
            <li> this was great.</li>
            <li> but the smell is not too great.</li>
            <li> Great color.</li>
            <li> It looks great.</li>
            <li> PAULY D&#x27;S SPRAY TAN IS 50 TIMES BETTER!!</li>
            <li> Love this!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awesome. :-)</li>
            <li> I wish there was a pleasant fragrance added because I can smell it until I wash it off</li>
            <li> This tanner will leave you a bright orange color, seriousley, like an oompa-loompa.</li>
            <li> the prices is good</li>
            <li> Fair skin tone</li>
            <li> And it does smell good.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and freckles, and try to stay out of the tanning bed, so i&#x27;ve always used a spray tanner.</li>
            <li> The one good thing I do have to say about this is the color isn&#x27;t ORANGE.</li>
            <li> that is a gorgeous color!!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Wears off on bath towels - otherwise good stuff -</li>
            <li> like it because it smells good and you can apply in layers.</li>
            <li> Smells great, applies smoothly, immediate good color, and after about 4 hours AMAZING color!</li>
            <li> I have a real good, fresh looking tan -</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but it worked great.</li>
            <li> I find that if you use the JWOWW spray tan and Snooki&#x27;s tanning lotion afterwards it leaves you with the perfect golden tan.</li>
            <li> smell isnt that great, but if your only looking for color, great product and great price!</li>
            <li> Love this tanning spray!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> More than 5 stars here!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more today!</li>
            <li> sure you price shop on this one!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Firstly it would be best to spray yourself in the shower because this stuff will spray and stain the bathroom floor or your surroundings.</li>
            <li> I put this spray on after I had a spray tan done at TanPro and the color turned out amazing,</li>
            <li> All of JWOWW&#x27;s products are amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Very impressed, a great product that I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This spray does produce a nice color... not orange like a lot of self-tanners.</li>
            <li> This tanning  spray is veryl effective and tans immediately.  </li>
            <li> but it does work for a nice tan.</li>
            <li> my own fault</li>
            <li> it kind of just splatters out.</li>
            <li> A lot of customers liked it.</li>
            <li> I have liked it a lot, but with sunless tanners there is always a drawback, they may say they won&#x27;t streak or when you sweat it will stay put, that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of all of the great reviews on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product, i have used many self tanners and this one sets in a nice tan.</li>
            <li> color shows up right away and continues to develop through out the day!!!</li>
            <li> This was by far the best smelling spray ever.</li>
            <li> I have to say by far this one is the BEST!</li>
            <li> I have used self tanning spray for years and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> amazing product .. :))))</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the effort of buying online for sure!!</li>
            <li> , It worked great thanks!</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and leaves a pretty good color, not orange at all.</li>
            <li> Ok color</li>
            <li> SURE JWOWW</li>
            <li> I love this spray tan.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different sprays and if you have a tan and need a kick to it this is perfect.</li>
            <li> i had much better result when i used  the Dior Bronzer....</li>
            <li> save your money  :))</li>
            <li> This product is the best and provides instant results!!!  </li>
            <li> Love you Jwoww</li>
            <li> The streaks are much more noticeable than a lot of self-tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Snooki&#x27;s is much better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> the color looked more orangy compared to snookies sunless tanning spray.</li>
            <li> So all I have to say is don&#x27;t buy something just because it has a famous persons name on the front.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> so I ingeniously over applied it all over and ended up looking like an orange dalmatian.</li>
            <li> I actually LOVE those two products but thought there&#x27;s always room for improvment.</li>
            <li> I love the color, just wish I could get it blended well and not streaky.</li>
            <li> she rubs lotion all over her body to make sure there&#x27;s no streaks.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wash your hands immediately after applying.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> But tan much better after washing bronzer away.</li>
            <li> I used it before going into work to have a glow on top of my tan.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than the VersaSpa self-tanning macine at the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on my tan.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Parts where my skin was more dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> JWOWW&#x27;s spray tan is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good</li>
            <li> This product has nice colour, but be sure and rub in immediately to make sure you get an even tan, and to prevent streaking, then wash hands right away.</li>
            <li> when i use this people have gone so far as to assume i&#x27;m Mediteranean (lol)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get a smooth color on my legs, even with the help of a friend to apply it.</li>
            <li> If you spray the self tanner on correctly, gives you a great natural looking tan that stays on for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff its a quick way to get awesome color, especially if you&#x27;re not as tan as you&#x27;d like to be.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, if you do it right.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The bottle sprays evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li> really strong odor.</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and sprays out very well!</li>
            <li> the California Tan bronzer spray does, it&#x27;s a really fine mist that covers evenly, with no streaks or spots.</li>
            <li> More like a spray and &#x27;quickly smear all over yourself before it drips on your floor and stains.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I will stick to regular brands that worked fine, just had to give this one a shot because it was supposed to be so great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skin btw, don&#x27;t really tan naturally at all, but</li>
            <li> the important note to</li>
            <li> Very runny, but the color is nice.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too light.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m overall happy with this product.</li>
            <li> overall worked great.</li>
            <li> I would just go with snookie or my favorite right now, St. Tropez tanning moose</li>
            <li> like I originally planned on doing.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how to do it the first time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love that it comes off on my sheets (mostly just the first night) but for a even tan - that looks real and not orange.</li>
            <li> When I first put this product on it looked very good and nature but after the first shower (which was over 12 hours later)</li>
            <li> The tan lasts for a pretty long time and it&#x27;s a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> True Jersey woman speaking on the product too..</li>
            <li> I love sunless tanning, as I&#x27;m very concerned about saving my skin from the harmful sun.  </li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a good product to spray and go.</li>
            <li> Nice deep tan, sans streaks or strong odor...</li>
            <li> However, it fades quickly and as it fades it sometimes becomes a bit orange and patchy.</li>
            <li> Like super orange.</li>
            <li> Which was lucky for me but means it also does not stay on like</li>
            <li> I love the beach smell not the normal sunless smell</li>
            <li> I would recommend the spray, using sparingly, because it gives great dark color with 1 coat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I had all that down, the product is great.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and do not tan easily, and this product worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners and this one is my new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy for touch-ups, not only on spray tans, but also if you were going somewhere and wanted a glow on top of your tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very glowy!!</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky!</li>
            <li> Even, instant color, coverage allows you to see where you are spraying and provides a great natural glow.</li>
            <li> So my advice for my fair skinned sisters be careful, don&#x27;t over apply, and read up on tips and tricks for this.</li>
            <li> And I rarely tanned to begin with.</li>
            <li> I spray it on, and imeadiatly have a  blow dryer handy to get it to dry quick so it doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> The color shows up right away (no need to spray in advance...</li>
            <li> I had my husband spray for me thinking I just wasn&#x27;t doing it right...</li>
            <li> thankfully it washed right off even after the day I gave it to set.</li>
            <li> I have tried many but none has ever looked as pretty or natural as this one.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite sunless tanning spray - it gives you a beautiful golden tan, looks natural and lasts longer than other products.</li>
            <li> LIVE BY THIS STUFF FOR QUICK FACE GLOW!</li>
            <li> considering I&#x27;m dark skinned good product it washes off a lot in the shower</li>
            <li> Another product that I have loved over the uses is the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Beach Sexy tanning spray.</li>
            <li> Jwoww is my favorite castmember of the Jersey Shore, next to Deena</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding a different and better sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product numerous times and have always been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> i am sorry not the best product out there..........</li>
            <li> only product I&#x27;ve used that I like better is the VersaSpa touch up spray.</li>
            <li> I went to work the next day with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> If it were my first time spray tanning I would think it&#x27;s just me...</li>
            <li> Like most sunless tanning products they simply cannot hold up to their claims.</li>
            <li> I can reach then stand in tub(no water:) and spray back etc.</li>
            <li> Instead, try a product like Fake Bake Flawless or Banana Boat.</li>
            <li> It will come out more evenly too the further it is sprayed from your body.</li>
            <li> but it sometimes squirted at me other than that really nice color</li>
            <li> I bought this the other day (because I realllly liked the jwoww tanning lotion).</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone needing a quick natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how the other users have had such great experiences with it</li>
            <li> Love this product and lasts long time even through showering.</li>
            <li> It really does look more natural than any i&#x27;ve tried before, but i do two coats, at least 18 hours apart, for a really nice, even &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get a hang of it if you don&#x27;t spray at a certain pace you get blotches.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful how much you spray; you can easily turn yourself into an oompa-loompa!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need much to cover certain areas.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the \\&quot;Jwoww 2012 Australian Gold Sunless Tanning Spray\\&quot; and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spray too much in one spot.</li>
            <li> If you use it on your face, wear a hair net or towel over your head and close your eyes and lightly spray your face.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> After reading all the \\&quot;rave\\&quot; reviews about this product,I was looking very forward to trying it.</li>
            <li> It was also was very streaky and would wash off.</li>
            <li> Also, move it fast as you&#x27;re spraying, otherwise it will start running because you&#x27;ll have too much in one place.</li>
            <li> i have light skin with red undertones.</li>
            <li> It turned my skin orange and was very streaky</li>
            <li> I actually rarely like spray tans or tanners because they make me orange and self conscious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used every fake tanner and this is BY FAR the BEST TANNER I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell of the tan right after application and after the tan had developed.</li>
            <li> WHEN I GOT IT, IT HAD NO TOP, CAUSING MOST OF IT TO SPILL IN THE PACKAGE.!</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t get that nice dark tan I was hoping for, it is the Gold color that it is marked to be; no orange.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t give you a dark model tan, but it&#x27;s good for evening out any washed out parts of your body, especially the face (IF APPLIED CORRECTLY).</li>
            <li> : Easy to use, inexpensive, even application, quick drying, long lasting color</li>
            <li> It looks pretty natural</li>
            <li> If you are already dark i think you might lik it more.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is the lasting color, only lasts for about a week or so.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t have good luck with any self-tanning product, but this one was easy to use and dried evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> My orange stained finger and toe nails on the other hand were a different story I actually was really happy with it aside from that.</li>
            <li> did find that since it&#x27;s so deep, you have to be extra cautious to make sure it doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 mainly because you do need to rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> It certainly got rid of my left over bikini lines from over the summer and has made my skin a lovely soft-looking single tone which is a plus.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t streak and dried super quick which was a bonus.</li>
            <li> At least Snookis bronzer lotion has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> : be sure to FULLY exfoliate all areas of your skin before using this product, and every few days exfoliate again and reapply product to avoid streaking or blotchy color.</li>
            <li> However, the overspray is pretty dramatic, similar to Mystic tan, which I really don&#x27;t like, so I&#x27;m still looking for a good tanner in a can where I won&#x27;t have issues with overspray.</li>
            <li> so it might not look right on really white skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure you leave it on for at least 4 hours for your tan to really develop.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking color.</li>
            <li> ; It looks so natural, didn&#x27;t leave me orange at all &amp; no streaks!</li>
            <li> The spray tan comes out really easily and evenly, but somehow it does end up a little blotchy in some places.</li>
            <li> I have used many other similar products in the past and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Because this did happen to me but only in certain spots on my body.</li>
            <li> The color was great but the application is a little to hard to do by yourself.</li>
            <li> I have to be more careful with application as it will come out blotchy if you arent careful.</li>
            <li> Looks like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> It sprays on streaky, even if you hold the can far away.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the all natural self tanner by Alba Botanicals</li>
            <li> My friends and family are all like \\&quot;wow how did you get so</li>
            <li> I have found that by using lotion and keeping your body very moisturized starting the day after You spray yourself, this does help.</li>
            <li> The tanner is messy, so be sure to hold it further away from your body than what they recommend.  </li>
            <li> Kind of wet and messy.</li>
            <li> no mess and</li>
            <li> My boyfriend actually thought I had a new perfume on.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous trying this bronzer for the first time, I&#x27;ve always used the tanning bed &amp; thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li> I looked 2 shades darker instantly and the rest of my tan developed over a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This comes out pretty dark</li>
            <li> and yes it gave you that nice orange fake  glow ...</li>
            <li> I do not notice it right away however in a few hours</li>
            <li> Works a little bit better in my opinion and doesn&#x27;t come out as concentrated so you can start out with a little and build upon it.</li>
            <li> This is a very dark self tanner and one that is applied directly without rubbing in so it can be easy to mess up.  </li>
            <li> My feet looked alien after the first time I sprayed!  </li>
            <li> And made a HUGE mess all in my shower!!!</li>
            <li> Be aware the spray soaks in quickly (not talking about drying time), especially in areas like your toes, knees, ankles, etc., where skin is tougher.  </li>
            <li> Normally I just use the cheap stuff from walmart (banana boat) or the rub on stuff called fake bake.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchase sunless tanner from some where other than Walmart, and it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> when spraying it is make sure you are further away then said on the bottle (only by a little), otherwise you will notice little streaks when wet.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Cons: Unpleasant smell (typical DHA self tanner odor, which is almost impossible to avoid with these products); slight shimmer which I am personally not a fan of.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this another star if the smell was more pleasant and if it had more of a bronze color, because it did come off as a little orangey on my skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a nasty tan smell, actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Whomever said that this spray stinks like spray tan is full of it because this smells very beachy with hints of coconut.</li>
            <li> this product gives instant and long lasting color that does not fade.</li>
            <li> I never really liked the spray on tans very much.</li>
            <li> It gives a natural looking dark tan, and does not streak.</li>
            <li> It last long.</li>
            <li> So I put a old sheet down before I spray myself.</li>
            <li> And i found that it only takes about an hour to dry and as the day goes on you will see a difference in your skin shade.</li>
            <li> If gives an instant dark tan, but once it sets, you are left with a dark, natural looking tan, that lasts for a week!</li>
            <li> Smells like dirt...like BAD dirt, not the neutral kind of smell...</li>
            <li> The only downfall is when it gets close to being empty</li>
            <li> Found it here on Amazon much less expensive, so that&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
            <li> It also transfers on to clothing and sheets, and takes a long time to dry after use.  </li>
            <li> THAT LONG!</li>
            <li> however, once dry it</li>
            <li> I put it on and let it dry and then go to bed with it.</li>
            <li> I did dry myself with my hairdryer and that seemed to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> This product will make your skin dry out</li>
            <li> It seems like it starts peeling and flaking when your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the price, being not overly expensive like some products are, but not cheap like you would find at Walmart.</li>
            <li> i bought her Dark Instant spray tanner</li>
            <li> BUT AS FAR AS THIS LOTION, DONT WASTE YOU MONEY ITS NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it makes a mess when you spray it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different sunless tanning lotions</li>
            <li> Must be careful with surrounding area during application.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you spray it, there is lots of fallout.</li>
            <li> That is why i have given four stars, because you need to know if you plan on using it before an occasion where in any way you will get wet or sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually tan with Versaspa at the local salon, but they were promoting JWOWW, so thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> but all the other reviews I read no one mentioned how sticky you would feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel sticky afterward, and it doesn&#x27;t smeel like other self tanners.</li>
            <li> The other thing is it took FOREVER to dry!!!</li>
            <li> I even have a pretty decent base tan.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my face at night, blow dry my face for a few minutes and go to bed.</li>
            <li> Im giving this 2 stars because this spray tan is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The tan that I get from it isn&#x27;t too dark</li>
            <li> I bought Jwoww&#x27;s spray dark tanning product.</li>
            <li> Color guide dark and rubs off on clothes leaving streaky look.</li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t go as dark as the jwoww.</li>
            <li> However, a slight odor does existentiële.</li>
            <li> We all know most self tanners have an awful small albeit moldy bread or fat man stench, however it generally goes away after a few showers.  </li>
            <li> I have also read that people were getting spots that were running, you can avoid this by spraying it a little farther away.</li>
            <li> Also I have had a little experience with the peeling and flaking.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes out very dark.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last-minute desperate hope to get my skin in a &#x27;presentable&#x27; mode because I have not been in the sun much at all this summer.</li>
            <li> The people that complain that it &#x27;peels&#x27; and that it has a disappointing &#x27;sticky&#x27; feeling are applying way to much at one time.</li>
            <li> Just dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> i wasted my money</li>
            <li> I absolutely wasted my money on this product, it turns you orange.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Then the next shower it was even worse.</li>
            <li> he also had trouble.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.  </li>
            <li> wanted to give a few tips as I have read others&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li> It turns orange, and I mean not pretty orange in a few hours.</li>
            <li> I did have a base when i used this but a base for me isnt much because i have a pretty pale complexion similar to jwow less the freckles</li>
            <li> Also, it runs really bad, is not consisted in all areas.&lt;br /&gt;Worse than a spray tan, atleast a spray tan can stat consistent when turning you orange.</li>
            <li> Bad smell, unnatural and orange color, and the spray is not fine enough and distributes the product unevenly.  </li>
            <li> even though i dont like leaving a negative comment i must say......</li>
            <li> Comes out thick and runny.</li>
            <li> PAULY D&#x27;S LASTED FOR A FEW WEEKS!!</li>
            <li> tha bottle is small and yes a little too expensive......</li>
            <li> Not much but just enough to look horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get an even application, then there was spots that were running, and once it gets to that point its very hard to blend it in.</li>
            <li> After an awful experience at a hair salon where my naturally blonde hair got dyed almost black</li>
            <li> And I got one use out of the can, which I sprayed all over me so that was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I have bought Victoria Secret self bronzer who is known for perfume</li>
            <li> I have tried several self-tanning products over the years, and this has been one of the worst.  </li>
            <li> and yes it was that nasty smell of a tanner like any other tanner........</li>
            <li> one thing that I hate about this spray tan (as with other ones that I&#x27;ve tried) is the horrible smell.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> But i jus hate the sticky feeling it leaves on me/:</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in it!</li>
            <li> but this stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> And the smell wasnt too terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst self tanner</li>
            <li> it was horrible</li>
            <li> OMG this is horrible.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have tried in regards to tanning sprays.</li>
            <li> its just awful.</li>
            <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t horribly offensive.</li>
            <li> It smells awful and also turns your skin orange and blotchy.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I never really liked the spray on tans very much. The color was great but the application is a little to hard to do by yourself.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning spray! I have tried a few different sunless tanning lotions and I definitely prefer this over anything else I have tried. The amount of mist that comes out is the perfect amount. I spray tan in the salons and this product is great for touch-ups and works great on my face as well. Love!</li>
            <li> I have used every fake tanner and this is BY FAR the BEST TANNER I have ever used. If gives an instant dark tan, but once it sets, you are left with a dark, natural looking tan, that lasts for a week! It&#x27;s worth the effort of buying online for sure!!</li>
            <li> I recently bought the \\&quot;Jwoww 2012 Australian Gold Sunless Tanning Spray\\&quot; and it&#x27;s amazing. I have a real good, fresh looking tan - it&#x27;s to die for! Jwoww is my favorite castmember of the Jersey Shore, next to Deena and I knew I just had to buy this. I dont regret it at all. I put this spray on after I had a spray tan done at TanPro and the color turned out amazing, its like i&#x27;ve been at the Jersey Shore with this tan. I recomend it to everybody!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP**&lt;br /&gt;Hold &amp; spray atleast a foot back so it does not become blochy, shake before you apply it to your skin!</li>
            <li> This is my favourite self tanner! I have tried many but none has ever looked as pretty or natural as this one.</li>
            <li> As a tanning consultant at one of the biggest tanning salons in the country for over 2 years, I have seen and tried about every lotion and bronzer spray under the sun. I can say that this bronzer spray is the best that I have ever tried. Whomever said that this spray stinks like spray tan is full of it because this smells very beachy with hints of coconut. My boyfriend actually thought I had a new perfume on. The nozzle is perfect, it doesn&#x27;t blast out like the California Tan bronzer spray does, it&#x27;s a really fine mist that covers evenly, with no streaks or spots. I looked 2 shades darker instantly and the rest of my tan developed over a couple of hours. I swear by this stuff its a quick way to get awesome color, especially if you&#x27;re not as tan as you&#x27;d like to be. All of JWOWW&#x27;s products are amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, i have used many self tanners and this one sets in a nice tan. I do not notice it right away however in a few hours I notice I am several shades darker.  the important note to when spraying it is make sure you are further away then said on the bottle (only by a little), otherwise you will notice little streaks when wet. however, once dry it it not noticeable. I have ordered pauly D&#x27;s spray tan and will compare the two soon! cannot wait.</li>
            <li> This is the best spray tan i have tried. Looks like a natural tan. I will order again when i run out.</li>
            <li> LIVE BY THIS STUFF FOR QUICK FACE GLOW!</li>
            <li> Ok color but this stuff is awful. Comes out thick and runny. I can&#x27;t believe she would approve this stuff. I&#x27;m finding a different and better sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> Very runny, but the color is nice. I spray it on, and imeadiatly have a  blow dryer handy to get it to dry quick so it doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product numerous times and have always been satisfied.  Even, instant color, coverage allows you to see where you are spraying and provides a great natural glow.</li>
            <li> I love the beach smell not the normal sunless smell and i dont look orange always plus will buy again for summer</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY. WHEN I GOT IT, IT HAD NO TOP, CAUSING MOST OF IT TO SPILL IN THE PACKAGE.! WHEN I APPLIED IT, IT WAS A STREAKY ORANGE! IM SURE JWOWW HERSELF DOES NOT EVNE USE IT, BECAUSE SHES  NOT ORANGE! PAULY D&#x27;S SPRAY TAN IS 50 TIMES BETTER!! AND TRUST ME, IVE BEEN TANNING FOR 9 YRS, BOTH TANNING BED AND SPRAY! PAULY D&#x27;S LASTED FOR A FEW WEEKS!! THE SPRAY TANS IN THE SALON DONT EVEN LAST THAT LONG! BUT AS FAR AS THIS LOTION, DONT WASTE YOU MONEY ITS NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> Im giving this 2 stars because this spray tan is not worth the money. I used it twice, just to see if i could make myself like it. It sprays on streaky, even if you hold the can far away. It turns orange, and I mean not pretty orange in a few hours. I even have a pretty decent base tan. The only reason it gets two starts is because It works well on my face, no breakouts. So atleast i can use the rest of the bottle for that use. Just dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this spray tan. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but it worked great. I have used so many different sprays and if you have a tan and need a kick to it this is perfect.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Goes on nicely, if you do it right. Don&#x27;t spray too much in one spot. &amp;lt;3 it!!!</li>
            <li> i bought her Dark Instant spray tanner and yes it gave you that nice orange fake  glow ... and yes it does streak and yes it was that nasty smell of a tanner like any other tanner........ i had much better result when i used  the Dior Bronzer....tha bottle is small and yes a little too expensive......and it doesn&#x27;t do what is promised to do ....  even though i dont like leaving a negative comment i must say...... i am sorry not the best product out there.......... save your money  :))</li>
            <li> This product works beautifully! Easy to use. Spray yourself in the shower. This stuff comes out very dark. My entire tan from last year was back in four hours with no tanning bed costs!</li>
            <li> One of the BEST self tanners that I have ever used!! Smells great, applies smoothly, immediate good color, and after about 4 hours AMAZING color! Very impressed, a great product that I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is the best and provides instant results!!!  No streaking, no mess and you look beaultifully tan NOT orange!  Love you Jwoww this product is the best.  I go tanning all the time and this product enhances that as well.  It sprays on evenly and dries within a couple minutes!  More than 5 stars here!</li>
            <li> The spray tan comes out really easily and evenly, but somehow it does end up a little blotchy in some places. What I do is I put it on and let it dry and then go to bed with it. Then, I rinse in the morning. The tan that I get from it isn&#x27;t too dark and it&#x27;s not too light. It looks pretty natural and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s orangey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I hate about this spray tan (as with other ones that I&#x27;ve tried) is the horrible smell. I wish there was a pleasant fragrance added because I can smell it until I wash it off and it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> Oka. I thought getting this would kinda even out my red face. (Only reason i got it) And i wasnt that impressed. I NEVER use it lol It is very glowy!! And it does give you a orange look. It feels sticky/: Uuugh i jus dont like it. And the smell wasnt too terrible. If you are prone to acne i wouldnt suggest it. Juuus wasnt that impressed. If you are already dark i think you might lik it more. But i jus hate the sticky feeling it leaves on me/:</li>
            <li> This spray does produce a nice color... not orange like a lot of self-tanners. It&#x27;s also deep, so one application is sufficient for a night out. The color shows up right away (no need to spray in advance... just do it before you leave!) and gets darker as it&#x27;s on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that since it&#x27;s so deep, you have to be extra cautious to make sure it doesn&#x27;t run. The streaks are much more noticeable than a lot of self-tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product I&#x27;ve used that I like better is the VersaSpa touch up spray. That stuff is divine. However, for the $$$ savings you get, this spray is great.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for in between tanning beds. I have only used once, but did give me color. I have to be more careful with application as it will come out blotchy if you arent careful. I dont like the smell though. I dont know if i would buy again based on that. At least Snookis bronzer lotion has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This tanning  spray is veryl effective and tans immediately.  However, a slight odor does existentiële. I would buy it againand the prices is good</li>
            <li> Nice deep tan, sans streaks or strong odor... and I&#x27;ve tried DOZENS of sunless tanners. I&#x27;m hooked on this...  I&#x27;m very fair skin btw, don&#x27;t really tan naturally at all, but when i use this people have gone so far as to assume i&#x27;m Mediteranean (lol) or that I&#x27;ve been on an extended vacation. It really does look more natural than any i&#x27;ve tried before, but i do two coats, at least 18 hours apart, for a really nice, even &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  Then, it lasts for about 5 days before it gets patchy and i need to exfoliate and re-apply.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> We all know most self tanners have an awful small albeit moldy bread or fat man stench, however it generally goes away after a few showers.  Not this product!  It&#x27;s great for color that&#x27;s even and the color lasts and lasts (awesome) however so does the smell!  I would recommend the all natural self tanner by Alba Botanicals it&#x27;s the best and smells delicious like pineapple and coconuts.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in it!</li>
            <li> Worst self tanner ive ever used color is like mud and it drips everywhere i wasted my money i advise not to buy this product it was horrible</li>
            <li> Not for darker toned people</li>
            <li> This product does get you tan..I gave it a 4 mainly because you do need to rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;Its not a product you can just spray all over without streaks but it does work for a nice tan.</li>
            <li> I absolutely wasted my money on this product, it turns you orange. Also, it runs really bad, is not consisted in all areas.&lt;br /&gt;Worse than a spray tan, atleast a spray tan can stat consistent when turning you orange.</li>
            <li> OMG this is horrible.  It has an agressive nozzle and the color makes you look like an Oompa Loompa (aka ORANGE!)! I ended up with  orange application dots.  Snooki&#x27;s is much better.</li>
            <li> JWOWW&#x27;s spray tan is a pretty good product. It goes on nicely and leaves a pretty good color, not orange at all. However, it fades quickly and as it fades it sometimes becomes a bit orange and patchy. Doesn&#x27;t have a nasty tan smell, actually smells pretty good. I find that if you use the JWOWW spray tan and Snooki&#x27;s tanning lotion afterwards it leaves you with the perfect golden tan.</li>
            <li> this product gives instant and long lasting color that does not fade. when it starts to fade, skin looks blotchy. smell isnt that great, but if your only looking for color, great product and great price!</li>
            <li> Fair skin tone, It worked great thanks! Will purchase again jwoww sunless spray works and I&#x27;m overall happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Did not change my skin color</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last-minute desperate hope to get my skin in a &#x27;presentable&#x27; mode because I have not been in the sun much at all this summer. I was satisfied with the price, being not overly expensive like some products are, but not cheap like you would find at Walmart. I usually don&#x27;t have good luck with any self-tanning product, but this one was easy to use and dried evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use, inexpensive, even application, quick drying, long lasting color&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Unpleasant smell (typical DHA self tanner odor, which is almost impossible to avoid with these products); slight shimmer which I am personally not a fan of.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this another star if the smell was more pleasant and if it had more of a bronze color, because it did come off as a little orangey on my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: be sure to FULLY exfoliate all areas of your skin before using this product, and every few days exfoliate again and reapply product to avoid streaking or blotchy color. If you use it on your face, wear a hair net or towel over your head and close your eyes and lightly spray your face.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is the lasting color, only lasts for about a week or so. That is unless each week you want to indulge your skin in staining stinky glory...Smells like dirt...like BAD dirt, not the neutral kind of smell...Also, it says tanning spray. More like a spray and &#x27;quickly smear all over yourself before it drips on your floor and stains.&#x27; NEVER buying this again...</li>
            <li> I bought Jwoww&#x27;s spray dark tanning product. This was by far the best smelling spray ever. I have bought Victoria Secret self bronzer who is known for perfume and it stunk this was great. I went to work the next day with a healthy glow. It didn&#x27;t streak and dried super quick which was a bonus. I spray it on my face at night, blow dry my face for a few minutes and go to bed. It is never on my pillow case either. I bought mine at a tanning salon and it was $40, then I ordered it on Amazon for $15..how can you beat that...True Jersey woman speaking on the product too..thanks Jwoww lovin it gurl..</li>
            <li> I recently had a kindey transplant and was informed that I could no longer tan in the sun or tanning beds for that matter. So I have been trying different self tanners (which I have never done before). I have to say by far this one is the BEST! I have only used it once and I look like I have been tannning for weeks! My friends and family are all like \\&quot;wow how did you get so dark?\\&quot; I now tell everyone to order this product. I have to tip my hat to JWOWW for creating a GREAT product!! I will def tell everyone to use this product, I am even trying to get my sister-in-law to not use tanning beds this year and use JWOWW&#x27;s Continuous Sunless Tanning Spray and to get in on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong. And it streaks I wasn&#x27;t able to get a smooth color on my legs, even with the help of a friend to apply it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchase sunless tanner from some where other than Walmart, and it was money well spent. I am very pale and do not tan easily, and this product worked great for me. It didn&#x27;t streak at all. I did dry myself with my hairdryer and that seemed to speed up the process. I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back and love it! I spray it on and use gloves to rub it in. Gives me even color and I don&#x27;t need much to cover certain areas. Those who say it turns you orange must not know how to use self tanner. I have had products cause streaking, but this doesn&#x27;t if you use it CORRECTLY! needing an instant tan for the weekend and it&#x27;s awesome. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and it lived up to what it&#x27;s supposed to be. While I didn&#x27;t get that nice dark tan I was hoping for, it is the Gold color that it is marked to be; no orange. The people that complain that it &#x27;peels&#x27; and that it has a disappointing &#x27;sticky&#x27; feeling are applying way to much at one time. Spray tans should be applied gradually, not drenching your body for desprate results. It certainly got rid of my left over bikini lines from over the summer and has made my skin a lovely soft-looking single tone which is a plus. This won&#x27;t give you a dark model tan, but it&#x27;s good for evening out any washed out parts of your body, especially the face (IF APPLIED CORRECTLY).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It last long. The only thing is that it makes a mess when you spray it. So I put a old sheet down before I spray myself. I have used self tanning spray for years and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have tried in regards to tanning sprays. It is blottchy, un even and color is undesirable. I had to rub it in with my hands to get some level of eveness. I would not buy this product. I will stick to regular brands that worked fine, just had to give this one a shot because it was supposed to be so great. Its aweful.</li>
            <li> Love this!! The color is amazing and sprays out very well! It smells awesome too!! Will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I would give it a five but it sometimes squirted at me other than that really nice color considering I&#x27;m dark skinned good product it washes off a lot in the shower but the color seems to stay it only last like 3* of using it though</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! works amazing and doesn&#x27;t streak!!! Been using this for three years now, only spray tan i will use. People complaining about streaking probably don&#x27;t know how to use it and are spraying it too close to there skin instead of holding it further away for even coverage. color shows up right away and continues to develop through out the day!!! Amazing product!!! Recommend this product to anyone who loves to be tan!!!</li>
            <li> this spray works great! but the smell is not too great. still use it because it is the only one to not turn me orange or leave brown stains on my fingers. overall worked great.</li>
            <li> This product has nice colour, but be sure and rub in immediately to make sure you get an even tan, and to prevent streaking, then wash hands right away.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell of the tan right after application and after the tan had developed. really strong odor. the color looked more orangy compared to snookies sunless tanning spray. I would just go with snookie or my favorite right now, St. Tropez tanning moose</li>
            <li> I broke out all over my arms and legs by using this product. I will never use or reccomend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. After reading all the \\&quot;rave\\&quot; reviews about this product,I was looking very forward to trying it. Thank God I only tested it on my feet and legs and didn&#x27;t spray my face like I originally planned on doing. This tanner will leave you a bright orange color, seriousley, like an oompa-loompa. All kidding aside, you will look ridicilous. After scrubbing it off with salt scrub, I still have the brown traces..its just awful. I have no idea how the other users have had such great experiences with it, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if there all JWow&#x27;s friends!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Great color. Never streaks and smells great! I will be buying more today! People are constantly complimenting my tan!</li>
            <li> When I first put this product on it looked very good and nature but after the first shower (which was over 12 hours later) it started to peal. Not much but just enough to look horrible. Then the next shower it was even worse. So all I have to say is don&#x27;t buy something just because it has a famous persons name on the front.</li>
            <li> amazing product .. :))))</li>
            <li> It made me orange. Like super orange. It was also was very streaky and would wash off. I would never consider buying it again.</li>
            <li> one of the best on the market at a good price. i can usally find it for about $10 to $13.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought them all - Bliss, Origins, Jergens. This is the only product that I like and I keep coming back and buying again. I don&#x27;t love that it comes off on my sheets (mostly just the first night) but for a even tan - that looks real and not orange. I think this is the best. I&#x27;m pretty picky!</li>
            <li> I love sunless tanning, as I&#x27;m very concerned about saving my skin from the harmful sun.  I usually tan with Versaspa at the local salon, but they were promoting JWOWW, so thought I&#x27;d try it.  Found it here on Amazon much less expensive, so that&#x27;s a huge plus! The tanner is messy, so be sure to hold it further away from your body than what they recommend.  Also, move it fast as you&#x27;re spraying, otherwise it will start running because you&#x27;ll have too much in one place. Be aware the spray soaks in quickly (not talking about drying time), especially in areas like your toes, knees, ankles, etc., where skin is tougher.  My feet looked alien after the first time I sprayed!  LOL!  I would recommend the spray, using sparingly, because it gives great dark color with 1 coat.  However, the overspray is pretty dramatic, similar to Mystic tan, which I really don&#x27;t like, so I&#x27;m still looking for a good tanner in a can where I won&#x27;t have issues with overspray.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good i have light skin with red undertones. This product will make your skin dry out and if you can&#x27;t get a hang of the continuous spray don&#x27;t get it. I&#x27;m still trying to get a hang of it if you don&#x27;t spray at a certain pace you get blotches. But overall it&#x27;s a good product to spray and go. I bought it so i could go to the beach with my family and not be the whitest one there :) And it does smell good. And i found that it only takes about an hour to dry and as the day goes on you will see a difference in your skin shade.</li>
            <li> After an awful experience at a hair salon where my naturally blonde hair got dyed almost black I realized I do not have the complexion to pull it off whatsoever. I never used anything like this before so I wasn&#x27;t sure how to do it the first time so I ingeniously over applied it all over and ended up looking like an orange dalmatian. So my advice for my fair skinned sisters be careful, don&#x27;t over apply, and read up on tips and tricks for this. Exfoliate and moisturize and this will work in your favor</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and freckles, and try to stay out of the tanning bed, so i&#x27;ve always used a spray tanner. Normally I just use the cheap stuff from walmart (banana boat) or the rub on stuff called fake bake. I actually LOVE those two products but thought there&#x27;s always room for improvment. I bought this the other day (because I realllly liked the jwoww tanning lotion). I wasn&#x27;t impressed when I used it. It&#x27;s very hard to get an even application, then there was spots that were running, and once it gets to that point its very hard to blend it in. I had my husband spray for me thinking I just wasn&#x27;t doing it right... he also had trouble. If it were my first time spray tanning I would think it&#x27;s just me... but i&#x27;ve been doing this for years and never had that problem. The one good thing I do have to say about this is the color isn&#x27;t ORANGE. it&#x27;s actually a bronzed tan look. I love the color, just wish I could get it blended well and not streaky. I had a friend say she sprays it on, then after about 5 min. she rubs lotion all over her body to make sure there&#x27;s no streaks. I will have to try that...</li>
            <li> This is a very dark self tanner and one that is applied directly without rubbing in so it can be easy to mess up.  If you spray the self tanner on correctly, gives you a great natural looking tan that stays on for a couple of days.  LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous trying this bronzer for the first time, I&#x27;ve always used the tanning bed &amp; thought I&#x27;d try something new. I worked in a tanning salon &amp; heard about every sunless bronzer out there. I decided I would give this one a try &amp; let me tell you. I absolutely love this stuff!!! It smells AMAZING. I have never used a sunless brozer that hasn&#x27;t stunk. I walked out of my room &amp; my mom said &amp;#34;WOW! that is a gorgeous color!!&amp;#34; It looks so natural, didn&#x27;t leave me orange at all &amp; no streaks! Just make sure you wash your hands immediately after applying. I waited a few mins &amp; my hands are really orange today *my own fault* I will use this over &amp; over again. Make sure you leave it on for at least 4 hours for your tan to really develop. I would recommend to anyone needing a quick natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> This worked okay but all the other reviews I read no one mentioned how sticky you would feel afterwards. The other thing is it took FOREVER to dry!!! And made a HUGE mess all in my shower!!! And I got one use out of the can, which I sprayed all over me so that was a little disappointing. The color isn&#x27;t that bad but my brother in law did say I looked like an Oompa Loompa so it does have an orange tint...</li>
            <li> It turned my skin orange and was very streaky thankfully it washed right off even after the day I gave it to set. Which was lucky for me but means it also does not stay on like the product claims it will. Like most sunless tanning products they simply cannot hold up to their claims.</li>
            <li> Kind of wet and messy. Must be careful with surrounding area during application. Smell wasn&#x27;t horribly offensive. Color guide dark and rubs off on clothes leaving streaky look. But tan much better after washing bronzer away.</li>
            <li> Love this product and lasts long time even through showering. Would definitely recommend. Very natural looking color. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best bronzer/self tanner have used...and I have tried a ton. Just be careful when you spray it, there is lots of fallout. I have taken to just spraying into my hand and applying it everywhere I can reach then stand in tub(no water:) and spray back etc. Just wash hands well and you may want to rub off nails, since this can discolor.</li>
            <li> Great product, it applies evenly! It looks great. The only downfall is when it gets close to being empty it kind of just splatters out.</li>
            <li> I actually rarely like spray tans or tanners because they make me orange and self conscious. I did have a base when i used this but a base for me isnt much because i have a pretty pale complexion similar to jwow less the freckles and I didnt feel like my skin orange when i used it. My orange stained finger and toe nails on the other hand were a different story I actually was really happy with it aside from that.</li>
            <li> Wears off on bath towels - otherwise good stuff -</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of all of the great reviews on amazon.  I have tried several self-tanning products over the years, and this has been one of the worst.  Bad smell, unnatural and orange color, and the spray is not fine enough and distributes the product unevenly.  It also transfers on to clothing and sheets, and takes a long time to dry after use.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.  Instead, try a product like Fake Bake Flawless or Banana Boat.</li>
            <li> Once i had stopped indoor tanning, I wanted to keep my tan up. The salon that I not only worked at, but tanned at sold this product. A lot of customers liked it. It was quick and easy for touch-ups, not only on spray tans, but also if you were going somewhere and wanted a glow on top of your tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the discount I had, amazon was still cheaper. I have liked it a lot, but with sunless tanners there is always a drawback, they may say they won&#x27;t streak or when you sweat it will stay put, that isn&#x27;t the case. That is why i have given four stars, because you need to know if you plan on using it before an occasion where in any way you will get wet or sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product has treated me well. I used it before going into work to have a glow on top of my tan. And I rarely tanned to begin with. Another product that I have loved over the uses is the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Beach Sexy tanning spray. Works a little bit better in my opinion and doesn&#x27;t come out as concentrated so you can start out with a little and build upon it.</li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners and this one is my new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it smells good and you can apply in layers. I wait 5 min in between.&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned and this gives me a ton of color.&lt;br /&gt;Use in your shower though because this will tan the bathroom floor!!!&lt;br /&gt;I do apply lotion on my knees , feet, elbows, ect. Anywhere that color could pool in wrinkles before applying the tanning spray.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you price shop on this one! Some places have it listed for $40 while others have it for $16.&lt;br /&gt;I also like tan towels and jergens medium tanning lotion. But they don&#x27;t go as dark as the jwoww.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite sunless tanning spray - it gives you a beautiful golden tan, looks natural and lasts longer than other products. Definitely would buy again!</li>
            <li> My wife actually bought this, so I&#x27;ll let her saw what she wants:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from Suntan City, for $30-something dollars. It&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon. I like this product better than the VersaSpa self-tanning macine at the tanning bed. I don&#x27;t feel sticky afterward, and it doesn&#x27;t smeel like other self tanners. You have to be careful how much you spray; you can easily turn yourself into an oompa-loompa! All in all, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased JWOW sunless tanning spray. I love this stuff! I have used many other similar products in the past and this is by far my favorite. It gives a natural looking dark tan, and does not streak. The bottle sprays evenly and easily. I have received many compliments on my tan.&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to give a few tips as I have read others&#x27; reviews. Firstly it would be best to spray yourself in the shower because this stuff will spray and stain the bathroom floor or your surroundings. Also I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this on very fair skin people. This comes out pretty dark so it might not look right on really white skin. I have also read that people were getting spots that were running, you can avoid this by spraying it a little farther away. Don&#x27;t spray so close. It will come out more evenly too the further it is sprayed from your body. Also I have had a little experience with the peeling and flaking. I have found that by using lotion and keeping your body very moisturized starting the day after You spray yourself, this does help. It seems like it starts peeling and flaking when your skin is dry. Because this did happen to me but only in certain spots on my body. Parts where my skin was more dry.&lt;br /&gt;After I had all that down, the product is great. The tan lasts for a pretty long time and it&#x27;s a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> this is a horrid product. It smells awful and also turns your skin orange and blotchy. I will stick with another product that I have found that actually works well. I would not recommend this to anyone! Unless you like looking orange!</li>
