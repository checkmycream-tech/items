            <li>Great color match &amp; coverage.</li>
            <li>Gives you great color and coverage.  </li>
            <li>but I think it will be great in the summer.</li>
            <li>This product is great if you do not want to use a liquid foundation every day.</li>
            <li>Great tinted moisterzer.</li>
            <li>I can ususally get 2 1/2 - 3 months from one tube, so the value is great too.  </li>
            <li>Good things amazon sells it</li>
            <li>Light weight and blends perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I sincerely recommend!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It blends really well and makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li>has a nice texture not sticky and goes on even.</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice beachy glow anytime of the year.</li>
            <li>It has 20 SPF and applies very smoothly on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a very light version of Korean BB cream.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a variety of shades and is great for the whole year.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more and praying that my acne scars fade by time the product discontinues.</li>
            <li>This product is more of an orange color in person than it appears in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I go tanning regularly so most products like this one match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I love this face tint.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 95% sure Too</li>
            <li>Korean BB creams seem to cover better and diffuse imperfections.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly better than Garnier&#x27;s BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, I like it much better during winter months.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I like it better than foundation because of the additional benefits to my skin.  </li>
            <li>There are so many out there now, so</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy with non greasy feel and lasts all day for a light even coverage.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It has a light feel on the face</li>
            <li>For those with drier skin, I really can&#x27;t give an honest assessment.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is really good and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin or even combination skin and the weather is warm to hot, this will melt right off your face.  </li>
            <li>This tinted moisturizer has a beautiful and radiant finish just like the other shades</li>
            <li>Very natural, goes on easy with make-up brush, sheer but good coverage.</li>
            <li>The BB Cream has more coverage than a tinted moisturizer, but blends just as easlily and looks very natural on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the Too Faced line anyways, but this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am disappointed in &amp;#34;beach glow&amp;#34; but I will definitely go back and try a shade that matches my skin better based off the gorgeous finish and excellent ingredients!</li>
            <li>Right now it is priced at $22 which is better than the big box beauty stores.  </li>
            <li>like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I do not have to use very much &amp; when applying I mix it in my palms with my face sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchase of this product.&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have bought my second tube, the first one lasted for more than 6 mths with every day use.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t last more than 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li>I love that the SPF covers with out being white n chalky.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the color, however, during the Summer months I prefer a lite coverage and this balm had the feel of regular makeup.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this beauty balm, I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li>but I had to rectify it by adding a decent amount of powder on top, which totally defeats the purpose of beauty balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really upset because now they don&#x27;t have anything for us darker women on Sephora or TooFaced.com.</li>
            <li>It was very orange.</li>
            <li>I bought from another company last year and the expiration dates were way out, giving me more than enough time to use all three tubes before the expiration date.</li>
            <li>It is so close to my natural color, you have to look really close to see that I am wearing any makeup at all.  </li>
            <li>so i would pick a lighter shade than normal.</li>
            <li>and I have a healthy summer glow year round.  </li>
            <li>This tan shade is super orange and not natural looking!</li>
            <li>The beach glow color looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product however the color is much darker than expected.</li>
            <li>It is light to the skin, covers your pores and gives a good make up base.</li>
            <li>My guess is that the formula is a bit old, which is why there was a color change.</li>
            <li>I get pretty dark in the summer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it was exactly what I ordered and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>As far as how long it last, that depends on your skin type and the weather.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t wanna be forced to use another bb cream because too faced works wonders on me and the other shade is too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> product has lasted very well especially considering I have used a small amount mixed with sunscreen on my arms &amp; legs.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I will just keep it, throw it away and be VERY careful in the future.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I am 4 starring vs 5 is specifically because the BEACH color I purchased is so orange and dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium to dark skin, olive-toned Italian to give you a point of reference.  </li>
            <li> I resorted to using Amazon, but unfortunately the formula just seems a little light.</li>
            <li> does not have coverage like a foundation and the color for medium is really dark even for already tan skin</li>
            <li> This product was just a little too orange for my taste.  </li>
            <li> and it is not too heavy or sticky for the summer time.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure.  </li>
            <li> It seems like you need to dispurse a lot of product at once because it can be hard to rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Sucks it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Good,however a bit thick for my taste.</li>
            <li> Addicted to this color</li>
            <li> I put it away until the weather gets cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that this shade is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> Try this in your skintone you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant experience!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was my fav color. Sucks it was discontinued. Bought a couple to tide me over while I find something similar.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. It comes in a variety of shades and is great for the whole year. It applies best with your finger tips or a make up sponge. It blends really well and makes my skin look great! No need for foundation. And it has SPF!</li>
            <li> I love this!!! This is the best bb cream I haver ever used. I purchased this in the shade beach glow and it is the perfect color for my skin tone. For some reason I think they are discontinuing this color, because they don&#x27;t sell beach glow in stores and it&#x27;s on the website in the on sale section and when you click on it a error message pops up. Good things amazon sells it and it&#x27;s not expired or nothing!!! I will be purchasing more and praying that my acne scars fade by time the product discontinues. It has some added Benifits as well. Such as,abti aging properties and added spf. I don&#x27;t wanna be forced to use another bb cream because too faced works wonders on me and the other shade is too light for my skin tone. Try this in your skintone you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> This product is more of an orange color in person than it appears in the picture.  I go tanning regularly so most products like this one match my skin tone.  This product was just a little too orange for my taste.  It seems like you need to dispurse a lot of product at once because it can be hard to rub into the skin.  It has a light feel on the face and it is not too heavy or sticky for the summer time.  Overll I just don&#x27;t like the tint of the product on my skintone.</li>
            <li> I love this face tint. It has 20 SPF and applies very smoothly on my skin. The coverage is really good and not heavy at all. But the best part is how it makes my skin look so dewey and glowing.  Love this</li>
            <li> color is too orange. Coverage not so great</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchase of this product.&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product very much. I do not have to use very much &amp; when applying I mix it in my palms with my face sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This product has lasted very well especially considering I have used a small amount mixed with sunscreen on my arms &amp; legs.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> It was awful. It made me look like an oompa loompa! So orange!!!! I used it once and washed it off.</li>
            <li> Great color match &amp; coverage. Goes on easy with non greasy feel and lasts all day for a light even coverage. I&#x27;m very disappointed that this shade is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, with lots of beneficial elements for your skin.  I even use it all over my eyes since it also acts as a primer.  The ONLY reason I am 4 starring vs 5 is specifically because the BEACH color I purchased is so orange and dark I don&#x27;t see how anyone can use it.  I now purchase NUDE glow and its just perfect; truly gives my skin a glow!  I sincerely recommend!</li>
            <li> has a nice texture not sticky and goes on even. does not have coverage like a foundation and the color for medium is really dark even for already tan skin so i would pick a lighter shade than normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 95% sure Too Faced has discontinued this BB cream which is a shame because it&#x27;s a beautiful color for us ladies who are in the NC-45 range. I&#x27;m really upset because now they don&#x27;t have anything for us darker women on Sephora or TooFaced.com. I resorted to using Amazon, but unfortunately the formula just seems a little light. My guess is that the formula is a bit old, which is why there was a color change. Just bring it back Too Faced!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gives you great color and coverage.  Works well with being at the beach!</li>
            <li> Very natural, goes on easy with make-up brush, sheer but good coverage. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product however the color is much darker than expected. I get pretty dark in the summer so I&#x27;m saving for then. I could mix it with a lighter shade but I think it will be great in the summer.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say there&#x27;s a reason this shade (beach glow) is &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34;. This tan shade is super orange and not natural looking! This tinted moisturizer has a beautiful and radiant finish just like the other shades but I had to rectify it by adding a decent amount of powder on top, which totally defeats the purpose of beauty balm. I am disappointed in &amp;#34;beach glow&amp;#34; but I will definitely go back and try a shade that matches my skin better based off the gorgeous finish and excellent ingredients!</li>
            <li> This product is great if you do not want to use a liquid foundation every day. It is light to the skin, covers your pores and gives a good make up base. I have bought my second tube, the first one lasted for more than 6 mths with every day use.</li>
            <li> Good,however a bit thick for my taste. The color was a bit darker than I thought and looks a bit caked on.</li>
            <li> I bought Too Faced version of BB cream last summer from another vendor. The color is close to NC42 for those who use MAC.  It is a very light version of Korean BB cream.  It lacks the weight and density of Missha.  Some people might prefer a lighter feel to their BB cream.  The price for this BB cream is excellent here on Amazon.  Right now it is priced at $22 which is better than the big box beauty stores.  The coverage is nothing like the Korean BB cream.  It doesn&#x27;t blur out imperfections like Missha does.  Korean BB creams seem to cover better and diffuse imperfections.  However for those who want SPF protection with moisturizing benefits and a hint of color, this is the product for them.  Will I buy this again?  I am not sure.  It is slightly better than Garnier&#x27;s BB cream.  As far as how long it last, that depends on your skin type and the weather.  If you have oily skin or even combination skin and the weather is warm to hot, this will melt right off your face.  For those with drier skin, I really can&#x27;t give an honest assessment.  I used this along with powder to set it and it didn&#x27;t last more than 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> Great tinted moisterzer. Light weight and blends perfectly with my skin tone. I love that the SPF covers with out being white n chalky. Addicted to this color</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the color, however, during the Summer months I prefer a lite coverage and this balm had the feel of regular makeup. I put it away until the weather gets cold. Hopefully, I like it much better during winter months.</li>
            <li> Love this. Gives you a nice beachy glow anytime of the year.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this beauty balm, I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I&#x27;m a big fan of the Too Faced line anyways, but this product is amazing.  I wear it with their Primed and Poreless Primer and their Chocolate Soleil Bronzer and I have a healthy summer glow year round.  The BB Cream has more coverage than a tinted moisturizer, but blends just as easlily and looks very natural on.  It also seems to last longer.  I like it better than foundation because of the additional benefits to my skin.  The beach glow color looks very natural on me. It is so close to my natural color, you have to look really close to see that I am wearing any makeup at all.  I&#x27;m a medium to dark skin, olive-toned Italian to give you a point of reference.  I can ususally get 2 1/2 - 3 months from one tube, so the value is great too.  There are so many out there now, so if you have been thinking about trying a BB cream, I recommend the Too Faced version.</li>
            <li> I only give 3 stars because I purposely buy this product in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; - three tubes at a time since Too Faced discontinued this color and it&#x27;s my favorite. Therefore, the expiration date should be further out than this year.....I bought from another company last year and the expiration dates were way out, giving me more than enough time to use all three tubes before the expiration date. Hopefully now I&#x27;ll use all three before November....&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it was exactly what I ordered and arrived earlier than expected. So if expiration dates aren&#x27;t your problem, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This makeup looked nothing like a beach glow! It was very orange. When I tried to return, was told it would be reduced refund, restocking fee and my cost of return. Very unpleasant experience!! I will just keep it, throw it away and be VERY careful in the future.</li>
