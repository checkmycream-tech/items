            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than my terry towel turban twist.</li>
            <li>Maybe a ton of fabric softener will make it more &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; feeling to my hands.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>We love our Turbie Twists.  </li>
            <li>I think the product has been improved because it is more absorbent.</li>
            <li>This works much better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Have had one for years and bought more for Christmas.</li>
            <li>love it....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it dries my hair any faster, but it nice and light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly for long, curly hair.</li>
            <li>and it stays perfectly in place and does seem to help dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This towel is easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a longer one, but this works fine as it.  </li>
            <li>The Turbie is so comfy and stays securely in place.</li>
            <li>But, overall.... it is a great item.  </li>
            <li>great.. everything as expected</li>
            <li>Good, simple product!</li>
            <li>I got a rich blue color which looks nice.</li>
            <li>I use it for hot oil treatments and just getting my hair out of my face while I clean the house.</li>
            <li>After diligent use, I decided my hair didn&#x27;t dry better in my turbie twist than it does in a good old fashioned bun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Satisfied so far with my purchase.</li>
            <li>So being the nice guy that I am, I surprised her with 3 new ones...</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair (but a lot of it), and this seems to do fine staying in place and absorbing water.</li>
            <li>It dries the hair better than a towel and is efficient after shampooing and just as efficient for second use after conditioning and rinsing.</li>
            <li>I bought it fully aware of the fact that it was &amp;#34;microfiber&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It pretty much works like the thinner cotton terry towel I have used on my hair for years.</li>
            <li>I can wear it while getting ready in the morning, running frantically around the house</li>
            <li>I have a straight style to my hair which emphasizes frizz</li>
            <li>They are advertised as microfiber ( which by definition is a fabric made from synthetic fibers which makes them absorbent and fast drying).  </li>
            <li>Turbie Twist fits around my head, it&#x27;s long enough to hold all of my hair, absorbs water and wraps up nicely.</li>
            <li>This works better than the previous twist towel I had with a button.</li>
            <li>Works well on most hair lengths (I let my hair grow out from shoulder length to middle of my back</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice compact hair towel that actually stays on, but it does not dry hair faster than a regular towel.</li>
            <li>Took me a few times to figure out how to get it tight enough so it didn&#x27;t slip to the side, but once you wrap it tightly, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>All of my hair fits in it, it twists easily, and after just five minutes, I pulled my hair out, and it was even a little more dry than with a regular towel.</li>
            <li>It was kind of thin but had the job done very well.</li>
            <li>I read online and realized from using a regular cotton towel that my towel was absorbing too much moisture from my hair, resulting in frizz.</li>
            <li>I WAS VERY SURPRISED.</li>
            <li>very soft and absorbent</li>
            <li>I either have to use a huge body towel to wrap up my hair, which is heavy and makes me feel lop-sided</li>
            <li>This towel is so soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li>and I have pretty long hair.</li>
            <li>must say I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works.</li>
            <li>I do not have curly hair, but a natural wave.</li>
            <li>Towel and hair dried quickly.</li>
            <li>I was able to towel dry my hair and wash my face without fighting with a heavy towel!</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that the material is rather thin, so it works fine but is not as highly absorbent as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair any quicker than a regular towel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging says it&#x27;s extra long for long hair, but I still have to fold my hair in at the end.</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair and wanted a quick-drying towel that would stay on my head and keep my hair from frizzing so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very thin cloth and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a separate bath towel to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I also never blow dry it, so it takes hours to dry, even after towel drying.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick, pretty curly hair and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair being any less frizzy from using this towel over a regular cotton towel.</li>
            <li> My wife has had one of these for years and loves it, but the little loop finally gave out.</li>
            <li> It has a little loop in the back to tuck in the wrapped up end.</li>
            <li> Not really absorbant.</li>
            <li> These towels are not fast drying because they are made from 100% cotton.  </li>
            <li> Not the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> My hair length is down to my chest to give you an idea of how long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, past my shoulder blades long.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair, almost to my waist, and not only do I look stupid throwing my hair up in my regular towel to dry it, it soaks up a lot of moisture, making it not as useful to dry the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> For one towel, I&#x27;m disappointed and would not have purchased it, had I known better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cut my hair drying time down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and wrapping it in a large towel is too bulky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this happened but every single time I use it, it ends up smelling like mildew.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> My hair hangs down to my bra brand and this towel is a little too small for my hair even though it&#x27;s supposed to be for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I purposely chose a microfiber one for two reasons: 1) lighter weight than cotton; 2) less drying.</li>
            <li> Guys, it&#x27;s all about the little things.</li>
            <li> The towel smelled like mildew after one use, and I dried it by hanging it up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Way too small for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick longer hair and does not fit.</li>
            <li> or I use a small hand towel, which doesn&#x27;t wrap around my head or hold all my hair and it falls off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays in place and isn&#x27;t heavy to walk around with!</li>
            <li> It took me a couple tries to figure out how to keep the twist in place with the loop, but it&#x27;s not at all difficult.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely thick hair, helps cut drying time.</li>
            <li> Just wish I had gotten it in pink. :(</li>
            <li> Feels weird.  </li>
            <li> and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I hate that color choice isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in these hair towels.</li>

            <li> Great item to have in your towel closet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it dries my hair any faster, but it nice and light and easy to use. Wish I had gotten it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this is awesome. Absorbs water immediately. Easy to use. Will purchase another one.</li>
            <li> This should considered be an essential.</li>
            <li> I love it but I hate that color choice isn&#x27;t an option. I got brown and I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> I am still using it. It&#x27;s great for showering and washing my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I was unsure before I ordered it about the way the towel loops into itself to hold in place. This works better than the previous twist towel I had with a button.</li>
            <li> These towels are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Way too small for my hair. I have thick longer hair and does not fit. My hair length is down to my chest to give you an idea of how long. I would like it if they had size options because the idea is great but the execution is not so great.</li>
            <li> Works well and I have pretty long hair. Glad I bought it. It&#x27;s cut my hair drying time down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is easy to use and does a great job damp drying my hair. I like it much better than my terry towel turban twist.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it was mis-advertised... I bought it fully aware of the fact that it was &amp;#34;microfiber&amp;#34;.  The item is actually awesome, but I am NOT a fan of microfiber.  Feels weird.  Maybe a ton of fabric softener will make it more &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; feeling to my hands.  But, overall.... it is a great item.  I use it for hot oil treatments and just getting my hair out of my face while I clean the house.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I mis read the details but I thought I was purchasing two towels and that the price was a good deal.  For one towel, I&#x27;m disappointed and would not have purchased it, had I known better.</li>
            <li> TURBIE TWIST WORKS JUST AS IT STATES. I WAS VERY SURPRISED. PUT IT ON AND I COULD DO WHAT EVER I WANTED WITH OUT IT COMING LOSE. EASY TO USE. IT IS PERFECT. I REALLY LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My SO bought me the Turbie Twist from another store as a practical surprise present. I have very long, thick hair, almost to my waist, and not only do I look stupid throwing my hair up in my regular towel to dry it, it soaks up a lot of moisture, making it not as useful to dry the rest of my body. I also never blow dry it, so it takes hours to dry, even after towel drying. I wasn&#x27;t terribly excited to receive this gift, considering the poor track record of the quality of the As Seen on TV products, but decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works. All of my hair fits in it, it twists easily, and after just five minutes, I pulled my hair out, and it was even a little more dry than with a regular towel. I will keep using it to save my regular bath towel from its former drowning state.</li>
            <li> We love our Turbie Twists.  Wish there was a longer one, but this works fine as it.  I&#x27;m ordering another as a spare.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool. I use it at night while I sleep when I do coconut oil treatment for my hair. Sometimes it falls off but I am definitely a mover in my sleep so that probably why. I got a rich blue color which looks nice.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, past my shoulder blades long. I either have to use a huge body towel to wrap up my hair, which is heavy and makes me feel lop-sided or I use a small hand towel, which doesn&#x27;t wrap around my head or hold all my hair and it falls off.&lt;br /&gt;The Turbie Twist fits around my head, it&#x27;s long enough to hold all of my hair, absorbs water and wraps up nicely. It has a little loop in the back to tuck in the wrapped up end. It stays in place and isn&#x27;t heavy to walk around with!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an absorbent towel for my hair without the bulk and harshness of a regular towel. This is just what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> I have had a Turbie Twist for years and it wore out so I ordered this one. I think the product has been improved because it is more absorbent. Works well on most hair lengths (I let my hair grow out from shoulder length to middle of my back and it still works great).</li>
            <li> After diligent use, I decided my hair didn&#x27;t dry better in my turbie twist than it does in a good old fashioned bun.</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars since I&#x27;ve never had a cotton Turbie Twist to compare it to. I have short, fine hair (but a lot of it), and this seems to do fine staying in place and absorbing water. I purposely chose a microfiber one for two reasons: 1) lighter weight than cotton; 2) less drying. I read online and realized from using a regular cotton towel that my towel was absorbing too much moisture from my hair, resulting in frizz. I do not have curly hair, but a natural wave. I have a straight style to my hair which emphasizes frizz if there&#x27;s any present. Satisfied so far with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This works much better than I thought it would. I have very long, very thick, pretty curly hair and this worked well. Just wish I had gotten it in pink. :(</li>
            <li> Have had one for years and bought more for Christmas. Gifts</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in these hair towels. They are advertised as microfiber ( which by definition is a fabric made from synthetic fibers which makes them absorbent and fast drying).  These towels are not fast drying because they are made from 100% cotton.  They are not as advertised.</li>
            <li> great.. everything as expected</li>
            <li> love it....very soft and absorbent</li>
            <li> Works as described! Use it every time I wash my hair. I will never go without one again.</li>
            <li> Very thin cloth and cheaply made. Not the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. The fabric is kind of rhins, so I can&#x27;t say I would buy this one again, but I use it anyway.</li>
            <li> This is great to use while traveling. Towel and hair dried quickly.</li>
            <li> Oh my, yes! Love this. Arrived on time. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great hair towel got one for my mom too</li>
            <li> Good, simple product! Keeps my hair up and out of the way while I&#x27;m drying off. It took me a couple tries to figure out how to keep the twist in place with the loop, but it&#x27;s not at all difficult. My only complaint is that the material is rather thin, so it works fine but is not as highly absorbent as I&#x27;d like. Still, would definitely recommend, especially for the price.</li>
