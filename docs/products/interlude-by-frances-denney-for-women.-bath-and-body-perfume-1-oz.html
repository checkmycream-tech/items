            <li>It is very sensuous and lasting and evokes a warm scent and feeling.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast..</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, a little sweet, but it is wonderful, and the fragrance last all day.  </li>
            <li>and I felt it was a little mature for me, but people said that it smelled beautiful on me, and it became my second favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is exactly how I remembered it.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I had been looking for...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!  </li>
            <li>From the time I first found it in a department store, I have always had a bottle sitting on my dresser.</li>
            <li>this inconvenience I will most likely use it for the remainder of my life.</li>
            <li>First of all, this product is 100% pure fragrance oil.</li>
            <li>I always considered it lovely and elegant, but at the same time dark, powdery, and very \\&quot;old-school.\\&quot; I was in high school at the time and went for the fruity drugstore body sprays instead.     </li>
            <li>THANKS  </li>
            <li>this is very oriental and reminds of my Mother during the 40s and 50s.  </li>
            <li>My very childhood is this smell.  </li>
            <li>Well I found this on Amazon and it is the closest to the real thing that I could find.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Have absolutely adored this fragrance  for fifty years.  </li>
            <li>WOW, WOW,WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>This is a delicious, seductive, very well-constructed scent and it&#x27;s actually quite soft and subtle once it settles.</li>
            <li>Evidently the product jhas changed and my wife does not feel she likes the new one.</li>
            <li>Not the same as the original.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will be getting the other interlude products eventually.</li>
            <li>It has certain elements that remind me of each of these scents, as well as an overall sense of being a classic, dressed-up fragrance with some real character and gravitas.</li>
            <li>When my friends or family are looking for a different perfume or even a first perfume I recommend Interlude.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new version is not as intense and is missing some critical ingredient to make it smaell like the original.</li>
            <li>Classy fragrance that stays with you for a while.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing it since I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li>The scent seems to be different, not as intense.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance purchasing this bath &amp; body oil, basing it on a dim memory of that haunting waft from the bottle on my mom&#x27;s dresser.</li>
            <li>old, i&#x27;m now 65.</li>
            <li>I used Interlude since the early 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It opens with a burst of tropical flowers and green moss, followed quickly by lush woods and an indescribable soapy/spicy note that&#x27;s just plain gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Somehow they do not smell the same as my older purchases.</li>
            <li>They sent a second bottle and it was the same as the first.</li>
            <li>it actually smelled old and musty.  </li>
            <li>Although the scent is similar to other old standards, this is the only fragrance that I consistently get compliments</li>
            <li>was disappointed  but not in the seller or speed of delivery - they were great.</li>

            <li> I love it and will be getting the other interlude products eventually.</li>
            <li> It has certain elements that remind me of each of these scents, as well as an overall sense of being a classic, dressed-up fragrance with some real character and gravitas.</li>
            <li> When my friends or family are looking for a different perfume or even a first perfume I recommend Interlude.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new version is not as intense and is missing some critical ingredient to make it smaell like the original.</li>
            <li> Classy fragrance that stays with you for a while.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it since I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to be different, not as intense.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance purchasing this bath &amp; body oil, basing it on a dim memory of that haunting waft from the bottle on my mom&#x27;s dresser.</li>
            <li> old, i&#x27;m now 65.</li>
            <li> I used Interlude since the early 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It opens with a burst of tropical flowers and green moss, followed quickly by lush woods and an indescribable soapy/spicy note that&#x27;s just plain gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Somehow they do not smell the same as my older purchases.</li>
            <li> They sent a second bottle and it was the same as the first.</li>
            <li> it actually smelled old and musty.  </li>
            <li> Although the scent is similar to other old standards, this is the only fragrance that I consistently get compliments</li>
            <li> was disappointed  but not in the seller or speed of delivery - they were great.</li>
            <li> Smells soft and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It holds its scent a long time.</li>
            <li> If you like Aromatics Elixir, Royal Secret, Chantilly, Diva, or Paloma Picasso, this one is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> My Mother who is age 86 has been using this perfume for years and for some reason it&#x27;s hard to find where we live.  </li>
            <li> only downside which is usually the case for this item is that the spray mechanism stops working properly.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle but don&#x27;t worry, it lasts such a long time due to its potency.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume and was disappointed until I found it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> But I am very sorry that  Hope body and bath perfume isn&#x27;t   available.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed, as the original, as I remember  was somewhat denser and definitely had a scent that stayed longer.</li>
            <li> It is indeed as dark and powdery as I remember, but that&#x27;s no longer offputting to me.</li>
            <li> This oil perfume has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I was extremely dissappointed!</li>
            <li> Not interested in any other product!!</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that I can dab behind my ears and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It is as I remembered but, a little heavier than what I&#x27;ve been wearing for the past few years.</li>
            <li> a little goes a loooonnngg way!</li>
            <li> The prices were unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to see if product was as stated.  </li>

            <li> It works beautifully on me, not a jarring note in this composition.       </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite perfume....a little goes a loooonnngg way!</li>
            <li> As a  person who had used Frances Denney Interlude for over thirty (20) years, I was very excited to be able to find it again.  That was until three weeks after I started using this bottle.  The fragrance changed and became rancid. I do not know where you are getting this product, but it is definitely not the quality that Frances Denney has been noted for.  I was extremely dissappointed!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love the way this perfume mingles with my body&#x27;s chemistry.  It alters with my mood.  Meaning good to really good</li>
            <li> Loved it for 50 years</li>
            <li> This oil perfume has never let me down. Always getting compliments on the fragrance. And it stays with you all day. I never have to re apply.</li>
            <li> The store where I used to get my perfume discontinued selling it.  I just love this perfume and was disappointed until I found it on Amazon.com.  Now I know where to go for my buying needs.</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied with this purchase.  The fragrance is exactly how I remembered it.</li>
            <li> I wore this about 20 years ago and it just recently resurfaced  in my thoughts and I&#x27;m so glad that it did.  Classy fragrance that stays with you for a while.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I had been looking for...so glad Amazon carries this.  The shipping was very fast..good value for the money.  Same quality as I had before.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> My Mother who is age 86 has been using this perfume for years and for some reason it&#x27;s hard to find where we live.  I found it on this site so when she needs it I order it for her.  Thank you very much.  I know she appreciates it.</li>
            <li> My wife drives a me crazy wearing this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;She has shared this with me for over 40 years.  When&lt;br /&gt;I win LOTTO .. I&#x27;m buying the Co. and advertise it.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I ORDERED!  THANKS  TO YOU MY SISTER IS VERY HAPPY!</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for selling Interlude - this is very oriental and reminds of my Mother during the 40s and 50s.  It is very sensuous and lasting and evokes a warm scent and feeling.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find in any store anymore-loved this perfume for decades!</li>
            <li> Smells soft and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My very childhood is this smell.  She has worn this since I was a tiny girl and I just turned 50.  She&#x27;s pushing 80 and it&#x27;s still her favorite over all parfumes she has tried.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the original...</li>
            <li> I love Interlude. I have been wearing it since I was 19 years old. I&#x27;m happy that I can still get it.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I was given this perfume by friends, but through the years lost track of it.  Just a dab lasts all day.  It&#x27;s a rich oil, many use like perfume, and it has a unique and superior scent, because it&#x27;s so strong, it may have to grow on some.  I was 20 and I felt it was a little mature for me, but people said that it smelled beautiful on me, and it became my second favorite perfume.  I wondered if it still existed, and if it would still be the same wonderful fragrance it was then, 39 years ago.  I was thrilled to find it again, and it smells as lovely as ever!  Thank you, Amazon for the perfume and the great price!</li>
            <li> Interlude is one of my favorite perfumes. It has a great light scent.  When my friends or family are looking for a different perfume or even a first perfume I recommend Interlude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered right on time.</li>
            <li> Very pleased will order again</li>
            <li> Love it , Love It!!! Smells great and the price is right. 5 stars for Interlude. I LOVVVVVE IT!!!!!!!!! its an amzing perfume!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original.  They have changed it and thinned it.</li>
            <li> have used interlude for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I have worn for years! It is unique and not over powering. I receive compliments from strangers often.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to be different, not as intense.  Do not get as many compliments when wearing it. Did you change the formula?</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time!  I love &amp;#34;Interlude Bath &amp; Body!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This used to be my signature fragrance and since I couldn&#x27;t find it in the dept stores for some time, thought it had gone out of business.  So happy to have found it once again.</li>
            <li> Very soft, a little sweet, but it is wonderful, and the fragrance last all day.  It&#x27;s hard to find anywhere else, so I keep shopping at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This was my favorite fragrance 30 years ago. I was sad when it was discontinued in the stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great to find it again.</li>
            <li> It seems like every time I find a perfume that I love and that others give me complements on they discontinue it!  Well I found this on Amazon and it is the closest to the real thing that I could find.  To put is simply I LOVE it.  The first time I wore it the complements started:)  This is the only perfume that I can dab behind my ears and it lasts all day.  It is more like an oil but not greasy. It comes in a small bottle but don&#x27;t worry, it lasts such a long time due to its potency.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the bottle of Interlude sent to me.  It did not smell anything like the Interlude I remembered when introduced to it by a college friend who gave it to me for Christmas....it actually smelled old and musty.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m not even wearing it...just sits in my bathroom cabinet.  It couldn&#x27;t be returned because I had already opened it.</li>
            <li> this product works great; very satisfied customer I will surely recommend to a friend. Have A Great Day and thanks</li>
            <li> I have used only Interlude  bath and body perfume for 48 years!!!! There is nothing else that compares. I love the scent. Wonderful!!!! Glad I can find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> The prices were unbelievable.  I was anxious to see if product was as stated.  Thrilled to get the product as stated in the ad.  Will continue to order through Amazon.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used Interlude for many (many)years (smile) and i am sooooooo happy to be able to still get it through you.Thank you so much for your prompt delivery.This is the ONLY purfume that will stay with me all day.Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;  Sheila</li>
            <li> I just opened my Frances Denny purchase and it will not spray. What can I do?</li>
            <li> As advertised, with fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND INTERLUDE AGAIN. I LOVED WEARING IT IN THE 80&#x27;S AND I LOVE IT NOW. NICE PRODUCT SMELLS BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for 30 years and i love it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was not as I remembered from my younger days.  I also never remembered it being in oil form.</li>
            <li> I wore this perfume for years and it was my signature fragrance. It is as I remembered but, a little heavier than what I&#x27;ve been wearing for the past few years. As you age your body chemistry changes so I don&#x27;t wear it every day like I used to but it is a very sexy, warm fragrance and brings back a lot of wonderful memories.</li>
            <li> Worn this for over 25 years my favorite</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying FRances Denney products for over 30 years. I love Interlude. But I am very sorry that  Hope body and bath perfume isn&#x27;t   available. That is my very favorite and I always received so many compliments when I wore it. But Interlude is also very, very fine. Please make Hope available again.  Thank you. janecrawford@sbcglobal.net</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in these bottles. Somehow they do not smell the same as my older purchases. The color is lighter, but the smell is different also. I will still use it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Fragrance net was very nice to deal with. They sent a second bottle and it was the same as the first. Evidently the product jhas changed and my wife does not feel she likes the new one. AShe is used to the original Interlude Bath and Body Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I have today returned both bottle and the lit and samples to fragrance net, Please ceredit my account and confirm.</li>
            <li> I remembered my mom having a bottle of Interlude on her dresser, back in the &#x27;80s. I always considered it lovely and elegant, but at the same time dark, powdery, and very \\&quot;old-school.\\&quot; I was in high school at the time and went for the fruity drugstore body sprays instead.     Now I&#x27;m 40, and my tastes (possibly also my chemistry) have changed. I took a chance purchasing this bath &amp; body oil, basing it on a dim memory of that haunting waft from the bottle on my mom&#x27;s dresser. And it&#x27;s even better than I remembered!     First of all, this product is 100% pure fragrance oil. That makes it phenomenally rich and long-lasting, and the real complexity of the fragrance is in full bloom. I can see how Interlude is categorized as an Oriental scent; it does have a base of vanilla and sandalwood, but there is no lingering sweetness or spiciness. I&#x27;d call it more of a floral chypre. It opens with a burst of tropical flowers and green moss, followed quickly by lush woods and an indescribable soapy/spicy note that&#x27;s just plain gorgeous. It is indeed as dark and powdery as I remember, but that&#x27;s no longer offputting to me. This is a delicious, seductive, very well-constructed scent and it&#x27;s actually quite soft and subtle once it settles. It works beautifully on me, not a jarring note in this composition.       If you like Aromatics Elixir, Royal Secret, Chantilly, Diva, or Paloma Picasso, this one is definitely worth a try. It has certain elements that remind me of each of these scents, as well as an overall sense of being a classic, dressed-up fragrance with some real character and gravitas. It&#x27;s become my favorite!</li>
            <li> The ONLY perfume I wear or will ever wear!  Always receive compliments on it, it&#x27;s truly feminine...</li>
            <li> for my Mom for Christmas, she loves this and it is hard to find!! Thanks very much!! Have a great day!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I cannot find it in stores anymore and I gotta have it. Great smell.</li>
            <li> This has alway been a wonderful fragrance. It holds its scent a long time. A fine fragrance for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed, as the original, as I remember  was somewhat denser and definitely had a scent that stayed longer.</li>
            <li> It has the dame wonderful sawmill that it had 28 years ago!!! I love it and will be getting the other interlude products eventually.</li>
            <li> love this fragrance have used it for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> I have actually seen guys walk into floor displays in&lt;br /&gt;a grocery store and ask my wife what is that scent.&lt;br /&gt;USE JUST DOTS OF THIS .. so the guys don&#x27;t break&lt;br /&gt;one of their legs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is as good a product as I am used to buying.</li>
            <li> Started using this perfume back in 1965 I loved it then I coluld not find it.  This is not the same essence not even close.&lt;br /&gt;It is very bad. Ha no essence at all. Verónica</li>
            <li> WOW, WOW,WOW!!!  What an wonderful product. This makes you feel so beautiful.  I can&#x27;t get enought of this wondeful stuff. Highly recommended!!  Most people stops me in the street and ask me what am I wearing that smells so good.</li>
            <li> was very pleased, shipment arrived 1 week earlier than was promised.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same perfume for over 40 years, wear nothing else!!!!  Not interested in any other product!!</li>
            <li> Interlude Bath and Body is a product I have used for 30 plus years and it is my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent.  I haven&#x27;t been able to locate a store near where I now reside to purchase the perfume, so Amazon.com is the perfect place for me to shop for this product, convenient way to shop.</li>
            <li> I have worn Interlude for more years than I want to admit.  Although the scent is similar to other old standards, this is the only fragrance that I consistently get compliments on.when I wear it.  Interlude is extremely difficult to find.  This was affordable and just what I ordered.  My only wish is that they carried the 2-oz bottle.</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite scents, I have used it for so many years.  It is so different than anything else.  Also love Frances Denney &amp;#34;HOPE&amp;#34;  Hope is my very favorite but I like them both.</li>
            <li> i have worn this perfume since i was 18 yrs. old, i&#x27;m now 65. I get compliments everytime i wear it.  MALES LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Sometimes rating is hard.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed  but not in the seller or speed of delivery - they were great. The scent was not how I remembered it and it was a very small bottle. There is no way for me to know if the formula changed or my sense of smell has...&lt;br /&gt;So 5 stars for the seller; 3 stars for the product itself and 1 star for my changed olfactory system</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for many years and always get compliments on the nice scent.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Frances Denney for Women over 40 years and I really like it.  It is a deep perfume that stays with you all day.  From the time I first found it in a department store, I have always had a bottle sitting on my dresser.</li>
            <li> Have absolutely adored this fragrance  for fifty years.  My mother introduced me to it and although I could not find it in a shop anymore I was able to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;ordered it again last fall and my new husband is enjoying it as well.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside which is usually the case for this item is that the spray mechanism stops working properly.  The bottle I presently have has not worked properly from the outset so I have to take the sprayer cap off to use.&lt;br /&gt;Despite this inconvenience I will most likely use it for the remainder of my life.</li>
            <li> THE BATH OIL LASTS LONGER THAN YHE COLOGNE.</li>
            <li> I have worn and loved Interlude for years and have no plan to change.</li>
            <li> This perfume was purchased as a surprise gift. My wife thought it was no longer available, but was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. It has always been one of her favorites, and the fragrance is still the same. Price was great and shipping was fast (in plenty of time for Christmas).</li>
            <li> Been using since the 60s love it ,best for me .</li>
            <li> I used Interlude since the early 1970&#x27;s. This new version is not as intense and is missing some critical ingredient to make it smaell like the original.</li>
