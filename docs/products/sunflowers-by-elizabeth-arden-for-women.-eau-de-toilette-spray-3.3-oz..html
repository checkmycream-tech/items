            <li>This is my all time favorite perfume, its light sented &amp; will not bother allergies at all, &amp; I wore this at my wedding , my flowers were sunflowers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to it.  </li>

            <li>Came right on time!</li>
            <li>Good parfum at low cost.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a sweet, fruity, orangey drink.  </li>
            <li>Happily too, Sunflowers is very affordable, especially through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Favorite old standby perfume.</li>
            <li>Almost daily people comment that I smell nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this perfume for years because of its fresh summery scent.</li>
            <li>This smell is so pure and unique.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>My mother has purchased Elizabeth Arden products for many years from many different department stores in California and in Arizona where she live now.</li>
            <li>This is a scent my wife has used for years but was no longer able to find locally.</li>
            <li>I never fail to receive compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for all your help!  </li>
            <li>The item shipped and arrived promptly, and it was exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>I wear this perfume on a regular basis and love the scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been one of my favorites for a long time, I ran out of it quite a while ago and then found it on Amazon for such a great price, I had to buy it.</li>
            <li>So now it is my Number 2 favorite (after Red Door).  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It is 100% authentic, arrived quickly, and was carefully packaged.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to many perfumes because of their harshness, but this one is soft without being powdery smelling and does not irritate my nose.</li>
            <li>Hubby doesn&#x27;t like it (says it is too strong), but ALL Arden fragrances are strong (which I like, because you use less).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go-to fragrance that is great night or day, special occasion or casual.  </li>
            <li>i love this item its exactly what i expected</li>
            <li>but I was hoping it was as large as I thought .I</li>
            <li>My daugther is pretty particular about her cologne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn different scents over the years, and some were likeable for a little while, then wore out their welcome.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>it was the real deal</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Like this one very much, I really smelled sunflowers from it.</li>
            <li>I received it as expected and was pleased.  </li>
            <li>Was packaged well and ready to wrap for holiday gift.</li>
            <li>it is so much cheaper</li>
            <li>It is light yet long</li>
            <li>If you can wear other scents like Cool Water, or you were once a fan of Max Factor&#x27;s now defunct Le Jardin or Dare, this one will be right up your alley as well.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is my calling card for nothing but positive reasons, so give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for everyone to buy .</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find Sunflowers here in the town we live in -</li>
            <li>She dont shower on a regular basis so this stuff really helps!</li>
            <li>smells heavenly and such a large bottle for the price</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m too busy.</li>
            <li>Not overpoweringly floral, no musky notes like Red Door, but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t offend those sensitive to fragrances</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s presence in space is directly proportional to the amount placed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for daily or out on the town wearing.</li>
            <li>Will definitely come back here when ready to replace.</li>

            <li> Happily too, Sunflowers is very affordable, especially through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Favorite old standby perfume.</li>
            <li> Almost daily people comment that I smell nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years because of its fresh summery scent.</li>
            <li> This smell is so pure and unique.</li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> My mother has purchased Elizabeth Arden products for many years from many different department stores in California and in Arizona where she live now.</li>
            <li> This is a scent my wife has used for years but was no longer able to find locally.</li>
            <li> I never fail to receive compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for all your help!  </li>
            <li> The item shipped and arrived promptly, and it was exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I wear this perfume on a regular basis and love the scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been one of my favorites for a long time, I ran out of it quite a while ago and then found it on Amazon for such a great price, I had to buy it.</li>
            <li> So now it is my Number 2 favorite (after Red Door).  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It is 100% authentic, arrived quickly, and was carefully packaged.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to many perfumes because of their harshness, but this one is soft without being powdery smelling and does not irritate my nose.</li>
            <li> Hubby doesn&#x27;t like it (says it is too strong), but ALL Arden fragrances are strong (which I like, because you use less).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to fragrance that is great night or day, special occasion or casual.  </li>
            <li> i love this item its exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> but I was hoping it was as large as I thought .I</li>
            <li> My daugther is pretty particular about her cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn different scents over the years, and some were likeable for a little while, then wore out their welcome.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> it was the real deal</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Like this one very much, I really smelled sunflowers from it.</li>
            <li> I received it as expected and was pleased.  </li>
            <li> Was packaged well and ready to wrap for holiday gift.</li>
            <li> it is so much cheaper</li>
            <li> It is light yet long</li>
            <li> If you can wear other scents like Cool Water, or you were once a fan of Max Factor&#x27;s now defunct Le Jardin or Dare, this one will be right up your alley as well.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is my calling card for nothing but positive reasons, so give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for everyone to buy .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find Sunflowers here in the town we live in -</li>
            <li> She dont shower on a regular basis so this stuff really helps!</li>
            <li> smells heavenly and such a large bottle for the price</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m too busy.</li>
            <li> Not overpoweringly floral, no musky notes like Red Door, but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t offend those sensitive to fragrances</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s presence in space is directly proportional to the amount placed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for daily or out on the town wearing.</li>
            <li> Will definitely come back here when ready to replace.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been around for such a long time</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Sunflowers has been around for a very long time and is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t smell me from down the hall but only in my personal space will it catch on.</li>
            <li> I would depend on their quality in the future or just use other companies.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Red Door by Arden, but decided to try Sunflowers because it is less expensive, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since it was released, but always hated dealing with department stores to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this perfume this big for this price had to buy it,  </li>
            <li> Sadly I can&#x27;t wear it much, because of that ingredient that bothers me.</li>
            <li> The sprayer on the bottle worked for a few weeks, then started leaking when depressed.  </li>
            <li> She got double the amount and less expensive by ordering it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This perfume  Definitely takes me back to the summers of the late 90&#x27;s!!!!</li>
            <li> They are usually $20 plus dollars in the stores.</li>
            <li> I was not sure on the size</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my cousin who has been unable to find this anywhere.  </li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Trust me, you cannot go wrong with this fragrance!</li>

            <li> Everywhere I go I am complimented on the fragrance I am wearing...when I wear Sunflowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend who works for a famous and really expensive line of perfumes who can and does obtain deep discounts on the line...and NO ONE ever says a word when I am wearing any of those fragrances!  Spray on Sunflowers, and the compliments come.  Happily too, Sunflowers is very affordable, especially through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, Wife loved it!</li>
            <li> Brought it for my mother. It smells good, but it is mild. She loved it. Personally, I prefer stronger smells..</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this product for 23 years. Almost daily people comment that I smell nice. I work in healthcare and have to be mindful of strong scents, but this doesn&#x27;t bother my patients.</li>
            <li> Sunflowers is my daughters favorite fragrance and she was delighted to receive it she loves the way it smells and was very happy with it. It arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> The item shipped and arrived promptly, and it was exactly what I hoped for. I love this perfume and realized that I should have purchased two bottles.</li>
            <li> alway loved this perfume and every time  i wear it - Im complimented about how great it smells!!! This perfume  Definitely takes me back to the summers of the late 90&#x27;s!!!!</li>
            <li> So glad I can find Sunflower on line! Seems to have disappeared off store shelfs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great fragrance for Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li> My mother has purchased Elizabeth Arden products for many years from many different department stores in California and in Arizona where she live now. The best deals are always through Amazon.com. What she paid for on a 1.7oz bottle of perfume in a department store. She got double the amount and less expensive by ordering it at Amazon.com. She said \\&quot;No more department store shopping for me\\&quot;.[[ASIN:B0009OAI18 Sunflowers By Elizabeth Arden For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Oz.]]</li>
            <li> I love this scent! Smells like sunshine - light and sweet. I am very sensitive to many perfumes because of their harshness, but this one is soft without being powdery smelling and does not irritate my nose. I get a lot of compliments on it. Strangers sometimes stop me to ask what perfume I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Everyone around me enjoys the fragrance</li>
            <li> Very good price for the size. They are usually $20 plus dollars in the stores. I get this every year for my sister in law for Christmas.</li>
            <li> There just is nothing else to say about this perfume. It smells as good today as it did when it first came out.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume. you cant go wrong with this product. value is great. i love this item its exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I get so many compliments on it.  I have bought more expensive perfumes and don&#x27;t get the compliments like I do when I wear Sunflowers.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this one. i try to buy this whenever i can and i always get a great price from amazon.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and well packaged. We bought this for our daughter and she loves the smell of the perfume, and even better both her dad and I can tolerate the smell too. So this is a win/win for sure. I would recommend this perfume to anyone.</li>
            <li> Worn this for years, Love it! It does smell different on everybody though. I do not like the lotion just the perfume on me.</li>
            <li> I love this  perfume.  Its never obtrusive or heavy and has a light but delicious fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this fragrance.  It reminds me of a sweet, fruity, orangey drink.  It reminds me of walking on a quiet street or through flowers on a summer morning.  I love the smell but there is something in it that is strong and can bother my allergies.  It&#x27;s great if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to it.  Sadly I can&#x27;t wear it much, because of that ingredient that bothers me.</li>
            <li> As always I love this one.</li>
            <li> I love my sunflower cologne.I was not sure on the size but I was hoping it was as large as I thought .I was also hopefully it was the real deal and it was</li>
            <li> love the smell. bottle is very simple though. they should rethink the design.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE IT. i USE IT EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> Excellent, Classic smell! Quick Shipment!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Can&#x27;t find Sunflowers here in the town we live in - so, this was a welcome find.</li>
            <li> Sunflowers is a delightful perfume that I have worn for years.  Love it&#x27;s softness!</li>
            <li> My daugther is pretty particular about her cologne. This is one she asks for yearly. One of her overall favorites.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she smells terrific! She dont shower on a regular basis so this stuff really helps!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas. I&#x27;ve always loved this smell and can pick it out in a crowded room.</li>
            <li> Just beautiful, I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great smell.  I always get compliments.  I have worn this for many years.  The smell is a very sweet smell. Like refreshing. It is a great deal, buying it online.  Hard to find in stores.  When I do find, it is alot more money.  Love you amazon.</li>
            <li> es un perfume muy rico primera vez que lo uso, lo recomiendo, es excelente, justo lo que quer&amp;iacute;a tal cual como se muestra en la foto</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my sister.  She loves this cologne so it was a hit with her. Thanks</li>
            <li> Trust me, you cannot go wrong with this fragrance! It&#x27;s been around for such a long time and it&#x27;s STILL one of the best!!!</li>
            <li> I wear this perfume on a regular basis and love the scent.  I order from Amazon quite often, but have never had product shipped that was damaged or would malfunction and this makes me question weather I would depend on their quality in the future or just use other companies.The sprayer on the bottle worked for a few weeks, then started leaking when depressed.  There was no way to fix.  I don&#x27;t think I would order from this company again, if they are going to send damaged merchandise.</li>
            <li> Like this one very much, I really smelled sunflowers from it. I feel this one a litte bit neutral, anyone can wear it.</li>
            <li> Came quicker than estimated.  Great price for a big bottle!</li>
            <li> Just as ordered. Size was correct and packaging was in new and excellent condition. This made a very nice gift for a special friend since it is her favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> This item is larger than you think so it LASTS! This smell is so pure and unique. I bought this for my Mom to remind her I love her. She wears it all the time and it reminds me of my childhood. This is a great gift and an amazing scent. It&#x27;s worth the money. At THIS cost? Send it with a gift note and pay your love forward.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this perfume. It&#x27;s been one of my favorites for a long time, I ran out of it quite a while ago and then found it on Amazon for such a great price, I had to buy it. The smell is amazing and I get compliments anytime I&#x27;m out wearing it. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> smells heavenly and such a large bottle for the price</li>
            <li> Hard to find this perfume this big for this price had to buy it,  it&#x27;s one of my friends fav scents light and sweet on the scences.</li>
            <li> The wife always loves this for a gift.  Was shipped and relieved promptly.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since it was released, but always hated dealing with department stores to purchase it. So glad I could find it on Amazon to save the frustrations.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just what I wanted.I work12hrs daily, no time to write reviews. Please don&#x27;t ask me again i&#x27;m too busy.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear Sunflowers people tell me they love my perfume and where can they get some.  Nuff said!</li>
            <li> Daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume, Birthday gift</li>
            <li> I usually wear Red Door by Arden, but decided to try Sunflowers because it is less expensive, and I am glad I did.  Red Door is still my favorite, but Sunflowers is beautiful scent for summer.  Not overpoweringly floral, no musky notes like Red Door, but I really like it.  So now it is my Number 2 favorite (after Red Door).  Hubby doesn&#x27;t like it (says it is too strong), but ALL Arden fragrances are strong (which I like, because you use less).  Hubby will have to put up with it until I run out, or he can buy me a bottle of the more expensive Red Door.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of sunflowers and the reason I have decided to buy from this seller the perfume is because everywhere I went looking for some in stores didn&#x27;t seem to have any more.  So, now I will buy one to two bottles at a time and from this seller.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great price, it is the original perfume, some reviewers have noted the some scents seem different in packaging and smell. This was not the case . Arrived securely packaged and intact, very pleased !!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years because of its fresh summery scent. I never get tired of it. My children buy me more expensive perfume and I love it too, but I always purchase Sunflowers when I run out.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?!  My favorite cologne at a great price!  Will definitely come back here when ready to replace.</li>
            <li> Very pleased will order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn different scents over the years, and some were likeable for a little while, then wore out their welcome.  There were others I absolutely loved, but they were pulled off the market after a certain amount of time.  Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Sunflowers has been around for a very long time and is definitely a keeper.  It&#x27;s my go-to fragrance that is great night or day, special occasion or casual.  With it&#x27;s light, floral/botanical scent, I get a lot of compliments from strangers and acquaintances alike.  It is aimed for those who love botanical or more natural floral aromas, but it also depends on your chemistry type.  No two people wear the same fragrance the same way.  If you can wear other scents like Cool Water, or you were once a fan of Max Factor&#x27;s now defunct Le Jardin or Dare, this one will be right up your alley as well.  It will remind you of summer in autumn and winter, and you will be an accessory to summer and spring.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is my calling card for nothing but positive reasons, so give it a try.  It&#x27;s one of the most delightful favors you can ever do for yourself and those around you.</li>
            <li> I received it as expected and was pleased.  This a fresh, floral scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower but lingers and retains its composure, at least on me. I wear it to work and it doesn&#x27;t offend those sensitive to fragrances and I work in a hospital. People don&#x27;t smell me from down the hall but only in my personal space will it catch on. I have had many a compliment. I highly recommend for daily or out on the town wearing. It&#x27;s presence in space is directly proportional to the amount placed.</li>
            <li> Great to find this cologne still available and at a reasonable price. Was packaged well and ready to wrap for holiday gift.</li>
            <li> The wife loved the perfume. We looked for the product and could not locate it at Christmas. Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> my mom has worn this perfume on and off since I was kid. Love the smell! Came right on time!</li>
            <li> Unique and delicious with extraordinary fixation that lasts throughout the day is a very nice gift for a woman I recommend free and bold</li>
            <li> I love sunflowers being wearing it for years and I love buying here it is so much cheaper then the department stores and a bigger bottle . Highly recommend for everyone to buy .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Very satisfied with price.</li>
