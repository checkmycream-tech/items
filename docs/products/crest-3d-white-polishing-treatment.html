    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>perfect.</li>
            <li>Good product it works!!</li>
            <li>I am sooo impressed by this lineup!</li>
            <li>and I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li>all i can say is beautiful teeth</li>
            <li>, I ean iit is very good so nice and good to eat!!!</li>
            <li>and I think this goes great with that</li>
            <li>What a great feeling.</li>
            <li>When my wife is happy I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>I would greatly appreciate it.</li>
            <li>it should be good results lol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works well for keeping your teeth bright between those whitening treatments, or if you do not use white-strips, this product will help to control those surface stains that coffee, berries, wine, etc, can deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, IT IS PURTTEY GOOD</li>
            <li>Almost as good as you can get after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth the money even if just for that great nice tingly minty mouth afterward.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>, 3-stars is fair here.  </li>
            <li>A good value for a good amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>Heard good things about this.</li>
            <li>really good.</li>
            <li>It tastes good too</li>
            <li>We all love this polish!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Mind you, I used this product with my toothpaste alone for about a week and the results were amazing, but let me tell you, since I started using the mouthwash and the whitening strips, OH MY GOODNESS.</li>
            <li>already used and liked the Crest pro toothpaste</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I liked it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>and my teeth still look nice and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flavor and texture were nice.</li>
            <li>(I tried them and they&#x27;re fairly effective in lightening tooth color.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it still kind of works.</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m supposed to, but I still think that&#x27;s a limitation of the product--that it has to be used in conjunction with another product in order to be fully effective.</li>
            <li>Like the kind the dentist / hygienist provides.  </li>
            <li>I try to take care of my teeth and keep them looking nice</li>
            <li>After using the toothpaste, yeah my mouth feels great and clean.</li>
            <li>it leaves a real clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Add this to a whitening campaign and my teeth look like just coming from the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;Has a pleasant minty taste and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>minty taste is kind of strong, but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>And for the most part, all toothpaste seems to whiten the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is more of an after treatment.</li>
            <li>Using this just a couple of times made my teeth feel so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used my whitening strips in weeks, but I&#x27;m sure if I used them with the polishing treatment I&#x27;d have even better results.</li>
            <li>Love this polishing.  </li>
            <li>I love the results I am gettting</li>
            <li>they are for sure stained.</li>
            <li>I often receive compliments on my bright smile.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting dental care product.  </li>
            <li>Even with this grit, the product provides assurance that it is safe for the enamel of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my coffee, and I am ,shall we say, a frugal shopper.  </li>
            <li>I really LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff works real good with any tooth paste, now that I have the 3D Crest White stripes, I know I will have a brighter and whiter teeth by the time 2015.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I got this product to enhance my whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>okay, just a enhancer.</li>
            <li>What I do know is that my mouth felt very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I see it as a good maintenance product after a professional whitening service or for very lightly discolored teeth, nothing more.</li>
            <li>However, recently, I have decided to venture out and really perfect my smile, so I decided to purchase the Polishing Treatment.</li>
            <li>And one of the benefits of it being strong is that it leaves your mouth tasting minty and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>found that since it has the same ingredients as Crest Strips, but you don&#x27;t need to leave it on your mouth, as a result, it not as effective as whitening strips (though its more effective than the whitening mouthwash)</li>
            <li>It is more effective than whitening tooth paste and less immediately effective, but not as damaging to your teeth as the strips, so I find this quite the winner in my book!</li>
            <li>taste is fine.</li>
            <li>And, we all have great, white teeth.</li>
            <li>The price is great on this, especially for how well it works.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth and polished.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s important to note.</li>
            <li>not annoyingly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly though, this stuff seems to work really well when it comes to whitening and polishing my teeth.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to lighten those coffee and red wine stains, this is a great way to go.</li>
            <li>Cause the strips are fantastic, toothpaste whatever, and this product...</li>
            <li>It was almost as good as the way they feel after a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have already been using Crest 3D toothpaste for several months and yes, it does a good job of cleaning and keeping most stains off my teeth.  </li>
            <li>For me, I&#x27;m pretty happy so far with just this, but I also don&#x27;t ever drink coffee or wine, but I am a chocolate freak</li>
            <li>It make your teeth feel clean and smooth while making them even whiter, I swear it.</li>
            <li>Riminds me of a paste version of the original Perl drops.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel even cleaner, stay cleaner, and I feel I already have a brighter smile!</li>
            <li>This is a unique polishing treatment.</li>
            <li>It made my teeth feel quite clean.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many whitening toothpastes, and none work very well.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the better part of a month, and I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>Overall good for your oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps whiten teeth after using the toothpaste, and it tastes good.</li>
            <li>As a coffee drinker, this product helps me make a good impression in the middle of my work day.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a toothpaste alone.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly you see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the very first use my teeth were noticeably whiter to me, maybe not to anyone else though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m lucky to brush my own teeth twice a day, now to use the Crest 3D white polishing treatment, that means 3-4 brushings per day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot---it makes my teeth feel smooth and just polished.  </li>
            <li>Using brilliance was, quite literally, a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I felt as if I had just left the dentist.</li>
            <li>thought that this stuff was worth a shot though</li>
            <li>Effective at removing espresso staining on my lower teeth that had escaped my regular</li>
            <li>My teeth are too sensitive to use whitening stripes on, and i&#x27;ve had some ok luck with some whitening pens out</li>
            <li>It has whitened and brightened my smile by eons.</li>
            <li>My smile is getting noticeably whiter every day.</li>
            <li>but then you get used to it and the results make it sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s a nice change from the whitening strips, with the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product kind of creates a third category.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they were &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34; as much as they were clean and polished.</li>
            <li>i used this for a month, pretty regularly and it did a nice job of whitening my teeth; I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use Crest whitening strips once or twice a year to keep my smile bright, so this polish is really just a supplement - and it does work to help keep my teeth bright, since I&#x27;m a coffee drinker (black and strong) and occasional red wine drinker, and berry eater - and and</li>
            <li>not that cool, fresh brushed feeling that I love so much.  </li>
            <li>It tastes fine, too, probably better than normal 3D White</li>
            <li>Such an easy way to use it (doesn&#x27;t add more time to getting ready for the day or for bed, unlike whitening strips) and very effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice much difference - though that won&#x27;t prevent me from at LEAST finishing out the tube! :-D</li>
            <li>My teeth looked noticeably whiter after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I feel it does a better job cleaning my teeth than brushing with just a regular toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used this toothpaste for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The idea is that you brush twice, first with a toothpaste for cleaning (which this is not) then with this, for whitening.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li>First your teeth are polished using abrasives, and then you rinse with a fluoride toothpaste, allowing fluoride to absorb into the enamel of your teeth and protect them from cavities.</li>
            <li>Seems to show within the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>I personally have used the strips, which are certainly effective, but tend to hurt my teeth after a few uses, but this didn&#x27;t, which I really liked.</li>
            <li>Mr Fiance uses this Crest White Strips as well and noticed better results when she used the polishing treatment as well.</li>
            <li>so I scooped this booster up and the the matching toothpaste when these first hit the store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to try it again eventually and see if it still bothers me.</li>
            <li>I am not picky about most things in my life, but I am about which toothpaste I buy, and it HAS to be 3D Glamorous White.</li>
            <li>my teeth are much whiter!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is promoted to keep teeth white in between brushes with your favorite whitening toothpaste or as a boost.</li>
            <li>So this helps to keep my teeth white in between those brushes without adding more fluoride into my teeth brushing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use all 3 (mouthwash, polishing treatment, and strips), you are pretty much guaranteed a hollywood smile without the hollywood prices.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think this works &amp; feels better on my teeth than Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>so impressed with CREST 3D WHITE POLISHING TREATMENT that I will continue to use it in the future to help keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li>Most products are either a paste for cleaning/whitening -OR- are a whitening product like a gel, tray, white strip, etc.  </li>
            <li>I feel like if you are willing to use it 1-2x</li>
            <li>I put it on top of whatever toothpaste I am using and noticed after the first brushing how WHITE my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>Not super white amazing results, but certainly better than it was before I started using this.</li>
            <li>Granted, it doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as the strips, but I&#x27;m not usually in a rush to whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, when I used this polishing treatment along with the 3D White, the overall whitening result seemed more significant.  </li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not a dramatic whitening product</li>
            <li>It has no fluoride or other ingredients meant for keeping teeth clean and plaque free.</li>
            <li>The first time the product tasted a little strong, but I quickly became used to it.</li>
            <li>I use it a few days a week (after brushing with regular toothpaste) and have noticed some great results I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li>really whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Fast.  </li>
            <li>Really helps to whiten.</li>
            <li>I suspect that the real benefit derives from the fact that you are doing twice as much brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this every night for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li>but given how much cheaper this stuff is, I think it works quite well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner than ever and are already much whiter.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have much preferred matching tubes, given that the products are intended to be used together.</li>
            <li>Really...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, it really works well.</li>
            <li>Works very well when used after the 3D whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This really did make a difference.  </li>
            <li>(although, I admit I really donâ€™t like flossing).</li>
            <li>This boosting polish does whiten enough that I feel that I can happily enjoy my coffee without worrying about ruining my teeth.  </li>
            <li>nothing really noticeable unless you think about it.</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>I am changing my whole look.</li>
            <li>I am not trying to change, I am changing my whole look.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even have to use much of this stuff either.</li>
            <li>My assumption is that any toothpaste is the same, and all of them advertise pretty much the same array of effects, including whiter teeth and refreshing flavor.  </li>
            <li>I am looking forward to finally having the smile I want!</li>
            <li>Due to that problem though I wasn&#x27;t able to rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>is NOT a toothpaste, so you do need to still use your regular toothpaste to clean and prevent cavities.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling extra clean, almost like after a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li>It may be useful to get a professional whitening treatment and use the Crest 3D polishing Treatment to maintain your newly pearly whites.</li>
            <li>and - all those things that make your teeth less white and bright than they can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it can surely do a decent job of keeping teeth whiter for a longer period of time, requiring either fewer or no trips to the dentist for whitening treatments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does say in bold letters that it does not contain fluoride and should not replace your fluoride (i.e. regular) toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just brush the same way you do as regular toothbrush, it just has more hydrogen peroxide instead of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use this long enough to detect a real difference...</li>
            <li>The brilliance boost is not mean as a toothpaste as it does not contain</li>
            <li>Okay, so u have been using crest products for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li>Price is a little higher than regular toothpaste but is a good supplement during regular brushing.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have different in my smile</li>
            <li>Worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for something to achieve practical results or use between whitening stripes/treatments to maintain your white.</li>
            <li>Just a normal shmoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product can be used in 2 ways: right after your regular toothpaste, or in addition at anytime of the day.</li>
            <li>The directions aren&#x27;t very clear, but i think you basically brush your teeth twice at night, once with your normally toothpaste and then once with this</li>
            <li>A clean flavor and results within the first few days.</li>
            <li>When I tried Crest&#x27;s 3D White toothpaste, I found it to be much like others I&#x27;ve tried: effective if you brush frequently, especially after eating or drinking beverages or foods that stain teeth (wine, coffee, blueberries, dark juices, tea, spaghetti sauce, etc.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the toothpaste is effective for some whitening, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the very slight brown discoloration that can build up on teeth just above the gum line.  </li>
            <li>Was it because I brushed my teeth twice (the first time with toothpaste, and this as a followup)?  </li>
            <li>So first off, this is not actually toothpaste that you use every day.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>when I first read the packaging, I didn&#x27;t read it closely enough.</li>
            <li>Adding another 1-2 renditions of brushing is over the top for me, but I&#x27;m also not a famous actor, TV personality, politician, etc.  </li>
            <li>My teeth stay pretty white from whitening toothpastes and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will use it for an extra clean feeling after a especially string flavored meal, too.</li>
            <li>I must say, I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li>(in the Refreshing Mint flavor, at least).</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I have used all kinds of white strips and polishes, but never see any real results.</li>
            <li>I have used whitening strips, but they seem to leave the area near the gum line, untouched.</li>
            <li>I have never had sensitive teeth before.</li>
            <li>Since I just wanted a touch up and didn&#x27;t feel like buying a whole box of crest white strips, I ordered this.</li>
            <li>Mesmerizing Mint Flavor Toothpaste, 4.1 Fluid Ounce]] along with the Crest 3D White Polishing Treatment - Brilliance Boost, and</li>
            <li>But I think I need to use it a few more times to give a final verdict on that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, if you are looking for a third category of treatment for your teeth, try this and see if you think the benefit is worth the extra time and expense.  </li>
            <li>Expensive and didn&#x27;t work any better than most other brands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing exactly that with this and a Crest 3D White toothpaste for the last 2 weeks, and my teeth do seem a shade whiter than they were before, when I was just brushing with Ultrabrite.</li>
            <li>I bought Sensodyne for sensitive teeth, but they still aren&#x27;t back to normal.</li>
            <li>No drastic pearly whites, but certainly some minor shades brighter.  </li>
            <li>If anyone knows how to get my teeth back to normal</li>
            <li>I really like the way my teeth feel after using this product; money well spent.</li>
            <li>I had recently tried Crest&#x27;s 3D Luxe for sensitive teeth and was not a fan.</li>
            <li>So far nothing has worked to get my teeth as white as I want.</li>
            <li>It feels (and tastes) very similar to the polish used at the dentist&#x27;s office when you get your teeth professionally</li>
            <li>I thought they were white before using this but WOW.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using it with regular Crest whitening, not the new 3D White stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does work...has a noticeable effect, but it is slight and may not be worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li>I know brushing your teeth in the middle of the day is annoying, but I think that&#x27;s when the polishing treatment does its magic, since most coffee drinking is done by the middle of the day, and by using the polishing treatment, you are preventing the coffee staining from permeating your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have also used other whitening boosters but this one REALLY shows a difference.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth twice a day with an electric toothbrush (and floss daily), but I don&#x27;t do a lot of whitening generally.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth at least twice a day and have noticed a significant change in the whitening of my teeth since using the CREST 3D WHITE POLISHING TREATMENT.</li>
            <li>I noticed that within the first few days but after about 10 days or so, I noticed my teeth seem whiter and unlike with the whitening strips</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of Colgate products and so after reading other reviews I thought I would give this particular brand a try.</li>
            <li>I have to generally use sensitive toothpaste for my back teeth; however, this product did not bother me like other non-sensitive brands.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> perfect.</li>
            <li> Good product it works!!</li>
            <li> I am sooo impressed by this lineup!</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li> all i can say is beautiful teeth</li>
            <li> , I ean iit is very good so nice and good to eat!!!</li>
            <li> and I think this goes great with that</li>
            <li> What a great feeling.</li>
            <li> When my wife is happy I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I would greatly appreciate it.</li>
            <li> it should be good results lol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works well for keeping your teeth bright between those whitening treatments, or if you do not use white-strips, this product will help to control those surface stains that coffee, berries, wine, etc, can deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , IT IS PURTTEY GOOD</li>
            <li> Almost as good as you can get after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth the money even if just for that great nice tingly minty mouth afterward.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> , 3-stars is fair here.  </li>
            <li> A good value for a good amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Heard good things about this.</li>
            <li> really good.</li>
            <li> It tastes good too</li>
            <li> We all love this polish!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Mind you, I used this product with my toothpaste alone for about a week and the results were amazing, but let me tell you, since I started using the mouthwash and the whitening strips, OH MY GOODNESS.</li>
            <li> already used and liked the Crest pro toothpaste</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I liked it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> and my teeth still look nice and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flavor and texture were nice.</li>
            <li> (I tried them and they&#x27;re fairly effective in lightening tooth color.)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it still kind of works.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m supposed to, but I still think that&#x27;s a limitation of the product--that it has to be used in conjunction with another product in order to be fully effective.</li>
            <li> Like the kind the dentist / hygienist provides.  </li>
            <li> I try to take care of my teeth and keep them looking nice</li>
            <li> After using the toothpaste, yeah my mouth feels great and clean.</li>
            <li> it leaves a real clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Add this to a whitening campaign and my teeth look like just coming from the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;Has a pleasant minty taste and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> minty taste is kind of strong, but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> And for the most part, all toothpaste seems to whiten the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is more of an after treatment.</li>
            <li> Using this just a couple of times made my teeth feel so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my whitening strips in weeks, but I&#x27;m sure if I used them with the polishing treatment I&#x27;d have even better results.</li>
            <li> Love this polishing.  </li>
            <li> I love the results I am gettting</li>
            <li> they are for sure stained.</li>
            <li> I often receive compliments on my bright smile.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting dental care product.  </li>
            <li> Even with this grit, the product provides assurance that it is safe for the enamel of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my coffee, and I am ,shall we say, a frugal shopper.  </li>
            <li> I really LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff works real good with any tooth paste, now that I have the 3D Crest White stripes, I know I will have a brighter and whiter teeth by the time 2015.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I got this product to enhance my whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> okay, just a enhancer.</li>
            <li> What I do know is that my mouth felt very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I see it as a good maintenance product after a professional whitening service or for very lightly discolored teeth, nothing more.</li>
            <li> However, recently, I have decided to venture out and really perfect my smile, so I decided to purchase the Polishing Treatment.</li>
            <li> And one of the benefits of it being strong is that it leaves your mouth tasting minty and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> found that since it has the same ingredients as Crest Strips, but you don&#x27;t need to leave it on your mouth, as a result, it not as effective as whitening strips (though its more effective than the whitening mouthwash)</li>
            <li> It is more effective than whitening tooth paste and less immediately effective, but not as damaging to your teeth as the strips, so I find this quite the winner in my book!</li>
            <li> taste is fine.</li>
            <li> And, we all have great, white teeth.</li>
            <li> The price is great on this, especially for how well it works.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt smooth and polished.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s important to note.</li>
            <li> not annoyingly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly though, this stuff seems to work really well when it comes to whitening and polishing my teeth.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to lighten those coffee and red wine stains, this is a great way to go.</li>
            <li> Cause the strips are fantastic, toothpaste whatever, and this product...</li>
            <li> It was almost as good as the way they feel after a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have already been using Crest 3D toothpaste for several months and yes, it does a good job of cleaning and keeping most stains off my teeth.  </li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;m pretty happy so far with just this, but I also don&#x27;t ever drink coffee or wine, but I am a chocolate freak</li>
            <li> It make your teeth feel clean and smooth while making them even whiter, I swear it.</li>
            <li> Riminds me of a paste version of the original Perl drops.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel even cleaner, stay cleaner, and I feel I already have a brighter smile!</li>
            <li> This is a unique polishing treatment.</li>
            <li> It made my teeth feel quite clean.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many whitening toothpastes, and none work very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the better part of a month, and I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Overall good for your oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps whiten teeth after using the toothpaste, and it tastes good.</li>
            <li> As a coffee drinker, this product helps me make a good impression in the middle of my work day.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a toothpaste alone.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly you see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the very first use my teeth were noticeably whiter to me, maybe not to anyone else though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky to brush my own teeth twice a day, now to use the Crest 3D white polishing treatment, that means 3-4 brushings per day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot---it makes my teeth feel smooth and just polished.  </li>
            <li> Using brilliance was, quite literally, a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I felt as if I had just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> thought that this stuff was worth a shot though</li>
            <li> Effective at removing espresso staining on my lower teeth that had escaped my regular</li>
            <li> My teeth are too sensitive to use whitening stripes on, and i&#x27;ve had some ok luck with some whitening pens out</li>
            <li> It has whitened and brightened my smile by eons.</li>
            <li> My smile is getting noticeably whiter every day.</li>
            <li> but then you get used to it and the results make it sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s a nice change from the whitening strips, with the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product kind of creates a third category.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they were &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34; as much as they were clean and polished.</li>
            <li> i used this for a month, pretty regularly and it did a nice job of whitening my teeth; I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use Crest whitening strips once or twice a year to keep my smile bright, so this polish is really just a supplement - and it does work to help keep my teeth bright, since I&#x27;m a coffee drinker (black and strong) and occasional red wine drinker, and berry eater - and and</li>
            <li> not that cool, fresh brushed feeling that I love so much.  </li>
            <li> It tastes fine, too, probably better than normal 3D White</li>
            <li> Such an easy way to use it (doesn&#x27;t add more time to getting ready for the day or for bed, unlike whitening strips) and very effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice much difference - though that won&#x27;t prevent me from at LEAST finishing out the tube! :-D</li>
            <li> My teeth looked noticeably whiter after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I feel it does a better job cleaning my teeth than brushing with just a regular toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used this toothpaste for the first time this morning</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The idea is that you brush twice, first with a toothpaste for cleaning (which this is not) then with this, for whitening.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li> First your teeth are polished using abrasives, and then you rinse with a fluoride toothpaste, allowing fluoride to absorb into the enamel of your teeth and protect them from cavities.</li>
            <li> Seems to show within the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> I personally have used the strips, which are certainly effective, but tend to hurt my teeth after a few uses, but this didn&#x27;t, which I really liked.</li>
            <li> Mr Fiance uses this Crest White Strips as well and noticed better results when she used the polishing treatment as well.</li>
            <li> so I scooped this booster up and the the matching toothpaste when these first hit the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to try it again eventually and see if it still bothers me.</li>
            <li> I am not picky about most things in my life, but I am about which toothpaste I buy, and it HAS to be 3D Glamorous White.</li>
            <li> my teeth are much whiter!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is promoted to keep teeth white in between brushes with your favorite whitening toothpaste or as a boost.</li>
            <li> So this helps to keep my teeth white in between those brushes without adding more fluoride into my teeth brushing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use all 3 (mouthwash, polishing treatment, and strips), you are pretty much guaranteed a hollywood smile without the hollywood prices.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think this works &amp; feels better on my teeth than Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> so impressed with CREST 3D WHITE POLISHING TREATMENT that I will continue to use it in the future to help keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li> Most products are either a paste for cleaning/whitening -OR- are a whitening product like a gel, tray, white strip, etc.  </li>
            <li> I feel like if you are willing to use it 1-2x</li>
            <li> I put it on top of whatever toothpaste I am using and noticed after the first brushing how WHITE my teeth looked.</li>
            <li> Not super white amazing results, but certainly better than it was before I started using this.</li>
            <li> Granted, it doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as the strips, but I&#x27;m not usually in a rush to whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when I used this polishing treatment along with the 3D White, the overall whitening result seemed more significant.  </li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not a dramatic whitening product</li>
            <li> It has no fluoride or other ingredients meant for keeping teeth clean and plaque free.</li>
            <li> The first time the product tasted a little strong, but I quickly became used to it.</li>
            <li> I use it a few days a week (after brushing with regular toothpaste) and have noticed some great results I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> really whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Fast.  </li>
            <li> Really helps to whiten.</li>
            <li> I suspect that the real benefit derives from the fact that you are doing twice as much brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this every night for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li> but given how much cheaper this stuff is, I think it works quite well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner than ever and are already much whiter.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have much preferred matching tubes, given that the products are intended to be used together.</li>
            <li> Really...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, it really works well.</li>
            <li> Works very well when used after the 3D whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This really did make a difference.  </li>
            <li> (although, I admit I really donâ€™t like flossing).</li>
            <li> This boosting polish does whiten enough that I feel that I can happily enjoy my coffee without worrying about ruining my teeth.  </li>
            <li> nothing really noticeable unless you think about it.</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> I am changing my whole look.</li>
            <li> I am not trying to change, I am changing my whole look.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to use much of this stuff either.</li>
            <li> My assumption is that any toothpaste is the same, and all of them advertise pretty much the same array of effects, including whiter teeth and refreshing flavor.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to finally having the smile I want!</li>
            <li> Due to that problem though I wasn&#x27;t able to rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> is NOT a toothpaste, so you do need to still use your regular toothpaste to clean and prevent cavities.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling extra clean, almost like after a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li> It may be useful to get a professional whitening treatment and use the Crest 3D polishing Treatment to maintain your newly pearly whites.</li>
            <li> and - all those things that make your teeth less white and bright than they can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it can surely do a decent job of keeping teeth whiter for a longer period of time, requiring either fewer or no trips to the dentist for whitening treatments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it does say in bold letters that it does not contain fluoride and should not replace your fluoride (i.e. regular) toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just brush the same way you do as regular toothbrush, it just has more hydrogen peroxide instead of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use this long enough to detect a real difference...</li>
            <li> The brilliance boost is not mean as a toothpaste as it does not contain</li>
            <li> Okay, so u have been using crest products for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> Price is a little higher than regular toothpaste but is a good supplement during regular brushing.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have different in my smile</li>
            <li> Worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for something to achieve practical results or use between whitening stripes/treatments to maintain your white.</li>
            <li> Just a normal shmoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product can be used in 2 ways: right after your regular toothpaste, or in addition at anytime of the day.</li>
            <li> The directions aren&#x27;t very clear, but i think you basically brush your teeth twice at night, once with your normally toothpaste and then once with this</li>
            <li> A clean flavor and results within the first few days.</li>
            <li> When I tried Crest&#x27;s 3D White toothpaste, I found it to be much like others I&#x27;ve tried: effective if you brush frequently, especially after eating or drinking beverages or foods that stain teeth (wine, coffee, blueberries, dark juices, tea, spaghetti sauce, etc.)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the toothpaste is effective for some whitening, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the very slight brown discoloration that can build up on teeth just above the gum line.  </li>
            <li> Was it because I brushed my teeth twice (the first time with toothpaste, and this as a followup)?  </li>
            <li> So first off, this is not actually toothpaste that you use every day.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> when I first read the packaging, I didn&#x27;t read it closely enough.</li>
            <li> Adding another 1-2 renditions of brushing is over the top for me, but I&#x27;m also not a famous actor, TV personality, politician, etc.  </li>
            <li> My teeth stay pretty white from whitening toothpastes and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will use it for an extra clean feeling after a especially string flavored meal, too.</li>
            <li> I must say, I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li> (in the Refreshing Mint flavor, at least).</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of white strips and polishes, but never see any real results.</li>
            <li> I have used whitening strips, but they seem to leave the area near the gum line, untouched.</li>
            <li> I have never had sensitive teeth before.</li>
            <li> Since I just wanted a touch up and didn&#x27;t feel like buying a whole box of crest white strips, I ordered this.</li>
            <li> Mesmerizing Mint Flavor Toothpaste, 4.1 Fluid Ounce]] along with the Crest 3D White Polishing Treatment - Brilliance Boost, and</li>
            <li> But I think I need to use it a few more times to give a final verdict on that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, if you are looking for a third category of treatment for your teeth, try this and see if you think the benefit is worth the extra time and expense.  </li>
            <li> Expensive and didn&#x27;t work any better than most other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing exactly that with this and a Crest 3D White toothpaste for the last 2 weeks, and my teeth do seem a shade whiter than they were before, when I was just brushing with Ultrabrite.</li>
            <li> I bought Sensodyne for sensitive teeth, but they still aren&#x27;t back to normal.</li>
            <li> No drastic pearly whites, but certainly some minor shades brighter.  </li>
            <li> If anyone knows how to get my teeth back to normal</li>
            <li> I really like the way my teeth feel after using this product; money well spent.</li>
            <li> I had recently tried Crest&#x27;s 3D Luxe for sensitive teeth and was not a fan.</li>
            <li> So far nothing has worked to get my teeth as white as I want.</li>
            <li> It feels (and tastes) very similar to the polish used at the dentist&#x27;s office when you get your teeth professionally</li>
            <li> I thought they were white before using this but WOW.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using it with regular Crest whitening, not the new 3D White stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work...has a noticeable effect, but it is slight and may not be worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li> I know brushing your teeth in the middle of the day is annoying, but I think that&#x27;s when the polishing treatment does its magic, since most coffee drinking is done by the middle of the day, and by using the polishing treatment, you are preventing the coffee staining from permeating your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have also used other whitening boosters but this one REALLY shows a difference.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth twice a day with an electric toothbrush (and floss daily), but I don&#x27;t do a lot of whitening generally.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth at least twice a day and have noticed a significant change in the whitening of my teeth since using the CREST 3D WHITE POLISHING TREATMENT.</li>
            <li> I noticed that within the first few days but after about 10 days or so, I noticed my teeth seem whiter and unlike with the whitening strips</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Colgate products and so after reading other reviews I thought I would give this particular brand a try.</li>
            <li> I have to generally use sensitive toothpaste for my back teeth; however, this product did not bother me like other non-sensitive brands.</li>
            <li> For reasons that escape me, Crest designed their 3D White toothpaste tubes to stand up, while the polishing treatment tube is slimmer and lies flat, taking up an unwieldy amount of counter space.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to talk about results, but I&#x27;m using it with 3d toothpaste &amp; strips &amp; ...</li>
            <li> Mainly because I am too lazy to ACTUALLY whiten.</li>
            <li> but they do make your teeth a little sensitive...</li>
            <li> I have a wedding  and a bunch of other social events to attend in a couple of months</li>
            <li> and since the results are so good, I don&#x27;t find it at all annoying to basically brush my teeth twice (once with toothpaste and then again with the polishing</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, especially to any other whitening toothpaste nut like myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brands of whitening toothpastes, strips, and other treatments.</li>
            <li> A bit spendy, but it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I am a big coffee drinker and I also sometimes drink dark sodas and fruit juices.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this because I&#x27;m a big fan of the Crest Whitening Strips.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that after a few days I saw a slight difference, my tooth looked brighter.</li>
            <li> I use white strips maybe once a year when I notice that my teeth have gotten a little yellow, and I get a little bit of a polish from the dentist&#x27;s office twice a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week of using this every night though, my teeth definitely looked a little whiter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot like the gritty cream the hygienist uses on your teeth after a cleaning when using the little buffing tool.</li>
            <li> Not as well as whitening strips, but I have a hard time with those because my teeth are sensitive.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks my teeth definitely look whiter.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s one of the few whitening toothpastes/boosters I have used that I actually noticed my teeth looking whiter...</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s certainly not a replacement for a whitening treatment at your dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (only gripe about the toothpaste is it&#x27;s a little thick/gunky!)</li>
            <li> After using it once (after regular brushing), I noticed a little less discoloration.  </li>
            <li> I am very annoyed because I don&#x27;t know how to get my teeth back to normal.</li>
            <li> Usually my hygienist uses a raspberry flavoured one and it actually has fluoride in it, but this does not.</li>
            <li> Moreover, my mouth is cleanerâ€”a benefit you don&#x27;t get from other whitening treatments.</li>
            <li> I use it about every other day.  </li>
            <li> reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it&#x27;s not working quite as miraculously as the package (and other reviews) led me to believe it would.</li>
            <li> I have to start this review off by saying that I am a total sucker for a whitening gimmick.</li>
            <li> It is a thick , slightly gritty paste you use to polish stains off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All toothpaste tastes the same to me, so I&#x27;m not impressed by packaging related to the taste.  </li>
            <li> This is a bit of an odd product: It doesn&#x27;t tout itself as a toothpaste (the product packaging says to use it in addition to toothpaste), but it is a goo that you put on the head of a toothbrush, rub against your teeth, and then rinse out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this &amp;#34;Brilliance Boost&amp;#34; variety, thinking it was your typical 2-in-1 whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I like the slight grittiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works, granted not as well as strips or trays, but I could tell a difference in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I do use the whitening strips about once every 2 weeks or less.</li>
            <li> I use this polishing treatment when I find out I&#x27;m going to be on camera in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> A little grittier.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it feels a little bit thicker though once it&#x27;s in your mouth, but</li>
            <li> Give it a  little time you will see the differents..</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a little grit or roughness to it,</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s tough for me to judge that objectively),</li>
            <li> this polishing treatment, I&#x27;m seeing results literally after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I took photos of my teeth every few days just to see if they were whiter</li>
            <li> I have to admit, after using it with toothpaste for a few weeks, it does whitens my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is not an everyday toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Although the whitening strips do work, they leave my teeth feeling extremely sensitive and I am unable to drink liquids.</li>
            <li> and so I don&#x27;t use the whitening toothpaste with fluoride everyday.</li>
            <li> , however, you use a whitening toothpaste everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but it works.....</li>
            <li> The weird thing about that is this has a sort of unpleasant polishy taste instead of a lovely, minty paste taste, so you have to get used to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result isn&#x27;t quite as dramatic as a white strip, but I won&#x27;t wear strips at work.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t particularly yellow, so it is difficult for me to judge how well this lifted stains.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s rather expensive, but if you prefer double the amount of brushing to the inconvenience of wearing strips,</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B electric toothbrush and I use a small bead of this on my brush along with a small bead of toothpaste, and brush for 2 minutes as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of the Crest 3D toothpastes in the past with no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after reading all of the fine-print on the packaging, this is only a polish!  </li>
            <li> difficult would it have been to have added some fluoride so that you don&#x27;t have to use 2 different products.  </li>
            <li> I have used the strips and trays in the past.</li>
            <li> and since then my teeth have been ridiculously sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li> The effect is not as dramatic as using the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of days, I was skeptical about this since I didn&#x27;t notice a change.</li>
            <li> I think this item es useless.</li>
            <li> Mind you, the taste is horrible, and I mean horrible, the first couple days,</li>
            <li> It feels like the polishing you get at the dentist office but without the awful taste.  </li>
            <li> Worst mistake!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this stuff rocks!!!!!!!! really whitens your teeth. will always have it around</li>
            <li> I am just like you. I have tried many whitening toothpastes, and none work very well. However, this product works immediately and beyond expectations.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my teeth feel after using this product; money well spent.</li>
            <li> Sent one or two tubes out to each of our children all over the country.  We all love this polish!  And, we all have great, white teeth.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT SO MUCH, IT IS PURTTEY GOOD, I ean iit is very good so nice and good to eat!!!</li>
            <li> I tried the [[ASIN:B00I5H5ZEG Crest 3D White Brilliance Mesmerizing Mint Flavor Toothpaste, 4.1 Fluid Ounce]] along with the Crest 3D White Polishing Treatment - Brilliance Boost, and I must say, I was really surprised.  My assumption is that any toothpaste is the same, and all of them advertise pretty much the same array of effects, including whiter teeth and refreshing flavor.  All toothpaste tastes the same to me, so I&#x27;m not impressed by packaging related to the taste.  And for the most part, all toothpaste seems to whiten the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the combination of these products actually whitens.  Fast.  I was not expecting that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  Polishing Treatment felt different from the toothpaste.  A little grittier.  It made my teeth feel quite clean.  Did it whiten my teeth? Dramatically.  My teeth looked noticeably whiter after the first use.  Was it because I brushed my teeth twice (the first time with toothpaste, and this as a followup)?  Perhaps.  But it was noticeable, whatever the reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Polishing Treatment is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> So first off, this is not actually toothpaste that you use every day. This is more of an after treatment. I use it a few days a week (after brushing with regular toothpaste) and have noticed some great results I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I&#x27;ve tried the Crest Whitestrips and just can&#x27;t manage to last through the entire treatment. I just don&#x27;t like the feel of them on my teeth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this polishing treatment, I&#x27;m seeing results literally after a few uses. Not super white amazing results, but certainly better than it was before I started using this. The price is great on this, especially for how well it works. Also, if you currently do use the Whitestrips, adding this to your regimen might increase your results. For me, I&#x27;m pretty happy so far with just this, but I also don&#x27;t ever drink coffee or wine, but I am a chocolate freak so I would say that my teeth see some staining from time to time. I will definitely be buying this once I run out and recommending it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overdue for a teeth cleaning my several months. Using this just a couple of times made my teeth feel so SMOOTH! Almost as good as you can get after a cleaning. I noticed that within the first few days but after about 10 days or so, I noticed my teeth seem whiter and unlike with the whitening strips, I have had no sensitivity issues with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already used and liked the Crest pro toothpaste and I think this goes great with that and since the results are so good, I don&#x27;t find it at all annoying to basically brush my teeth twice (once with toothpaste and then again with the polishing treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink a lot of iced tea so I might still have to use the strips once in awhile but I think this will make it so I don&#x27;t have to use so often. I will definitely be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t particularly yellow, so it is difficult for me to judge how well this lifted stains. What I do know is that my mouth felt very clean after using it. My teeth felt smooth and polished. It was almost as good as the way they feel after a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minty taste is kind of strong, but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked it and will continue using it. I feel it does a better job cleaning my teeth than brushing with just a regular toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Really helps to whiten.</li>
            <li> I have to start this review off by saying that I am a total sucker for a whitening gimmick. Mainly because I am too lazy to ACTUALLY whiten. Anyway, I used this toothpaste for the first time this morning and I am very impressed. I tend to stick to the Crest 3D line so when I saw this in Target, I couldn&#x27;t say no. I went all out and bought both the toothpaste and the booster. After using the toothpaste, yeah my mouth feels great and clean. perfect. Exactly what I wanted. I had recently tried Crest&#x27;s 3D Luxe for sensitive teeth and was not a fan. It made me feel like I had just chewed on celery for an hour and not that cool, fresh brushed feeling that I love so much.  Using brilliance was, quite literally, a breath of fresh air. Were my teeth whiter? Maybe. But I think I need to use it a few more times to give a final verdict on that. However, after using the boost I can definitely say that I saw a difference. Maybe they were &amp;#34;whiter&amp;#34; as much as they were clean and polished. To be honest, I felt as if I had just left the dentist. What a great feeling. I would recommend this product, especially to any other whitening toothpaste nut like myself.</li>
            <li> I use Crest whitening strips once or twice a year to keep my smile bright, so this polish is really just a supplement - and it does work to help keep my teeth bright, since I&#x27;m a coffee drinker (black and strong) and occasional red wine drinker, and berry eater - and and and - all those things that make your teeth less white and bright than they can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use this polish as a supplement to your regular tooth-brushing routine, not in the place of - that&#x27;s important to note. I&#x27;ll brush my teeth and then rinse, and then I&#x27;ll use the polish treatment with my electric toothbrush. The first time the product tasted a little strong, but I quickly became used to it. And one of the benefits of it being strong is that it leaves your mouth tasting minty and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well for keeping your teeth bright between those whitening treatments, or if you do not use white-strips, this product will help to control those surface stains that coffee, berries, wine, etc, can deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money even if just for that great nice tingly minty mouth afterward. I&#x27;ll purchase this product when this tube is gone.</li>
            <li> This is an alternative to wearing whitening strips or using a gel with a mouthguard.  The idea is that you brush twice, first with a toothpaste for cleaning (which this is not) then with this, for whitening. I suspect that the real benefit derives from the fact that you are doing twice as much brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it works â€“ after a couple of week&#x27;s use, I notice an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather expensive, but if you prefer double the amount of brushing to the inconvenience of wearing strips, etc., then you could try this.</li>
            <li> This product is meant as an addition to your toothbrushing habits. The brilliance boost is not mean as a toothpaste as it does not contain flouride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening works and gives me an extra boost in polishing. No drastic pearly whites, but certainly some minor shades brighter.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Used after brushing with the Crest 3D toothpaste, it makes my teeth look like I just came back from the dentist with that fresh-polished look.  My teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth twice a day with an electric toothbrush (and floss daily), but I don&#x27;t do a lot of whitening generally. I use white strips maybe once a year when I notice that my teeth have gotten a little yellow, and I get a little bit of a polish from the dentist&#x27;s office twice a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this stuff was worth a shot though and I was pleasantly surprised! The directions aren&#x27;t very clear, but i think you basically brush your teeth twice at night, once with your normally toothpaste and then once with this (I did two minutes with each), and I didn&#x27;t rinse after. I don&#x27;t know if you should rinse out your mouth after since the directions didn&#x27;t say, but my dentist criticized me for rinsing my mouth immediately after brushing my teeth instead of letting it stay in my mouth for a while after so I decided not to with this polishing treatment since it probably needs to stay on your teeth after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is similar to toothpaste and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your teeth like when your dentist polishes your teeth or anything like that. It tastes fine, too, probably better than normal 3D White (in the Refreshing Mint flavor, at least). I will say that it feels a little bit thicker though once it&#x27;s in your mouth, but not annoyingly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days, I was skeptical about this since I didn&#x27;t notice a change. After a week of using this every night though, my teeth definitely looked a little whiter. I took photos of my teeth every few days just to see if they were whiter and they visibly were - even my girlfriend agreed. I used this every night for 2 weeks straight and I was definitely getting diminished returns during that second week. That was several days ago - since then I haven&#x27;t used it at all and my teeth still look nice and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this works quite as dramatically as white strips do (it&#x27;s tough for me to judge that objectively), but given how much cheaper this stuff is, I think it works quite well. I&#x27;m definitely planning to use this again in the future when my teeth start to yellow a bit again.te well. I&#x27;m definitely planning to use this again in the future when my teeth start to yellow a bit again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 3D White toothpastes and also the whitening strips. I am a big coffee drinker and I also sometimes drink dark sodas and fruit juices. Even though I mostly only drink this stuff through a straw, my teeth still get stained. My teeth are not yellow but they aren&#x27;t as white as they should be. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brands of whitening toothpastes, strips, and other treatments. So far nothing has worked to get my teeth as white as I want. I decided to pick this up at Target one day, not thinking it would work. I was so wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is very gritty and not meant to be used in place of toothpaste. It has no fluoride or other ingredients meant for keeping teeth clean and plaque free. It&#x27;s a lot like the gritty cream the hygienist uses on your teeth after a cleaning when using the little buffing tool. It makes the teeth shiny and white. Usually my hygienist uses a raspberry flavoured one and it actually has fluoride in it, but this does not. It&#x27;s minty and just gritty with no fluoride. I have an Oral B electric toothbrush and I use a small bead of this on my brush along with a small bead of toothpaste, and brush for 2 minutes as usual. My teeth feel cleaner than ever and are already much whiter. Such an easy way to use it (doesn&#x27;t add more time to getting ready for the day or for bed, unlike whitening strips) and very effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the very first use my teeth were noticeably whiter to me, maybe not to anyone else though. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and my teeth are a lot whiter now. My husband has started using it since he could see it was working for me. I haven&#x27;t used my whitening strips in weeks, but I&#x27;m sure if I used them with the polishing treatment I&#x27;d have even better results. I have a wedding  and a bunch of other social events to attend in a couple of months and I am going to start using this treatment with the strips now. I am looking forward to finally having the smile I want!</li>
            <li> This is a bit of an odd product: It doesn&#x27;t tout itself as a toothpaste (the product packaging says to use it in addition to toothpaste), but it is a goo that you put on the head of a toothbrush, rub against your teeth, and then rinse out of your mouth. So why isn&#x27;t it a toothpaste? Because it contains no fluoride, apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider what happens when you go to the dentist: First your teeth are polished using abrasives, and then you rinse with a fluoride toothpaste, allowing fluoride to absorb into the enamel of your teeth and protect them from cavities. Crest seems to be recommending a similar regimen for routine care at home: brush your teeth with an abrasive polish, then with a fluoride toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been doing exactly that with this and a Crest 3D White toothpaste for the last 2 weeks, and my teeth do seem a shade whiter than they were before, when I was just brushing with Ultrabrite. Moreover, my mouth is cleanerâ€”a benefit you don&#x27;t get from other whitening treatments. And I haven&#x27;t had any problems with teeth sensitivity. Also, the price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is with the tube design. For reasons that escape me, Crest designed their 3D White toothpaste tubes to stand up, while the polishing treatment tube is slimmer and lies flat, taking up an unwieldy amount of counter space. I would have much preferred matching tubes, given that the products are intended to be used together.</li>
            <li> Honestly though, this stuff seems to work really well when it comes to whitening and polishing my teeth. Seems to show within the first couple uses. Your teeth will be mo&#x27; white, and probably, mo&#x27; shiny. Not quite the glow-in-the-dark quality of the commercial, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> I think this item es useless. Really...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have different in my smile My teeth are equal. I had been using all 3D White&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked for the refund to PG</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of the Crest 3D toothpastes in the past with no complaints.  I thought I would try this &amp;#34;Brilliance Boost&amp;#34; variety, thinking it was your typical 2-in-1 whitening toothpaste.  Unfortunately, after reading all of the fine-print on the packaging, this is only a polish!  It contains no fluoride and states that you must additionally use toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky to brush my own teeth twice a day, now to use the Crest 3D white polishing treatment, that means 3-4 brushings per day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How difficult would it have been to have added some fluoride so that you don&#x27;t have to use 2 different products.  2-in-1 whitening toothpastes are a dime a dozen out there, Crest of all brands should know how to make one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For practical use, considering time and effort, 3-stars is fair here.  As for results, I have no complaints after 2 weeks, but I had fairly white teeth to begin with, so nothing earth-shattering to report after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this because I&#x27;m a big fan of the Crest Whitening Strips. I have to admit, after using it with toothpaste for a few weeks, it does whitens my teeth. The effect is not as dramatic as using the whitening strips. Nevertheless, it does work to give your teeth a clarifying boost.</li>
            <li> it works well along with the teeth whitening kit</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the better part of a month, and I can really see a difference. It specifically says not to be used as a substitute for toothpaste, but rather as a supplement for after brushing. The weird thing about that is this has a sort of unpleasant polishy taste instead of a lovely, minty paste taste, so you have to get used to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, it really works well. If you are looking to lighten those coffee and red wine stains, this is a great way to go. I personally have used the strips, which are certainly effective, but tend to hurt my teeth after a few uses, but this didn&#x27;t, which I really liked. It is more effective than whitening tooth paste and less immediately effective, but not as damaging to your teeth as the strips, so I find this quite the winner in my book!</li>
            <li> This is not an everyday toothpaste. It is a thick , slightly gritty paste you use to polish stains off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it once a week with an oral-b electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- Effective at removing espresso staining on my lower teeth that had escaped my regular routine.&lt;br /&gt;- Flavor and texture were nice. I like the slight grittiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;- A bit spendy, but it lasts a very long time.  A good value for a good amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;- Use in addition to your regular fluoride toothpaste, whenever you want to brighten and remove stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> all i can say is beautiful teeth</li>
            <li> Works well within one week of using it.  Will definitely be purchasing again</li>
            <li> Okay, so u have been using crest products for a little over a year now. I have tried everything from whitening strips to toothpaste to mouthwash. Although the whitening strips do work, they leave my teeth feeling extremely sensitive and I am unable to drink liquids. However, the brilliance boost provides whitening without the pain you get from the strips.</li>
            <li> Love this polishing.  It feels like the polishing you get at the dentist office but without the awful taste.  Definitely use in conjunction with whitening tooth paste and in my case oil pulling.  Overall good for your oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> When I tried Crest&#x27;s 3D White toothpaste, I found it to be much like others I&#x27;ve tried: effective if you brush frequently, especially after eating or drinking beverages or foods that stain teeth (wine, coffee, blueberries, dark juices, tea, spaghetti sauce, etc.)  However, when I used this polishing treatment along with the 3D White, the overall whitening result seemed more significant.  Basically, you would brush twice, once with the 3D White, then with the 3D White Polishing Treatment.  I would definitely use both again.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Colgate products and so after reading other reviews I thought I would give this particular brand a try. A clean flavor and results within the first few days. I have to generally use sensitive toothpaste for my back teeth; however, this product did not bother me like other non-sensitive brands. Mr Fiance uses this Crest White Strips as well and noticed better results when she used the polishing treatment as well. Price is a little higher than regular toothpaste but is a good supplement during regular brushing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice much difference - though that won&#x27;t prevent me from at LEAST finishing out the tube! :-D</li>
            <li> Good product it works!! Give it a  little time you will see the differents..</li>
            <li> It sort of works.....</li>
            <li> Works very well when used after the 3D whitening toothpaste. I love the results I am gettting</li>
            <li> This really did make a difference.  My teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps whiten teeth after using the toothpaste, and it tastes good.</li>
            <li> So I am a hardcore coffee drinker, and while my teeth aren&#x27;t YELLOW they are for sure stained. My teeth are too sensitive to use whitening stripes on, and i&#x27;ve had some ok luck with some whitening pens out but I&#x27;m always looking for something to help my teeth look whiter so I scooped this booster up and the the matching toothpaste when these first hit the store. I&#x27;ve been using the toothpaste (only gripe about the toothpaste is it&#x27;s a little thick/gunky!) and this booster. I was surprised that after a few days I saw a slight difference, my tooth looked brighter. After a few weeks my teeth definitely look whiter. No, it&#x27;s not a dramatic whitening product but it&#x27;s one of the few whitening toothpastes/boosters I have used that I actually noticed my teeth looking whiter... and these products don&#x27;t seem to be bothering my teeth. Worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for something to achieve practical results or use between whitening stripes/treatments to maintain your white.</li>
            <li> Riminds me of a paste version of the original Perl drops.</li>
            <li> Heard good things about this. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to talk about results, but I&#x27;m using it with 3d toothpaste &amp; strips &amp; ...it should be good results lol. Cause the strips are fantastic, toothpaste whatever, and this product...it leaves a real clean feeling. So, I like it. I brush with it after I brush with the toothpaste in this line.</li>
            <li> I feel like this does help in boosting the whitening power of your toothpaste but they do make your teeth a little sensitive...Only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works, granted not as well as strips or trays, but I could tell a difference in less than a week. Not bad for a toothpaste alone. I would recommend this toothpaste for anyone who does not expect instant whitening. I do use the whitening strips about once every 2 weeks or less. I often receive compliments on my bright smile.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use this long enough to detect a real difference... While the taste and texture didn&#x27;t bother me at all, I started having a itchy burning sensation in the roof of my mouth every time I tried to eat. Probably just an individual reaction to the product... I&#x27;m willing to try it again eventually and see if it still bothers me. Due to that problem though I wasn&#x27;t able to rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Okay. So I have been using Crest 3D white toothpaste since, well forever. I am not picky about most things in my life, but I am about which toothpaste I buy, and it HAS to be 3D Glamorous White. So with that being said, alone, it has always provided me with nicer, whiter, looking teeth. However, recently, I have decided to venture out and really perfect my smile, so I decided to purchase the Polishing Treatment. WOW. It has whitened and brightened my smile by eons. Mind you, I used this product with my toothpaste alone for about a week and the results were amazing, but let me tell you, since I started using the mouthwash and the whitening strips, OH MY GOODNESS. My smile is getting noticeably whiter every day. I am sooo impressed by this lineup! Mind you, the taste is horrible, and I mean horrible, the first couple days, but then you get used to it and the results make it sooo worth it. I will be buying this product for the rest of my life!!</li>
            <li> I have already been using Crest 3D toothpaste for several months and yes, it does a good job of cleaning and keeping most stains off my teeth.  But when Crest 3D Polishing Treatment promised to improve these results, I had to put them to the test.  Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the toothpaste is effective for some whitening, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the very slight brown discoloration that can build up on teeth just above the gum line.  After using it once (after regular brushing), I noticed a little less discoloration.  Using it now once a day, there is virtually no discoloration on my upper teeth.  The discoloration has lightened on the lower teeth.  The whiteness is a couple of shades lighter, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Brilliance Boost Treatment is not a replacement for regular brushing.  Nor, is it a replacement for Crest&#x27;s 3D Whitestrips.  (I tried them and they&#x27;re fairly effective in lightening tooth color.)  And it&#x27;s certainly not a replacement for a whitening treatment at your dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it can surely do a decent job of keeping teeth whiter for a longer period of time, requiring either fewer or no trips to the dentist for whitening treatments.  It may be useful to get a professional whitening treatment and use the Crest 3D polishing Treatment to maintain your newly pearly whites.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot---it makes my teeth feel smooth and just polished.  I use it about every other day.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible whitening but it could be just so gradual that it hasn&#x27;t hit me yet.  It would get a 5 if there were noticeable whitening.</li>
            <li> I have to start with a confession: when I first read the packaging, I didn&#x27;t read it closely enough. I thought it said that this product was recommended to be used with *any* Crest whitening product, not specifically with Crest 3D White toothpaste. So I&#x27;ve been using it with regular Crest whitening, not the new 3D White stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it still kind of works. Not as well as whitening strips, but I have a hard time with those because my teeth are sensitive. This hasn&#x27;t caused any sensitivity issues at all. It feels (and tastes) very similar to the polish used at the dentist&#x27;s office when you get your teeth professionally cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it&#x27;s not working quite as miraculously as the package (and other reviews) led me to believe it would. I realize that part of that might be because I&#x27;m not using it with 3D White like I&#x27;m supposed to, but I still think that&#x27;s a limitation of the product--that it has to be used in conjunction with another product in order to be fully effective.</li>
            <li> This product will give you about one shade,whitening if used as directed along with the toothpaste. It is not a miracle white product, so don&#x27;t get your hopes up. It simply cannot do what a dentist does. I see it as a good maintenance product after a professional whitening service or for very lightly discolored teeth, nothing more.</li>
            <li> A stocking stuffer. When my wife is happy I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Probably toxic but my teeth are much whiter!</li>
            <li> It does work, you can feel it.&lt;br /&gt;When paired with the white strips, It does a hell of a job</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is promoted to keep teeth white in between brushes with your favorite whitening toothpaste or as a boost. That doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me unless you don&#x27;t use another whitening toothpaste everyday. Which, actually, I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not a fan of fluoride and so I don&#x27;t use the whitening toothpaste with fluoride everyday. So this helps to keep my teeth white in between those brushes without adding more fluoride into my teeth brushing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is fine. However, I am not a fan of chemical tastes, which this has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if polishing and continued whitening is what you want, don&#x27;t hesitate in buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, however, you use a whitening toothpaste everyday I don&#x27;t see the need to use this.</li>
            <li> Who doesnâ€™t what whiter teeth? In todayâ€™s world, it just doesnâ€™t make sense to have yellow teeth. I was leery if CREST 3D WHITE POLISHING TREATMENT â€“ BRILLIAN BOOST, 3 OUNCE would work, but work it dose. I was amazed at how quickly you see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is a bit different, but the same constancy as toothpaste. It is not to be used in place of toothpaste, but after regular brushing for the sole purpose of whitening your teeth. Itâ€™s a nice change from the whitening strips, with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢3x stain-lifting ingredient.**vs. Crest 3D White toothpastes&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Daily teeth polishing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Boost formula amplifies whiteness</li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth with my Soniccare toothbrush with the 2 step crest HD toothpaste, this makes my teeth feel unreal! My teeth feel even cleaner, stay cleaner, and I feel I already have a brighter smile!</li>
            <li> I have been using this whitening &amp;#34;booster&amp;#34; paste along with CREST 3D WHITENING TOOTHPASTE and I have to say I am impressed. I have used all kinds of white strips and polishes, but never see any real results. After over a month of use, I can see my teeth as noticeably whiter .They are not super-white, but still I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a toothpaste, so you do need to still use your regular toothpaste to clean and prevent cavities. I use this twice a day. Morning and at bedtime. Sometimes I will use it for an extra clean feeling after a especially string flavored meal, too. It leaves my mouth feeling extra clean, almost like after a dentist cleaning. I do have a Sonicare electric toothbrush, so that obviously adds to it</li>
            <li> There are no instructions on the packaging so I had no idea how to use this product, since it says &amp;#34;polishing treatment&amp;#34; and not toothpaste. Do I leave it in my mouth for a couple of minutes? Should I scrub extra hard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does say in bold letters that it does not contain fluoride and should not replace your fluoride (i.e. regular) toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can be used in 2 ways: right after your regular toothpaste, or in addition at anytime of the day. I know brushing your teeth in the middle of the day is annoying, but I think that&#x27;s when the polishing treatment does its magic, since most coffee drinking is done by the middle of the day, and by using the polishing treatment, you are preventing the coffee staining from permeating your teeth. You just brush the same way you do as regular toothbrush, it just has more hydrogen peroxide instead of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that since it has the same ingredients as Crest Strips, but you don&#x27;t need to leave it on your mouth, as a result, it not as effective as whitening strips (though its more effective than the whitening mouthwash) If you use all 3 (mouthwash, polishing treatment, and strips), you are pretty much guaranteed a hollywood smile without the hollywood prices.</li>
            <li> This is a unique polishing treatment. Like the kind the dentist / hygienist provides.  There is no fluoride so you use this after regular brushing. Add this to a whitening campaign and my teeth look like just coming from the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;Has a pleasant minty taste and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> I use this polishing treatment when I find out I&#x27;m going to be on camera in less than an hour. As a coffee drinker, this product helps me make a good impression in the middle of my work day. The result isn&#x27;t quite as dramatic as a white strip, but I won&#x27;t wear strips at work.</li>
            <li> I try to take care of my teeth and keep them looking nice (although, I admit I really donâ€™t like flossing). Recently I had the opportunity to try some CREST 3D WHITE POLISHING TREATMENT. This is a polish that is supposed to be used in addition to brushing. You put in on a toothbrush and use it like toothpaste, but only after you have already brushed your teeth. I brush my teeth at least twice a day and have noticed a significant change in the whitening of my teeth since using the CREST 3D WHITE POLISHING TREATMENT. It has made my teeth freaky-white, ala Ed Helms, but it has whitened my teeth some. Personally, I think this works &amp; feels better on my teeth than Crest Whitestrips. Iâ€™m so impressed with CREST 3D WHITE POLISHING TREATMENT that I will continue to use it in the future to help keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting dental care product.  Most products are either a paste for cleaning/whitening -OR- are a whitening product like a gel, tray, white strip, etc.  This product kind of creates a third category.  It doesn&#x27;t whiten.  It doesn&#x27;t clean.  It boosts or enhances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t replace your regular brushing or trips to the dentist.  It contains no fluoride.  This doesn&#x27;t remove your need for a whitening product if you want whiter teeth.  Instead is enhances, amplifies, refines, or boosts what you are already doing.  If you are not doing anything, this will not miraculously improve your teeth.  If you are fanatical about your teeth, brush twice a day, floss, use whitening products...this product will further improve upon that by protecting against tartar, discoloration, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has some grit to it...almost like brushing with toothpaste mixed with sand.  The end effect is similar to the last step at the dentist where they buff out your teeth.  Even with this grit, the product provides assurance that it is safe for the enamel of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product.  I feel like if you are willing to use it 1-2x a day regularly it has benefit.  I personally don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time on my teeth each day.  I already brush my teeth 2x per day for 2 minutes each time, floss, and use mouthwash.  Adding another 1-2 renditions of brushing is over the top for me, but I&#x27;m also not a famous actor, TV personality, politician, etc.  Just a normal shmoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you are looking for a third category of treatment for your teeth, try this and see if you think the benefit is worth the extra time and expense.  It does work...has a noticeable effect, but it is slight and may not be worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li> I love my coffee, and I am ,shall we say, a frugal shopper.  I can not stand the idea of paying $40 for whitening strips.  This boosting polish does whiten enough that I feel that I can happily enjoy my coffee without worrying about ruining my teeth.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have used whitening strips, but they seem to leave the area near the gum line, untouched. Not so with this tooth polish because everywhere you brush, gets treated. Granted, it doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as the strips, but I&#x27;m not usually in a rush to whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell this isn&#x27;t toothpaste by it&#x27;s texture and there&#x27;s a little grit or roughness to it, nothing really noticeable unless you think about it. i used this for a month, pretty regularly and it did a nice job of whitening my teeth; I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this stuff. It&#x27;s not cheap but it works.....really good. My teeth stay pretty white from whitening toothpastes and mouthwash. I have used the strips and trays in the past. I have also used other whitening boosters but this one REALLY shows a difference. I put it on top of whatever toothpaste I am using and noticed after the first brushing how WHITE my teeth looked. I thought they were white before using this but WOW. Since I started using this..a lot of people have commented on how white my teeth look so i definitely know it is noticeable. Give it a try if you are trying to whiten your teeth...it works very well. It tastes good too</li>
            <li> Item received as described and on time.</li>
            <li> I brushed my teeth with this one time for about 2 minutes (my electric toothbrush is timed for 2 minutes) and since then my teeth have been ridiculously sensitive to cold. I have never had sensitive teeth before. I am very annoyed because I don&#x27;t know how to get my teeth back to normal. I have used crest strips before and have never had a problem. Since I just wanted a touch up and didn&#x27;t feel like buying a whole box of crest white strips, I ordered this. Worst mistake! If anyone knows how to get my teeth back to normal I would greatly appreciate it. I bought Sensodyne for sensitive teeth, but they still aren&#x27;t back to normal.</li>
            <li> This stuff works real good with any tooth paste, now that I have the 3D Crest White stripes, I know I will have a brighter and whiter teeth by the time 2015. I am changing my whole look. You hear me. I am not trying to change, I am changing my whole look. You don&#x27;t even have to use much of this stuff either. It make your teeth feel clean and smooth while making them even whiter, I swear it. I am glad that I got this product to enhance my whiteness of my teeth. This is not a tooth paste okay, just a enhancer.</li>
            <li> Expensive and didn&#x27;t work any better than most other brands</li>
