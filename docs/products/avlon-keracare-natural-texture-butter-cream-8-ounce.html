            <li>Worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a daily moisture cream.</li>
            <li>New user, no comment yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li>This creme keeps my hair moisturized and it&#x27;s not heavy at all!</li>
            <li>and I have to moisturize daily to make sure it stays soft and have less tangles.</li>
            <li>If you have natural hair</li>
            <li>and this is the cheapest price so far that I have found I use it in my hair and my daughters</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, and enhances the natural curl.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel so soft and moisturiazed.</li>

            <li>Have used it twice so far</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t use as much water, just enough to damped it</li>
            <li>I use the KeraCare Hydrating Detangling Shampoo followed by the KeraCare Natural Textures Leave In Conditioner, and last but not least I apply the KeraCare Natural texture Butter Cream.</li>
            <li>Kept my daughters hair moisturized and is gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li>I have extremely porous hair that refuses to hold onto moisture for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>A little goes a very long way, it has a nice scent not too overpowering but not very mild either.</li>
            <li>and there just weren&#x27;t enough natural ingredients in it for me.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning and this has been the only product that has allowed my hair to stay moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>I did the BIG CHOP back in 2009 and have been natural every since.</li>
            <li>I had tried so many products that where either to heavy or dried my hair out.</li>

            <li> I have course, extremely kinky hair (and a lot of it)</li>

            <li> I would have saved a lot of money by not buying all those other products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I searched endlessly for a product that would not weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it when my hair is wet, so I give it a few hours after wash.</li>
            <li> Its extremely moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, if not every other day (depends on what style I wear).  </li>
            <li> so I used half the jar after I do a treatment (wash/condition/treatment).</li>
            <li> I also felt the product was a little on the greasy side  </li>
            <li> With just a little edge control she&#x27;s set to go.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really enjoy  this product on my natural hair and have since 2010.</li>
            <li> New user, no comment yet</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers that claim to work for natural hair, but this one is by far the best. I have extremely porous hair that refuses to hold onto moisture for more than a few hours. This product helps keep my hair moisturized all day!</li>
            <li> If you have natural hair then you need this product. I searched endlessly for a product that would not weigh my hair down and I finally found one. The smell is pleasant as well. Thumbs up to this !!!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff the smell is awesome and this is the cheapest price so far that I have found I use it in my hair and my daughters we get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer that&#x27;s not too greasy. Leaves my hair soft, and enhances the natural curl. Really good product for natural black hair!</li>
            <li> Finally, something that actually works. I have course, extremely kinky hair (and a lot of it) so I used half the jar after I do a treatment (wash/condition/treatment). Eventually less is needed and it just does wonders to dry hair. I don&#x27;t use it when my hair is wet, so I give it a few hours after wash. The trick is to finger comb all the way through in small sections. If you grab a section and think it&#x27;s small enough, make it smaller. It&#x27;s EXTREMELY time consuming for me, but may not be for you. I love my hair afterwords. Best curls I&#x27;ve ever had. EVER!</li>
            <li> The consistency was ok, but I didn&#x27;t really like the odor.  It was a bit sweet and overpowering. I also felt the product was a little on the greasy side  and there just weren&#x27;t enough natural ingredients in it for me. Using this actually inspired me to make my own natural hair butters.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite moisturizes. My hair is very thick with small coils. It gets tangled a lot and I have to moisturize daily to make sure it stays soft and have less tangles. The fragrance is light and not too annoying for my allergy-ridden household.</li>
            <li> I ditched relaxers and went natural a few years ago.  I worked hard not to become a product junkie, while trying to figure out just what works for my natural hair.  After a few hit and misses (as my hair grew out, the product need changed), my mom found the Keracare Natural Textures line of hair products and bought me a sample set.  Let me just say, AWESOME!!  Out of all of the styling products in this line, the Butter Cream is my favorite. I use it everyday, if not every other day (depends on what style I wear).  It is a great moisturizer and a style maintainer.  Oh, and it smells yummy!  Kudos to Keracare for developing a great line!</li>
            <li> I love this product on my hair! Love it! Love it! Love it! It is a must buy! Get your Keracare!</li>
            <li> I had hoped this product would do the trick....help me with my thick dry hair but sadly enough it did nothing for my hair. ORS olive oil butter creme is ten times better than this. But i will keep using this product but will not buy again</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this butter cream. It can revive my hair when its dull -- that&#x27;s impressive. It also smells good and the consistency is what I was looking for. Not too thick, not sticky, and not to wimpy. Worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a daily moisture cream.</li>
            <li> This product is great for locs, giving a good moisture and no sticky buildup.  The fragrance is very mild and clean smelling which is another plus.  I also use the Butter Cream on my daughters thick coily  hair, giving it a rich luster, adequate control, and beautiful conditioning.  With just a little edge control she&#x27;s set to go.  I also like to tap her edges with the Butter Cream a couple times a week and wrap with a silken scarf at bed time.  My boys wear their hair in low cuts.  Works fabby on them too. I&#x27;ve tried many products over the past 20 years.  This is one of the best I&#x27;ve use.</li>
            <li> I have natural thick kinky hair (for 7 years) and I really like this product. It moisturizes but it&#x27;s not watery like some other products (Mizani Rose Water). I also used this on my son who has curly hair and it still works well, adding moisture and a light sheen to his hair.</li>
            <li> This product has a very nice texture. I have 4B hair type and I have experimented on the market using a variety of cremes to make my hair more softer and more manageable. I have found nothing until this great product. My hair feels so soft and is so easy to comb through. One of my biggest hair problems solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Kera care butter cream textures really works wonders for my hair. This hair cream keep my hair very healthy as I transition to natural hair. And plus it smells good to. This hair product is a winner for me.</li>
            <li> I tried both the twist and define cream and butter cream and they are great they do the job</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do much for my natural haor.</li>
            <li> I did not like thus product. I really don&#x27;t think it was for my hair. I wanted it to slick my natural hair for a ponytail and it did not do the trick</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd tie reordering this butter cream for my 4b/4c hair... AH-MAZING!!! love. gives amazing hold by itself for my twist outs on dry, stretched hair. add some homemade flaxseed gel and its definition for days! LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is not greasy on my hair.  It feels moisturized and I like the way my hair looks.  I have gotten many compliments on my hair while using the Kera Care Naturals line.</li>
            <li> I did the BIG CHOP back in 2009 and have been natural every since. I had tried so many products that where either to heavy or dried my hair out. I came to Amazon and looked at several products and read several reviews. A nice young man on one of the reviews told me about KeraCare so I ordered it. I have finally found a product line I love. This makes my hair feel so soft and moisturiazed. I use the KeraCare Hydrating Detangling Shampoo followed by the KeraCare Natural Textures Leave In Conditioner, and last but not least I apply the KeraCare Natural texture Butter Cream. These products work so good together. Wished I had found these products sooner. I would have saved a lot of money by not buying all those other products that didn&#x27;t work. I have told several people that had also did the BIG Chop about these products.</li>
            <li> This Butter Cream is one of my favs! I use this at night when braiding my hair for my braid-outs! Its extremely moisturizing! Its a staple in my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> I love the thickness of the cream. It keeps my natural hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave residue or flake. Moisturizes nicely.  Works well with the complete line of products. Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Really a great moisturizing hair cream for natural hair.  No silicones and a lot of great natural oils.  Smells great too.  Avlon really gets it right when it comes to natural hair products!</li>
            <li> It has my hair moist but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Have used it twice so far and I believe it works just like described in the ad.</li>
            <li> I found it to be to greasy and heavy for my hair. For my sisters hair it work very well so I just gave it to her</li>
            <li> Kept my daughters hair moisturized and is gentle enough to use daily. It also helped define my daughters curls and smells good</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, it has a nice scent not too overpowering but not very mild either. My hair doesn&#x27;t stay moisturized for very long with this product.</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this butter creme.  Other products have given me a better finish.  I will use it but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the butter cream.  I&#x27;d been using this product for 4 months now and it makes my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This creme keeps my hair moisturized and it&#x27;s not heavy at all!</li>
            <li> I love it. It is a five star product the only reason I gave it a 4 is because of the price. You can find this product cheaper if you google search it. Some websites are offering it for 20% off . I did not know that until after I purchased and wanted more. Of course this will be a part of my staple. I have 4a hair so this works great for my thirsty hair. U only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> I like this product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff on my natural twa, it helps my curls to pop even more while adding moisture.</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair reacts to the cream.. I have thick wavy hair and I usually wet it every morning.  Now, I don&#x27;t use as much water, just enough to damped it and I put the Texture Butter Cream in my scalp (every three days) and put around the edge of my hair and brush it.  I will purchase the other products later.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product on my 4B/C natural African American hair ! it is just amazing and it&#x27;s the best butter I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been using and I will continue to use</li>
            <li> It does the job! Makes the hair just moist enough loosen too tight curls and waves.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy effect.</li>
            <li> Avlon Keracare Natural Texture Butter Cream is a great product.  I am transitioning and this has been the only product that has allowed my hair to stay moisturized and soft.  I&#x27;m able to run the comb through without meeting up with tangles.  I leaves my hair shiny as well.  I really helps the natural texture of my hair!!</li>
