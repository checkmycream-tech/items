    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Of the acne line by Burt&#x27;s Bees , in my opinion, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>After years of looking for the perfect cleanser I found the acne line by Burts Bees - my skin care answer - thank you.</li>
            <li>She is very happy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li>(Their signature lip balm is wonderful.)</li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>and it just feels wonderful to use.</li>
            <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bees line of acne care is wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I have had great results.</li>
            <li>While in-between products her skin did not look great</li>
            <li>GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li>it works great</li>
            <li>More impressive though is the fact that this cleanser does do what it claims, albeit not overnight.  </li>
            <li>Also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Great product and even better price!</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin, and am susceptible to blackheads.</li>
            <li>LOVE this!</li>
            <li>But when I do, I use the hot spot cream and it works great!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cleanser!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>This product honestly should cost more!</li>
            <li>It smells and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say, there has been no product quite like this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Acne-prone skin does well with a good moisturizer anyway, so make sure you follow this cleanser with a schmear of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am incredible fair and have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect balance between sensitive and effective.</li>
            <li>and the fact it&#x27;s almost 100% natural is the best part.</li>
            <li>:) WOULD LOVE TO BUY MORE!</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, but it is very effective.  </li>
            <li>However, it is good for people who have mild acne or looking for a maintenance regimen.</li>
            <li>I will buy it once more.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better cleansers I have ever used, and kept me from breaking out well even though I was on steriods and trying to.  </li>
            <li>Cleans without stripping the skin, the whole line is great.</li>
            <li>I love that I can recommend something that is almost 100 percent</li>
            <li>I feel better too knowing that she woke up too this morning and said, &amp;#34;I feel so much better about my skin today&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCTS FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li>Really love them.</li>
            <li>That worked much better.</li>
            <li>MY DAUGHTERS LOVE IT  </li>
            <li>that means it&#x27;s working (I just love that feeling).  </li>
            <li>And then I noticed more on my chest and shoulders--I was freaking out.  </li>
            <li>For gel being in the name, it&#x27;s more like liquidy soap.</li>
            <li>The difference is that it&#x27;s much, much more tepid, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and clears up a lot faster.</li>
            <li>It ended up causing more acne.</li>
            <li>I wash my face at most 3 times a day:</li>
            <li>, I look forward to washing my face with this stuff because it makes it look so much better and feel better.</li>
            <li>purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees Purifying Gel Cleanser on a whim while browsing in a local drugstore and was more than impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>this is great you dont need much at all</li>
            <li>My daughter use it for more than a year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying and I love that it smells how you&#x27;d expect</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about this cleanser?</li>
            <li>i preferred it more as a body wash than a face wash.</li>
            <li>I do continue to love the Burts Bees natural acne Lotion because it&#x27;s really a great face</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive and combination skin</li>
            <li>Very nice and natural scent</li>
            <li>Rinse with cool water and PAT!</li>
            <li>Bottle cap breaks easily</li>
            <li>Easy to over-dispense</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Still lathers up just fine, but I thought it would be something that would hold its shape when I squeezed it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It also effectively removed all traces of makeup and believe me, no one was more surprised than I when my toner-laden cotton ball showed not a trace of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a few acne cleansers but this is the best.</li>
            <li>and we have seen great results in a short time.  </li>
            <li>and nothing working too great and her face was ver red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazing at how fast the results are coming in.</li>
            <li>Combat it with a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two really important things to note about this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>its a great product, this Brand its a very reliable Brand because its very organic</li>
            <li>Good cleanser my face is clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>I wanted the gel cleanser because I originally ordered it.</li>
            <li>The most effective acne solution I had come up with was Dr. Bronners Lavender and a prescription topical lotion called Duac which is clindamycin and 5% benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>product did leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>its keeps my face clean &amp; beatifull</li>
            <li>The only thing it did was leave a pleasant lemony scent.</li>
            <li>Light, natural scent, not at all &#x27;perfumey&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent value, the bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ended up buying another bottle just out of pure love.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this product</li>
            <li>This is OK, but I really took issue with the amount of bubbly suds that got stuck in my hairline as I was trying to rinse this off my face.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, and if you use too much, you&#x27;re going to strip your skin and cause more acne.</li>
            <li>Does a good job on mild to moderate acne</li>
            <li>I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees when I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>The first 3 weeks were fabulous</li>
            <li>I definitely want to try more of Burts Bee skin care!</li>
            <li>I love this gel cleanser, it has a light but refreshing citrus smell and foams slightly when used.  </li>
            <li>Clear, smooth, glowing, softer, brighter!....</li>
            <li>She used Pro-Active, which a I paid $50 for about 6 weeks worth.  </li>
            <li>For me, the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive series work better than this.</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite face wash.  </li>
            <li>I have been more pleased with this face wash than any other.</li>
            <li>We did not have good luck with the other products in this line, but this one is a winner.  </li>
            <li>right on my jaw line, and in the hollows of my cheek.</li>
            <li>but I just noticed that I am breaking out on my forehead and along my right jaw.</li>
            <li>very oily skin for most of my adult life and been on a myriad of antibiotics</li>
            <li>Within 3 days it Just completely gave me 4 HUGE cysts on my right cheek.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, kept a long time, and produced comfortable foam, however, I don&#x27;t think it worked as an anti-acne cleanser.</li>
            <li>this stuff is very gentle and does not cause redness.</li>
            <li>This along with Alba Botanica Hawaiian Pineapple Enzyme Facial Cleanser keep my face clean and acne free.  </li>
            <li>BUT IN THE STORES ITS PRETTY PRICEY.</li>
            <li>(personally I feel that when the product sits on my face it works better).</li>
            <li>my skin has really improved!</li>
            <li>the best one ill try</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other products would cause noticeable irritation, and even if they cleared my skin up at first, they&#x27;d stop working and often even made the problem</li>
            <li>but it was higher concentrate.</li>
            <li>This stuff is especially effective at sniping those tiny little whiteheads that like to form near your lips and in your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It pops open easily when traveling ruining your bag&#x27;s contents and eating the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for 3 months and while it hasn&#x27;t eradicated my breakouts it has certainly lessened the amount of pimples while speeding up their healing time.  </li>
            <li>I immediately stopped using the products but not soon enough because I then had a huge flare-up all over my chin area.  </li>
            <li>and I was an absolute skeptic.</li>
            <li>Gentle and works very well for preventing acne.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to, too.    </li>
            <li>VERY INEXPENSIVE ONLINE.</li>
            <li>Not a problem if you&#x27;re in the shower, but with a washcloth it was really labor intensive to try to rinse this stuff off.</li>
            <li>I really helps with my acne problem.</li>
            <li>Expected a lot better from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>Fast results</li>
            <li>Lathers well, and lather is very creamy</li>
            <li>One is that it&#x27;s very concentrated.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s also pretty normal for acid-based acne products, but no biggy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I have been using this product for a while, and my skin is much clearer than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very relieved to have found this</li>
            <li>It really keeps &amp;#34;would</li>
            <li>, what is there to lather doesn&#x27;t lather much at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more liquid like than I had expected it to be, but that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li>Worked really well for about 8 months and then started drying my face out.</li>
            <li>Regular treatments weren&#x27;t helping, She found out your skin changes with age and needs different treatments, Viola, my normal handsome self again!  </li>
            <li>About 3-4 on her chin, 3-4 on her forhead right in between her eyes and and 4-6 zits near her hairline.  </li>
            <li>I can feel the deep clean after I wash with Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne cleanser.</li>
            <li>For the first time in over a decade I no longer need to depend on prescription medication to give me the hope of clear skin.</li>
            <li>Another good thing about this brand is that you only have to use just a little.</li>
            <li>And if you go onto a certain website which I cannot name here, you will see it has a hazard score of 6 (much too high for a product that is considered &#x27;natural&#x27;).  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended this for me, as I got older (60) I started to get acne.  </li>
            <li>Faced with a looming first date with my Dream Guy just around the corner, I abandoned my normal Lush soap, a Benedict Arnold that had gone from Skin Savior to Breakout Baron, and agonized over what to buy instead before settling on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser is a translucent yellow, light gel-like, lemon/herbal-smelling, medicated (1% salicylic acid), foaming cleanser for acne-prone</li>
            <li>I have not broken out and my skin has not dried it.</li>
            <li>I bought this in order to switch my whole face care routine to all natural.</li>
            <li>and it really helped clear up my gestational acne.</li>
            <li>I also use the daily lotion, and together I rarely ever get zits.</li>
            <li>but if you have dry skin do not get it it helps dry it out so oily skin people it will work better for it arrived almost the next day super fast and the product will last for a long time because you dont need more the a nicki size for our face</li>
            <li>Now my problem areas are my cheeks and forehead and it seemed like whenever one series of breakouts resided a new one would start.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, combination skin with a hyperactive cell turnover rate that makes my skin flake and clog no matter what.</li>
            <li>After two days, no joke, my face was clear!</li>
            <li>Many other products she could not use because she would end up with a rash or a red face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overall very gentle, but any salicylic acid product used daily can be too much for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>No harsh parabens or sulfates, 99% natural, and it works!</li>
            <li>It was mostly working, but pricey and left her face stinging sometimes and red, since it was pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li>Every body is different but this wash certainly works wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling this scenario since the birth of my daughter in 2009 and have tried product after product to both combat and clear.  </li>
            <li>This soap helps to clear up my face and never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>keeps my skin clear without overdrying</li>
            <li>but yeah, i guess it does help clear up acne.</li>
            <li>I am an adult acne sufferer</li>
            <li>it was on sale and 2.it was advertised as natural.</li>
            <li>will also add, that I am a professional makeup artist, and I am always in search of products to recommend to clients.</li>
            <li>I bought this and the Burts spot treatment for me 12 1/2 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>On day one, all of the redness was mostly gone and the pimples had at least flattened.  </li>
            <li>Here we are day 3 and she has no redness and about 1/2 of them are completely gone.  </li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do a damn thing for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I then chose to buy this product after reading the labels of countless ones in the pharmacy and I am very satifisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By week 6 of using this, my whole face and neck were covered in tiny bumps and pimples.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use day and night!</li>
            <li>For treating breakouts, product is only overly-drying if you use too much of it.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call this a miracle product.</li>
            <li>In fact, after use, it felt soft.  </li>
            <li>Within 5 days they were gone completely.  </li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive to soaps with filler ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really feel that the gentleness of this product is what actually works for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my acne has completely gone away.</li>
            <li>It turns out my skin is just sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li>and I needed a natural alternative.</li>
            <li>People with combination skin or sensitive skin should immediately follow up with a moisturizer to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li>The first noticeable difference is that though this product contains salicylic acid it didn&#x27;t make my face dry.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say exactly when the siege broke, but I know that by three months, my skin was back to its usual mild acne</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: December 15, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember the exact date of my review above, but still using the above product without issue.</li>
            <li>It is mostly smooth to the touch, and the only place that actually has the tiniest amount of acne is an area of my face that I must not normally get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife likes this cleanser but other reviews are right.</li>
            <li>I started using this face wash in high school, and still use it 6 years later.</li>
            <li>It is less harsh and proving to be just as effective.  </li>
            <li>nice and moisturizing (some would call it too thick) for my dry skin without having to worry about breakouts.</li>
            <li>This gently cleanses, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I am using the sensitive daily moisturizing cream and sensitive facial cleanser, which keep me from breaking out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this product is much thinner than I had expected.</li>
            <li>use Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser 2-3 times daily.</li>
            <li>Helps tame the severity of mild to moderate cystic acne&lt;</li>
            <li>I visited a organic health store near me and an employee said that she has seen several people come in with the same reaction from the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li>No product is a miracle, diet, fluid intake and hormonal fluctuations can play a large part in your acne so before blaming a product there are other factors to take into account.</li>
            <li>Try it, it seems like it is worth the money because I haven&#x27;t even made a dent in it, and I usually wash 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li>and I have a few acne \\&quot;hot</li>
            <li>It may seem to work at first, but you could be in for trouble.  </li>
            <li>your skin is irritated by other products out there, then I would highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few spots come up and normally it takes a week or longer before they&#x27;re completely gone.</li>
            <li>My face is less red and much softer.</li>
            <li>Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser reduces the size and speeds the healing time of my mild acne (pimples and occasional cysts) while not drying out or irritating my acne-prone skin.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Of the acne line by Burt&#x27;s Bees , in my opinion, this is the best.  </li>
            <li> After years of looking for the perfect cleanser I found the acne line by Burts Bees - my skin care answer - thank you.</li>
            <li> She is very happy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> (Their signature lip balm is wonderful.)</li>
            <li> great product!</li>
            <li> and it just feels wonderful to use.</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees line of acne care is wonderful.</li>
            <li> and I have had great results.</li>
            <li> While in-between products her skin did not look great</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li> it works great</li>
            <li> More impressive though is the fact that this cleanser does do what it claims, albeit not overnight.  </li>
            <li> Also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Great product and even better price!</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin, and am susceptible to blackheads.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!</li>
            <li> But when I do, I use the hot spot cream and it works great!</li>

            <li> It smells and feels nice.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say, there has been no product quite like this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Acne-prone skin does well with a good moisturizer anyway, so make sure you follow this cleanser with a schmear of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am incredible fair and have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the perfect balance between sensitive and effective.</li>
            <li> and the fact it&#x27;s almost 100% natural is the best part.</li>
            <li> :) WOULD LOVE TO BUY MORE!</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, but it is very effective.  </li>
            <li> However, it is good for people who have mild acne or looking for a maintenance regimen.</li>
            <li> I will buy it once more.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better cleansers I have ever used, and kept me from breaking out well even though I was on steriods and trying to.  </li>
            <li> Cleans without stripping the skin, the whole line is great.</li>
            <li> I love that I can recommend something that is almost 100 percent</li>
            <li> I feel better too knowing that she woke up too this morning and said, &amp;#34;I feel so much better about my skin today&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCTS FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li> Really love them.</li>
            <li> That worked much better.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTERS LOVE IT  </li>
            <li> that means it&#x27;s working (I just love that feeling).  </li>
            <li> And then I noticed more on my chest and shoulders--I was freaking out.  </li>
            <li> For gel being in the name, it&#x27;s more like liquidy soap.</li>
            <li> The difference is that it&#x27;s much, much more tepid, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and clears up a lot faster.</li>
            <li> It ended up causing more acne.</li>
            <li> I wash my face at most 3 times a day:</li>
            <li> , I look forward to washing my face with this stuff because it makes it look so much better and feel better.</li>
            <li> purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees Purifying Gel Cleanser on a whim while browsing in a local drugstore and was more than impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> this is great you dont need much at all</li>
            <li> My daughter use it for more than a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying and I love that it smells how you&#x27;d expect</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this cleanser?</li>
            <li> i preferred it more as a body wash than a face wash.</li>
            <li> I do continue to love the Burts Bees natural acne Lotion because it&#x27;s really a great face</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive and combination skin</li>
            <li> Very nice and natural scent</li>
            <li> Rinse with cool water and PAT!</li>
            <li> Bottle cap breaks easily</li>
            <li> Easy to over-dispense</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Still lathers up just fine, but I thought it would be something that would hold its shape when I squeezed it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It also effectively removed all traces of makeup and believe me, no one was more surprised than I when my toner-laden cotton ball showed not a trace of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a few acne cleansers but this is the best.</li>
            <li> and we have seen great results in a short time.  </li>
            <li> and nothing working too great and her face was ver red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazing at how fast the results are coming in.</li>
            <li> Combat it with a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two really important things to note about this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> I like the light scent</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> its a great product, this Brand its a very reliable Brand because its very organic</li>
            <li> Good cleanser my face is clean and clear.  </li>
            <li> I wanted the gel cleanser because I originally ordered it.</li>
            <li> The most effective acne solution I had come up with was Dr. Bronners Lavender and a prescription topical lotion called Duac which is clindamycin and 5% benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> product did leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> its keeps my face clean &amp; beatifull</li>
            <li> The only thing it did was leave a pleasant lemony scent.</li>
            <li> Light, natural scent, not at all &#x27;perfumey&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent value, the bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up buying another bottle just out of pure love.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product</li>
            <li> This is OK, but I really took issue with the amount of bubbly suds that got stuck in my hairline as I was trying to rinse this off my face.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, and if you use too much, you&#x27;re going to strip your skin and cause more acne.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on mild to moderate acne</li>
            <li> I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees when I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> The first 3 weeks were fabulous</li>
            <li> I definitely want to try more of Burts Bee skin care!</li>
            <li> I love this gel cleanser, it has a light but refreshing citrus smell and foams slightly when used.  </li>
            <li> Clear, smooth, glowing, softer, brighter!....</li>
            <li> She used Pro-Active, which a I paid $50 for about 6 weeks worth.  </li>
            <li> For me, the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive series work better than this.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite face wash.  </li>
            <li> I have been more pleased with this face wash than any other.</li>
            <li> We did not have good luck with the other products in this line, but this one is a winner.  </li>
            <li> right on my jaw line, and in the hollows of my cheek.</li>
            <li> but I just noticed that I am breaking out on my forehead and along my right jaw.</li>
            <li> very oily skin for most of my adult life and been on a myriad of antibiotics</li>
            <li> Within 3 days it Just completely gave me 4 HUGE cysts on my right cheek.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, kept a long time, and produced comfortable foam, however, I don&#x27;t think it worked as an anti-acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very gentle and does not cause redness.</li>
            <li> This along with Alba Botanica Hawaiian Pineapple Enzyme Facial Cleanser keep my face clean and acne free.  </li>
            <li> BUT IN THE STORES ITS PRETTY PRICEY.</li>
            <li> (personally I feel that when the product sits on my face it works better).</li>
            <li> my skin has really improved!</li>
            <li> the best one ill try</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other products would cause noticeable irritation, and even if they cleared my skin up at first, they&#x27;d stop working and often even made the problem</li>
            <li> but it was higher concentrate.</li>
            <li> This stuff is especially effective at sniping those tiny little whiteheads that like to form near your lips and in your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It pops open easily when traveling ruining your bag&#x27;s contents and eating the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for 3 months and while it hasn&#x27;t eradicated my breakouts it has certainly lessened the amount of pimples while speeding up their healing time.  </li>
            <li> I immediately stopped using the products but not soon enough because I then had a huge flare-up all over my chin area.  </li>
            <li> and I was an absolute skeptic.</li>
            <li> Gentle and works very well for preventing acne.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to, too.    </li>
            <li> VERY INEXPENSIVE ONLINE.</li>
            <li> Not a problem if you&#x27;re in the shower, but with a washcloth it was really labor intensive to try to rinse this stuff off.</li>
            <li> I really helps with my acne problem.</li>
            <li> Expected a lot better from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Fast results</li>
            <li> Lathers well, and lather is very creamy</li>
            <li> One is that it&#x27;s very concentrated.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s also pretty normal for acid-based acne products, but no biggy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have been using this product for a while, and my skin is much clearer than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very relieved to have found this</li>
            <li> It really keeps &amp;#34;would</li>
            <li> , what is there to lather doesn&#x27;t lather much at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more liquid like than I had expected it to be, but that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for about 8 months and then started drying my face out.</li>
            <li> Regular treatments weren&#x27;t helping, She found out your skin changes with age and needs different treatments, Viola, my normal handsome self again!  </li>
            <li> About 3-4 on her chin, 3-4 on her forhead right in between her eyes and and 4-6 zits near her hairline.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the deep clean after I wash with Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> For the first time in over a decade I no longer need to depend on prescription medication to give me the hope of clear skin.</li>
            <li> Another good thing about this brand is that you only have to use just a little.</li>
            <li> And if you go onto a certain website which I cannot name here, you will see it has a hazard score of 6 (much too high for a product that is considered &#x27;natural&#x27;).  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this for me, as I got older (60) I started to get acne.  </li>
            <li> Faced with a looming first date with my Dream Guy just around the corner, I abandoned my normal Lush soap, a Benedict Arnold that had gone from Skin Savior to Breakout Baron, and agonized over what to buy instead before settling on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser is a translucent yellow, light gel-like, lemon/herbal-smelling, medicated (1% salicylic acid), foaming cleanser for acne-prone</li>
            <li> I have not broken out and my skin has not dried it.</li>
            <li> I bought this in order to switch my whole face care routine to all natural.</li>
            <li> and it really helped clear up my gestational acne.</li>
            <li> I also use the daily lotion, and together I rarely ever get zits.</li>
            <li> but if you have dry skin do not get it it helps dry it out so oily skin people it will work better for it arrived almost the next day super fast and the product will last for a long time because you dont need more the a nicki size for our face</li>
            <li> Now my problem areas are my cheeks and forehead and it seemed like whenever one series of breakouts resided a new one would start.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, combination skin with a hyperactive cell turnover rate that makes my skin flake and clog no matter what.</li>
            <li> After two days, no joke, my face was clear!</li>
            <li> Many other products she could not use because she would end up with a rash or a red face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall very gentle, but any salicylic acid product used daily can be too much for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> No harsh parabens or sulfates, 99% natural, and it works!</li>
            <li> It was mostly working, but pricey and left her face stinging sometimes and red, since it was pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li> Every body is different but this wash certainly works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling this scenario since the birth of my daughter in 2009 and have tried product after product to both combat and clear.  </li>
            <li> This soap helps to clear up my face and never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin clear without overdrying</li>
            <li> but yeah, i guess it does help clear up acne.</li>
            <li> I am an adult acne sufferer</li>
            <li> it was on sale and 2.it was advertised as natural.</li>
            <li> will also add, that I am a professional makeup artist, and I am always in search of products to recommend to clients.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Burts spot treatment for me 12 1/2 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> On day one, all of the redness was mostly gone and the pimples had at least flattened.  </li>
            <li> Here we are day 3 and she has no redness and about 1/2 of them are completely gone.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do a damn thing for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I then chose to buy this product after reading the labels of countless ones in the pharmacy and I am very satifisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By week 6 of using this, my whole face and neck were covered in tiny bumps and pimples.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use day and night!</li>
            <li> For treating breakouts, product is only overly-drying if you use too much of it.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call this a miracle product.</li>
            <li> In fact, after use, it felt soft.  </li>
            <li> Within 5 days they were gone completely.  </li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive to soaps with filler ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really feel that the gentleness of this product is what actually works for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my acne has completely gone away.</li>
            <li> It turns out my skin is just sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li> and I needed a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> People with combination skin or sensitive skin should immediately follow up with a moisturizer to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li> The first noticeable difference is that though this product contains salicylic acid it didn&#x27;t make my face dry.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say exactly when the siege broke, but I know that by three months, my skin was back to its usual mild acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: December 15, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember the exact date of my review above, but still using the above product without issue.</li>
            <li> It is mostly smooth to the touch, and the only place that actually has the tiniest amount of acne is an area of my face that I must not normally get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife likes this cleanser but other reviews are right.</li>
            <li> I started using this face wash in high school, and still use it 6 years later.</li>
            <li> It is less harsh and proving to be just as effective.  </li>
            <li> nice and moisturizing (some would call it too thick) for my dry skin without having to worry about breakouts.</li>
            <li> This gently cleanses, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I am using the sensitive daily moisturizing cream and sensitive facial cleanser, which keep me from breaking out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this product is much thinner than I had expected.</li>
            <li> use Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser 2-3 times daily.</li>
            <li> Helps tame the severity of mild to moderate cystic acne&lt;</li>
            <li> I visited a organic health store near me and an employee said that she has seen several people come in with the same reaction from the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li> No product is a miracle, diet, fluid intake and hormonal fluctuations can play a large part in your acne so before blaming a product there are other factors to take into account.</li>
            <li> Try it, it seems like it is worth the money because I haven&#x27;t even made a dent in it, and I usually wash 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li> and I have a few acne \\&quot;hot</li>
            <li> It may seem to work at first, but you could be in for trouble.  </li>
            <li> your skin is irritated by other products out there, then I would highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few spots come up and normally it takes a week or longer before they&#x27;re completely gone.</li>
            <li> My face is less red and much softer.</li>
            <li> Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser reduces the size and speeds the healing time of my mild acne (pimples and occasional cysts) while not drying out or irritating my acne-prone skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this for 5 years now, and as long as it stays the same, I will continue to use</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first until it started to slowly spread.  </li>
            <li> and I seem to have broken out a little more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad bottle, it was sealed on top, but it is so runny, nothing like a gel!</li>
            <li> I mean its good but not great!!</li>
            <li> My acne is usually mild to moderate, but I&#x27;m prone to large, painful, infected cysts.</li>
            <li> little bit of Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser goes a long way so a 5 oz bottle lasts for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> natural, acne face wash that doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li> I was going through a minor breakout &amp;</li>
            <li> To cleanse, I do the following: wet a cotton pad,</li>
            <li> As someone in their late 20&#x27;s, I suffer from hormonal breakouts: once a month my chin and jawline become littered with numerous small pimples as well as several of the large, red, hurt-to-touch variety.  </li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> By day two they were much smaller and a few of them had left.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its due to the fact that i started using a new primer or the fact that my hair sometimes touches my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I began using this wash, along with the Dr Bronner&#x27;s and in less than a week all the tiny blemishes that covered both my cheeks/jawline/neck were gone.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days of use the cluster of small whiteheads on my jawline had vanished and the larger pimples were smaller in size each morning.  </li>
            <li> Compare to other cleansers this one won&#x27;t dry her skin after each use.  </li>
            <li> My son is 13 and when he uses this product alone, with regular 10% benzoil peroxide for trouble spots, he&#x27;s seen a TON of improvement.  </li>
            <li> add a dime-sized amount of cleanser to the cotton pad, rub the cotton pad to produce a lather, wet my face and massage my face with the foamy cotton pad in circular motions for 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days, and it&#x27;s already working miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only down side was the smell, it took a little bit to get used to it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne-- not that bad but very obvious.</li>
            <li> The 1/2 dozen or so that are left are small and appear to be on their way to being healed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had extreme acne</li>
            <li> When I picked up the product, the product is all wet!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased a few times already and don&#x27;t plan on switching as long as it continues helping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to dry a little.</li>
            <li> Less harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the products,</li>
            <li> and she was using a little of my pro-active, some aveeno, etc.</li>
            <li> but  then I started to notice little bumps on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees products a few days ago</li>
            <li> This one works when she remembers to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Not for everyday use when you&#x27;re not breaking out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li> I was nervous trying it because salicylic acid has dried my skin before</li>
            <li> Use this as my everyday face wash</li>
            <li> The very few times I have broken out in deep painful cysts this wash got rid of them quickly and faster than the prescription lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two weeks, and not only has it cleared up pimples, but has very much reduced the acne \\&quot;scabbing\\&quot; that I get from my (very bad) habit of picking.</li>
            <li> Some products worked, some didn&#x27;t, but almost all made my face so dry that the skin would peel - not attractive in the least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking, a cyst that usually took months to heal was gone in a week.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re not breaking out, I&#x27;d recommended using it no more than three times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had blackheads on my cheeks for years and awful breakouts on my chin (mostly stress and hormone-related).</li>
            <li> Massage it into your skin in small, circular motions for at least 30 seconds to give the acid time to work.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but the shipping was terrible.</li>
            <li> All SA formulations are going to be a little drying and somewhat irritating.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED in the product....spent too much on it.</li>
            <li> I mean this thing works!</li>
            <li> Making my breakout worse than it was.</li>
            <li> dried me out really bad.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> and Ill let it sit on my face from 15 min-2 hrs depending on what i have going on</li>
            <li> However, it would eventually fail, and itsometimes even made my skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had bad acne, just random breakouts around my mouth and forehead.</li>
            <li> Lately my skin has been breaking out terribly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about years since my flare ups got bad.  </li>
            <li> I will start by saying that i do not have BAD acne.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I had been getting wave after wave of painful breakouts for four months with no signs of slowing.</li>
            <li> By the end of the week, what blemishes I got were no longer painful.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I was also was extremely sick of bleaching out all my pillow cases, shirt collars, etc.  </li>
            <li> This product sucks!!!!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> If you hate it, you probably have a friend that will like it.</li>
            <li> , I hate perfumed face</li>
            <li> This has also been the hottest weeks of the year (my worst breakout tine)</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but it makes my skin terribly sticky and it broke me out within hours of using it.</li>
            <li> Really terrible product for me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I switched from proactiv to this and I have had great results. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and a little of this product goes a long way. I definitely want to try more of Burts Bee skin care!</li>
            <li> I have mild acne-- not that bad but very obvious. This did nothing to it. But hey everyone has different skin</li>
            <li> I am an adult acne sufferer and I believe it started when I became a zookeeper (dirt, sweat, stress).  It&#x27;s been about years since my flare ups got bad.  I used about everything. I have been using this for two weeks, and not only has it cleared up pimples, but has very much reduced the acne \\&quot;scabbing\\&quot; that I get from my (very bad) habit of picking. This has also been the hottest weeks of the year (my worst breakout tine) I am incredible fair and have sensitive skin and my face has absolutley ZERO redness.  My only issue is that my blackheads aren&#x27;t clearing.  Try it, it seems like it is worth the money because I haven&#x27;t even made a dent in it, and I usually wash 3 times a day.  Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I will buy it once more.</li>
            <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees products a few days ago and I seem to have broken out a little more. Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the products, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see if it improves.</li>
            <li> Very nice and natural scent, I&#x27;ve only had it a day and I can already notice a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I have tried a few acne cleansers but this is the best. Less harsh on the skin. Bravo to Burt!</li>
            <li> I have had cystic acne/very oily skin for most of my adult life and been on a myriad of antibiotics, prescription/otc lotions and skin peels all of which eventually lead me back to severe breakouts.  The most effective acne solution I had come up with was Dr. Bronners Lavender and a prescription topical lotion called Duac which is clindamycin and 5% benzoyl peroxide.This still wasn&#x27;t enough to stop breakouts of every size. I was also was extremely sick of bleaching out all my pillow cases, shirt collars, etc.  A close friend of mine mentioned this wash and I was an absolute skeptic. Salicylic acid had never worked well for me at all. On a whim, I bought it.  I began using this wash, along with the Dr Bronner&#x27;s and in less than a week all the tiny blemishes that covered both my cheeks/jawline/neck were gone. My face is less red and much softer. The very few times I have broken out in deep painful cysts this wash got rid of them quickly and faster than the prescription lotion. I&#x27;m talking, a cyst that usually took months to heal was gone in a week. As a matter of fact, I no longer need or use the Duac. Now that I have been using this wash regularly twice a day for about 3 months now, I have had no cysts! For the first time in over a decade I no longer need to depend on prescription medication to give me the hope of clear skin. And all I have to do is wash my face.  No product is a miracle, diet, fluid intake and hormonal fluctuations can play a large part in your acne so before blaming a product there are other factors to take into account. The skin is the largest organ on the body, try listening to it. Every body is different but this wash certainly works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!!!! I have always had issues with acne, and I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. This cleanser does not lather well and makes your skin feel oily, which acne prone skin already is, so I do not recommend this product, save your money.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best face wash I have ever used. Gentle and works very well for preventing acne. Also has a pleasant smell. FYI you can purchase at your local Walgreens for $9.99</li>
            <li> It smells and feels nice.  It is very gentle, but it is very effective.  Of the acne line by Burt&#x27;s Bees , in my opinion, this is the best.  This is one of the better cleansers I have ever used, and kept me from breaking out well even though I was on steriods and trying to.  My son is 13 and when he uses this product alone, with regular 10% benzoil peroxide for trouble spots, he&#x27;s seen a TON of improvement.  We did not have good luck with the other products in this line, but this one is a winner.  I will continue to buy it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> After years of looking for the perfect cleanser I found the acne line by Burts Bees - my skin care answer - thank you. Cleans without stripping the skin, the whole line is great.</li>
            <li> This product honestly should cost more! I mean this thing works! I will start by saying that i do not have BAD acne. I have combination skin and I have a few acne \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot;. right on my jaw line, and in the hollows of my cheek. So I was not \\&quot;in search\\&quot; of products. I ended up buying this product for two reasons, 1. it was on sale and 2.it was advertised as natural. After two days, no joke, my face was clear! Clear, smooth, glowing, softer, brighter!.... I ended up buying another bottle just out of pure love. I have now been using this for over two months and I can honestly say, there has been no product quite like this.&lt;br /&gt;I will also add, that I am a professional makeup artist, and I am always in search of products to recommend to clients. I love that I can recommend something that is almost 100 percent natural!&lt;br /&gt;An added benefit to this product is the quantity! A little goes a long way. I have used maybe just under and inch out of the bottle since purchasing! LOVE this! And you will too!!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Burts spot treatment for me 12 1/2 year old daughter.  She used Pro-Active, which a I paid $50 for about 6 weeks worth.  It was mostly working, but pricey and left her face stinging sometimes and red, since it was pretty harsh.  In looking for an alternative we found this Burts product.  It is less harsh and proving to be just as effective.  She has only used it for 3 (THREE) days along with the spot treatment and we have seen great results in a short time.  When not using something to treat it, she has about 12 zits at any given time on her face.  About 3-4 on her chin, 3-4 on her forhead right in between her eyes and and 4-6 zits near her hairline.  On day one, all of the redness was mostly gone and the pimples had at least flattened.  By day two they were much smaller and a few of them had left.  Here we are day 3 and she has no redness and about 1/2 of them are completely gone.  The 1/2 dozen or so that are left are small and appear to be on their way to being healed.  She is very happy. I am too because of the price and spending money on something that actually works.  I feel better too knowing that she woke up too this morning and said, &amp;#34;I feel so much better about my skin today&amp;#34;.  While in-between products her skin did not look great and she was using a little of my pro-active, some aveeno, etc. and nothing working too great and her face was ver red.  I&#x27;m amazing at how fast the results are coming in.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCTS FAST SERVICE</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, kept a long time, and produced comfortable foam, however, I don&#x27;t think it worked as an anti-acne cleanser. For me, the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive series work better than this. I am using the sensitive daily moisturizing cream and sensitive facial cleanser, which keep me from breaking out. Really love them.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do a damn thing for my sensitive skin.  I really wanted it to, too.    Hope it works for you, might as well give it a shot.  If it doesn&#x27;t, try some of the Alba products. That worked much better.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my granddaughter who has begun the acne outbreak.  Many other products she could not use because she would end up with a rash or a red face.  This one works when she remembers to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite face wash.  I can feel the deep clean after I wash with Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTERS LOVE IT  :) WOULD LOVE TO BUY MORE! GREAT STUFF. VERY INEXPENSIVE ONLINE. BUT IN THE STORES ITS PRETTY PRICEY.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this for me, as I got older (60) I started to get acne.  Regular treatments weren&#x27;t helping, She found out your skin changes with age and needs different treatments, Viola, my normal handsome self again!  I use it with Burt&#x27;s Acne Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is OK, but I really took issue with the amount of bubbly suds that got stuck in my hairline as I was trying to rinse this off my face. Not a problem if you&#x27;re in the shower, but with a washcloth it was really labor intensive to try to rinse this stuff off. I also found it to be a bit drying.  I found ultimate freedom from acne with a dairy-free diet, The Body Shop Tee Tree Line, and an Olay Facial Brush. I do continue to love the Burts Bees natural acne Lotion because it&#x27;s really a great face moisturizer-- nice and moisturizing (some would call it too thick) for my dry skin without having to worry about breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had extreme acne but I would always gets pimples around my forehead and lip/ chin area. I tried proactive and even though that worked for me, it dried out my skin way too much that I started flaking in some areas of my face. I then chose to buy this product after reading the labels of countless ones in the pharmacy and I am very satifisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this in the morning and nighttime after washing my face and I have to say this has worked for me. I have not broken out and my skin has not dried it. I definitely recommend this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good cleanser my face is clean and clear.  This tingles when you put it on, to me that means it&#x27;s working (I just love that feeling).  I like it!</li>
            <li> I started using this face wash in high school, and still use it 6 years later. I really helps with my acne problem. I also use the daily lotion, and together I rarely ever get zits. But when I do, I use the hot spot cream and it works great!</li>
            <li> I love this gel cleanser, it has a light but refreshing citrus smell and foams slightly when used.  Only caution is that the bottle always comes open when I try to travel with it unless I tape the lid.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of decreasing my acne spurts and I felt like this product did nothing to help at all. The only thing it did was leave a pleasant lemony scent. It didn&#x27;t help, in fact I think at times it made my situation work. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing</li>
            <li> I used this product along with the acne solutions moisturizer for 6 weeks.  The first 3 weeks were fabulous but  then I started to notice little bumps on my forehead.  I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first until it started to slowly spread.  By week 6 of using this, my whole face and neck were covered in tiny bumps and pimples.  And then I noticed more on my chest and shoulders--I was freaking out.  I immediately stopped using the products but not soon enough because I then had a huge flare-up all over my chin area.  Fustrated and fed-up I visited a organic health store near me and an employee said that she has seen several people come in with the same reaction from the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  She told me to stop using any Burt&#x27;s Bees, including the lip balm that I&#x27;ve used for YEARS.  She went on to say that something has changed in their formula that may be causing the reactions.  Very possible since Burt&#x27;s Bees was bought out by Clorox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It may seem to work at first, but you could be in for trouble.  And if you go onto a certain website which I cannot name here, you will see it has a hazard score of 6 (much too high for a product that is considered &#x27;natural&#x27;).  Please, don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> Horrible. I was going through a minor breakout &amp; I thought all these &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients would definitely make my skin at it&#x27;s best. WRONG. Within 3 days it Just completely gave me 4 HUGE cysts on my right cheek. Making my breakout worse than it was. Very unhappy. Expected a lot better from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I got a moisturizer.... I mean its good but not great!! I wanted the gel cleanser because I originally ordered it.</li>
            <li> the product is not sealed well, and then some liquid was fell out from the battle. When I picked up the product, the product is all wet!</li>
            <li> I bought this in order to switch my whole face care routine to all natural. After reading tons of reviews, I went with Burt&#x27;s Bees because it&#x27;s a brand I trust. (Their signature lip balm is wonderful.) I also read that this was key to have if you order the acne pore scrub, which I ordered at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this product is much thinner than I had expected. For gel being in the name, it&#x27;s more like liquidy soap. Still lathers up just fine, but I thought it would be something that would hold its shape when I squeezed it out of the bottle. I use this after using the acne scrub (which if you do order the scrub, then you MUST order this as well) and finish with the toner and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great product! natural, acne face wash that doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling tight or dry. Gentle enough to use day and night!</li>
            <li> My wife likes this cleanser but other reviews are right. It pops open easily when traveling ruining your bag&#x27;s contents and eating the product. Come on, Burt!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Overall gentle&lt;br /&gt;- Concentrated&lt;br /&gt;- Fast results&lt;br /&gt;- Does a good job on mild to moderate acne&lt;br /&gt;- Helps tame the severity of mild to moderate cystic acne&lt;br /&gt;- Great for sensitive and combination skin&lt;br /&gt;- Lathers well, and lather is very creamy&lt;br /&gt;- Not overly-drying (when used correctly, see Tips)&lt;br /&gt;- Light, natural scent, not at all &#x27;perfumey&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent value, the bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Bottle cap breaks easily&lt;br /&gt;- Bottle can leak during travel&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to over-dispense&lt;br /&gt;- Does nothing for blackheads&lt;br /&gt;- Not for everyday use when you&#x27;re not breaking out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for Use:&lt;br /&gt;- When you&#x27;re not breaking out, I&#x27;d recommended using it no more than three times a week. It&#x27;s overall very gentle, but any salicylic acid product used daily can be too much for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- For treating breakouts, product is only overly-drying if you use too much of it. A little goes a long way! Dispense a tiny amount into your palm and work it into a lather.&lt;br /&gt;- That said, it is an anti-acne product. It&#x27;s supposed to dry a little. Combat it with a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;- Massage it into your skin in small, circular motions for at least 30 seconds to give the acid time to work.&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse with cool water and PAT! not rub, PAT! dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this when my skin was in the midst of a mutiny. I have very sensitive, combination skin with a hyperactive cell turnover rate that makes my skin flake and clog no matter what. My acne is usually mild to moderate, but I&#x27;m prone to large, painful, infected cysts. When I bought this, I had been getting wave after wave of painful breakouts for four months with no signs of slowing. Faced with a looming first date with my Dream Guy just around the corner, I abandoned my normal Lush soap, a Benedict Arnold that had gone from Skin Savior to Breakout Baron, and agonized over what to buy instead before settling on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne started clearing upwithin three days. By the end of the week, what blemishes I got were no longer painful. This stuff is especially effective at sniping those tiny little whiteheads that like to form near your lips and in your eyebrows. Within a month, I noticed that my occasional cysts had downgraded from Dreadnought-class monstrosities to the moderate, manageable Schooner size. I can&#x27;t say exactly when the siege broke, but I know that by three months, my skin was back to its usual mild acne status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call this a miracle product. I still get acne. The difference is that it&#x27;s much, much more tepid, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and clears up a lot faster. And anything that shrinks cysts is 5-star caliber in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two really important things to note about this stuff. One is that it&#x27;s very concentrated. You don&#x27;t need a lot, and if you use too much, you&#x27;re going to strip your skin and cause more acne. A dab&#x27;ll do ya, as they say. The second is that it is a salicylic acid product. All SA formulations are going to be a little drying and somewhat irritating. Acne-prone skin does well with a good moisturizer anyway, so make sure you follow this cleanser with a schmear of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that after my constant breakouts stopped, I couldn&#x27;t use this stuff every day. It ended up causing more acne. That&#x27;s also pretty normal for acid-based acne products, but no biggy. I only use this stuff once or twice a week now except when I&#x27;m breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s fabulous. You should try it. If you hate it, you probably have a friend that will like it. Give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> Lately my skin has been breaking out terribly. I&#x27;m not sure if its due to the fact that i started using a new primer or the fact that my hair sometimes touches my cheeks. Now my problem areas are my cheeks and forehead and it seemed like whenever one series of breakouts resided a new one would start. I purchased this product on Sept 30th. I wash my face at most 3 times a day: morning, when I&#x27;m finished with classes and at night. Ive already used this product 3 times and I must say i can notice a difference in the size as well as amount of my ace (white heads, red acne). Whenever I wash my face I use honey and Ill let it sit on my face from 15 min-2 hrs depending on what i have going on (personally I feel that when the product sits on my face it works better). Although I&#x27;ve just begun using this I can already tell its going to work, I look forward to washing my face with this stuff because it makes it look so much better and feel better. Burts Bees keep doing what you&#x27;re doing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had blackheads on my cheeks for years and awful breakouts on my chin (mostly stress and hormone-related). Since I&#x27;ve started using this cleanser my skin has really improved! I like the light scent and it just feels wonderful to use. I use it twice a day in the morning and before I go to sleep and I plan to continue to do so unless for some reason it stops working. Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees for helping my skin out!</li>
            <li> As someone in their late 20&#x27;s, I suffer from hormonal breakouts: once a month my chin and jawline become littered with numerous small pimples as well as several of the large, red, hurt-to-touch variety.  I&#x27;ve been battling this scenario since the birth of my daughter in 2009 and have tried product after product to both combat and clear.  Some products worked, some didn&#x27;t, but almost all made my face so dry that the skin would peel - not attractive in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees Purifying Gel Cleanser on a whim while browsing in a local drugstore and was more than impressed with the results.  The first noticeable difference is that though this product contains salicylic acid it didn&#x27;t make my face dry.  In fact, after use, it felt soft.  More impressive though is the fact that this cleanser does do what it claims, albeit not overnight.  Within 3 days of use the cluster of small whiteheads on my jawline had vanished and the larger pimples were smaller in size each morning.  Within 5 days they were gone completely.  It also effectively removed all traces of makeup and believe me, no one was more surprised than I when my toner-laden cotton ball showed not a trace of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for 3 months and while it hasn&#x27;t eradicated my breakouts it has certainly lessened the amount of pimples while speeding up their healing time.  This one gets an A+!</li>
            <li> this is great you dont need much at all but if you have dry skin do not get it it helps dry it out so oily skin people it will work better for it arrived almost the next day super fast and the product will last for a long time because you dont need more the a nicki size for our face it works great</li>
            <li> My daughter use it for more than a year. Compare to other cleansers this one won&#x27;t dry her skin after each use.  It also helps reduce acne.  So, she keeps using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive to soaps with filler ingredients. This soap helps to clear up my face and never irritates my skin. Recommended.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin clear without overdrying</li>
            <li> If you have moderate to sever acne, cystic acne or resilient skin like me, it is not going to work.  However, it is good for people who have mild acne or looking for a maintenance regimen.</li>
            <li> i love this product very much ill used every day&lt;br /&gt; its keeps my face clean &amp; beatifull&lt;br /&gt;its the best one ill try</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cleanser! It has been working well for me, not breaking me out or drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> Before trying this, I tried everything-- Proactive, Neutrogena, Clearasil, Clinique... My doctor even prescribed me some stuff a while back. Some of it worked temporarily. However, it would eventually fail, and itsometimes even made my skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have been using this product for a while, and my skin is much clearer than it has ever been. It is mostly smooth to the touch, and the only place that actually has the tiniest amount of acne is an area of my face that I must not normally get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this stuff is very gentle and does not cause redness. I really feel that the gentleness of this product is what actually works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Other products would cause noticeable irritation, and even if they cleared my skin up at first, they&#x27;d stop working and often even made the problem worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is irritated by other products out there, then I would highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li> I have been more pleased with this face wash than any other. I was nervous trying it because salicylic acid has dried my skin before but it was higher concentrate. I&#x27;ve never had bad acne, just random breakouts around my mouth and forehead. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for almost 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve had a few spots come up and normally it takes a week or longer before they&#x27;re completely gone. Since using this they&#x27;re 100% gone in 2 days. I was shocked. I use to dab clearasil on spots as a teen (in the 90s) and by morning they&#x27;d be almost gone but that product hasn&#x27;t worked in ages for me. I&#x27;m very relieved to have found this and the fact it&#x27;s almost 100% natural is the best part. It&#x27;s not drying and I love that it smells how you&#x27;d expect, I hate perfumed face products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: December 15, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember the exact date of my review above, but still using the above product without issue. I&#x27;ve repurchased a few times already and don&#x27;t plan on switching as long as it continues helping. It really keeps &amp;#34;would be&amp;#34; blemishes at bay for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad bottle, it was sealed on top, but it is so runny, nothing like a gel! It just about pours out of my hand before I can lather it, what is there to lather doesn&#x27;t lather much at all. I have no desire to continue to use the product to see if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do for my skin.</li>
            <li> I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees when I found out I was pregnant. I use this every morning in the shower on a washcloth and it really helped clear up my gestational acne.</li>
            <li> Great product and even better price! The Burt&#x27;s Bees line of acne care is wonderful. The only down side was the smell, it took a little bit to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Use this as my everyday face wash and it&#x27;s the perfect balance between sensitive and effective. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with the moisturizing sage face wash and between the two of them my acne has completely gone away. It turns out my skin is just sensitive to chemicals and I needed a natural alternative. Another good thing about this brand is that you only have to use just a little.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I used to use the Orange Gel Cleanser, but they changed the formula.  This along with Alba Botanica Hawaiian Pineapple Enzyme Facial Cleanser keep my face clean and acne free.  I used this for 5 years now, and as long as it stays the same, I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the shower, only once a day.  I have fairly oily skin, and am susceptible to blackheads. This gently cleanses, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this cleanser? No harsh parabens or sulfates, 99% natural, and it works! It&#x27;s more liquid like than I had expected it to be, but that&#x27;s not a problem. People with combination skin or sensitive skin should immediately follow up with a moisturizer to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li> its a great product, this Brand its a very reliable Brand because its very organic and you can see it when you use it.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but the shipping was terrible. It took three weeks to arrive, and when it did it had opened in the box. The entire bottle was covered in the face wash. I had to wash it, my hands, and the scissors I used to open the box. Not good.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for about 8 months and then started drying my face out. Had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but it makes my skin terribly sticky and it broke me out within hours of using it. Really terrible product for me.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser is a translucent yellow, light gel-like, lemon/herbal-smelling, medicated (1% salicylic acid), foaming cleanser for acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser 2-3 times daily. To cleanse, I do the following: wet a cotton pad, add a dime-sized amount of cleanser to the cotton pad, rub the cotton pad to produce a lather, wet my face and massage my face with the foamy cotton pad in circular motions for 60 seconds. The use of the cotton pad increases the efficacy of the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser reduces the size and speeds the healing time of my mild acne (pimples and occasional cysts) while not drying out or irritating my acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser goes a long way so a 5 oz bottle lasts for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: water, decyl glucoside, lauryl glucoside, sucrose laurate, willow bark extract, salicylic acid (1%), coco-betaine, betaine, beet root extract, evening primrose leaf extract, sodium cocoyl hydrolyzed soy protein, hydroxypropyltrimonium honey, glycerin, glyceryl ole</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days, and it&#x27;s already working miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this product but I just noticed that I am breaking out on my forehead and along my right jaw. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the product....spent too much on it. Now I just have to wait out the storm.</li>
            <li> i preferred it more as a body wash than a face wash. dried me out really bad. i added water to it as well, and still kicked my face&#x27;s ass. but yeah, i guess it does help clear up acne.</li>
