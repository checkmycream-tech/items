            <li>worth it!!</li>
            <li>I love mary kay products they always are easy to take off at night</li>
            <li>I prefer the original lash love mascara because my lashes look fuller, longer and hold a curl; where as this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.</li>
            <li>This product arrived very quickly and I thank you.</li>
            <li>I like this mascara because it washes off easily with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>company was fast shipping it to me thank you !! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Given I usually do not have that kind of leisure time in the morning</li>
            <li>Its alright ..nothing special ..</li>
            <li>This way I am able to achieve decent coverage, length and avoid lashes which are clumped together.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Product delivered quickly and was as promised</li>
            <li>It does leave your lashes feather soft and it is a lot easier to wash off than the Lash Love mascara.</li>
            <li>As a result, one must apply layer after layer to achieve any results (more than ten).</li>
            <li>It was new, arrived in a decent time only issue was its regular love lash not lengthening kind.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and clean.  </li>
            <li>I used this exact brand in the past and loved the formula because it does not dry quick, so it allows you to build length without tearing off your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>It thickens the lashes, but not too much.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this was a older one sent to me, but for the price won&#x27;t buy through Amazon any longer.</li>
            <li>The mascara is a high quality.</li>
            <li>and  they don&#x27;t compare to this one, it is a little more $</li>
            <li>New but not lengthening mascara</li>
            <li>It use to be nice and full and now it is thin and long.</li>
            <li>It seems to be drying out much faster than the last one I had from another agent.</li>
            <li>So wrong kind</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t notice that my lases look any longer versus other mascaras. It does leave your lashes feather soft and it is a lot easier to wash off than the Lash Love mascara. I prefer the original lash love mascara because my lashes look fuller, longer and hold a curl; where as this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If used alone, this mascara needs many (think 4 or 5) layers. Each layer drying before applying the next. Given I usually do not have that kind of leisure time in the morning, I like Mary Kay&#x27;s \\&quot;ultimate\\&quot; mascara as a base with this applied when the base is dry.  This way I am able to achieve decent coverage, length and avoid lashes which are clumped together.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It takes my short lashes and makes them dark, long, and voluminous.</li>
            <li> New but not lengthening mascara just the reg love lash kind but still good</li>
            <li> Love the mascara.  At my age I have finally learned how to apply mascara.  Product goes on great.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when i opened the Mascara and it&#x27;s already dried. Difficult to apply. Any chance I can return ?</li>
            <li> This mascara if very light but does lengthen my lashes.  The mascara is a high quality.</li>
            <li> Wish they didn&#x27;t stop making this. I really like this masacara hold my eyelashes up all day&lt;br /&gt;and night.highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great product! Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve used this mascara for years and it is a must in my make up regimen!</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the retailer was great. However, it is the product itself why I rated it with only three stars. I used this exact brand in the past and loved the formula because it does not dry quick, so it allows you to build length without tearing off your eyelashes. However, the have change the brush. It use to be nice and full and now it is thin and long. As a result, one must apply layer after layer to achieve any results (more than ten). With that I would not purchase this product again because of its applicatior.</li>
            <li> I love mary kay products they always are easy to take off at night this mascara is awesome I always buy mascara from mary kay I have tried others maybelline, covergirl, loreal , i was allergic to those and  they don&#x27;t compare to this one, it is a little more $ then some but well worth it!! company was fast shipping it to me thank you !! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Its alright ..nothing special .. Regular mascara</li>
            <li> It was new, arrived in a decent time only issue was its regular love lash not lengthening kind.  So wrong kind but still good</li>
            <li> Very good mascara.  Nice coverage.  Not allergic to this mascara.  It does not clump.  It looks natural and clean.  Washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  It doesn&#x27;t clump and does extend the length of your eyelashes!  If you&#x27;re looking for a great mascara....this is the one to buy if you have short lashes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It seems to be drying out much faster than the last one I had from another agent. This one also doesn&#x27;t seem to be lengthening like it either so I don&#x27;t know if this was a older one sent to me, but for the price won&#x27;t buy through Amazon any longer.</li>
            <li> As always, the Mary Kay product provides great color and lenght to my eyes.  I am always pleased.  This product arrived very quickly and I thank you.</li>
            <li> Adds volume to my lashes</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because it washes off easily with soap and water.  It thickens the lashes, but not too much.  It stays on well also.</li>
            <li> I liked the product fine.</li>
            <li> Product delivered quickly and was as promised</li>
            <li> I like all Mary Kay products.  This one was no exception.</li>
