            <li>was  nice to see something I use to use years ago.</li>

            <li>I used to own some years ago, now the grand kids want them for their hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter stole and lost my old one, but I came on Amazon and found a great deal on this one!</li>
            <li>I guess the product itself is ok, but it would have been nice for instructions for usage, or the website to go to for instruction.  </li>
            <li>use it for my 2yo toddler because she has very fine hair and ponies never stay in her hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and they work just as needed!</li>
            <li>This one works quite well, and although it seems a  bit light-weight, it is holding up fine!  </li>
            <li>These are very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Made out of VERY cheap material.</li>
            <li>just added these on since they were very cheap</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>

            <li>I was looking for this hook in some stores and a friend instructed me that I could find here, I love it</li>
            <li>And she sits still to allow these creations to come to fruition. :)</li>
            <li>no one likes to have to do it all over again many times.</li>
            <li>It was great using on my daughter, she didn&#x27;t fidget as much when I use the tool to style her</li>
            <li>she says it is much better than the bread tie I was using to do this with.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>I love them, I have try so many hair styles on my daughter</li>

            <li>You can tell it was made for dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap...</li>
            <li>To be honest, when I do it myself, I find it much easier just to tuck my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li>This tool helped me create a smooth look that you can&#x27;t get by using your hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great hair tool to add to your daily routine.</li>
            <li>I have been having fun playing and experimenting with these and love having them again.</li>
            <li>Its cheap</li>
            <li>Really cheap plastic?  </li>
            <li>However it is made a bit cheaply.</li>
            <li>and it is what was advertised just cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made  but will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>A bit flimsy and the plastic is not so smooth so gets stuck in my hair and hurts when I have to pull it through.</li>
            <li>Think i paid around 50 cents or so and free shipping,</li>
            <li>Very flexible and works nicely with no problems.</li>
            <li>it&#x27; on the cheap side but still works.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it was cheap, so I almost got what I paid for.....</li>
            <li>Very simple and the work great to make my ponytail a bit fancier.</li>
            <li>Cheap fun for lady hair. :)</li>
            <li>Wow...the price is right and free shipping!</li>
            <li>guess I am going to youTube this to make sure I do it right</li>
            <li>It looks pretty!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use for quick hairstyles for adults and children.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use and very resistant to pulling.  </li>
            <li>Great for a quick simple hair style.</li>
            <li>so be aware might work better with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>So fun!</li>
            <li>So I went to the Conair web site and found the original under the stylemakers selection</li>
            <li>I was excited to find them so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>When I had long hair these were great tools to have.  </li>
            <li>I use to have the original Topsy Turvey,  somehow I lost it</li>
            <li>Not as sturdy as the original topsy tail</li>
            <li>Happy with the product,  but it did take them a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this</li>
            <li>For the price and some research of videos on what you can do for hairstyles, its worth it!</li>
            <li>Not as well made as the original ones.</li>
            <li>This works ok, but starts to come apart after first use.</li>
            <li>and she was really excited to get it.</li>
            <li>I had one for more years than I&#x27;m willing to admit.  </li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Used to have one years ago when they first came out and glad to have another set.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you are interested in reading the instructions you better know</li>
            <li>Not at all like the original</li>
            <li>I am excited to get another one.</li>
            <li>Target had one of these for a LOT more money - lets be honest what is the point of spending much more for an item that does exactly the same thing?</li>
            <li>and this makes it so much easier then using a bobbypin and much more secure.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as I wish it were, but as I said, it gets the job fun.</li>
            <li>This ponytail flipper creates the most elegant style from just a simple ponytail, and it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li>These broke right away!  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t exactly know how to use the smaller one lol</li>
            <li>she can do all kinds cool hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Next time  purchase,very good</li>
            <li>but these tools make the pony tail much nicer :)</li>
            <li>I have been having such a good time with these.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t take too much hair at a time.</li>
            <li>I love this topsy tail so much</li>
            <li>I was pleased with how fast i received the item.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the two sizes, but be careful, i about got it stuck in my hair!</li>
            <li>1000 more now that i&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>I would love this product more if the directions were written in English.</li>
            <li>i quickly pick up her hair, stick that tool in, and BOOM</li>
            <li>Item came quickly for being sent overseas.</li>
            <li>My daughter and my niece enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>So cool for fun designs.</li>
            <li>Works good for long hair</li>
            <li>I have been trying all kinds of new ways to use these and have come up with interesting styles</li>
            <li>My girls love getting a new &#x27;do, and I can&#x27;t complain at all for the 35 cents</li>
            <li>Very flemsy and broke easy.  </li>
            <li>large one works fine</li>
            <li>I large one works fine.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t complain to much!!</li>
            <li>Make cute hair designs for a fraction of the cost of a topsy turvy thing!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was only like a week or two, not bad for coming from over seas!</li>
            <li>Great for little girls hair.</li>
            <li>These are great little tools.  </li>
            <li>The little pamphlet that came with it also was great.</li>
            <li>so it took weeks to get here but worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice way to change a simple ponytail into a fancier hairdo!</li>
            <li>I guess I will see if the product was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>This is a decent hair tool, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The smaller one works great when putting up sections of her hair and and the bigger one works good on bigger pieces.</li>
            <li>These were awfully fun to get for use in styling my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>fun to use.  </li>
            <li>I can do fun</li>
            <li>This replacement is better than my old one.</li>
            <li>It arrived in the expected time in good condition.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>however, after I got it, I found that it is not so useful as what I thought.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Like all &amp;#34;topsy tail&amp;#34; tools, they&#x27;re fun.  </li>
            <li>Simple to use with a nice result.</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace the old one but found they are thinner and more flexible</li>
            <li>you can tell its cheaply made and not as good as a really topsy tail, but for less than a dollar its a good deal as long as you are already someone who knows how to use them.</li>
            <li>these came pretty quick considering they come from out of country, came before est.</li>
            <li>It broke right off</li>
            <li>Then when it is through it doesn&#x27;t even look right.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Price was right.  </li>
            <li>the product is very easy to make different hairstyles.</li>
            <li>It was what I ordered but I would have liked it better if the instructions were in English or and in English.</li>
            <li>But I wish they were a tad bit bigger, but overall a great product.</li>
            <li>The small one is great if you just want to pull back the top of your hair.</li>
            <li>I was always curious as to how to make certain hair styles and with these it makes it all the more easy</li>
            <li>I havent truly tested how strong it is because I dont want to break them, but so far it works pretty well for what I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it with a simple ponytail and it works fine!</li>
            <li>Been looking for these for a while and was a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>Very cheap, broke instantly, I ordered 3 sets for my granddaughters....</li>
            <li>You need to be very gentle with it.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have english instructions included and decent pictures/diagrams.  </li>
            <li>I had some when i was younger and loved them for my hair this one has some sharp edge but was easy to take off</li>
            <li>its good for my hair, i like the different style, specially my hair is really long..</li>
            <li>I bought this product to be able to do different styles in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>It has done exactly what I needed it to</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so simple, but</li>
            <li>It needs a lot more thought put into packaging and instructions in English</li>
            <li>Pretty flimsy product, but does the job.</li>
            <li>SO inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it..</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay, because the pictures explain enough</li>
            <li>But I get a lot of use out of them first.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure I can go online to learn how to use it in English</li>
            <li>Both pieces broke within first 5 minutes of using them.</li>
            <li>do anyone knows a link where i can check  some hairdos with this ;-)</li>
            <li>But it is too hot for that, so in the mornings before she heads out to school</li>
            <li>it looks pretty</li>
            <li>I love it and used to use them before when I was younger</li>
            <li>This is a lot thinner - HOWEVER I found that it works much better than the actual brand Topsy Tail because it is thinner and easier to  maneuver and go through my hair.</li>
            <li>exactly as described.</li>
            <li>instructions were not in english for the cute hair designs.</li>
            <li>I broke my first one.  </li>
            <li>This tool helps me style my hair in so many different ways, I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliment at work.</li>
            <li>It took a long time (a few weeks) for them to get to my door, but I am very  happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It works for exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>Broke during the first use...</li>
            <li>I got exactly what was pictured and described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Instructions for more hair ideas were in Chinese.</li>
            <li>Broke during first use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I like that it comes with different sizes for more flexibility.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The material is not really sturdy is kind of bendy</li>
            <li>Product received was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The hair tool broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>The tip of the bigger one broke without me touching it.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what she has been looking for.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who wants to to something different that is quick and easy to do!</li>
            <li>This tool definitely makes this style much smoother, more finished looking.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy, just what I wanted, and the price was exactly what I was willing to pay to try these out.</li>
            <li>I love being able to have both the small for my toddler that doesn&#x27;t have much hair and the large for me.</li>
            <li>Large hook broke first time we tried using it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
            <li>These are super cool, even though the instruction manual is in Chinese.</li>
            <li>Very cute styles are getting created everyday.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>it comes with a little picture instruction sheet, but you can always look on youtube or wherever else online if you want more info on how to use these or for more ways to use them, since there is a few more tricks that can be done with them...</li>
            <li>I bought several because I read the comments saying they broke easily.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, the larger one broke on first use.  </li>
            <li>I think using my hands is just as easy, and has the same level on the \\&quot;ouch factor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Oh and guess what the instructions are easy and in english!!</li>
            <li>i use it a lot ,its suprizing durable .its simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It seems like the material was not even strong enough to do what is required.</li>
            <li>The large one broke after two uses.  </li>
            <li>Certainly is a time saver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap imitation of the original.</li>
            <li>Plus, it arrived earlier than expected which is always a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Granted you could probably just tuck the pony tail through, but this allows you to keep it nice and tight while you flip the hair through.</li>
            <li>She has short, fine hair</li>
            <li>Overall, they work just fine for doing topsy tail type things in your hair.  </li>
            <li>These are made of such cheap plastic that they broke within a week.</li>
            <li>but on the plus side, the pictorals are very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Not very sturdy but worked ok on my baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy</li>
            <li>the directions are in another language, and the product was very flimsy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and not broken yet</li>
            <li>It does the trick for your hair, but is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really need them.  </li>
            <li>, shes ready.</li>
            <li>No directions with packaging although I only paid 37cents for this item with free shipping&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really flimsy</li>
            <li>So thanks.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>They are flimsy and very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>This makes it so much easier to make a braid ponytail.</li>
            <li>this is a very flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li>It makes styling my daughter s hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to hold my medium length, medium weight hair very well.</li>
            <li>I try to help it along and be gentle w/it as I dont want it to break.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very inferior I tried sever times to use it and could not.  </li>
            <li>The 2 sizes allow for me to style hair no matter how much hair is involved.  </li>
            <li>it is fast delivery</li>
            <li>I have very thick/unruly hair and it manages to pull through like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>it works but very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy....</li>
            <li>Instructions are in Chinese and it is quite flimsy, one could make a better one out of a paperclip and clear tape.  </li>
            <li>The tiny one is especially good for my two year olds thin baby hairs.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t want to go into my thick hair that good.</li>
            <li>I really should read things before I get excited about a low price.</li>
            <li>If you are unfamiliar with the original, I&#x27;d suggest looking up directions or a tutorial upon arrival (as the instructions included are in Chinese).</li>
            <li>Simple to use and user friendly.</li>
            <li>Works okay, but you need to be very careful when you use it.  </li>
            <li>Breaks very easily after few uses.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be more stiff, but it&#x27;s pretty flexible.  </li>
            <li>Turns and ordinary pony tail into a nice hair do for work.  </li>
            <li>very innovative for thick or skinney hair.</li>
            <li>, it came early, and it was what i expected and more.</li>
            <li>but yes it works and you can do more then a ponytail the only thing they need to send you how to do all that can be done in English ....</li>
            <li>It was cheap, but it broke the first time my wife used it and the instructions are in Chinese (I think, certainly not English).</li>
            <li>I love this product, it came from Hong Kong and took a little bit of time to get it</li>
            <li>I used it when I was a little girl. :)</li>
            <li>ok I thought it would be a little bit sturdier</li>
            <li>- I think there are many hairstyles that I&#x27;m not familiar with.</li>
            <li>I love using it on my little girl.</li>
            <li>The large tool is ok for my hair, but the small one does nothing.</li>
            <li>I want to get a few more.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have had a lot of fun trying different hairstyles for she and her dolls!</li>
            <li>Still for the price it was worth it just for the big one.</li>
            <li>They are handy to have but very low quality, convenient to have but not really worth the money or time to order</li>
            <li>I have the same item for years and with it I can make a lot of fun with my hair.</li>
            <li>I have no complaint about it.</li>
            <li>Wish I had order a few more in case it breaks.  </li>
            <li>sure yet how long it will last but</li>
            <li>These were kind of flimsy, I have fairly thick hair</li>
            <li>Like the above title indicates, I don&#x27;t know how to use the littler piece which is mostly why I ordered them though I needed a new one of the bigger size cuz my old one broke.  </li>
            <li>Really cheaply made,I think it can be broken easily if you just pull</li>
            <li>Broke right in my middle daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it to tuck in strans of loose hair and sometimes flip my ponytail to give my hair a different look :)</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to do your hair up or down.  </li>
            <li>I got this so I could learn to do some new things with my daughters hair</li>
            <li>but I would like to get new ones to use.</li>
            <li>to simple too fragile to cheaply made.......</li>
            <li>I love this product arrived very quickly, earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>It is a bit stiff and has some catchy/grabby bits that require you to be kind of carefule, so it&#x27;s only getting three stars.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s okay for the price you pay for these, there is a bigger and a smaller one, and they are just like any other of its kind, just cheaper, they are as pictured, black and plastic, but like I said, they work!</li>
            <li>But, after trying it on myself, it feels exactly the same as when I flip the hair through with my hands.</li>
            <li>Smaller one broke first time I used it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty simple thing anyway.</li>
            <li>The big one worked the first 3 times that I used it, and I was using it this Friday night</li>
            <li>finally used hot air to flatten it out...</li>
            <li>The larger hoop broke the first time we used it.  </li>
            <li>First time used it broke total rip off.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do good buns with long hair its really hard to keep it together</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product that allows me to create intricate hairstyles that are nearly impossible to do neatly by hand, and they are so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Too cheaply made and too fragile to be used for very long.</li>
            <li>It was mailed in an envelope, which would have been fine if it had not been folded to fit - therefore making the larger tool annoying to use at first (later it flattened out - mostly).</li>
            <li>Item is cheaply made and came a little bent</li>
            <li>it works ok, the loops are actually a little big, my hair slips out sometimes</li>
            <li>I love the look that this does to my hair, but it is hard to do it.  </li>
            <li>I was going to buy one made of hard plastic if these gave out, but I also knew to pull the pony tail holder outwards by about 3/4s of an inch to allow the hair top pass through, and they have not even threatened to snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even my 6 year old can use it.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter loves this.</li>
            <li>Has worked well so far</li>
            <li>had one of these i used to use on my daughters hair when they were young  and now use it myself...</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to both beginner and professional braiders.</li>
            <li>Had really thought I had ordered an actual Topsy Tail.</li>
            <li>I really like the different sizes of the loops.</li>
            <li>My girls are now 12 and 13 years old.</li>
            <li>I have used it 7-8 times so far.</li>
            <li>But, they are also priced much lower than similar products.  </li>
            <li>The old saying you get what you pay for applies here.  </li>
            <li>so far, it works well.</li>
            <li>It adds a touch of elegance and fun when you&#x27;re short on time and need to spruce up a regular ponytail.</li>
            <li>These are worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Very thin, great flexibility, and multiple size options</li>
            <li>You get 2 items but the plastic appears flimsy and not as studyt as the original Topsy Tail was, shipping cost was over-the-top, was sent via parcel post, cheap way to ship, but</li>
            <li>These feel pretty cheap and like they will break any second, I have really thick hair, and they haven&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
            <li>The big one worked great on my very long, thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I love that this set comes with a big and small piece.  </li>
            <li>The larger tool is pretty durable, but the smaller one broke after just a couple uses.</li>
            <li>It took me by surprise, because I was very pleased by the little one, which I use almost everyday and would have expected to break first.</li>
            <li>We have searched high and low for these ponytail makers for our daughter.</li>
            <li>but they were bent and folded to fit a SMALL envelope.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>it took forever to get here and the smaller one was really flimsy, and the little tip wouldnt stay stiff, but the big one is good enough.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple way to create new hair styles.</li>
            <li>but the instructions are really crappy and they are in chinese- the pictures are drawings and are so tiny you have no idea what to do with the product...</li>
            <li>Not heavy duty enough for hair but for the price I&#x27;m not to surprised.</li>
            <li>This can convert an ordinary ponytail into a unique one in mear seconds.</li>
            <li>I love that such a simple tool can make you look a little different!</li>
            <li>Had a very hard time finding a pony tail maker like the one I had many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Sweet little set - well, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>Specially since I work with lots of different people everyday, someone always have something to say about my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was so happy and shocked that I found one again for her.  </li>
            <li>do recommend getting a Topsy Tail in general, but maybe not this brand.</li>
            <li>I thought this was an actual topsy tail tool, i apparently didnt read the description clearly.</li>
            <li>, it has lasted through my four year old and now I use it on my younger daughter as well!</li>
            <li>This was shipped directly from China and the packaging was in Chinese.</li>
            <li>I like the smaller one for my daughter&#x27;s doll and my 2-year old.</li>
            <li>, you cant beat the price, and they are just as good as the expensive ones, and I don&#x27;t see any need in needing to spend that much money for a little loop tool!</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T HAVE MUCH TO SAY OTHER</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, packaging has different hairstyle instructions, they might not be in English but they have pictures.</li>
            <li>at first, I want to use this to tight my hair.</li>
            <li>When fixing their hair, it gives them a clean neat ponytail that last way longer than just a plain ponytail!</li>
            <li>I had a four year old who has long strait hair</li>
            <li>But for the small price this is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Even if your hair is not real long; you can still use these to style your hair</li>
            <li>My little girls don&#x27;t cry as much when I use those instead of using my fingers trying to flip their hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very delicate and sort of cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this in stores and definitely worth getting.</li>

            <li> I was so glad to find them on here!</li>
            <li> It works amazingly and it helps me do some hair styles.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, it arrived on time &amp; this makes a great stocking stuffer at Christmas time.</li>
            <li> They are amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is the funnest and oddest tool that works amazingly.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing.</li>
            <li> Now she does her own her.</li>
            <li> These are very flexible and work perfectly with my daughters&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it to do my daughter&#x27;s hair and my own.</li>
            <li> I think this would be nice for thinner hair or childrens hair.</li>
            <li> It gets kind of stuck</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also an excellent tool for those of us who are always in a rush to get ready for work.</li>
            <li> It takes no time to create a very beautiful hairstyle, buns, pony tails, every looks much prettier when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (September 23rd, 2014):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they work nicely now.</li>
            <li> but this eliminates it and helps you create a nice neat looking braid ponytail.</li>
            <li> i liked to use them and it was really nice to use it.</li>
            <li> I received this 2 pcs hair ponytail  tool ,made my hair looked so nice</li>
            <li> was  nice to see something I use to use years ago.</li>
            <li> I really liked the price, but.......</li>
            <li> she can now do her own hair instead of asking me to do it ever morning.</li>
            <li> very easy to use I liked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li> I love being able to flip my ponytails!  </li>
            <li> great product for doing ponytails and hairstyles and got it for less than $1 works great and makes great hair styles.</li>
            <li> Things very good, very much,love it so much,Speicher-Service ist sehr gut,</li>
            <li> I used to own some years ago, now the grand kids want them for their hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter stole and lost my old one, but I came on Amazon and found a great deal on this one!</li>
            <li> I guess the product itself is ok, but it would have been nice for instructions for usage, or the website to go to for instruction.  </li>
            <li> use it for my 2yo toddler because she has very fine hair and ponies never stay in her hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and they work just as needed!</li>
            <li> This one works quite well, and although it seems a  bit light-weight, it is holding up fine!  </li>
            <li> These are very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Made out of VERY cheap material.</li>
            <li> just added these on since they were very cheap</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Wife and daughter liked the ponytail makers and said they were easy to use.  </li>

            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to buy the ones made by Considered instead.</li>
            <li> Why do I need to use seven more words?</li>
            <li> I love this tool.</li>
            <li> so it was ok.</li>
            <li> so I have no complaints. :-)</li>

            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I was glad to get these.  </li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing it myself for so many years</li>
            <li> I use them most often to cover a rubber band at the end of my braid.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this hook in some stores and a friend instructed me that I could find here, I love it</li>
            <li> And she sits still to allow these creations to come to fruition. :)</li>
            <li> no one likes to have to do it all over again many times.</li>
            <li> It was great using on my daughter, she didn&#x27;t fidget as much when I use the tool to style her</li>
            <li> she says it is much better than the bread tie I was using to do this with.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> I love them, I have try so many hair styles on my daughter</li>

            <li> its ok it is what I ordered.</li>
            <li> kind of cheap</li>
            <li> They work ok.</li>
            <li> and I probably would have had more luck with practice, but in the meantime I lost the product.</li>
            <li> sure it</li>

            <li> and you can to so many hair styles with thing I LOVE IT . - Jamie</li>
            <li> These seem to be made of something more durable and flexible.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and does the job for cheap!</li>
            <li> I paid $1.30 for two which is much better than the one I saw at the store for $8.  </li>

            <li> I used them to make a heart in my daughter&#x27;s hair :)</li>

            <li> so they work much better.</li>

            <li> Best tool for doing my little girls&#x27; hair</li>
            <li> My stepdaughter was amazed by it and how much easier it is to do certain hairstyles now lol</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on my 2 year old and 8 year old.</li>
            <li> You can really make nice hair styles with it....</li>
            <li> Such a great hair tool.</li>
            <li> but the larger one is great.</li>
            <li> Cheap, skimpy item.</li>
            <li> You can tell it was made for dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap...</li>
            <li> To be honest, when I do it myself, I find it much easier just to tuck my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li> This tool helped me create a smooth look that you can&#x27;t get by using your hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great hair tool to add to your daily routine.</li>
            <li> I have been having fun playing and experimenting with these and love having them again.</li>
            <li> Its cheap</li>
            <li> Really cheap plastic?  </li>
            <li> However it is made a bit cheaply.</li>
            <li> and it is what was advertised just cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made  but will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> A bit flimsy and the plastic is not so smooth so gets stuck in my hair and hurts when I have to pull it through.</li>
            <li> Think i paid around 50 cents or so and free shipping,</li>
            <li> Very flexible and works nicely with no problems.</li>
            <li> it&#x27; on the cheap side but still works.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it was cheap, so I almost got what I paid for.....</li>
            <li> Very simple and the work great to make my ponytail a bit fancier.</li>
            <li> Cheap fun for lady hair. :)</li>
            <li> Wow...the price is right and free shipping!</li>
            <li> guess I am going to youTube this to make sure I do it right</li>
            <li> It looks pretty!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use for quick hairstyles for adults and children.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and very resistant to pulling.  </li>
            <li> Great for a quick simple hair style.</li>
            <li> so be aware might work better with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> So fun!</li>
            <li> So I went to the Conair web site and found the original under the stylemakers selection</li>
            <li> I was excited to find them so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> When I had long hair these were great tools to have.  </li>
            <li> I use to have the original Topsy Turvey,  somehow I lost it</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as the original topsy tail</li>
            <li> Happy with the product,  but it did take them a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this</li>
            <li> For the price and some research of videos on what you can do for hairstyles, its worth it!</li>
            <li> Not as well made as the original ones.</li>
            <li> This works ok, but starts to come apart after first use.</li>
            <li> and she was really excited to get it.</li>
            <li> I had one for more years than I&#x27;m willing to admit.  </li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Used to have one years ago when they first came out and glad to have another set.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you are interested in reading the instructions you better know</li>
            <li> Not at all like the original</li>
            <li> I am excited to get another one.</li>
            <li> Target had one of these for a LOT more money - lets be honest what is the point of spending much more for an item that does exactly the same thing?</li>
            <li> and this makes it so much easier then using a bobbypin and much more secure.</li>
            <li> It is not as strong as I wish it were, but as I said, it gets the job fun.</li>
            <li> This ponytail flipper creates the most elegant style from just a simple ponytail, and it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li> These broke right away!  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t exactly know how to use the smaller one lol</li>
            <li> she can do all kinds cool hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Next time  purchase,very good</li>
            <li> but these tools make the pony tail much nicer :)</li>
            <li> I have been having such a good time with these.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t take too much hair at a time.</li>
            <li> I love this topsy tail so much</li>
            <li> I was pleased with how fast i received the item.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the two sizes, but be careful, i about got it stuck in my hair!</li>
            <li> 1000 more now that i&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> I would love this product more if the directions were written in English.</li>
            <li> i quickly pick up her hair, stick that tool in, and BOOM</li>
            <li> Item came quickly for being sent overseas.</li>
            <li> My daughter and my niece enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> So cool for fun designs.</li>
            <li> Works good for long hair</li>
            <li> I have been trying all kinds of new ways to use these and have come up with interesting styles</li>
            <li> My girls love getting a new &#x27;do, and I can&#x27;t complain at all for the 35 cents</li>
            <li> Very flemsy and broke easy.  </li>
            <li> large one works fine</li>
            <li> I large one works fine.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t complain to much!!</li>
            <li> Make cute hair designs for a fraction of the cost of a topsy turvy thing!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was only like a week or two, not bad for coming from over seas!</li>
            <li> Great for little girls hair.</li>
            <li> These are great little tools.  </li>
            <li> The little pamphlet that came with it also was great.</li>
            <li> so it took weeks to get here but worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice way to change a simple ponytail into a fancier hairdo!</li>
            <li> I guess I will see if the product was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This is a decent hair tool, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The smaller one works great when putting up sections of her hair and and the bigger one works good on bigger pieces.</li>
            <li> These were awfully fun to get for use in styling my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> fun to use.  </li>
            <li> I can do fun</li>
            <li> This replacement is better than my old one.</li>
            <li> It arrived in the expected time in good condition.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> however, after I got it, I found that it is not so useful as what I thought.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Like all &amp;#34;topsy tail&amp;#34; tools, they&#x27;re fun.  </li>
            <li> Simple to use with a nice result.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the old one but found they are thinner and more flexible</li>
            <li> you can tell its cheaply made and not as good as a really topsy tail, but for less than a dollar its a good deal as long as you are already someone who knows how to use them.</li>
            <li> these came pretty quick considering they come from out of country, came before est.</li>
            <li> It broke right off</li>
            <li> Then when it is through it doesn&#x27;t even look right.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Price was right.  </li>
            <li> the product is very easy to make different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> It was what I ordered but I would have liked it better if the instructions were in English or and in English.</li>
            <li> But I wish they were a tad bit bigger, but overall a great product.</li>
            <li> The small one is great if you just want to pull back the top of your hair.</li>
            <li> I was always curious as to how to make certain hair styles and with these it makes it all the more easy</li>
            <li> I havent truly tested how strong it is because I dont want to break them, but so far it works pretty well for what I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it with a simple ponytail and it works fine!</li>
            <li> Been looking for these for a while and was a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Very cheap, broke instantly, I ordered 3 sets for my granddaughters....</li>
            <li> You need to be very gentle with it.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have english instructions included and decent pictures/diagrams.  </li>
            <li> I had some when i was younger and loved them for my hair this one has some sharp edge but was easy to take off</li>
            <li> its good for my hair, i like the different style, specially my hair is really long..</li>
            <li> I bought this product to be able to do different styles in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> It has done exactly what I needed it to</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s so simple, but</li>
            <li> It needs a lot more thought put into packaging and instructions in English</li>
            <li> Pretty flimsy product, but does the job.</li>
            <li> SO inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it..</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay, because the pictures explain enough</li>
            <li> But I get a lot of use out of them first.  </li>
            <li> but I am sure I can go online to learn how to use it in English</li>
            <li> Both pieces broke within first 5 minutes of using them.</li>
            <li> do anyone knows a link where i can check  some hairdos with this ;-)</li>
            <li> But it is too hot for that, so in the mornings before she heads out to school</li>
            <li> it looks pretty</li>
            <li> I love it and used to use them before when I was younger</li>
            <li> This is a lot thinner - HOWEVER I found that it works much better than the actual brand Topsy Tail because it is thinner and easier to  maneuver and go through my hair.</li>
            <li> exactly as described.</li>
            <li> instructions were not in english for the cute hair designs.</li>
            <li> I broke my first one.  </li>
            <li> This tool helps me style my hair in so many different ways, I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliment at work.</li>
            <li> It took a long time (a few weeks) for them to get to my door, but I am very  happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It works for exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> Broke during the first use...</li>
            <li> I got exactly what was pictured and described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Instructions for more hair ideas were in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Broke during first use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with different sizes for more flexibility.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The material is not really sturdy is kind of bendy</li>
            <li> Product received was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The hair tool broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> The tip of the bigger one broke without me touching it.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what she has been looking for.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone who wants to to something different that is quick and easy to do!</li>
            <li> This tool definitely makes this style much smoother, more finished looking.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy, just what I wanted, and the price was exactly what I was willing to pay to try these out.</li>
            <li> I love being able to have both the small for my toddler that doesn&#x27;t have much hair and the large for me.</li>
            <li> Large hook broke first time we tried using it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
            <li> These are super cool, even though the instruction manual is in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Very cute styles are getting created everyday.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> it comes with a little picture instruction sheet, but you can always look on youtube or wherever else online if you want more info on how to use these or for more ways to use them, since there is a few more tricks that can be done with them...</li>
            <li> I bought several because I read the comments saying they broke easily.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made, the larger one broke on first use.  </li>
            <li> I think using my hands is just as easy, and has the same level on the \\&quot;ouch factor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Oh and guess what the instructions are easy and in english!!</li>
            <li> i use it a lot ,its suprizing durable .its simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It seems like the material was not even strong enough to do what is required.</li>
            <li> The large one broke after two uses.  </li>
            <li> Certainly is a time saver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap imitation of the original.</li>
            <li> Plus, it arrived earlier than expected which is always a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Granted you could probably just tuck the pony tail through, but this allows you to keep it nice and tight while you flip the hair through.</li>
            <li> She has short, fine hair</li>
            <li> Overall, they work just fine for doing topsy tail type things in your hair.  </li>
            <li> These are made of such cheap plastic that they broke within a week.</li>
            <li> but on the plus side, the pictorals are very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Not very sturdy but worked ok on my baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy</li>
            <li> the directions are in another language, and the product was very flimsy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and not broken yet</li>
            <li> It does the trick for your hair, but is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really need them.  </li>
            <li> , shes ready.</li>
            <li> No directions with packaging although I only paid 37cents for this item with free shipping&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really flimsy</li>
            <li> So thanks.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.</li>
            <li> They are flimsy and very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier to make a braid ponytail.</li>
            <li> this is a very flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li> It makes styling my daughter s hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to hold my medium length, medium weight hair very well.</li>
            <li> I try to help it along and be gentle w/it as I dont want it to break.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very inferior I tried sever times to use it and could not.  </li>
            <li> The 2 sizes allow for me to style hair no matter how much hair is involved.  </li>
            <li> it is fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have very thick/unruly hair and it manages to pull through like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> it works but very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy....</li>
            <li> Instructions are in Chinese and it is quite flimsy, one could make a better one out of a paperclip and clear tape.  </li>
            <li> The tiny one is especially good for my two year olds thin baby hairs.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t want to go into my thick hair that good.</li>
            <li> I really should read things before I get excited about a low price.</li>
            <li> If you are unfamiliar with the original, I&#x27;d suggest looking up directions or a tutorial upon arrival (as the instructions included are in Chinese).</li>
            <li> Simple to use and user friendly.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but you need to be very careful when you use it.  </li>
            <li> Breaks very easily after few uses.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be more stiff, but it&#x27;s pretty flexible.  </li>
            <li> Turns and ordinary pony tail into a nice hair do for work.  </li>
            <li> very innovative for thick or skinney hair.</li>
            <li> , it came early, and it was what i expected and more.</li>
            <li> but yes it works and you can do more then a ponytail the only thing they need to send you how to do all that can be done in English ....</li>
            <li> It was cheap, but it broke the first time my wife used it and the instructions are in Chinese (I think, certainly not English).</li>
            <li> I love this product, it came from Hong Kong and took a little bit of time to get it</li>
            <li> I used it when I was a little girl. :)</li>
            <li> ok I thought it would be a little bit sturdier</li>
            <li> - I think there are many hairstyles that I&#x27;m not familiar with.</li>
            <li> I love using it on my little girl.</li>
            <li> The large tool is ok for my hair, but the small one does nothing.</li>
            <li> I want to get a few more.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have had a lot of fun trying different hairstyles for she and her dolls!</li>
            <li> Still for the price it was worth it just for the big one.</li>
            <li> They are handy to have but very low quality, convenient to have but not really worth the money or time to order</li>
            <li> I have the same item for years and with it I can make a lot of fun with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have no complaint about it.</li>
            <li> Wish I had order a few more in case it breaks.  </li>
            <li> sure yet how long it will last but</li>
            <li> These were kind of flimsy, I have fairly thick hair</li>
            <li> Like the above title indicates, I don&#x27;t know how to use the littler piece which is mostly why I ordered them though I needed a new one of the bigger size cuz my old one broke.  </li>
            <li> Really cheaply made,I think it can be broken easily if you just pull</li>
            <li> Broke right in my middle daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it to tuck in strans of loose hair and sometimes flip my ponytail to give my hair a different look :)</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to do your hair up or down.  </li>
            <li> I got this so I could learn to do some new things with my daughters hair</li>
            <li> but I would like to get new ones to use.</li>
            <li> to simple too fragile to cheaply made.......</li>
            <li> I love this product arrived very quickly, earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It is a bit stiff and has some catchy/grabby bits that require you to be kind of carefule, so it&#x27;s only getting three stars.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s okay for the price you pay for these, there is a bigger and a smaller one, and they are just like any other of its kind, just cheaper, they are as pictured, black and plastic, but like I said, they work!</li>
            <li> But, after trying it on myself, it feels exactly the same as when I flip the hair through with my hands.</li>
            <li> Smaller one broke first time I used it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a pretty simple thing anyway.</li>
            <li> The big one worked the first 3 times that I used it, and I was using it this Friday night</li>
            <li> finally used hot air to flatten it out...</li>
            <li> The larger hoop broke the first time we used it.  </li>
            <li> First time used it broke total rip off.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do good buns with long hair its really hard to keep it together</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product that allows me to create intricate hairstyles that are nearly impossible to do neatly by hand, and they are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Too cheaply made and too fragile to be used for very long.</li>
            <li> It was mailed in an envelope, which would have been fine if it had not been folded to fit - therefore making the larger tool annoying to use at first (later it flattened out - mostly).</li>
            <li> Item is cheaply made and came a little bent</li>
            <li> it works ok, the loops are actually a little big, my hair slips out sometimes</li>
            <li> I love the look that this does to my hair, but it is hard to do it.  </li>
            <li> I was going to buy one made of hard plastic if these gave out, but I also knew to pull the pony tail holder outwards by about 3/4s of an inch to allow the hair top pass through, and they have not even threatened to snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even my 6 year old can use it.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter loves this.</li>
            <li> Has worked well so far</li>
            <li> had one of these i used to use on my daughters hair when they were young  and now use it myself...</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to both beginner and professional braiders.</li>
            <li> Had really thought I had ordered an actual Topsy Tail.</li>
            <li> I really like the different sizes of the loops.</li>
            <li> My girls are now 12 and 13 years old.</li>
            <li> I have used it 7-8 times so far.</li>
            <li> But, they are also priced much lower than similar products.  </li>
            <li> The old saying you get what you pay for applies here.  </li>
            <li> so far, it works well.</li>
            <li> It adds a touch of elegance and fun when you&#x27;re short on time and need to spruce up a regular ponytail.</li>
            <li> These are worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Very thin, great flexibility, and multiple size options</li>
            <li> You get 2 items but the plastic appears flimsy and not as studyt as the original Topsy Tail was, shipping cost was over-the-top, was sent via parcel post, cheap way to ship, but</li>
            <li> These feel pretty cheap and like they will break any second, I have really thick hair, and they haven&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
            <li> The big one worked great on my very long, thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I love that this set comes with a big and small piece.  </li>
            <li> The larger tool is pretty durable, but the smaller one broke after just a couple uses.</li>
            <li> It took me by surprise, because I was very pleased by the little one, which I use almost everyday and would have expected to break first.</li>
            <li> We have searched high and low for these ponytail makers for our daughter.</li>
            <li> but they were bent and folded to fit a SMALL envelope.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> it took forever to get here and the smaller one was really flimsy, and the little tip wouldnt stay stiff, but the big one is good enough.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple way to create new hair styles.</li>
            <li> but the instructions are really crappy and they are in chinese- the pictures are drawings and are so tiny you have no idea what to do with the product...</li>
            <li> Not heavy duty enough for hair but for the price I&#x27;m not to surprised.</li>
            <li> This can convert an ordinary ponytail into a unique one in mear seconds.</li>
            <li> I love that such a simple tool can make you look a little different!</li>
            <li> Had a very hard time finding a pony tail maker like the one I had many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Sweet little set - well, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> Specially since I work with lots of different people everyday, someone always have something to say about my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was so happy and shocked that I found one again for her.  </li>
            <li> do recommend getting a Topsy Tail in general, but maybe not this brand.</li>
            <li> I thought this was an actual topsy tail tool, i apparently didnt read the description clearly.</li>
            <li> , it has lasted through my four year old and now I use it on my younger daughter as well!</li>
            <li> This was shipped directly from China and the packaging was in Chinese.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller one for my daughter&#x27;s doll and my 2-year old.</li>
            <li> , you cant beat the price, and they are just as good as the expensive ones, and I don&#x27;t see any need in needing to spend that much money for a little loop tool!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T HAVE MUCH TO SAY OTHER</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, packaging has different hairstyle instructions, they might not be in English but they have pictures.</li>
            <li> at first, I want to use this to tight my hair.</li>
            <li> When fixing their hair, it gives them a clean neat ponytail that last way longer than just a plain ponytail!</li>
            <li> I had a four year old who has long strait hair</li>
            <li> But for the small price this is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Even if your hair is not real long; you can still use these to style your hair</li>
            <li> My little girls don&#x27;t cry as much when I use those instead of using my fingers trying to flip their hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very delicate and sort of cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this in stores and definitely worth getting.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these for my 5 year old with long medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> updating this review, 17 days later because the big one, which I used less frequently, broke.</li>
            <li> So far, I can only do two things - pull ponytail up, pull pony tail down.  </li>
            <li> and I have to yank on my hair pretty hard to get it to pull through.</li>
            <li> I had to pull pretty hard because of my thickness and mass of hair and it did not break so</li>
            <li> meh... it took an annoyingly long time to get to me and I ended up finding one for about the same price at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> we will see how long it last.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes it was in its normal shape.  </li>
            <li> This product broke the first time I tried to use it, I have medium length hair and it is not as thick as it used to be</li>
            <li> I recommend for the price, but be aware that they are not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> The big one is very weak and even if you pull it lightly, it may break.</li>
            <li> it came in with a brochure with different hair designs that I can make the only downfall is in Asian language which I don&#x27;t read,but the photos do help what other designs I can make with my hair with  these tools .I went to the mall  </li>
            <li> My hair super long, I find it very hard to manage</li>
            <li> BUT it took forever to get here because it came from the other side of the world which was apparent when I saw that all the package instructions were in ching chang chong language.  </li>
            <li> The small one is a bit difficult to use on ones own head - but the bigger one can be used just as well.</li>
            <li> instructions not very clear at all</li>
            <li> I mainly use the small one because I have shorter hair, but my mom has long long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these for a long time.</li>
            <li> The plastic rings are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Now I use it to fix my daughter&#x27;s long her.</li>
            <li> Product came earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> but I have to be extra careful in pulling the hair</li>
            <li> If you have extremely long hair or medium length hair.</li>
            <li> this took long to ship.</li>
            <li> When I bought it I expected it to be smaller.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was able to crazy glue it and wrap a loop of electrical tape around that to fix it, but I don&#x27;t expect that to hold very long.</li>
            <li> Item as described, works fine with my daughter&#x27;s thick hair--just pull slowly</li>
            <li> makes some different style ponytails ,helps pull hair through other hair</li>
            <li> Directions are in a foreign language, so I suggest using Pinterest or Youtube to find tutorials on how to use it in different ways.</li>
            <li> Even with the visual instructions provided on the accompanying paper, it was too complicated to use and to rigidly made to be useful.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times and then the bigger one broke.</li>
            <li> Unless you have really long hair, it likely to be of little use.</li>
            <li> It came with instructions for the big loop, not really sure how to use the smaller loop.</li>
            <li> r black instead of red.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is so thin it broke in half the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> Waiting for other items too try it cause my hair is so long.</li>
            <li> The small one is very flimsy and will not easily go through a collection of hair or under the scrunchies.</li>
            <li> but the small was is too small even for my daughter&#x27;s very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Imuse the little one for my toddler and the big one for myself.</li>
            <li> I knew international doing would take a little longer, they emailed me as soon as I ordered to let me know it would arrive by the 31st that month, and it arrived on the 16th.</li>
            <li> Great for bad hair days!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product at least 3 times last week and have gotten several comments.</li>
            <li> The supplier even emailed to say when they were shipping, and it arrived well before the expected date.  </li>
            <li> The one I had years ago, was harder plastic and still did the trick.</li>
            <li> And it got here faster then expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected, no complaints at all.  </li>
            <li> would* break if you are really rough</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter, works as expected</li>
            <li> But i am really careful when have used it.</li>
            <li> It is like using a wet noodle.</li>
            <li> They are plastic (which I expected).</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> It is not strong enough</li>
            <li> I suppose in this age of computers (here I am, faithfully sitting in front of mine), we are expected to go to U-Tube or some other site for help.  </li>
            <li> The small one is useless unless you have pretty short hair.</li>
            <li> There are endless possibilities I can do her hair.</li>
            <li> These tools came with a small instruction sheet as well to try different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t do all the other fancy stuff you can do with mini ponytails and the like.</li>
            <li> and i have long hair so these do help pull my hair through without getting tangled and all messy at the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the slotted end of the smaller tool is for, though.</li>
            <li> But other than that I can style my hair how ever I want to ^_^</li>
            <li> These little loops make doing hair on little ones ten times easier.</li>
            <li> have been waiting forever but not dissappoint in other purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well but not sure if they will last</li>
            <li> I was trying to do my boyfriends nieces hair and the small eye piece broke after the second use.</li>
            <li> it does not work on thick hair unless you plan on using it only for a partial pony tail.</li>
            <li> It was so week that the small one was just broken when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Just a little harder.</li>
            <li> I learned to do it with my fingers and it always looked a little rough that way.  </li>
            <li> Only issue is the instructions are hard to read, that&#x27;s my only negative remark.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, ugly looking, but it can get the job done.</li>
            <li> Not worth the wait it took to get these.</li>
            <li> I just wish there were some instructions other than the very small pics on the back of the package</li>
            <li> I have really thick, coarse, curly hair and this thing just cannot handle it.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you have thick</li>
            <li> I purchased this one to replace my old one which has broken.</li>
            <li> Only problem I can see is the plastic is a little thin - afraid it might break easily - time will tell.  </li>
            <li> I should mention I&#x27;ve had similar tools in the past; but, they were made of a less flexible plastic and usually broke after not much use.</li>
            <li> My daughter always like to have her hair down.</li>
            <li> The down side is they took weeks to get here.</li>
            <li> The instructions are in a foreign language and are so small, they are not legible.</li>
            <li> The smaller one has not broken yet, but I&#x27;d be shocked if it lasted twelve uses.</li>
            <li> I received it in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It arrived folded in half at the loop.</li>
            <li> LESS THAN A MINUTE.</li>
            <li> and when they packed it they folded it in half.</li>
            <li> Thankful that this was less than $1.00.</li>
            <li> The packet was folded in half and stuffed in an envelope</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not good at braiding, I only know how to do two faux braid styles.</li>
            <li> The larger one also is not a good condition.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I really only use the big one because my hair is thick and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;ll break the smaller tool.</li>
            <li> The surface is not very smooth, it was hard to get to slide through my daughters hair and my hair, even when wet or with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I gave it to a friend who uses it on her little girls hair</li>
            <li> I use it to add a little flare to my pony tails</li>
            <li> Sometimes it pulls little strands of hair with it.</li>
            <li> But the price was so little, I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned after I had read some of the reviews  </li>
            <li> Very thin, not very bendy, kinda hurts if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken but it is very bendy and with very thick hair you have to finagle it.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters hair everyday.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s so fascinated by how it works but soon figured out how simple the science behind it is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Try to find some others that are heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Came in a cellophane sleeve, with poorly printed pix &amp; instructions in Chinese.  </li>
            <li> They ship from China but get here within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Cheap worthless</li>
            <li> but after a few days they broke.</li>
            <li> n jst waste of yr money type thing</li>
            <li> The smaller one appears to be meant for thin hair or a child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the original....snags a bit, hair slips b/c of loop being too round.  </li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat thick, but I was only the small tool for small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> But I suppose it performed at least as well as expected for the price it cost.</li>
            <li> Anyways I was just disappointed the entire package was in Japanses or Chinese, not sure which, no directions at all in English, wish I could get the directions sent to me in Englsish or be abole to print them at least.  </li>
            <li> It is small and thin but at the same time durable.</li>
            <li> The package arrived with only Asian instructions and diagrams that are impossible to decipher.  </li>
            <li> Gave it to co-worker who had long thin hair.</li>
            <li> No more crying our hair pulling.......</li>
            <li> have used it on medium and long, think and thin hair.</li>
            <li> Product is as I expected except the material is a little thin.</li>
            <li> Every little girl should have some of these!</li>
            <li> Bought for my doggies they little one is the one I use on my Maltese and Shih-tzu!</li>
            <li> THAN IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO HANDLE ON MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S HAIR.</li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> My mom used to use the Topsy Turvy tool on my ponytail when I was younger, and I had a nostalgic thrill when I rediscovered it.</li>
            <li> it is so small.</li>
            <li> not sure if I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it will break because the material is so soft...</li>
            <li> the intructions that came with it are kinda small</li>
            <li> Why would anyone make such a useless hair tool?</li>
            <li> Product works but the small loop broke within 2 uses of it.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they were not in English.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are returnable or not</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that it&#x27;s a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Not real happy with the service.</li>
            <li> not a very good product you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> &amp; I had a hard time pulling it through.</li>
            <li> It was bent when it came in envelope... makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li> but some of them are hard to figure out and don&#x27;t make sense.  </li>
            <li> its hard for me</li>
            <li> Wife uses these at least two times a week.  </li>
            <li> My complaint is that it took a MONTH to receive it.  </li>
            <li> Takes common sense because instructions do not help.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and was worried about it breaking.</li>
            <li> Not useable for thick or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I know my daughter has thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is to thick for these.</li>
            <li> i have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> not very happy with this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very sturdy very thin</li>
            <li> I was tired of wearing the same old boring ponytails.</li>
            <li> I feel like one wrong tug is going to break it in half.</li>
            <li> For this little gadget, I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Def not good for a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I have hair that isn&#x27;t thick or thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that these have no English instructions.</li>
            <li> I found this very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Very confusing and cant figure out how to correctly use it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so that may be the problem</li>
            <li> Maybe because my hair is very thick.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because I got tired of trying to do it myself without this gadget.  </li>
            <li> i dont guess that much thin, but it work.  </li>
            <li> Frustrating.</li>
            <li> and it just came apart, leaving me with a halfway hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;The material is too thin, therefore, too flimsy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become so dependant of this for styling my long hair, that I will be purchasing another, but not from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this item unless you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> and It was broken then.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality product.  </li>
            <li> poor instructions.</li>
            <li> It does grab little hairs but not too bad.</li>
            <li> no ideal at all how it is to be used.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these items is very bad, because I used it only once</li>
            <li> I know I have a hard time doing it myself without messing everything up and it looking bad</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and it split  useless</li>
            <li> No gimmicks or wrong wording here.</li>
            <li> I thought that was weird.</li>
            <li> very poor quality</li>
            <li> it splits  not practical and very poorly made</li>
            <li> Made of very thin and flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Very thinly made.</li>
            <li> the smaller one is worthless 100% worthless</li>
            <li> afraid it is going to break.</li>
            <li> This is VERY poorly made!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Cosmetologist and I find it almost impossible to use.</li>
            <li> When gathering your hair, &amp;#34;Ponytail&amp;#34; style, it&#x27;s almost impossible to create the effect that the &amp;#34;DragonPad Hair Braid Ponytail Maker&amp;#34; is supposedly designed to do, The bulk of the hair cannot go through the plastic loop without a Lot of work.</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed in Amazon to offer something from their website.</li>
            <li> When i got it, i was disappointed but tried to use it anyways.</li>
            <li> ALL of them broke &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Hate this item tryed it on my daughter and it broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> Nasty kid won&#x27;t even let me touch her hair!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE BROKE IN</li>
            <li> my daughter loves for you crazy hair !!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> handy and make great gifts</li>
            <li> Super handy tool for inverted ponytails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product before and this knock-off was flimsy and unusable. It took almost 6 weeks to get here. I would never purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> meh... it took an annoyingly long time to get to me and I ended up finding one for about the same price at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these for a long time. Had it when i was a kid and i had a thousand hair styles. 1000 more now that i&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> I got this so I could learn to do some new things with my daughters hair, I know she&#x27;s gonna love it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom since she wanted one :D she loves it! It&#x27;s great for creating supercute hairdos. :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for these for quite some time and now I&#x27;ve finally found them.  Wow...the price is right and free shipping!</li>
            <li> This can convert an ordinary ponytail into a unique one in mear seconds. Great for a quick simple hair style.</li>
            <li> I love the look that this does to my hair, but it is hard to do it.  I have very thick hair, so that may be the problem</li>
            <li> makes some different style ponytails ,helps pull hair through other hair</li>
            <li> So easy to use and gives my ponytails a bit of flair!! I mainly use the small one because I have shorter hair, but my mom has long long hair and she loves using the big one! I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Been using the same set for years.  I bought several because I read the comments saying they broke easily.  I have given them all away to friends.  Best tool for doing my little girls&#x27; hair</li>
            <li> I got the topsy tail like 2 weeks after ordering, I gave it to my friend as a gift filler she loved it. I just ordered one for myself I can wait to start using it.</li>
            <li> These plastic accessories are very cheap plastic material, does not look like a very good deal. The plastic rings are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the item. It works wonderfully! It does grab little hairs but not too bad. Even my 6 year old can use it.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, but it broke the first time my wife used it and the instructions are in Chinese (I think, certainly not English). My wife says there are better versions available.</li>
            <li> it works ok, the loops are actually a little big, my hair slips out sometimes</li>
            <li> My favorite kid&#x27;s hair took, I use it weekly, their hair always turns out great, would buy again</li>
            <li> Wife uses these at least two times a week.  They work perfect, and the price is unreal!</li>
            <li> Love them. So cool for fun designs.</li>
            <li> It kept on bending and I couldn&#x27;t get the hair through. I really don&#x27;t use it very much. Not pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to test out for someone. Unless you have really long hair, it likely to be of little use. Also, it&#x27;s made of very light plastic that is easily breakable. I tried to use it and I ended up breaking it. Even with the visual instructions provided on the accompanying paper, it was too complicated to use and to rigidly made to be useful. Too cheaply made and too fragile to be used for very long. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I love it. The topsy tail works so well..It is flexible plastic and easy to use. I have thick hair and was worried about it breaking. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to to something different that is quick and easy to do!</li>
            <li> My mom used to use the Topsy Turvy tool on my ponytail when I was younger, and I had a nostalgic thrill when I rediscovered it. It works great, even on my extra-long, extra-thick hair. It adds a touch of elegance and fun when you&#x27;re short on time and need to spruce up a regular ponytail.</li>
            <li> Works good for long hair</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter loves this. she can do all kinds cool hairstyles. she is very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, the larger one broke on first use.  Instructions are in Chinese and it is quite flimsy, one could make a better one out of a paperclip and clear tape.  The smaller one has not broken yet, but I&#x27;d be shocked if it lasted twelve uses.</li>
            <li> These are made of such cheap plastic that they broke within a week. Make sure to buy the ones made by Considered instead.</li>
            <li> These are very cheaply made.  The package arrived with only Asian instructions and diagrams that are impossible to decipher.  So far, I can only do two things - pull ponytail up, pull pony tail down.  It would be nice to have english instructions included and decent pictures/diagrams.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> The large one broke after two uses.  I haven&#x27;t tried the smaller one. Why do I need to use seven more words?</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping good item good good good</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken but it is very bendy and with very thick hair you have to finagle it. The small one is useless unless you have pretty short hair.</li>
            <li> Broke after only two uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to be able to do different styles in my daughters hair. It has done exactly what I needed it to and I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that these have no English instructions. It is all in Chinese. I have never been so disappointed in Amazon to offer something from their website.</li>
            <li> This is a really good one. It&#x27;s incredibly quick and easy, and it makes my hair style way more interesting. I love that it&#x27;s so simple, but looks like I took some time to do it! I want to get a few more.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, coarse, curly hair and this thing just cannot handle it.  I gave it to a friend who uses it on her little girls hair and they like it</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters hair everyday. I love this tool. There are endless possibilities I can do her hair.</li>
            <li> Great product very happy with this product  i would recommend this product to anyone who like to do ponytail looks</li>
            <li> I love being able to flip my ponytails!  Great tool and great price! I use it every day! My daughter even uses it too!</li>
            <li> Make cute hair designs for a fraction of the cost of a topsy turvy thing!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was only like a week or two, not bad for coming from over seas!</li>
            <li> I can do several hair styles in 3 seconds from a ponytail for me and my niece its aewsome for on the go hair do</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I got tired of trying to do it myself without this gadget.  It does what you expect it to do.  Certainly is a time saver.</li>
            <li> Had a very hard time finding a pony tail maker like the one I had many years ago.  This one works quite well, and although it seems a  bit light-weight, it is holding up fine!  The supplier even emailed to say when they were shipping, and it arrived well before the expected date.  The only problem is that all the instructions are in Chinese.....but on the plus side, the pictorals are very helpful.  Overall, a good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> This topsy tail is a total rip off because I ordered this item TWICE and I still haven&#x27;t recieved it and even if it said it would come in today (which is April 27,2011) I was waiting all day for it and I never got it,can someone give me an idea what might have happened,because I did order it</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy but worked ok on my baby&#x27;s hair. She has short, fine hair so it was ok. It&#x27;s very flimsy I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so inexpensive. You get what you pay...</li>
            <li> Product is as I expected except the material is a little thin. Has worked well so far so I have no complaints. :-)</li>
            <li> no ideal at all how it is to be used.  Written in only Chinese and the illustrations do not help at all.  Glad it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Very thin, not very bendy, kinda hurts if you are not careful. It still does the job. Just a little harder.</li>
            <li> it is so small. i dont guess that much thin, but it work.  it has direction how to used it</li>
            <li> They hurt when you try to pull it through you&#x27;r hair.  they are larger so be aware might work better with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> faster shipping than i though. works great, even though its plastic it does the job! I use this on my daughters hair everyday, no problem here, thanks</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.....very poor quality and it broke the second time I used it.  You can really make nice hair styles with it....just needs to be made more durable!!</li>
            <li> This can make the cutest hair styles! So fun! LOVE! I am happy with the two sizes, but be careful, i about got it stuck in my hair!</li>
            <li> instructions not very clear at all so just ok would not recommend it It needs a lot more thought put into packaging and instructions in English</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, a product of excellent quality. I put 5 stars for all categories. I have recommended this product to my friends</li>
            <li> I remember having one of this as a teenager. Now I use it to fix my daughter&#x27;s long her. She&#x27;s so fascinated by how it works but soon figured out how simple the science behind it is. Now she does her own her. Nasty kid won&#x27;t even let me touch her hair! lol</li>
            <li> Pretty flimsy product, but does the job. I think using my hands is just as easy, and has the same level on the \\&quot;ouch factor\\&quot;. I bought this to do hair styles on my daughters without them saying \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; when we do the flip through. But, after trying it on myself, it feels exactly the same as when I flip the hair through with my hands.</li>
            <li> the directions are in another language, and the product was very flimsy not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It does work, It does what I wanted it too. not sure if I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Made out of VERY cheap material. Both broke not even a month after receiving it.</li>
            <li> SO inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for.  These are very flexible and work perfectly with my daughters&#x27; hair.  I love them.</li>
            <li> Things very good, very much,love it so much,Speicher-Service ist sehr gut,Next time  purchase,very good, it came early, and it was what i expected and more.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have had a lot of fun trying different hairstyles for she and her dolls! We ordered extras to give for gifts. Love them!!</li>
            <li> Such a great hair tool. My girls love how quick and easy it is to use and the variety of hair styles they are now able to do.</li>
            <li> I had a four year old who has long strait hair so I thought this might do the trick. Not!! It broke right off and then the instructions are not in english? So I went to the Conair web site and found the original under the stylemakers selection, it has lasted through my four year old and now I use it on my younger daughter as well! Oh and guess what the instructions are easy and in english!!</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected!!! Great for bad hair days!!!! You can turn a ponytail into a  really cute style!</li>
            <li> Product came earlier than expected.  Works great for kids and adults.  All directions are in Chinese, but if your a 80s or 90s kid you don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> I was glad to get these.  I used to own some years ago, now the grand kids want them for their hair.  Now it&#x27;s time to play.&lt;br /&gt;These came from China so it took weeks to get here but worth it.</li>
            <li> I  had a party and my friends loved my nails and my hair I could make myself&lt;br /&gt;Use the product is very easy to make different hairstyles. Just placed an ornament as well buy here and wonderful</li>
            <li> Smaller one broke first time I used it but the larger one is great. Wish the smaller one would have held up.</li>
            <li> Now I know why it was only 35 cents. Cheap, skimpy item. Ive had these before and they were made a lot better. Not only that, it was bent in an envelope for mailing and now it&#x27;s crooked. I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these for my 5 year old with long medium thick hair. First time I used it..I was afraid it will break because the material is so soft...not sturdy at all. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and not broken yet but I have to be extra careful in pulling the hair</li>
            <li> I had some when i was younger and loved them for my hair this one has some sharp edge but was easy to take off</li>
            <li> I wish I could read Japanese, but since I don&#x27;t I will have to do it by trial and error.  You get 2 items but the plastic appears flimsy and not as studyt as the original Topsy Tail was, shipping cost was over-the-top, was sent via parcel post, cheap way to ship, but oh well.  Anyways I was just disappointed the entire package was in Japanses or Chinese, not sure which, no directions at all in English, wish I could get the directions sent to me in Englsish or be abole to print them at least.  If these break I will NOT get them again, knowing what I know now, but it&#x27;s a nice copy-cat of the original Topsy Tail[[ASIN:B004367X70 2 Pcs Hair Braid Ponytail Maker Styling Tool]]</li>
            <li> i was looking for this product for a while so went i saw it here i got excited.cant wait to try it.very happy</li>
            <li> Great for my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  Nice way to change a simple ponytail into a fancier hairdo!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap and easy to use version if the Topsy Tail. This was shipped directly from China and the packaging was in Chinese. That&#x27;s okay, because the pictures explain enough and it&#x27;s a pretty simple thing anyway.</li>
            <li> These tools came with a small instruction sheet as well to try different hairstyles. Both tools are very sturdy and work great.</li>
            <li> Works well. Great value for the price. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a simple way to create new hair styles.</li>
            <li> had one of these i used to use on my daughters hair when they were young  and now use it myself...easy way to dress up a ponytail</li>
            <li> I ordered this product 2 months ago and just got it. The instruction are not in English. I guess I will see if the product was worth the wait. Spend the extra money for the tospy tail.</li>
            <li> It does the trick for your hair, but is very flimsy. You can tell it was made for dirt cheap. I feel like one wrong tug is going to break it in half. The one I had years ago, was harder plastic and still did the trick. Wish I would have hung onto that one. LOL But for the small price this is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while, but you can&#x27;t beat the price! This is a decent hair tool, and easy to use. If you are unfamiliar with the original, I&#x27;d suggest looking up directions or a tutorial upon arrival (as the instructions included are in Chinese).</li>
            <li> This is a great product for styling your hair. It makes my hair look great everytime I use it. I love it</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product.  I use it to do my daughter&#x27;s hair and my own. Flipping the ponytail is the perfect finish for many crown-style hairstyles.</li>
            <li> excellent it is a tool I needed for a technique and it is what was needed so thank you !</li>
            <li> This is a simple tool but works and holds up well. It came with instructions for the big loop, not really sure how to use the smaller loop. My daughter stole and lost my old one, but I came on Amazon and found a great deal on this one! I use it to add a little flare to my pony tails but i don&#x27;t do all the other fancy stuff you can do with mini ponytails and the like.</li>
            <li> Not useable for thick or curly hair.  Item just gets stuck in hair. Frustrating. Would have loved it if it would have worked! Gave it to co-worker who had long thin hair. Worked like a charm for her.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Works just like they should.  I like the smaller one for my daughter&#x27;s doll and my 2-year old.</li>
            <li> I bought this here rather than pay $6 for the same thing at the grocery store...and this replaces one I had years ago.  Let&#x27;s face it...it&#x27;s cheap...but it does what it claims to do.  For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This ponytail flipper creates the most elegant style from just a simple ponytail, and it&#x27;s so easy.  I&#x27;m going to order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Shez</li>
            <li> These broke right away!  Waste of money. Especially if you have thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  Try to find some others that are heavy duty.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes using it but it doesn&#x27;t work on all hair types.</li>
            <li> I would love this product more if the directions were written in English. I don&#x27;t know how to use it. I guess I will have to try Youtube.</li>
            <li> Love these! I&#x27;ve been doing it myself for so many years but these tools make the pony tail much nicer :)</li>
            <li> I got these to use in my daughters hair and they work great. The smaller one works great when putting up sections of her hair and and the bigger one works good on bigger pieces.</li>
            <li> I have hair that isn&#x27;t thick or thin. It takes a lot of effort to get it to pull the hair through. Then when it is through it doesn&#x27;t even look right.</li>
            <li> I found this very hard to use.  Maybe because my hair is very thick.  I managed to break the big one while trying to flip my hair.  A good tool. but I think I may need an industrial one..lol.</li>
            <li> These are relatively inexpensively made.  Meaning they periodically break.  But I get a lot of use out of them first.  I use them most often to cover a rubber band at the end of my braid.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Cosmetologist and I find it almost impossible to use. When gathering your hair, &amp;#34;Ponytail&amp;#34; style, it&#x27;s almost impossible to create the effect that the &amp;#34;DragonPad Hair Braid Ponytail Maker&amp;#34; is supposedly designed to do, The bulk of the hair cannot go through the plastic loop without a Lot of work. The instructions are in a foreign language and are so small, they are not legible.</li>
            <li> I already knew how to use one.  My complaint is that it took a MONTH to receive it.  I can understand 7-10 days but this was unacceptable to me</li>
            <li> To be honest, when I do it myself, I find it much easier just to tuck my hair with my fingers. It might work if you are doing it on someone else though...the instructions I got were in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, packaging has different hairstyle instructions, they might not be in English but they have pictures. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom because I remember having one of these when I was a kid and I hadn&#x27;t seen them around. She loves that it came with the two different sizes for when she does her hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this hook in some stores and a friend instructed me that I could find here, I love it, it is very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Every little girl should have some of these! When fixing their hair, it gives them a clean neat ponytail that last way longer than just a plain ponytail! Even Daddies can use these with ease!</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get them but yes it works and you can do more then a ponytail the only thing they need to send you how to do all that can be done in English .... so the only thing I can do is a ponytail but I am sure I can go online to learn how to use it in English so what I am saying is when you order from them they do needed  to send the writing in English</li>
            <li> The big one worked the first 3 times that I used it, and I was using it this Friday night and it just came apart, leaving me with a halfway hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;The material is too thin, therefore, too flimsy.</li>
            <li> Got hair styling tools in the mail today. As advertised. Been looking for these for a while and was a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Both pieces broke within first 5 minutes of using them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a toddler that doesn&#x27;t grow long hair. Very cute styles are getting created everyday. And she sits still to allow these creations to come to fruition. :)</li>
            <li> These were awfully fun to get for use in styling my daughter&#x27;s hair.  They were just perfect!!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Although the instructions are in a foriegn language,  I like the product.  Waiting for other items too try it cause my hair is so long.</li>
            <li> just added these on since they were very cheap and i needed to bump up my balance 2 buck and i have long hair so these do help pull my hair through without getting tangled and all messy at the end. no one likes to have to do it all over again many times. plus no one has the time lol.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely long hair or medium length hair. This is the item for you. I was tired of wearing the same old boring ponytails. With this you can create several different looks.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it came from Hong Kong and took a little bit of time to get it but at the end I got a great product and the price in unbeatable.  Will definitely will buy from this seller again.  Only issue is the instructions are hard to read, that&#x27;s my only negative remark.</li>
            <li> This tool helped me create a smooth look that you can&#x27;t get by using your hands. It is small and thin but at the same time durable. It worked great on my course hair. It was great using on my daughter, she didn&#x27;t fidget as much when I use the tool to style her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great hair tool to add to your daily routine. I would recommend it to both beginner and professional braiders. It&#x27;s simple to use and creates styles faster than just using your hands.</li>
            <li> Item as described, works fine with my daughter&#x27;s thick hair--just pull slowly &amp; you&#x27;ll be fine.  Comes with picture instructions alongside the Chinese lettering.  Will repurchase to give out as part of gift bags for her friends&#x27; birthdays.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this item she says it is much better than the bread tie I was using to do this with. So glad I found this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I remember having these as a kid and didn&#x27;t know they still made them. I was excited to find them so inexpensive. the intructions that came with it are kinda small but I don&#x27;t really need them.  I have been having fun playing and experimenting with these and love having them again.</li>
            <li> these are perfect for my daughters hair! they make doing cute hair dos easy and pain free! love that it came with 2! and it came sooner than they said!</li>
            <li> It works just like I remember it working. Great for little girls hair. No more crying our hair pulling....... yay</li>
            <li> I guess the product itself is ok, but it would have been nice for instructions for usage, or the website to go to for instruction.  I suppose in this age of computers (here I am, faithfully sitting in front of mine), we are expected to go to U-Tube or some other site for help.  For this little gadget, I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this in stores and definitely worth getting. It works great! It gets tangled sometimes but overall it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Came in a cellophane sleeve, with poorly printed pix &amp; instructions in Chinese.  I still have no clue how to use it.</li>
            <li> Turns and ordinary pony tail into a nice hair do for work.  Quick and easy to use with many styles.</li>
            <li> The plastic is so thin it broke in half the first time I used it! Why would anyone make such a useless hair tool?</li>
            <li> i just receive it and dont know how to use it !! do anyone knows a link where i can check  some hairdos with this ;-)</li>
            <li> Hi.  Like the above title indicates, I don&#x27;t know how to use the littler piece which is mostly why I ordered them though I needed a new one of the bigger size cuz my old one broke.  There may be directions written in Chinese but I don&#x27;t read Chinese</li>
            <li> When I had long hair these were great tools to have.  It makes it so easy to do your hair up or down.  Makes it easier to do pony tail flips and buns.  Even if your hair is not real long; you can still use these to style your hair</li>
            <li> These are worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> this took long to ship. no directions how to use came with it. and it came in a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> These were kind of flimsy, I have fairly thick hair &amp; I had a hard time pulling it through. I think this would be nice for thinner hair or childrens hair.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and works great.  Win win for me.</li>
            <li> This product broke the first time I tried to use it, I have medium length hair and it is not as thick as it used to be so I don&#x27;t know why it broke but the company who makes these need to rethink the material used and it needs to be tougher.</li>
            <li> I really only use the big one because my hair is thick and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;ll break the smaller tool. But the larger one works well.</li>
            <li> I use to have the original Topsy Turvey,  somehow I lost it and I had not seen one since.  Until I found this Ponytail maker, same product different make,r black instead of red.  I use it to tuck in strans of loose hair and sometimes flip my ponytail to give my hair a different look :)</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made!  It won&#x27;t even flip my daughters hair.  I know my daughter has thick hair but I was using the one from when I was a child and it worked fine.  This is VERY poorly made!</li>
            <li> My daughter always like to have her hair down. But it is too hot for that, so in the mornings before she heads out to school i quickly pick up her hair, stick that tool in, and BOOM, shes ready.</li>
            <li> I pull my ponytail up through the back of my hair all the time.  It&#x27;s my go to style for getting my hair up and out of the way.  I had been just separating the hair above the elastic and pushing the tail through with my fingers, but I thought the topsy tail thing might be easier.  I tried it, it&#x27;s not easier.  It&#x27;s actually worse.  The tail does not want to flip over the elastic when I pull with this thing.  It gets kind of stuck and I have to yank on my hair pretty hard to get it to pull through.</li>
            <li> I received it in less than 2 weeks. Works perfect. I love using it on my daughter for great hair styles and always get good complements! Definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I have been having such a good time with these. I have been trying all kinds of new ways to use these and have come up with interesting styles</li>
            <li> These are great little tools.  Granted you could probably just tuck the pony tail through, but this allows you to keep it nice and tight while you flip the hair through.</li>
            <li> No directions with packaging although I only paid 37cents for this item with free shipping&lt;br /&gt; so I won&#x27;t complain to much!!</li>
            <li> Item came quickly for being sent overseas. I have used this product at least 3 times last week and have gotten several comments. It comes with an instruction sheet, but its not in English.</li>
            <li> Thats about it. It does what its supposed to. It is a bit stiff and has some catchy/grabby bits that require you to be kind of carefule, so it&#x27;s only getting three stars. Its cheap, it works, what&#x27;s to say?</li>
            <li> they work but they hurt my kids heads and the smaller one is worthless 100% worthless done right it looks pretty</li>
            <li> Great item! I love it and used to use them before when I was younger and I love to use them&lt;br /&gt;Now!</li>
            <li> When I bought it I expected it to be smaller.But for my surprise it was way bigger which is even better.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use. And it got here faster then expected. I will buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li> This tool definitely makes this style much smoother, more finished looking.  I learned to do it with my fingers and it always looked a little rough that way.  I&#x27;m not sure what the slotted end of the smaller tool is for, though.</li>
            <li> I really love this. It works amazingly and it helps me do some hair styles. It was a great purchase. I&#x27;ll be purchasing another of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I love them, I have try so many hair styles on my daughter</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter liked the ponytail makers and said they were easy to use.  They said they would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> It does the job. It&#x27;s really flimsy so I&#x27;m worried it will brake on me. However it was so cheep that if it did I wouldn&#x27;t cry over it. It does the job for now.</li>
            <li> Had really thought I had ordered an actual Topsy Tail. This is a lot thinner - HOWEVER I found that it works much better than the actual brand Topsy Tail because it is thinner and easier to  maneuver and go through my hair.</li>
            <li> Very flemsy and broke easy.  Instructions were not in English so we couldn&#x27;t read the directions,  Def not good for a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> works great, is as advertised. needs more ideas and directions. fun to use.  its just like the topsy turvy .</li>
            <li> Easy to use and durable. Great results achieved.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, broke instantly, I ordered 3 sets for my granddaughters....all broke.</li>
            <li> I really like the different sizes of the loops. The tiny one is especially good for my two year olds thin baby hairs.</li>
            <li> not a very good product you get what you pay for. Used then once and it split  useless would not recommend this product.  the seam where they splice it together  and where you would put the tension from your pony tail it splits  not practical and very poorly made</li>
            <li> exactly as described. haven&#x27;t been able to find these in years.</li>
            <li> The wife loves them. Cheap fun for lady hair. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great service.</li>
            <li> Work great. My daughter no longer cries when I do her hair:)</li>
            <li> works well enough.  you can tell its cheaply made and not as good as a really topsy tail, but for less than a dollar its a good deal as long as you are already someone who knows how to use them.</li>
            <li> I thought this was an actual topsy tail tool, i apparently didnt read the description clearly. When i got it, i was disappointed but tried to use it anyways. The surface is not very smooth, it was hard to get to slide through my daughters hair and my hair, even when wet or with conditioner. The small one is very flimsy and will not easily go through a collection of hair or under the scrunchies. The big one gets caught and tangled, and it actually broke before the 10th time using it...i was trying to pull a half-up pony through the scrunchy, and when it was about halfway through it snapped at the top of the loop! I am going to look for an actual topsy tail now.</li>
            <li> It was bent when it came in envelope... makes it hard to use. finally used hot air to flatten it out... instructions were not in english for the cute hair designs. delivered on time!!!</li>
            <li> Had one of these many years ago . I have been looking for this for ages!  Thanks - Love it!</li>
            <li> This thing is great. I was watching nickmom and saw it advertised &amp;#34; so easy dad can do &amp;#34; well he can. Works great with my 5 year old and keeps the hair tie in all day. It&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li> i like this there just was not enough directions on how to use</li>
            <li> Love these.  This is actually my second set as after using it for about a year I broke my first one.  I use it to hair wrap my ponytail and it makes it perfect every time.  They ship from China but get here within a few weeks.  Very happy with the company and the product and would definitely buy them again.  I think this is one of the most useful and least expensive hair tools I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> My hair super long, I find it very hard to manage and I&#x27;m not good at braiding, I only know how to do two faux braid styles. This tool helps me style my hair in so many different ways, I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliment at work. Specially since I work with lots of different people everyday, someone always have something to say about my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also an excellent tool for those of us who are always in a rush to get ready for work. It takes no time to create a very beautiful hairstyle, buns, pony tails, every looks much prettier when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (September 23rd, 2014):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m updating this review, 17 days later because the big one, which I used less frequently, broke. It took me by surprise, because I was very pleased by the little one, which I use almost everyday and would have expected to break first. The big one is very weak and even if you pull it lightly, it may break. I&#x27;m taking away two stars because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend getting a Topsy Tail in general, but maybe not this brand. I&#x27;ve become so dependant of this for styling my long hair, that I will be purchasing another, but not from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> great product for doing ponytails and hairstyles and got it for less than $1 works great and makes great hair styles.</li>
            <li> My hair is to thick for these. Obviously made for a child&#x27;s hair type. Made of very thin and flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but you need to be very careful when you use it.  Make sure you don&#x27;t take too much hair at a time.</li>
            <li> I remember these from when I was a kid. My girls are now 12 and 13 years old. I bought them as a stocking stuffer at Christmas. I asked if they knew what they were for...They had NO idea. When I showed them, they loved it!! too cute!!</li>
            <li> Hate this item tryed it on my daughter and it broke. It&#x27;s not very sturdy very thin and I wouldn&#x27;t even buy this product</li>
            <li> It took a long time (a few weeks) for them to get to my door, but I am very  happy with the product. They are just what I needed, and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> large one works fine but the small was is too small even for my daughter&#x27;s very fine thin hair. Still for the price it was worth it just for the big one.</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> People love hair wrapped ponytails and whatnot and this makes it so much easier then using a bobbypin and much more secure. I use both depending on what type of hair i&#x27;m working with so don&#x27;t have a preference.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected, no complaints at all.  Delivery of product timely. My daughter was very happy with the purchased product.</li>
            <li> I bought it before love it.  My little girls don&#x27;t cry as much when I use those instead of using my fingers trying to flip their hair.  I knew my sister would love it so I bought for my nieces their bday..</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as the original topsy tail but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product,  but it did take them a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I have owned a topsy tail for years and left it in the hotel on one of my trips.  I ordered this as a replacement and it broke after only two days.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The larger hoop broke the first time we used it.  Really cheap plastic?  Broke right in my middle daughter&#x27;s hair.  Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Love using these on my hair and my girls hair!</li>
            <li> They are handy to have but very low quality, convenient to have but not really worth the money or time to order</li>
            <li> Very good itvworks, and comes when said could use better packing came all bent up had to leave it in sun and came out to check to see if I can bend them back so did and they work nicely now. So thanks.</li>
            <li> Really cheaply made,I think it can be broken easily if you just pull it.&lt;br /&gt;And could you pls provide USA people with English user manuals?&lt;br /&gt;It will be perfect with better materials and user manuals.</li>
            <li> Product works but the small loop broke within 2 uses of it. I large one works fine. However it is made a bit cheaply.</li>
            <li> Good price.... I used to have pony tails. I used this one day instead just a simple pony tail and my coworker told me: ohh... you did your hair today!! It looks pretty!! haha. It is easy to use. I used it when I was a little girl. :)</li>
            <li> Did not work on any of our hair</li>
            <li> Easy to use. makes cute turnovers in any size hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap imitation of the original. Very flimsy. It arrived folded in half at the loop. All styling instructions were in Chinese. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone who isn&#x27;t great at styling their hair. It&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do good buns with long hair its really hard to keep it together</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and wasn&#x27;t expecting it for quite a while, but it showed up earlier than i had thought. My daughter and my niece enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> It is not strong enough</li>
            <li> I love this topsy tail so much</li>
            <li> This works ok I thought it would be a little bit sturdier but it works ok for the money! Enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this and I understand how to use the big one but can&#x27;t figure out the smaller one. I would read the instructions but unfortunately they were not in English.</li>
            <li> It was what I ordered but I would have liked it better if the instructions were in English or and in English.</li>
            <li> First time used it broke total rip off.  Would not recommend to anyone.  Wanted to return but never heard back.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I had them as a girl and I had been looking for them for years. They work perfectly and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> Target had one of these for a LOT more money - lets be honest what is the point of spending much more for an item that does exactly the same thing? There is no point in that at all. The small one is a bit difficult to use on ones own head - but the bigger one can be used just as well. For the price and some research of videos on what you can do for hairstyles, its worth it!</li>
            <li> mine actually snaped first time i used it :\  it did work and it is what was advertised just cheap</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE BROKE IN LESS THAN A MINUTE.</li>
            <li> Umm. No. Cheap worthless</li>
            <li> Bought for my doggies they little one is the one I use on my Maltese and Shih-tzu!</li>
            <li> I love this thing but I don&#x27;t exactly know how to use the smaller one lol but either way its a great product and Im happy I bought it</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, it arrived on time &amp; this makes a great stocking stuffer at Christmas time. A great way to wear your hair when letting it grow out.</li>
            <li> It works for exactly what it should. Directions are in a foreign language, so I suggest using Pinterest or Youtube to find tutorials on how to use it in different ways. Other than that, this is perfect. I have not had any problems with it. I have used it 7-8 times so far.</li>
            <li> These work fine for their purpose.  They are flimsy and very inexpensive.  But, they are also priced much lower than similar products.  Overall, they work just fine for doing topsy tail type things in your hair.  I mostly use the smaller one for my toddler and it works great.</li>
            <li> The plastic is a bit flimsier than the pricier version, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This worked well for flipping my hair under. Love the infinite amount of hair styles I can make with this.</li>
            <li> Okay.  They work.  Not as well made as the original ones.</li>
            <li> i love it ! i use it a lot ,its suprizing durable .its simple and easy to use. great deal!it is a must !</li>
            <li> Broke during the first use... N we bought several! ALL of them broke &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I love what it does, but it breaks really easily. The top loop of one of mine broke while doing my 3-year-old&#x27;s hair.  I was able to crazy glue it and wrap a loop of electrical tape around that to fix it, but I don&#x27;t expect that to hold very long.</li>
            <li> i have really thick hair and it works just as good as a $10 topsy tail amazing price and works soooooooooooooooo well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a topsy tail since they came out in the 80&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s a relatively easy way to jazz up your hairstyle.  I love that this set comes with a big and small piece.  The small one is great if you just want to pull back the top of your hair.</li>
            <li> This works ok, but starts to come apart after first use. You need to be very gentle with it. It is very delicate and sort of cheaply made.</li>
            <li> No gimmicks or wrong wording here. I got exactly what was pictured and described.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on medium and long, think and thin hair. With some video tutorials I found online, this has been a great tool to do my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> The consept is good,but these are to flimsy.</li>
            <li> I love being able to have both the small for my toddler that doesn&#x27;t have much hair and the large for me. Instructions for more hair ideas were in Chinese.</li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier to make a braid ponytail. I know I have a hard time doing it myself without messing everything up and it looking bad but this eliminates it and helps you create a nice neat looking braid ponytail.</li>
            <li> This is a OK!  product, for the money.. It&#x27;s cheaply made  but will do the trick.  I would recommend this..It&#x27;s easy to use. Will last!!! Recommend!!</li>
            <li> it was good item. i liked to use them and it was really nice to use it. i would like to buy them</li>
            <li> Broke during first use. I would not recommend this item unless you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Got the product -finally- but the instructions are really crappy and they are in chinese- the pictures are drawings and are so tiny you have no idea what to do with the product... I googled it- that helped. It was hecka cheap though :)</li>
            <li> took forever to get. &amp; then when i did get in the mail. It broke as soon as i opened it. Pissed me off. I will not order from this carrier anymore. It seems like the material was not even strong enough to do what is required. -__-</li>
            <li> its ok it is what I ordered. it is floppy. and when they packed it they folded it in half. I thought that was weird.</li>
            <li> A bit flimsy and the plastic is not so smooth so gets stuck in my hair and hurts when I have to pull it through.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a present and she was really excited to get it. She has not said anything about it to me yet.</li>
            <li> This tool does make an inside-out ponytail, but not without some finessing. I watched a YouTub video to learn how to use it, and after a bit of practice, I can do it.  I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the results though.</li>
            <li> Very thinly made. But will work.</li>
            <li> kind of cheap but at this price what should I expect.  They work ok.</li>
            <li> The quality of these items is very bad, because I used it only once and It was broken then. So I will not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> These ponytail makes we&#x27;re good while they lasted but after a few days they broke. Not sure if they are returnable or not but I would like to get new ones to use.</li>
            <li> My daughter had one of these some years ago and loved using it.  She moved and lost it.  She and I looked every where for years then I ran arcoss this on Amazon.  She was so happy and shocked that I found one again for her.  I should have thought of looking on Amazon for it along time ago and saved us alot of time.  Amazon has everything.</li>
            <li> this is a very flimsy plastic. it does not work on thick hair unless you plan on using it only for a partial pony tail. it is not durable.</li>
            <li> not very happy with this product, if i had known, i guess i got what i paid for. to simple too fragile to cheaply made.......</li>
            <li> dont even think to buy its its piece of plastic not usefull n jst waste of yr money type thing dont buy it even for try</li>
            <li> They are amazing.  I can do fun looks with them now without having to struggle myself.  Quick flip of the hair and it looks great!</li>
            <li> I used one it broke in one minute.</li>
            <li> Well.  It doesn&#x27;t really work that well. But. It came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.  It makes styling my daughter s hair so much easier.  It got here earlier than it said too</li>
            <li> Sweet little set - well, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to hold my medium length, medium weight hair very well. Could be operator error and I probably would have had more luck with practice, but in the meantime I lost the product.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be more stiff, but it&#x27;s pretty flexible.  I havent truly tested how strong it is because I dont want to break them, but so far it works pretty well for what I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my 2yo toddler because she has very fine hair and ponies never stay in her hair.  I have also used the larger one for my hair, just a basic pony tail.  I try to help it along and be gentle w/it as I dont want it to break.&lt;br /&gt;Im sure it *would* break if you are really rough w/it though.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price we paid for sure!  Arrived sooner than the EDD.</li>
            <li> These are super cool, even though the instruction manual is in Chinese. But other than that I can style my hair how ever I want to ^_^</li>
            <li> I have the same item for years and with it I can make a lot of fun with my hair. I purchased this one to replace my old one which has broken. It is cheap, ugly looking, but it can get the job done. I have no complaint about it.</li>
            <li> My friends been asking me how I did my hair wrapped pony tail I told them how to use this product and they all bought it from amazon.- Tamara  This is awesome plus it has to different sizes and you can to so many hair styles with thing I LOVE IT . - Jamie</li>
            <li> Thankful that this was less than $1.00. Don&#x27;t even know how to use since instructions are in Chinese. Looked nice in my garbage can!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with how fast i received the item. My only disappointment is that it&#x27;s a little flimsy. Sometimes it pulls little strands of hair with it. Overall it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I had one for more years than I&#x27;m willing to admit.  This replacement is better than my old one. Very thin, great flexibility, and multiple size options</li>
            <li> i have only one them  and they  did not  put the  lettering in engls so i have  to find  some  one to  tell  me how to use</li>
            <li> I had this when I was a kid and made my mom do fancy ponytails in my hair. Now I can do them in my 6 year olds hair! I love that such a simple tool can make you look a little different!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and these work perfectly to style with. I should mention I&#x27;ve had similar tools in the past; but, they were made of a less flexible plastic and usually broke after not much use. These seem to be made of something more durable and flexible.</li>
            <li> This Topsy Tail worked perfectly. I used this today on how I put my ponytail up 👌</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Only problem I can see is the plastic is a little thin - afraid it might break easily - time will tell.  But the price was so little, I can&#x27;t complain.  Wish I had order a few more in case it breaks.  Didn&#x27;t know it was coming from out of the country.</li>
            <li> The product quality is good. It arrived in the expected time in good condition. The only problem I have with this product is that the instructions for its use are not in English.</li>
            <li> The instructions were in Chinese</li>
            <li> I bought it to use on my daughters hair and the larger tool broke after only a couple uses. Not heavy duty enough for hair but for the price I&#x27;m not to surprised.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality product.  The old saying you get what you pay for applies here.  Large hook broke first time we tried using it.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these to do our daughter&#x27;s hair. These little loops make doing hair on little ones ten times easier. You can achieve some pretty awesome hairdos to boot. I wish I could post some pictures, but you&#x27;ll just have to get them and try them out for yourself. They are from Asia, so the shipping will take a while. We got ours after about 3 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter, works as expected</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on my 2 year old and 8 year old. Worth the price. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> at first, I want to use this to tight my hair. however, after I got it, I found that it is not so useful as what I thought.</li>
            <li> Very confusing and cant figure out how to correctly use it. Only comes with instructions in Chinese but you cant beat the price</li>
            <li> There is no need to get fancy with this; works as intended and it is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure yet how long it will last but so far, it works well.</li>
            <li> The ponytail maker works great, just what my daughter was expecting for the style she wanted to use it for.  But, the seller took forever to get it delivered.  Not real happy with the service.</li>
            <li> they work good hair looks cute once I figured out how to work them right would be nice if instructions came in english</li>
            <li> Very nice! Sturdy and does the job for cheap! The big one worked great on my very long, thick, coarse hair. I had to pull pretty hard because of my thickness and mass of hair and it did not break so it passed the test! Will buy more! Think i paid around 50 cents or so and free shipping, Can&#x27;t beat that! Very flexible and works nicely with no problems. WILL buy more for all my family! Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product is good and does its job. It is not as strong as I wish it were, but as I said, it gets the job fun. My girls love getting a new &#x27;do, and I can&#x27;t complain at all for the 35 cents it cost me for these. Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Have not receoved this either. have been waiting forever but not dissappoint in other purchase. hopefully in a week or two</li>
            <li> These feel pretty cheap and like they will break any second, I have really thick hair, and they haven&#x27;t broke yet. But i am really careful when have used it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times. The large tool is ok for my hair, but the small one does nothing. It is like using a wet noodle. I recommend for the price, but be aware that they are not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product is just as advertised. It is easy to use for quick hairstyles for adults and children. The little pamphlet that came with it also was great. You tube also has great videos on how to use this topsy tail.</li>
            <li> helps me incredibly to make hair bows!!!! Great for my cheerleading competitions!! But I wish they were a tad bit bigger, but overall a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the funnest and oddest tool that works amazingly. I was always curious as to how to make certain hair styles and with these it makes it all the more easy</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to BUT it took forever to get here because it came from the other side of the world which was apparent when I saw that all the package instructions were in ching chang chong language.  It&#x27;s all good though because it cost pennies.</li>
            <li> I had seen these before, possibly on TV but I didn&#x27;t expect the instructions to be in Chinese!  Oh well possibly we can use them following the picture instructions.</li>
            <li> Used to have one years ago when they first came out and glad to have another set.  They work well.</li>
            <li> it does what it says and is perfect for ponytails.i use it at my salon,i&#x27;m a hairdresser.and it makes flipping ponytails easier</li>
            <li> very pleased with the product and now I can fix my hair in different ways. thank you for this item</li>
            <li> They are fine and do the job. The price was amazing. The down side is they took weeks to get here.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T HAVE MUCH TO SAY OTHER THAN IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO HANDLE ON MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S HAIR. SHE DOES HAVE A LOT OF HAIR THOUGH.</li>
            <li> very inferior I tried sever times to use it and could not.  I will try it again some time in the summer.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and very resistant to pulling.  I like that it comes with different sizes for more flexibility.</li>
            <li> I received this 2 pcs hair ponytail  tool ,made my hair looked so nice it came in with a brochure with different hair designs that I can make the only downfall is in Asian language which I don&#x27;t read,but the photos do help what other designs I can make with my hair with  these tools .I went to the mall  and they were filming a movie inside someone in that crue asked if I had done my hair in a hair salon and I said no I did it,</li>
            <li> I paid 36 cent and excellent price (compare to Fred Meyer or Claire&#x27;s for $6+).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are interested in reading the instructions you better know Chinese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, shipped from China and took about 4 weeks to ship.  It was mailed in an envelope, which would have been fine if it had not been folded to fit - therefore making the larger tool annoying to use at first (later it flattened out - mostly).</li>
            <li> They are plastic (which I expected). but they were bent and folded to fit a SMALL envelope. I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> The styling tool is made of not of a sturdy plastic but it worked for my girls and my hair. I paid $1.30 for two which is much better than the one I saw at the store for $8.  I wanted to make sure I could it so the price was perfect and it does the same thing.  The product was shipped from China (took 4 weeks to receive) and the instructions are not in English.  It has pictures but some of them are hard to figure out and don&#x27;t make sense.  The packet was folded in half and stuffed in an envelope but after a few minutes it was in its normal shape.  I use it with a simple ponytail and it works fine! ;)</li>
            <li> I ordered your stuff and paid for it in full,now all I&#x27;ve got from you is the hair piece. Send the rest of my stuff or refund my money. I buy a lot on line,but I won&#x27;t buy from you anymore,bank on that.</li>
            <li> Love this item, easy to style my hair.</li>
            <li> The 2 sizes allow for me to style hair no matter how much hair is involved.  Plus, it arrived earlier than expected which is always a pleasant surprise.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Instructions are in Chinese ... guess I am going to youTube this to make sure I do it right</li>
            <li> Item is cheaply made and came a little bent</li>
            <li> As described and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It was so week that the small one was just broken when I tried it for the first time. The larger one also is not a good condition.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of hair, do not buy it.</li>
            <li> it is fast delivery and I have started using it.the product is easy to use and look good with the new hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and they work just as needed! They are a great price, and awesome when you need them. I used them to make a heart in my daughter&#x27;s hair :)</li>
            <li> was  nice to see something I use to use years ago.</li>
            <li> The material is not really sturdy is kind of bendy but it works for what you need it. I think that for the price it&#x60;s a great bargain!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  Bought as part of a gift and decided to not even give it to the person.  Will not buy this sort of product online again.</li>
            <li> Product received was exactly as described. It also works as described. I have very thick/unruly hair and it manages to pull through like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I really liked the price, but....... it took forever to get here and the smaller one was really flimsy, and the little tip wouldnt stay stiff, but the big one is good enough.</li>
            <li> This set works well, my daughter likes it she can now do her own hair instead of asking me to do it ever morning.</li>
            <li> put your hair in a ponytail b and pull through the loop. yur hair now looks fancy. it works but very flimsy. afraid it is going to break. very innovative for thick or skinney hair.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li> Very flimsy....but does the job just fine. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Like all &amp;#34;topsy tail&amp;#34; tools, they&#x27;re fun.  Gotta figure out how to use them, but they do what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> very easy to use I liked</li>
            <li> Breaks very easily after few uses.</li>
            <li> These are plastic. Wish they were more like a coat hanger. They don&#x27;t want to go into my thick hair that good.</li>
            <li> Purchased fo cosmetologist as gift. Simple to use with a nice result. Made of plastic. Arrived from Hong Kong very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works well but not sure if they will last</li>
            <li> I love this product arrived very quickly, earlier than expected. was a good buy. my daughter loves for you crazy hair !!!!</li>
            <li> These things are awesome.  Had one before that came with a book but the kids lost it.  I bought these to replace the old one but found they are thinner and more flexible so they work much better.</li>
            <li> been look for a second one of these for a while &amp; finally found it. it&#x27; on the cheap side but still works. we will see how long it last.</li>
            <li> great addition to my hair box. Get great compliments when I use it on my daughters.</li>
            <li> Daughter was pleased!</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use.  I was using my finger to try to get the hair turned.  This is simple to use and does not snag or pull hair.</li>
            <li> Imuse the little one for my toddler and the big one for myself. We get a lot of different styles from these. And its perfect that it can fit in a purse</li>
            <li> its good for my hair, i like the different style, specially my hair is really long.. its hard for me</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times and then the bigger one broke. I have thick hair. The smaller one appears to be meant for thin hair or a child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> these came pretty quick considering they come from out of country, came before est. arrival date, so that is faster than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I got these to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair, she is 5, and they do work, I wish they were stonger, but I don&#x27;t see them breaking for a while, since its not like I use them every day, but if I did, I would say they would only last 2/3 months, but that&#x27;s okay for the price you pay for these, there is a bigger and a smaller one, and they are just like any other of its kind, just cheaper, they are as pictured, black and plastic, but like I said, they work! it comes with a little picture instruction sheet, but you can always look on youtube or wherever else online if you want more info on how to use these or for more ways to use them, since there is a few more tricks that can be done with them... just check youtube, there is plenty of how to videos, and the howto website has plenty of videos as well I do recommend this to everybody, you cant beat the price, and they are just as good as the expensive ones, and I don&#x27;t see any need in needing to spend that much money for a little loop tool!</li>
            <li> I like the flexibility of the material this product is made from.  I use this to style my hair many times.  I bought it to replace the one I broke. This is good for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I was trying to do my boyfriends nieces hair and the small eye piece broke after the second use. Not worth the wait it took to get these.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the original....snags a bit, hair slips b/c of loop being too round.  Oh well, it was cheap, so I almost got what I paid for.....</li>
            <li> I use it every day now!! Great method to use for your hair every day I am very happy with this!</li>
            <li> The hair tool broke the first time I tried to use it. I wasnt pleased. Not at all like the original</li>
            <li> this is just what I ordered.  I enjoyed on of these years ago and it broke.  I am excited to get another one.</li>
            <li> Very simple and the work great to make my ponytail a bit fancier.</li>
            <li> It is a neat hair tool. Simple to use and user friendly. Takes common sense because instructions do not help.</li>
            <li> These things are always overpriced In the US. Price was great, and just what I needed to practice without overspending. This was mailed from overseas but that was okay with me- I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The tip of the bigger one broke without me touching it.</li>
            <li> The larger tool is pretty durable, but the smaller one broke after just a couple uses. My hair is somewhat thick, but I was only the small tool for small amounts of hair. But I suppose it performed at least as well as expected for the price it cost.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. My stepdaughter was amazed by it and how much easier it is to do certain hairstyles now lol</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t always use these to for hair twists but rather they are used daily for parting! They are perfect!</li>
            <li> works well. I have had it for over a year with no problems.</li>
            <li> The best tool ever to help you do so many different things with your hair without having to use so many bobby pins or clips.</li>
            <li> These are very tiny and flimsy. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. You get what you pay do I guess.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product that allows me to create intricate hairstyles that are nearly impossible to do neatly by hand, and they are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Price was right.  I just wish there were some instructions other than the very small pics on the back of the package - I think there are many hairstyles that I&#x27;m not familiar with.</li>
            <li> We have searched high and low for these ponytail makers for our daughter. I was so glad to find them on here! They are exactly what she has been looking for. I was a little concerned after I had read some of the reviews  but they are great! They are holding up perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love using it on my little girl. Makes styling a lot easier. A must have for all mommies out there.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, just what I wanted, and the price was exactly what I was willing to pay to try these out. I was going to buy one made of hard plastic if these gave out, but I also knew to pull the pony tail holder outwards by about 3/4s of an inch to allow the hair top pass through, and they have not even threatened to snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product. I knew international doing would take a little longer, they emailed me as soon as I ordered to let me know it would arrive by the 31st that month, and it arrived on the 16th.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how to use it...poor instructions. If you know how to wear it will be fine. Or if you find the instructions</li>
            <li> Worked great, twice. Then it broke and that was that. I really should read things before I get excited about a low price. I&#x27;ll be buying American products from now on.</li>
