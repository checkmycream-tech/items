            <li> I think this product is great, and the price was okay.</li>
            <li> Really couldn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I paid over $350.00 for this product in a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  Amazon had it for a 4th of that cost and the exact&lt;br /&gt;product.  Takes 6-8 weeks to make a noticeable difference but this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Liking this product so far!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!!  Results are undeniable!</li>
            <li> It is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for lines!!!  And nice it is safe for pregnant women.  I love Revision products.  They are the best.</li>
            <li> After using this product for two month, I can see that the lines of my forehead are disappearing. Must have!!! product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the Pericone, Clarins, Clinique, Nia2, but this line of products my dermatologist recommended really works. I&#x27;m 52, and people I meet sometimes comment on my skin, I tell them what products I use and my age, they all think I was in my 30&#x27;s.Give the line a try, you wont be disappointed. You can find everything here at Amazon for half the cost of a doctors office. there&#x27;s only 6 products you really need, the cleanser, eye restorer, Revox 2, Hydrating , Vitamin C cream, and The skin shade/foundation.</li>
            <li> Bought it at the dr office but this is cheaper here... Well worth the money spent and can see the difference</li>
            <li> Reason being I give 3 stars is just that I need more time to see the result. However, there is slight improvement around eyes since I used this about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This is a new product ive been using. I like the results so far. Ive used it for about three weeks now and do notice an improvement.I will continue to use and see if i maintain my improvements</li>
            <li> Love all the Revision products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Very happy with Revision products.</li>
            <li> Save your money-too expensive for what it is!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a gel if you have not used it before.  You pat a small amount on any areas that have fine lines twice a day and let it soak in for a minute before applying moisturizer (I use Revision Restorative Night cream).  My fine lines seem less visible.  I am happy with it.</li>
