            <li>Makes coloring my hair very easy</li>
            <li>It makes the job of coloring my hair at home much more thorough.</li>
            <li>Works much better than any applicator bottle/brush that comes with drugstore hair color brands.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I found this.</li>
            <li>You should:)</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try these to help me color better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li>I love the bowl and getting THREE brushes instead of only one was a great buy for the price!!</li>
            <li>These brushes work a LOT better than using those pointed nozzle applicators.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than sallys and way better quality.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good quality</li>
            <li>Worked really well with all the colors we&#x27;ve been using them for!!! :) and FAST delivery!!</li>
            <li>The dye kit doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>The brushes are cheaply made but they work for me</li>
            <li>Gets the job done and you can&#x27;t beat the price, 1.79 on sale with free shipping?</li>
            <li>Makes coloring hair so much easier and much more accurate.</li>
            <li>I am stocked up and would highly recommend anyone looking for fast shipping and a good price to buy.</li>
            <li>My old brush bristles were coming out, this set works nicely.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Was able to color my hair on my own without missing spots.</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product</li>
            <li>and like I mentioned before you can reuse these if you wish to, so they are definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>bowl and brushes are so easy to clean even if I hold over the sink drain and only use water to clean.</li>
            <li>shipped really fast and is worth the money</li>
            <li>Larger than they appear I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>This product is really helpful in term of mixing and applying the products nicely with a minimum mess.</li>
            <li>Very well made brushes and bowl.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff enough to brush through your hair while applying, which is great for even coverage.</li>
            <li>This was alot better than I expected!</li>
            <li>You can clean them and reuse them if you like, which I have done a few times, but now I just throw them away and just clean out the bowl.</li>
            <li>I can do a better job than the box dyes now, especially in the back.</li>
            <li>The long handle helps you part your hair, and the brush helps you get the dye in the right place!</li>
            <li>Since you can safely save un-mixed Naturtint hair color, (my preference) the low cost of this item is quickly replenished by avoiding the necessity of disposing left-over color due to short hair or combining colors.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any except for 1 other bowl and getting this set was a fabulous find.  </li>
            <li>Helps me reach those hard to get spots and a more even color.</li>
            <li>It also arrived early.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product, i officially can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Professional wisdom behind this product is now available for home use!</li>
            <li>This little set is exactly what I needed.</li>

            <li> This little set is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I would have expected one smaller version of the brush.</li>
            <li> and I can tell I&#x27;ll be using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the size of the brush and the bowl, was expecting it to be small.</li>
            <li> Other things like a three pack set of brushes was the same amount for less</li>
            <li> These were just as expected.</li>
            <li> It worked well in catering to my endless hair color changes and what not.</li>
            <li> The bowl holds a lot of color, and with my hair being long I usually have to use two applications.</li>
            <li> I do my hair all the time and this kit has never let me down</li>
            <li> Brushes applied color evenly and I used a lot less product than just squeezing the color onto my hair.</li>
            <li> Brushes are a lil stiff.</li>
            <li> The application brushes are stiff, making  it easier to get the product from the bowl into my hair.</li>
            <li> The bowls are small, but I combine product from 2 boxes of Naturtint to get the color I want.</li>
            <li> Still in use, for price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

            <li> since I can&#x27;t afford to pay someone to color my hair I thought I&#x27;d try these to help me color better.  Helps me reach those hard to get spots and a more even color.</li>

            <li> Good product for the price for sure.</li>
            <li> Bought this to bleach and dye my hair. Came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Makes coloring my hair very easy</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping. Very pleased!</li>

            <li> This little set is exactly what I needed. The price for what you receive is beyond wonderful. Would definitely buy from this seller again I recieved my item faster than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I love this! I usually do my own hair in between going to the salon, like touching up the roots, and this is perfect for that. I purchased it a while ago, but just got around to using it last night. The bristles are stiff enough to brush through your hair while applying, which is great for even coverage. The bowl holds a lot of color, and with my hair being long I usually have to use two applications. This bowl allowed me to mix all my color in one! I would definitely recommend this product, i officially can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I am a student stylist. And i am happy with what i got works great</li>
            <li> This good for use of dye hair</li>
            <li> It worked well in catering to my endless hair color changes and what not. I am completely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Love it. Was able to color my hair on my own without missing spots. Brushes are great!</li>
