            <li>Now I have a perfect sharpener.</li>
            <li>This is the very best pencil sharpener I have ever used.</li>
            <li>For all of you gals out there looking for the perfect sharpener, this one is it!!!!</li>
            <li>How great is that?!!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>These are the best cosmetic pencil sharpeners I&#x27;ve seen yet</li>
            <li>great tool.</li>
            <li>what makes it great?</li>
            <li>I used to have a great sharpener for eye brow pencils and eye liner pencils</li>
            <li>I thought this was an awesome sharpener before, but now it&#x27;s even more awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is a good one.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than the cheapie plastic ones I had before!</li>
            <li>Anyone that uses pencils of any kind whether for drawing or makeup needs one of these.</li>
            <li>By far the best I&#x27;ve used, and I didn&#x27;t have to adjust the screw to get a nice point without tearing up the pencil (but it&#x27;s nice to know I can adjust it if I need to).</li>
            <li>It is far and away the best sharpener ever.</li>
            <li>Love the sharpener it performs well.</li>
            <li>simply the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is better than some sharpeners I have had</li>
            <li>My favorite sharpener.</li>
            <li>The added bonus here is that it comes with two different size sharpeners and they both work great!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s even more awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: After using this wonderful sharpener for about a year, I discovered that the little screw on top of the blade will adjust the blade to adjust the sharpening to the way you want.</li>
            <li>it probably just needs a simple tightening or loosening of the screw to make it sharpen beautifully.</li>
            <li>It keeps my eyeliners sharpened to a fine point.</li>
            <li>precisely what a sharpener is supposed to do!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: SHARPENER IS STILL WORKING GREAT after 4 years + of continuous daily use.</li>
            <li>: SHARPENER IS STILL WORKING GREAT after 4 years + of continuous daily use.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this from Sally</li>
            <li>With great care I can achieve a small blunt tip but not a pointed one.  </li>
            <li>The quality seems good and the style is nice, but unfortunately I cannot use the product.</li>
            <li>I have heard others say the same thing and have even heard many blame it on the makeup pencils.  </li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s probably because it does such a fine job making the very top of the pencil sharp...</li>
            <li>My sister really loves this</li>
            <li>It came from Maybeline and I tried to find it again to replace it but, sadly, they don&#x27;t make that kind any more.</li>
            <li>After reading the previous review I was looking forward to finally getting a sharpener that would not break off or swallow my makeup pencil tips but would leave them nicely pointed and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>Neither side fits a normal size eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li>I bought a number of sharpeners for my eyeliner pencils and this is &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34;  I plan to get a few more of them, to keep in my travel bag and purse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using plastic ones in the mean time but those chew up your pencils and this handy tool will not.</li>
            <li>The first sharpener that actually works!</li>
            <li>It sharpens all of my makeup pencils (eye brow, eye liner, and lip pencils) to a nice sharp point and it doesn&#x27;t break off the tips or make my pencils smaller and smaller without sharpening.  </li>
            <li>This is the only makeup pencil sharpener that I will ever use again because it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bought numerous new sharpeners and they all seem to break my makeup pencils off at the tips or they just won&#x27;t sharpen anything.</li>
            <li>It is unbelievable, this one really works and sharpen the pencil to the pointed end, it is really happening!</li>
            <li>If I am not careful the tip breaks off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great tool. Stays sharp. I purchased two!</li>
            <li> Lost mine and this was a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have two, one for my lipliner so I bought one to use for my eye pencils.</li>
            <li> My sister really loves this</li>
            <li> The first sharpener that actually works! Had bought tens of sharpeners from every manufacturer and all of them just ruined every eye and lip pencil I every bought. Tens of dollars down the drain. It is unbelievable, this one really works and sharpen the pencil to the pointed end, it is really happening!</li>
            <li> I only use traditional sized pencils, so can&#x27;t speak to how it works for larger ones. It works so much better than the cheapie plastic ones I had before! It&#x27;s a must-have.</li>
            <li> Love the sharpener it performs well.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a pencil sharpener for my eye liner pencils that  doesn&#x27;t break the pencils . This one is a good one.</li>
            <li> simply the best.  very sharp and will last for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my local Sally&#x27;s ($2.99 and no shipping!) and it is perfect for my soft-tipped eyeliner. By far the best I&#x27;ve used, and I didn&#x27;t have to adjust the screw to get a nice point without tearing up the pencil (but it&#x27;s nice to know I can adjust it if I need to).</li>
            <li> Perfect makeup pencil sharpener. Multiple sizes. Extremely sturdy. Best sharpener I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a zillion pencil sharpeners- correction,  a zillion crappy sharpeners. Now I have a perfect sharpener. Anyone that uses pencils of any kind whether for drawing or makeup needs one of these.</li>
            <li> After reading the previous review I was looking forward to finally getting a sharpener that would not break off or swallow my makeup pencil tips but would leave them nicely pointed and ready to use.  Not so.  With great care I can achieve a small blunt tip but not a pointed one.  If I am not careful the tip breaks off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better than some sharpeners I have had but it is not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Neither side fits a normal size eyeliner pencil. The quality seems good and the style is nice, but unfortunately I cannot use the product.</li>
            <li> I bought a number of sharpeners for my eyeliner pencils and this is &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34;  I plan to get a few more of them, to keep in my travel bag and purse.</li>
            <li> My favorite sharpener. I would be lost without it. It keeps my eyeliners sharpened to a fine point.</li>
            <li> This is the very best pencil sharpener I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I discovered this sharpener serendipitously just lying at the bottom of a shelf at my pharmacy, then couldn&#x27;t find it again instore. It is far and away the best sharpener ever. I suppose the fact that it&#x27;s made in Germany would account for that, given their notorious precision with everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what makes it great? It sharpens your makeup pencils to a point... yes, a point! And it doesn&#x27;t eat up the pencil as it sharpens. (That&#x27;s probably because it does such a fine job making the very top of the pencil sharp... precisely what a sharpener is supposed to do!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to everyone who has been frustrated with all the poorly-functioning pencil sharpeners commonly available. btw it has a larger opening on the other side for thicker pencils.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from Sally and I have to say it&#x27;s A M A Z I N G it&#x27;s lasted me years and I finally lost it in my last move so I do need to order another one. I&#x27;ve been using plastic ones in the mean time but those chew up your pencils and this handy tool will not. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I used to have a great sharpener for eye brow pencils and eye liner pencils but I lost it.  It came from Maybeline and I tried to find it again to replace it but, sadly, they don&#x27;t make that kind any more. I have bought numerous new sharpeners and they all seem to break my makeup pencils off at the tips or they just won&#x27;t sharpen anything. I keep sharpening and it just keeps making my makeup pencil get smaller and smaller without sharpening it.  I have heard others say the same thing and have even heard many blame it on the makeup pencils.  Well, guess what? It&#x27;s not the makeup pencils, it&#x27;s the sharpeners!! This sharpener works like the one I used to have. It sharpens all of my makeup pencils (eye brow, eye liner, and lip pencils) to a nice sharp point and it doesn&#x27;t break off the tips or make my pencils smaller and smaller without sharpening.  The added bonus here is that it comes with two different size sharpeners and they both work great! For all of you gals out there looking for the perfect sharpener, this one is it!!!! I love it and I have tossed out all of my other &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; sharpeners.  This is the only makeup pencil sharpener that I will ever use again because it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/04/2013 Up Date: After using this wonderful sharpener for about a year, I discovered that the little screw on top of the blade will adjust the blade to adjust the sharpening to the way you want. How great is that?!! I also discovered that the blade is replaceable if it ever dulls (which mine has not yet dulled at all using it every day for a year).  They should have put this info in the description. You only need a small phillips screw driver to adjust or replace the blade. If you should buy it and it doesn&#x27;t sharpen (which would totally surprise me, but sometimes screws do loosen from the item being jostled around) it probably just needs a simple tightening or loosening of the screw to make it sharpen beautifully. I thought this was an awesome sharpener before, but now it&#x27;s even more awesome.&lt;br /&gt;1/30/2017 Up Date: SHARPENER IS STILL WORKING GREAT after 4 years + of continuous daily use. AMAZING!!!t now it&#x27;s even more awesome.&lt;br /&gt;1/30/2017 Up Date: SHARPENER IS STILL WORKING GREAT after 4 years + of continuous daily use. AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best cosmetic pencil sharpeners I&#x27;ve seen yet and they sharpen both fat and skinny pencils.</li>
