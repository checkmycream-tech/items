    <ol>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>Really great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t cause itching and is amazingly hydrating!  </li>
            <li>I use it every morning, and it keeps my skin hydrated for a good 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still amazing, but if you &#x27;NEED&#x27; those aspects, this might be better for your legs and arms.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a lot of products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my face when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Great for dry/sensitive/combination skin, works very well under makeup as well.</li>
            <li>Been using this facial cream for awhile and its excellent after I shave.</li>
            <li>but I really love the face cream as well as the body lotion.</li>
            <li>This works okay as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s okay....?....</li>
            <li>What I was able to apply never had an impact either way on my problem areas.  </li>
            <li>This, plus my healthy diet &lt;smile&gt;, has made a world of difference.</li>
            <li>I just got more before it ran out.</li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased with this and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was amazed by how silky and light it was.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and this works well, isn&#x27;t too perfumed and is just shockingly good for the price.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Best thing ever for wintry dry skin (in New England).</li>
            <li>It feels light, but is strong enough for a winter moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good and natural hydration and moisture for dry sensitive skin! :)</li>
            <li>Shikai is the best for facial care for my sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>nice to have something natural and stays on my skin for a long time.  </li>
            <li>comes only a light moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I used to have dry itchy flaky sensitive skin, mostly along the hair line, temples and forehead.</li>
            <li>However, this probably won&#x27;t cut it for dry skin, since with the light texture</li>
            <li>They promptly sent me a new tube.  </li>
            <li>I might recommend this for oily or normal skin, but not dry skin in need of real, lasting hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth mentioning -</li>
            <li>I use it after I get out of the shower or wash my face and it has kept my skin soft and breakout-free.</li>
            <li>Contacted Shikai directly as package sez Satisfaction Guaranteed.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and have tried a plethora of creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>It was completely unsanitary without the seal and cap.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so it really does last a while.</li>
            <li>Maybe others have had success with this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it or any other product from herbspro.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this, as well as Shikai&#x27;s regular borage lotion for the body.</li>
            <li>I could barely keep it on my hand before it would run through my fingers and apply it.  </li>
            <li>I have redness and dry flakes around my nostrils and the center of my chin under right under my lip.  </li>
            <li>I live in Colorado where it&#x27;s really dry, plus I&#x27;m almost 60.  </li>
            <li>Use a *dry* sea sponge to gently buff off the micro-dry skin you can&#x27;t see, then cleanse your face in warm water, rinse in cold, then use this cream generously.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a new product for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty thin, so it spreads really well, and makes my face feel so silky and luxurious.</li>
            <li>It is thick, but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I especially like that it requires so little to moisturize my whole face and neck area after showering.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use a large amount, a little goes a long way, so a bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Helps my severely dry skin immensely.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other people who wrote the same reviews.</li>
            <li> I had used the regular skin moisturizer before but hadn&#x27;t tried their other products.</li>
            <li> These products keep my skin moisturizer and it no longer gets dry and flakey by day&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li> Shikai Products has done wonders for my dry skin, this product has help me out alot during the winter months</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the pump opening where the product actually comes out is teeny tiny, so you don&#x27;t waste product.</li>
            <li> I usually feel the need to re-apply within an hour or two because my skin starts to feel dry again after only that long.</li>
            <li> I can tell it really sinks in and</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and usually apply it only to the dry areas for daytime use.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount, so it lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I will not deal with this company again due to the way the product arrived.  </li>
            <li> I usually appreciate when products come in a pump, but this particular pump is hard to appreciate.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have used other over the counter skin care so</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but at $13 there isn&#x27;t much risk.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a week</li>
            <li> also doesn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; in a few hours, like some products.</li>
            <li> Obviously a bad batch as it was very runny.  </li>
            <li> Recommended to me in a small health food store.</li>
            <li> even surpassed it because it had less irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> How would I know it was bad if I didnt open it???  </li>
            <li> Works very well as a base for foundation and praise the Goddesses, NO scent!</li>
            <li> As for the reviews that are saying that the product is runny or has a watery consistency, you probably have a bad tube or it was watered it down or something?</li>
            <li> I may have just purchased this from the wrong seller, but I was not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no control, and the product (which is very thin) squirts outward and often in two directions at once.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best thing ever for wintry dry skin (in New England). Use a *dry* sea sponge to gently buff off the micro-dry skin you can&#x27;t see, then cleanse your face in warm water, rinse in cold, then use this cream generously. If your skin still has problems, put a humidifier in your bedroom...that should do the trick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I saw that it was compared to much more expensive facial moisturizers. I use it after I get out of the shower or wash my face and it has kept my skin soft and breakout-free. I will definitely purchase this again and also recommended it to my brother.</li>
            <li> I read about this moisturizer online, where it said it stacked up against a $185 moisturizer- even surpassed it because it had less irritating ingredients. I was skeptical, but at $13 there isn&#x27;t much risk. I figured if it didn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;d use it on my legs instead of my face. When it arrived, I was amazed by how silky and light it was. I hate greasy lotions, never use any on my hands, but this was great. It&#x27;s pretty thin, so it spreads really well, and makes my face feel so silky and luxurious. I can&#x27;t stop touching my face when I wear it. It feels light, but is strong enough for a winter moisturizer. I have fairly sensitive skin and this works well, isn&#x27;t too perfumed and is just shockingly good for the price. If it had wrinkle fighting or sunscreen, this product would be unbeatable. It&#x27;s still amazing, but if you &#x27;NEED&#x27; those aspects, this might be better for your legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product from Nutricity.  Obviously a bad batch as it was very runny.  Nutrcitiy said they could not return, replace as I had already opened the package.  How would I know it was bad if I didnt open it???  Contacted Shikai directly as package sez Satisfaction Guaranteed.  They promptly sent me a new tube.  I will make a point not to give Nutricity my business in the future.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Great for dry/sensitive/combination skin, works very well under makeup as well. As for the reviews that are saying that the product is runny or has a watery consistency, you probably have a bad tube or it was watered it down or something? It also hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out at all.</li>
            <li> Really great moisturizer. Helps my severely dry skin immensely. Works very well as a base for foundation and praise the Goddesses, NO scent!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer does not irritate my sensitive skin. It is thick, but absorbs quickly. Oddly enough it does not make my skin oilier than a lighter moisturizer. I have combination skin and usually apply it only to the dry areas for daytime use. You only need to use a small amount, so it lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and have tried a plethora of creams and lotions. This doesn&#x27;t cause itching and is amazingly hydrating!  I use it every morning, and it keeps my skin hydrated for a good 24 hours. I am VERY pleased with this and would highly recommend it! Good and natural hydration and moisture for dry sensitive skin! :)</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a new product for my very dry skin. I have eczema and I need a lot of moisture for my skin. This product just didn&#x27;t cut it. I prefer Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> This product arrived without a cap and no seal.  I didn&#x27;t know whether it had been tampered with.  It was completely unsanitary without the seal and cap.  The vendor gave me a refund.  I will not deal with this company again due to the way the product arrived.  They gave no explanation for the condition of the tube.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Lasts all day and it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> nice to have something natural and stays on my skin for a long time.  I only use shikai and will never use anything else</li>
            <li> Been using this facial cream for awhile and its excellent after I shave. Not oily or sticky..: I recommend Borage 24...</li>
            <li> Shikai is the best for facial care for my sensitive, dry skin.  I especially like that it requires so little to moisturize my whole face and neck area after showering.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked this product up on EWG&#x27;s skin deep to see how \\&quot;clean\\&quot; it is but I really love the face cream as well as the body lotion. Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Not greasy and works to soften imediatley.</li>
            <li> This works okay as a moisturizer. On the plus side, it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a lot of products. However, this probably won&#x27;t cut it for dry skin, since with the light texture comes only a light moisturizing effect. I usually feel the need to re-apply within an hour or two because my skin starts to feel dry again after only that long. I might recommend this for oily or normal skin, but not dry skin in need of real, lasting hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth mentioning - I usually appreciate when products come in a pump, but this particular pump is hard to appreciate. There&#x27;s no control, and the product (which is very thin) squirts outward and often in two directions at once. On the plus side, the pump opening where the product actually comes out is teeny tiny, so you don&#x27;t waste product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s okay....?....</li>
            <li> This product truly is like a drink for your skin. I use it under my eyes every day, and occasionally on the rest of my face, as needed. I can tell it really sinks in and also doesn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; in a few hours, like some products. I don&#x27;t need to use a large amount, a little goes a long way, so a bottle lasts a while. Also, there is no fragrance, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, as well as Shikai&#x27;s regular borage lotion for the body.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews.  I have redness and dry flakes around my nostrils and the center of my chin under right under my lip.  I may have just purchased this from the wrong seller, but I was not impressed at all.  The lotion was so runny I could barely keep it on my hand before it would run through my fingers and apply it.  What I was able to apply never had an impact either way on my problem areas.  Even if I shook it vigorously it would still just pour out of the bottle.  I did try requesting a return from herbspro, but that never amounted to anything.  I missed their one and only call to me.  I tried, in vain, to reach someone at the number they left on my voicemail, but no one ever answered and there was no option to leave a voicemail.  I tried several different times throughout the day for about a week and was unsuccessful.  Maybe others have had success with this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it or any other product from herbspro.</li>
            <li> Recommended to me in a small health food store. I used to have dry itchy flaky sensitive skin, mostly along the hair line, temples and forehead. This, plus my healthy diet &lt;smile&gt;, has made a world of difference. I moisturize once a day in the AM and it lasts all day. People are telling me my skin is glowing! I just got more before it ran out.</li>
            <li> Runny product. I should have listened to the other people who wrote the same reviews. The customer service can only tell me to shake the product? It is almost like water as if they have diluted the sample. The product does not come with a seal which makes me even weary to use it. I have used other over the counter skin care so even if it is not sealed, it looks like no one has touch it because it is compacted and not runny. I suggest don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while now. I am on my second tube. It doesn&#x27;t take much so it really does last a while. It works well on my face and isn&#x27;t greasy. I like it!</li>
            <li> I had used the regular skin moisturizer before but hadn&#x27;t tried their other products. Love them!  I live in Colorado where it&#x27;s really dry, plus I&#x27;m almost 60.  These products keep my skin moisturizer and it no longer gets dry and flakey by day&#x27;s end. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a week and so far so good. We&#x27;ll see if it lives up to the geat reviews it got!</li>
            <li> Shikai Products has done wonders for my dry skin, this product has help me out alot during the winter months</li>
