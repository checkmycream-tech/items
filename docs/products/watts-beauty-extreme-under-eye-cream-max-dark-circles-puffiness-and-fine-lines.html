            <li>THAT IS AWESOME.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a great addition to my life!</li>
            <li>Excellent delivery!</li>
            <li>All of watts products are great.</li>

            <li>There is a good supply in this package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cream</li>
            <li>I have noticed this cream is good for puffiness but not lines.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my eyes like very moisturizing but still looks perfect (not oily) under make up.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love Watts Beauty products!</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>I have always had kind of darkish circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It kind of runs in my eyes</li>
            <li>recommend giving this an honest try.</li>
            <li>I gave it more of a month of usage to be fair.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have seen quite a difference in my fine lines around my eyes!</li>
            <li>This product has worked better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>Thanks Watts for a great product.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for more than a week</li>
            <li>well... i don&#x27;t agree with many of these reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have been drinking more water too</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>Makes a wonderful eye cream, soaks in fast, very gentle and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than some cheap ones that I&#x27;ve tried, but Strivectin is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>Also, huge for me, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I wear it to bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found something that works at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I purchased.</li>
            <li>The cream is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Has a really light silky texture and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Watts has great products at pretty low prices.</li>
            <li>Quick results.</li>
            <li>Felt nice but left area greasy.</li>
            <li>but it feels really good and works well with the other Watts products.</li>
            <li>I believe I started seeing results within the end of the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for selling it!</li>
            <li>and I see positive changes in the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re consistent with it, it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>but they seemed to have pretty much reversed.</li>
            <li>but I want the sensitive and delicate skin under my eyes to look healthy and so far so good.</li>
            <li>use it 2,3 times a day and for more than 2 months and really I have notice any single change.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This eye cream was very oily as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very smiley person</li>
            <li>I like Watts products, but this really is just a cream.</li>
            <li>and I even have enough to smooth around my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>It does absolutely NOTHING aside hidrating the area.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell that it made any difference, and the ingredients in the product seem to be separating.</li>
            <li>It works very well with under eyes darkness</li>
            <li>Although my dark circles are still evident (I think that&#x27;s just hereditary), the eye area wrinkles are notably diminished.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use this without any stinging or burning , flaking or redness that I have had with other eye creams.</li>
            <li>It does leave an oily residue at first, which is later well absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>My dark circles have gotten so much better than they have been.</li>
            <li>When I add under eye concealer it blends so smoothly, does not appear dry and the concealer lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I bought products from Watts Beauty before and that was the main reason to have chosen Vanish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really does vanish and skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I use the really expensive stuff in the morning but this at night and it seems to be a great combination.</li>
            <li>This eye cream was too heavy and it didn&#x27;t appear to be able to penetrate into the skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>but it is worth using and does definite deminish puffiness, does work on the dark circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and will not continue to use this cream.</li>
            <li>My dark circles are getting better, you only have to use a grain of rice size amount twice  a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week and really like it.</li>
            <li>Not by far.</li>
            <li>Also this is very reasonably priced, so I would recommend this compared to other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are softening and the dark circles seem to be slightly lighter.</li>
            <li>My dark circles aren&#x27;t so noticable anymore, and it really reduced the puffiness under my eyes when my allergies are bothering me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help with dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li>Really works for dark circles and Discoloration.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really works for dark circles and Discoloration.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is not a magic product, and I am mainly using it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It lasts long.</li>
            <li> This reduces it when it is a little bad and makes is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the most expensive to the least and haven&#x27;t found a product that works including this one.</li>
            <li> I have only been using a few weeks and have noticed some results.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not much area to cover under your eye.</li>
            <li> Since this cream is so heavy, not suggested to use during day if you wear eye makeup, it causes everything, including mascara to smear (especially since it contains oil).</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a few days and it allready seems to be working.</li>
            <li> so it end up bleeding into my eye and irritating it without having any positive impact on my dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll give it until the container is empty!</li>
            <li> I bought this Extreme Under Eye Cream for a friend for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I like other watts products but unfornately this one just didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> I ended up using this to moisturize dry spots on my skin--that&#x27;s how heavy it is.</li>
            <li> I felt it made a difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say on average</li>
            <li> I bought that eye cream because I&#x27;ve got dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> This cream did nothing to minimize puffing or dark cycles--it quite literally just sat on the surface of my skin</li>
            <li> This product does not work on my hereditary dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Slight irritation.</li>
            <li> Not sure if you can buy it on any other sites.</li>
            <li> This product says it contains the same stuff that other expensive brands contain.</li>
            <li> I find that if I run out and don&#x27;t use it for a couple weeks or slack off, am I&#x27;m going to bed late, the dark circles start to reappear.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see the dramatic changes on my dark circles, as delivered by other brightening lotions...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect to wake up and look 20 (since I&#x27;m way past that)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take but a small tap on the product to get what you need</li>
            <li> so I was getting lines like crazy in the last few years.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I purchased this product because I have dark circles and always look tired.</li>
            <li> I go to bed late on a routine basis</li>
            <li> Does not fix it when I am really having the worst black eye thing going on, but usually helps somewhat.</li>
            <li> You use a very small amount</li>
            <li> so tired&#x27;....</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye cream for approximately one month.  </li>
            <li> it had a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I have that real bad puffy black eye thing going on.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using this product and very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I purchased this product because I have dark circles and always look tired. I&#x27;ve tried the most expensive to the least and haven&#x27;t found a product that works including this one.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. I felt it made a difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is another Watts Beauty product that I bought and didn&#x27;t work for me. This eye cream was very oily as well so it end up bleeding into my eye and irritating it without having any positive impact on my dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have only been using a few weeks and have noticed some results. My fine lines are softening and the dark circles seem to be slightly lighter. The cream is light and absorbs quickly. I can use it under makeup and it does not cause my makeup to smear or crease. I also have very sensitive eyes.I am able to use this without any stinging or burning , flaking or redness that I have had with other eye creams. There is a good supply in this package. You use a very small amount and I can see this lasting a year or so even being used twice a day. Also this is very reasonably priced, so I would recommend this compared to other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any noticable effects yet...but it feels really good and works well with the other Watts products. It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks so I&#x27;ll give it until the container is empty! I&#x27;m hopeful!</li>
            <li> I love this product! My dark circles aren&#x27;t so noticable anymore, and it really reduced the puffiness under my eyes when my allergies are bothering me.</li>
            <li> i used it and i didnt saw any changes. it left me my face greasy and glowing. it had a weird smell.</li>
            <li> This product has worked better than anything else I have tried. All of watts products are great. I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> I used to have people telling me &#x27;oh you look so tired&#x27;....but after using this I stopped hearing that. THAT IS AWESOME. I have always had kind of darkish circles under my eyes. I started using this just before bed, and that&#x27;s it. I use it every night. I find that if I run out and don&#x27;t use it for a couple weeks or slack off, am I&#x27;m going to bed late, the dark circles start to reappear. So if you&#x27;re consistent with it, it seems to work really well. I go to bed late on a routine basis and it&#x27;s been a great addition to my life! I get it on Amazon for a great price. Not sure if you can buy it on any other sites. I haven&#x27;t checked. I believe I started seeing results within the end of the first 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably a year and a half.  A jar lasts me around 4 months I&#x27;d say on average (I&#x27;m guessing there). It lasts long. A little goes a long way. Think about it...there&#x27;s not much area to cover under your eye. I even use it on the outer corner of my eyes since I was developing crows feet and I never paid attention to it but they seemed to have pretty much reversed. I&#x27;m a very smiley person so I was getting lines like crazy in the last few years. It&#x27;s better to give this a shot than expensive products out there. This product says it contains the same stuff that other expensive brands contain. Thanks Watts for a great product. Thanks Amazon for selling it!</li>
            <li> Felt nice but left area greasy. Didn&#x27;t really help with dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week and really like it. Has a really light silky texture and absorbs quickly.  It already seems to be improving my under eye circles.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found something that works at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I have that real bad puffy black eye thing going on.  This reduces it when it is a little bad and makes is good. Does not fix it when I am really having the worst black eye thing going on, but usually helps somewhat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of eye creams, but none has worked as well as this one!  Although my dark circles are still evident (I think that&#x27;s just hereditary), the eye area wrinkles are notably diminished.  Love this.</li>
            <li> It kind of runs in my eyes and I can not tell a big difference. It&#x27;s better than some cheap ones that I&#x27;ve tried, but Strivectin is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been using it at night. It does leave an oily residue at first, which is later well absorbed by the skin. I have yet to see the dramatic changes on my dark circles, as delivered by other brightening lotions... In my opinion, it is not a magic product, and I am mainly using it as a moisturizer. Excellent delivery!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for more than a week and I see positive changes in the skin under my eyes. I don&#x27;t expect to wake up and look 20 (since I&#x27;m way past that) but I want the sensitive and delicate skin under my eyes to look healthy and so far so good. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this Extreme Under Eye Cream for a friend for Christmas. She&#x27;s been using it and says she likes it enough to buy a second tub. Watts has great products at pretty low prices.</li>
            <li> Makes a wonderful eye cream, soaks in fast, very gentle and non greasy. Really does vanish and skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I bought that eye cream because I&#x27;ve got dark circles and puffiness. I bought products from Watts Beauty before and that was the main reason to have chosen Vanish.&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2,3 times a day and for more than 2 months and really I have notice any single change.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not buying it again!</li>
            <li> This eye cream was too heavy and it didn&#x27;t appear to be able to penetrate into the skin around the eyes. This cream did nothing to minimize puffing or dark cycles--it quite literally just sat on the surface of my skin (yes, i applied it the way it is suppose to be applied with dabbing motions etc). The oil and cream quite often separate in the formula. I like other watts products but unfornately this one just didnt work for me. Since this cream is so heavy, not suggested to use during day if you wear eye makeup, it causes everything, including mascara to smear (especially since it contains oil). I ended up using this to moisturize dry spots on my skin--that&#x27;s how heavy it is.</li>
            <li> does do what it says.</li>
            <li> It actually works!! My dark circles are getting better, you only have to use a grain of rice size amount twice  a day. It feels great on my eyes like very moisturizing but still looks perfect (not oily) under make up. Also, huge for me, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I wear it to bed. A lot of eye creams (even the most expensive) make me wake up with irritated, puffy, itchy, red, swollen eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye cream for approximately one month.  I am very pleased, it is so moisturizing, unlike anything I have tried in years!  When I add under eye concealer it blends so smoothly, does not appear dry and the concealer lasts all day.  I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> well... i don&#x27;t agree with many of these reviews.  I used this product religiously.  It did not help.  I like Watts products, but this really is just a cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100% but it is worth using and does definite deminish puffiness, does work on the dark circles and fine lines. Doesn&#x27;t take but a small tap on the product to get what you need and I even have enough to smooth around my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend giving this an honest try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cream but I prefer serums over creams as they penetrate the skin faster and don&#x27;t clog pores. I have noticed this cream is good for puffiness but not lines.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, though I found it to be greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb well before I went to bed and I definitely can&#x27;t use under makeup.</li>
            <li> Really works for dark circles and Discoloration.  Quick results.</li>
            <li> This product does not work on my hereditary dark circles. I gave it more of a month of usage to be fair. It does absolutely NOTHING aside hidrating the area. It you are like me and hope still to find the silver bulet ...this is not it. Not by far.</li>
            <li> My dark circles have gotten so much better than they have been. I have been drinking more water too so that is probably part of it but this have saved me money. I use the really expensive stuff in the morning but this at night and it seems to be a great combination. Love Watts Beauty products!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I purchased. I used it religiously for 2 months and no results. Would always look like I had a ton of grease under my eyes. I stopped using this product and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a few days and it allready seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had time to fully evaluate</li>
            <li> No noticable change. Slight irritation. I have very sensitive skin and will not continue to use this cream.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy this again. I can&#x27;t really tell that it made any difference, and the ingredients in the product seem to be separating.</li>
            <li> I love these products. This is my 2nd jar &amp; I compare it to Hydroxatone . It works very well with under eyes darkness &amp; I have seen quite a difference in my fine lines around my eyes!</li>
