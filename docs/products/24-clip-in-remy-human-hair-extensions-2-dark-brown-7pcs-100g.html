            <li>Love them looks like my hair exactly can&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(yes I do admit I did end up replacing the clips eventually with my own clips I already had and glueing the hair peices around on top of others, to double them up)...</li>
            <li>I paid $180 for (which so far are still looking great for being 1 year old and worn almost every day).</li>
            <li>But other than that I love them!!</li>
            <li>but if you just have a few special nights out its great.</li>
            <li>They are fun</li>
            <li>The reason I bought these is to get some more length since my natural hair is already a 18 inches</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many extensions in the last few years, and these are a great amount, quality, durability and</li>

            <li>but the quality isn&#x27;t very well.</li>
            <li>The clips latch on to your hair really snug</li>

            <li>The brown is more like a reddish tint and not really good quality hair.</li>
            <li>Ok as for the extensions they look and feel natural tho you are gonna need 2 sets because they are really thin.</li>
            <li>the hair is too thin to thick hair advise not to buy, you must be more grams, and the quality is bad because the hair falls too because for me it was not one excellent purchase.</li>
            <li>Good quality bad listing.</li>

            <li> Clips are to loose on each peace!</li>
            <li> Well, I would not recommend it unless you wear them only to go out dancing once in a while, but for every day wear it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Thinner than i expected.</li>
            <li> delivered quicker than expected!</li>

            <li> Thin but was still nice</li>
            <li> I have ethnic B3 curls and i straightened my hair to put them in and they were pretty great. They aren&#x27;t the best quality because they shed a lot and get raddy really easily but for its price it did the job. They take a long time to arrive so be patient because i definitely was not.if you want something to last i suggest you invest more get something of better quality but if you just have a few special nights out its great.</li>
            <li> Nice and very soft there thin but you get what you pay for and I suggest you get them I love themm😍</li>
            <li> I was for the most part pleased with my new hair!! It said it was a #2 dark brown and it wasn&#x27;t! It was more like a level 3 or 4, so I had to dye them before I could wear them! But other than that I love them!! Good quality hair.</li>
            <li> They are easy to work with. I use them almost everyday. Easy to take in and out. Easy to keep clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, hair did not come with clips and is very thin.</li>
            <li> They looked like real hair very satisfied</li>
            <li> Did not come separated, or even with clips. Its just a long strand of hair.</li>
            <li> They were gud quality!!!!!:))))))))&lt;br /&gt;The extention looked so real that Im planning to order more in the future so happy with everything</li>
            <li> Worst extentions ever.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t 7 pieces, it was a full row with no clips and the length of the extensions when placed under hair wasn&#x27;t 24&amp;#34; and the ends were extremely thin</li>
            <li> Very disappointed didn&#x27;t get the right product really expect a seven piece clip in extensions and got a piece of sew in hair be careful</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s human hair but I got a big bag of plastic fake hair.You can&#x27;t color or curl.So unhappy</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really thin didn&#x27;t like them at all</li>
            <li> There not even dark drown , there not even 24 inches . I know u might no care of my opinion but please dont buy them... i begg u ..</li>
            <li> Good quality bad listing. In the listing it says clip in 7pcs but when it was delivered it did not have the clips on them. It also was just one piece and so I have to cut them and sow on the clips.</li>
            <li> I like that they are long but the quality isn&#x27;t very well. They are frizzy and thin. If somebody were to order these I&#x27;d order 2 or 3 sets because of the thiness.</li>
            <li> These extensions are extremely thin and not worth your money. They spent over a month to get here, and now it&#x27;ll take another month to return them and get my money back. Not even two sets of these would cover an entire head.</li>
            <li> Clips are to loose on each peace! not very happy at all. I need them right away and paid for next day and know sending back!</li>
            <li> Ordered this and it is okay. For the price I should have known that it won&#x27;t be the best quality. The brown is more like a reddish tint and not really good quality hair. I had to tone it down because it was so reddish in color. They are fun but I would probably not re-order them. I have had them maybe 3 weeks now and they are already starting to look fried compared to my Remy hairextentions I paid $180 for (which so far are still looking great for being 1 year old and worn almost every day). The reason I bought these is to get some more length since my natural hair is already a 18 inches and I only use hair extension to create volume faster. Well, I would not recommend it unless you wear them only to go out dancing once in a while, but for every day wear it is a waste of money. They are also very very thing not like a double weave so in order to get volume you would have to purchase 2 packs and your head would be nothing but clips. Buy higher end brand- it will pay off in the long run.</li>
            <li> Hair was sent in one long strip no clips. I was very disappointed. Ends of hair are really thin. I wont be reordering again.</li>
            <li> had a problem with first delivery but customer service did an amazing job they refunded my money and I ordered another set of remy 24&amp;#34; extensions and customer service paid the shipping and paid for it to be here the next day. Ok as for the extensions they look and feel natural tho you are gonna need 2 sets because they are really thin. I have worn the extensions 3 days now and noticed that they do shed. Also they need brushed often because the clump together and looks dirty. All in all I am happy with these extensions. I sprayed with heat protector and curled them tho they do not hold a tight curl you end up with natural looking waves. The clips latch on to your hair really snug I didnt have to back comb to  get them to stay in place. Def. Worth the money. So I recommend these extensions</li>
            <li> Love them looks like my hair exactly can&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;My friends all want then!&lt;br /&gt;Best extensions ever.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time!</li>
            <li> These extensions were so thin. They did not meet my expectations. Terrible. And they took so long to get to my house.</li>
            <li> Great quality!  delivered quicker than expected!</li>
            <li> Very thin huge rip off</li>
            <li> Thinner than i expected. If you buy two- you will be very happy. I bought a 24 and a 22 and i put all 14 clips in at once and they are fantastic looking.</li>
            <li> the hair is too thin to thick hair advise not to buy, you must be more grams, and the quality is bad because the hair falls too because for me it was not one excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many extensions in the last few years, and these are a great amount, quality, durability and (yes I do admit I did end up replacing the clips eventually with my own clips I already had and glueing the hair peices around on top of others, to double them up)... They are beautiful for the price! And they hold up well! You don&#x27;t need to replace the clips, I just happened to have them. I would get a second set just for those of you that want the extra volume... But these are beautiful!</li>
            <li> They say clip ins but there were no clips with them when I got them. It wasn&#x27;t as much hair as it said it would be and the color was way off. I do not reccomend this. I ended just going to Sallys and paying full price for better quality hair in the right color.</li>
            <li> Im very upset with my order. Mine will not curl or anything. Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> These extensions are wonderful. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on them. If you are hesitating to buy them don&#x27;t hold out on yourself. When I put them in I was thrilled that I had bought them. Very short shipping time for coming from China. Love them.</li>
