            <li>I&#x27;ll give props to AVON for making this awesome product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Greatest product out there.</li>
            <li>but it did work to make face perfect</li>
            <li>Very happy with product, price and delivery!</li>
            <li>But every sun block I used was greasy and ruined my foundation and every make-up primer made the foundation look good but didn&#x27;t even HAVE sunblock!  </li>
            <li>All these years, those women going door to door realized they had some great products.</li>
            <li>This is great as primer for the price.</li>
            <li>The mattifying power was so-so, but the velvety effects were very nice.</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks always Avon for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Yes, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many (MANY) primers and none come even close to Avon&#x27;s MagiX.</li>
            <li>If you want to go without foundation, especially on a hot day, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It makes the makeup look so much better</li>
            <li>and I look so much better when just working around the house.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many, many compliments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for Years and just love it.  </li>
            <li>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh:)  </li>
            <li>It has the added benefit of SPF which makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I like this product better in the winter than summer.</li>
            <li>It seemed to make my face more oily.</li>
            <li>I think it is better to look at this as a \\&quot;perfecting\\&quot; product and apply it OVER a good sunblock (that provides broad spectrum  protection).  </li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be much smaller, i&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>You have to reapply every two hours or so in order to remain shine free.   </li>
            <li>It goes on and makes my skin feel smooth like velvet.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at smoothing out imperfections such as wrinkles,</li>
            <li>This primer goes on smooth and matte, velvety powdery texture.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to put any makeup on, just my Face Pefector will do, it goes silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great primer especially for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the best primer for my skin type (combination skin) in my opinion, but it does work very well for a simple primer if you&#x27;re not looking for anything too fancy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really bother me though because this product does such a great job that I can forgive the smell.</li>
            <li>and I love how soft it makes your skin</li>
            <li>It also helps to keep make-up fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>BUT, it does what it says, it goes smoothly, it is an invisible gel AND leaves your skin completely matte.</li>
            <li>If you want flawless matte skin WHILE protecting it from the sun, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this when it first came out</li>
            <li>At home I just apply my face cream first then put some of this on.</li>
            <li>I found out that it works really well under mineral foundation</li>
            <li>Not only does it smooth out imperfections, it makes it easier to fill in places that need a bit of concealer.</li>
            <li>I normally use MAC, Nars, and Yves Saint Laurent and didn&#x27;t really have any reason to try Avon.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>This goes on clear and keeps me matte and has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, and i was surprised by the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and makes it look prettier.</li>
            <li>It is matte and gives a wonderful base for you to apply your makeup on.</li>
            <li>My skin was getting a little drier because the seasons are changing, and this product made the flaky skin very white and easily noticeable.</li>

            <li> but I think it gives a little bit of a wash out effect.</li>
            <li> I mix a little of it with my makeup cream in the palm of my hand then spread it on.</li>
            <li> A little blush and a little lipstick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually put it on before my foundation as it is hard to spread.</li>
            <li> it blurs my hyperpigmentation which is difficult to cover up so this helps with that also keeping my make up on longer</li>

            <li> Love this stuff. Smooths out any skin imperfections. It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> You have to reapply every two hours or so in order to remain shine free.   BUT, it does what it says, it goes smoothly, it is an invisible gel AND leaves your skin completely matte. NOTICE that this is NOT a broad spectrum protection and thus DO NOT use this product as your ultimate and only sunblock. I think it is better to look at this as a \\&quot;perfecting\\&quot; product and apply it OVER a good sunblock (that provides broad spectrum  protection).  For the price, I think this is a bargain and thus I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product does actually work for my skin! It goes on and makes my skin feel smooth like velvet. I have acne-prone, oily skin and it did not break me out. The mattifying power was so-so, but the velvety effects were very nice. However, it does enhance dry, flaky skin. My skin was getting a little drier because the seasons are changing, and this product made the flaky skin very white and easily noticeable. I used moisturizer to cover it up. Overall, I would use it again--just not when the seasons are changing. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you want flawless matte skin WHILE protecting it from the sun, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I normally use MAC, Nars, and Yves Saint Laurent and didn&#x27;t really have any reason to try Avon. But every sun block I used was greasy and ruined my foundation and every make-up primer made the foundation look good but didn&#x27;t even HAVE sunblock!  This stuff is amazing. At 5.99, I buy three at a time, and wear it every day under my make-up. It erases shine, makes pores invisible, and keeps you from premature aging.  All these years, those women going door to door realized they had some great products. Who knew?!!</li>
            <li> I bought this when it first came out and I love how soft it makes your skin but I think it gives a little bit of a wash out effect. I found out that it works really well under mineral foundation and you can use less of it by only using the step 2 brush.</li>
            <li> This is great as primer for the price. It arrived on time, and i was surprised by the size of the bottle. I thought it was going to be much smaller, i&#x27;m very pleased!

It does a great job at smoothing out imperfections such as wrinkles,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many (MANY) primers and none come even close to Avon&#x27;s MagiX. This one reduces shine, evens out skin tone AND provides SPF! If you want to go without foundation, especially on a hot day, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years.  I don&#x27;t usually put it on before my foundation as it is hard to spread. I mix a little of it with my makeup cream in the palm of my hand then spread it on. It makes the makeup look so much better and I&#x27;m getting SPF.  At home I just apply my face cream first then put some of this on. A little blush and a little lipstick and I look so much better when just working around the house.</li>
            <li> This primer goes on smooth and matte, velvety powdery texture. I love it. it blurs my hyperpigmentation which is difficult to cover up so this helps with that also keeping my make up on longer</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years now.  I use it as a primer under my make-up and it helps to control oil and make my pores look smaller.  It also helps to keep make-up fresh looking.  And, the sunscreen is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Thanks always Avon for this wonderful product. I&#x27;ve been using MagiX ever since it came out. Not only does it smooth out imperfections, it makes it easier to fill in places that need a bit of concealer. Then you can put your blush and face powder over it. I use it every day. It makes my skin feel so soft and makes it look prettier. Try it! I bet you will like it! I&#x27;ve received many, many compliments. You will too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for Years and just love it.  I ordered my Face Perfector on Amazon now because they are way cheaper than the AVON site.  Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh:)  I just can&#x27;t live without this product.  I&#x27;ll give props to AVON for making this awesome product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m in a hurry I don&#x27;t need to put any makeup on, just my Face Pefector will do, it goes silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dottie McKown&lt;br /&gt;Miami, FL</li>
            <li> Greatest product out there. For someone with acne still in their 30&#x27;s, I have to be very careful what products I put on my face. This goes on clear and keeps me matte and has sunscreen in it. The perfect base for powder foundation!!</li>
            <li> CAUSES IRRATIATION AND BREAKOUTS</li>
            <li> This is a great primer especially for those with oily skin. It is matte and gives a wonderful base for you to apply your makeup on. It has the added benefit of SPF which makes it even better. Controls shine for hours and helps keep your makeup in place. It does have a perfumey smell but it goes away after a bit. If you aren&#x27;t a fan of fragrances you might not care for this product. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me though because this product does such a great job that I can forgive the smell.</li>
            <li> my sister in law applied make up on me for a Halloween party&lt;br /&gt;she used this on me and I loved it&lt;br /&gt;it smoothed out all my imperfections on my face&lt;br /&gt;I normally do not wear ANY foundation at all&lt;br /&gt;so I purchased it&lt;br /&gt;well since the 3x that I used it since then, my forehead is now starting to break out&lt;br /&gt;maybe its from the product&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used since but it did work to make face perfect</li>
            <li> Very happy with product, price and delivery!</li>
            <li> I like this product better in the winter than summer. It seemed to make my face more oily.</li>
