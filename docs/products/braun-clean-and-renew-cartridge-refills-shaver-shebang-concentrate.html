            <li>Works just fine in the shaver that I own.</li>
            <li>What a shame; I really liked the smooth shaving.  </li>
            <li>Producers decided to &amp;#34;cut corners&amp;#34; - most of it is water, not an alcohol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and more Eco-friendly than the brain refill cartridges.  </li>

            <li>Keeping it in top shape is of the utmost importance to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shaver Shebang is better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>Shaver Shebang is better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>OK, I thought.</li>
            <li>I was better off using water.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper and there are more fragrances, too.</li>
            <li>The refill solution is as advertised, and actually smells very good.  </li>
            <li>Wish i found this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good thanks.</li>
            <li>The shave is also better when using the original braun refills.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing, thus far just as good</li>
            <li>that I can afford regular cleanings, the razor always smells great</li>
            <li>A smooth, close shave with no snags is extremely important to me.  </li>
            <li>I was too cheap to clean as often as I should</li>
            <li>Sure beats spending a fortune on new cartridges all the time to say nothing of being more land fill friendly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed in the price</li>
            <li>and hes not disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li>I also like how it cleans just as well as the Braun original.</li>
            <li>Well it didn&#x27;t do either because i dumped it out and had to buy the original cartridges again.  </li>
            <li>I clean out the shaver every time I&#x27;m done using it and have never had any problems with the original braun cartridges.</li>
            <li>It does the job of keeping my razor clean.  </li>
            <li>and I had to blow canned air through it to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>Now it doesn&#x27;t clean my razor.  </li>
            <li>The razor came out clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instructions were clean on how to clean existing cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see they are now selling the liquid cleaner in bulk to refill a cartridge rather than filling the landfill with so much plastic.</li>
            <li>So much more reasonable than buying the cartridges and works just as well.  </li>
            <li>What I did mind was that my shaver was gunky and I didn&#x27;t get the same good shave that I was getting before I started to use this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The problem ws masked by how quickly the Braun liquid evaporates and the thinness of the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;The problem was that my shaver wasn&#x27;t completely clean after a cycle and there was some leakage during cleaning .  </li>
            <li>Okay product however it does not clean no where as good as the Braun official cartridge solution.</li>
            <li>The Braun name brand fluid contains more alcohol and therefore evaporates much better.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited when I found this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use too, just clean your old cartridge with water and add the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rinsed out the Braun cartridge, filled it 3/4 full with this product and it smelled good for the first few days.  </li>
            <li>I rarely post a review on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The residue this product leaves behind is a perfect film to bind up all the hair your razor cuts off.</li>
            <li>When it came time to change the original Braun cartridge, I was excited to see if the new cleaning solution would work as well.  </li>
            <li>Thought this was better than the actual Braun Clean &amp; Renew Solution.</li>
            <li>As much as you flush with water and try to clean, they just don&#x27;t get that clean and ready for new solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They should have thought of refills first.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>First bought this item to save money, they are doing that.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have the exact same feel on your skin, but work just fine.</li>
            <li>Thing is, when an engineer design a product, it is to meet certain requirements.</li>
            <li>A great economical solution to expensive</li>
            <li>The added moisturizers in the product makes his shave much smoother too.</li>
            <li>I didn’t do much research</li>
            <li>Something in the formula moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling oily, and my shave is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is minty and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>And as the razor never really dries, you will never be able to remove the hair</li>
            <li>Had to switch back to the original Braun and dump the rest.  </li>
            <li>I had to clean the shaver by hand and go back to using the Braun alcohol based product.</li>
            <li>Shaver Shebang refills are easy to use… simply rinse your old cartridge with water and add in the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The guy who developed this must not know chemistry and certainly did not test this well before putting on the market.</li>
            <li>I decided to dump out the contents, thoroughly clean the cartridge, let it air dry overnight and then refilled it again with the solution.  </li>
            <li>The thirty seconds of extra work are worth the 80% savings, for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions provided exactly and rinsed a used cartridge thoroughly, I even went the extra mile and rinsed it with very hot water multiple times for about 10 mins before filling with this solution, after doing this process for about a couple of months</li>
            <li>I had to buy new ones.</li>
            <li>With this product the blade is always wet after the clean cycle and thus the rust.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had three Braun razors during the past 25 or more years.  </li>
            <li>The first time I shaved after having used this product, the razor over sped which means it had an RPM substantially higher than what it is supposed to have for a short second.</li>
            <li>, so shaver bogs down, doesn&#x27;t seem to lubricate or clean,</li>
            <li>Several other customers have complained the product doesn&#x27;t dry perfectly, and it leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>so when I found this all natural cleanser/lubricator I thought I&#x27;d give it a try</li>
            <li>and I really like the smoother shave provided by the extra lubrication.</li>
            <li>I am returning to Braun, a product that I used for nearly 10 years without any complaints.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve poured the stuff out and going back to the real deal.  </li>
            <li>She brought home a Braun 360 Complete.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin, and I had been dealing with some irritation from time to time.  </li>
            <li>That ceased completely when I switched to the Shaver Shebang solution.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, you need to rinse your old cartridge.</li>
            <li>There were still a lot of old fun left in the cartridge, and the water still turned white.</li>
            <li>This was not apparent at first, but now it is quite apparent.  </li>
            <li>With the seller&#x27;s fantastic support I was able to fix an issue with my base that I wasn&#x27;t aware of.  </li>
            <li>Obviously I like the product, but at first I felt differently.  </li>
            <li>I am trying right now a other stuff from Canada.</li>
            <li>purchased this product both because of the price of new cartridges, the alcohol left on your upper lip after shaving with a newly rinsed razor and the environmental issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days of regular use, I found my Braun 360 Complete just as clean as if I were using the Braun cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My beard comes in quite thick and very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The 6 refills of Mint tree are definitely not better than the original one.</li>
            <li>The shaver comes out a little bit wet, but maybe the second time I do the refill it will be better.</li>
            <li>1-the razor doesn&#x27;t dry up completely after I started using this product</li>
    </ol>

            <li> That ceased completely when I switched to the Shaver Shebang solution.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, you need to rinse your old cartridge.</li>
            <li> There were still a lot of old fun left in the cartridge, and the water still turned white.</li>
            <li> This was not apparent at first, but now it is quite apparent.  </li>
            <li> With the seller&#x27;s fantastic support I was able to fix an issue with my base that I wasn&#x27;t aware of.  </li>
            <li> Obviously I like the product, but at first I felt differently.  </li>
            <li> I am trying right now a other stuff from Canada.</li>
            <li> purchased this product both because of the price of new cartridges, the alcohol left on your upper lip after shaving with a newly rinsed razor and the environmental issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days of regular use, I found my Braun 360 Complete just as clean as if I were using the Braun cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My beard comes in quite thick and very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The 6 refills of Mint tree are definitely not better than the original one.</li>
            <li> The shaver comes out a little bit wet, but maybe the second time I do the refill it will be better.</li>
            <li> 1-the razor doesn&#x27;t dry up completely after I started using this product</li>
            <li> I split the cost of this with my dad vs ordering new refiles, and the smell become very strong and bad after a day or 2, it also always felt clogged up and had to be washed manually.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s difficult to continue to recondition the old Clean and Renew cartridges.</li>
            <li> However, when the razor is cleaned on the Braun charger, it does not dry, meaning that your next shave is wet.  </li>
            <li> Where the OEM Bruan product is expensive it cleans the blades and when the clean cycle is complete the blade is dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper than the cartridges and according to him it works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> They don’t last all that long</li>
            <li> English is not my native tongue, so please excuse any spelling errors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After day 7 or so, there was a sour smell (like a washcloth that was not properly dried) that emitted from the shaver and remained on my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to wash out your old cartridge with water before filling it, but I was having a hard time getting all of the old hair out of it.  </li>
            <li> I was turned on by the ease and quickness of a close shave, without having to shell out $20 every few weeks for new blades.  </li>
            <li> That created a smell that stopped from a single brushing out of the extra hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it gets most of it out but leaves a yuckky residue around the cutting head.</li>
            <li> The cooling effect lasts a long time, but the scent is gone in</li>
            <li> The cooling effect lasts a long time, but the scent is gone in</li>
            <li> It is a  sorry cheap formula that does not clean well, does not dry in the Braun device, and develops a putrid odor from bacterial decomposition of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> If this is needed every single time...</li>
            <li> The down side of the product is that it has left a musty smell in my shaver and every time I use it</li>
            <li> if not better than more expensive product.</li>
            <li> The smell returned a 3rd time (although it took a few weeks to occur), so I am no longer going to use this product.  </li>
            <li> This was not what I expected and not at all what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind that the razor was wet when it came out of the holder.  </li>
            <li> I really hoped this would work, but alas, it did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have started to think when I read that, but I guess my desire to have an alternative to the OEM cartridges drowned the alarm bells.</li>
            <li> Leaves shaver wet</li>
            <li> I took my shaver out of the cleaner stand the other day, after it had sat for over a day and it was sitting in the solution soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product with a lot of hope; however, it was not exactly what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> If you plan on shaving with a shave gel or other wet skin lubricant, then this is the stuff for you.  </li>
            <li> I have been forced to refill the container to keep the order down and/or eliminate it completely.  </li>
            <li> Even after being on a four week business trip where I didn&#x27;t do anything but flushing it under the faucet every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second complaint: this fluid stays wet on the razor for days.</li>
            <li> They are too wet; but they cost less.</li>
            <li> terrific savings , much smaller environmental footpring, made the US and a company that seems to stand behind their product in every way.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, it did&#x27;nt clean my shaver very well at all.</li>
            <li> dried his skin out when the shaver was still wet from the cleaning.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this product and have returned to using new new Braun cartridges.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the foil on the shaver felt like it had a dirty film over it when I shaved also there is a slighty musty dirty smell also, even before my light comes on telling me to change the solution, so it does not seem to last that long either.</li>
            <li> gives the razor a bad smell after few days of use&lt;br /&gt;3- had to throw it away and buy the original cleaner</li>
            <li> Depending on my plans for the day, I’ll often forgo aftershave and just splash on a little Shaver Shebang instead.</li>
            <li> Just a little messy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago as an alternative to the pre-filled cartridges from Braun.  </li>
            <li> The smell returned, so I repeated the process again and placed a few drops of tea tree oil in the container.  </li>
            <li> Saved me a lot of money and a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaner seems to work well by there is very little &amp;#34;mint tree&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, so no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Because of that, I am skeptical that this will really last for 6 refills without having to buy another cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Having used &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; scented aftershave in the past</li>
            <li> No more itching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the engineers in Organek Living deviates from the requirements created by the OEM, it will inevitably mean trouble.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a Braun electric razor for about a year but the clean &amp; renew cartridge refills are outrageously priced</li>
            <li> Gave this product a try because the replacement packs are wicked expensive and frankly not worth it with a substitute like this.</li>
            <li> but it left my shaver very wet and a nasty film on it.  </li>
            <li> Trustworthy sellers who stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> This annoyed me, and I began looking online for some alternatives.  </li>
            <li> It left shaving stubble all packed behind the screen and after a few days I noticed it smelled dreadful.</li>
            <li> If you like to shave with a dry face like I do, then pass on this refill, not because its a bad product, but because its the wrong product for you.</li>
            <li> Terrible odor buildup took sometime to get rid of with constant sanitizing and UV disinfecting.  </li>
            <li> I gotta tell ya using the expensive cartridges</li>
            <li> and it replaces those expensive Braun refills.</li>
            <li> I hated trashing those empty cartridges.</li>
            <li> I’ve seen a 3-pack for as expensive as $25.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, rinse and refill it in the kitchen sink.</li>
            <li> Sorry, wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li> I been spending a bloody fortune over the past 5 years on my self cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> $25 for three measly refills is a non-starter for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they’re expensive!  </li>
            <li> As a result just after too days, my razor blade started to get rusted, there is bad smell, and seems that the razor doesn&#x27;t get cleaned well.</li>
            <li> I have never ever seen it that dirty!</li>
            <li> But, this is truly terrible stuff.  </li>
            <li> That is horrible stuff.</li>

            <li> Okay product however it does not clean no where as good as the Braun official cartridge solution. I followed the instructions provided exactly and rinsed a used cartridge thoroughly, I even went the extra mile and rinsed it with very hot water multiple times for about 10 mins before filling with this solution, after doing this process for about a couple of months I noticed that my skin where i shaved on my face started breaking out after shaving I also noticed that the foil on the shaver felt like it had a dirty film over it when I shaved also there is a slighty musty dirty smell also, even before my light comes on telling me to change the solution, so it does not seem to last that long either.</li>
            <li> Terrible odor buildup took sometime to get rid of with constant sanitizing and UV disinfecting.  Had to switch back to the original Braun and dump the rest.  What a shame; I really liked the smooth shaving.  Update: Organek Living sent me a new formulation free of charge and it&#x27;s awesome.  Thank you for taking care of your Amazon customers.  This is what shopping in Amazon is all about.  Trustworthy sellers who stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> It does the job of keeping my razor clean.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, so no complaints.  The instructions say to wash out your old cartridge with water before filling it, but I was having a hard time getting all of the old hair out of it.  Because of that, I am skeptical that this will really last for 6 refills without having to buy another cartridge.  Therefore, I knocked off a star.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a Braun electric razor for about a year but the clean &amp; renew cartridge refills are outrageously priced so when I found this all natural cleanser/lubricator I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and I have to tell ya I&#x27;m not disappointed in the price and hes not disappointed in the product. It&#x27;s so much cheaper than the cartridges and according to him it works just as well if not better. It&#x27;s easy to use too, just clean your old cartridge with water and add the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I gotta tell ya using the expensive cartridges dried his skin out when the shaver was still wet from the cleaning. Shaver Shebang does just the opposite. The added moisturizers in the product makes his shave much smoother too. It&#x27;s like using a pre-shave without taking the time to put one on. Sometimes he splashes it on his neck if he&#x27;s going to be outside in the heat and I&#x27;ve even applied it after shaving my legs. It moisturizes and is quite cooling and soothing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had known about this a year ago!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this stuff, it does not work and will ruin your shaver.  The bolts in side the head of my shaver are now starting to rust because of this product.  Where the OEM Bruan product is expensive it cleans the blades and when the clean cycle is complete the blade is dry.  With this product the blade is always wet after the clean cycle and thus the rust.  Wish I didn&#x27;t buy this as I&#x27;ll probably now need to buy another razor soon.</li>
            <li> I like this product, very fast delivery, nice fragrance at a very good price and cleans just as good!  if you compare it to what it cost to buy refill cartridges</li>
            <li> I also like how it cleans just as well as the Braun original. I was too cheap to clean as often as I should so there was an accumulation of hairs in my razor that could not be removed with regular cleaning. That created a smell that stopped from a single brushing out of the extra hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I can afford regular cleanings, the razor always smells great and I really like the smoother shave provided by the extra lubrication.</li>
            <li> Sure beats spending a fortune on new cartridges all the time to say nothing of being more land fill friendly.</li>
            <li> I rated this product 5 starts because it works well and it replaces those expensive Braun refills. They don&#x27;t have the exact same feel on your skin, but work just fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago as an alternative to the pre-filled cartridges from Braun.  Having used &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; scented aftershave in the past, I thought I would like the smell of this product.  I rinsed out the Braun cartridge, filled it 3/4 full with this product and it smelled good for the first few days.  After day 7 or so, there was a sour smell (like a washcloth that was not properly dried) that emitted from the shaver and remained on my face after shaving.  I decided to dump out the contents, thoroughly clean the cartridge, let it air dry overnight and then refilled it again with the solution.  The smell returned, so I repeated the process again and placed a few drops of tea tree oil in the container.  The smell returned a 3rd time (although it took a few weeks to occur), so I am no longer going to use this product.  I am returning to Braun, a product that I used for nearly 10 years without any complaints.</li>
            <li> This was the best deal I could find. Works just fine in the shaver that I own. Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I split the cost of this with my dad vs ordering new refiles, and the smell become very strong and bad after a day or 2, it also always felt clogged up and had to be washed manually.  Lastly today I noticed the plastic itself on my bruan 8585 was bubbling so I&#x27;ve poured the stuff out and going back to the real deal.  I&#x27;d say use at your own risk as some have had good luck but not my dad or myself...</li>
            <li> 1-the razor doesn&#x27;t dry up completely after I started using this product&lt;br /&gt;2-it gives the razor a bad smell after few days of use&lt;br /&gt;3- had to throw it away and buy the original cleaner</li>
            <li> I like the idea of refills for the Braun Cleaners. I have used it a number of times and it is as good or better then the original.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy, over the Braun Cartridges. They should have thought of refills first. I recommend this to anyone who uses Braun Cleaning Cartridges. The smell is pleasant, and cleaning is very good with a no residue in the cleaner or the razor.</li>
            <li> The cleaner seems to work well by there is very little &amp;#34;mint tree&amp;#34; smell. I think they should make it stronger.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy this product, never did, but got it as a present for my electric razor. It&#x27;s good idea, but very cheap execution. Producers decided to &amp;#34;cut corners&amp;#34; - most of it is water, not an alcohol. Try set it on fire - it won&#x27;t burn. As a result just after too days, my razor blade started to get rusted, there is bad smell, and seems that the razor doesn&#x27;t get cleaned well.</li>
            <li> Saved me a lot of money and a lot of waste. I hated trashing those empty cartridges. Now I am reusing them. This is a terrific product, which I wish I knew about a couple years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok only problem is you can&#x27;t use the same cartridge over and over.</li>
            <li> Glad to see they are now selling the liquid cleaner in bulk to refill a cartridge rather than filling the landfill with so much plastic.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I found this stuff.  It&#x27;s cheaper and more Eco-friendly than the brain refill cartridges.  However, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work well.  It leaves residue inside the cleaner and on the razor screen.  It also makes it smell funky.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great. Save money and the environment at the same time.....Well it didn&#x27;t do either because i dumped it out and had to buy the original cartridges again.  The smell was good(Mint) but it left my shaver very wet and a nasty film on it.  I took my shaver out of the cleaner stand the other day, after it had sat for over a day and it was sitting in the solution soaking wet.  It had clogged my cleaner stand and I had to blow canned air through it to clean it out.  I clean out the shaver every time I&#x27;m done using it and have never had any problems with the original braun cartridges. The shave is also better when using the original braun refills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three Braun razors during the past 25 or more years.  This last one is my last.  This was not what I expected and not at all what I wanted.  Now it doesn&#x27;t clean my razor.  The damn thing just leaks all over the drain board. I&#x27;m getting an American made razor which I hope will work for me.</li>
            <li> should be cheaper than the cartridges.</li>
            <li> This is everything it is advertised as.  A great economical solution to expensive refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint smells great.  The razor came out clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this going forward.</li>
            <li> The shaver comes out a little bit wet, but maybe the second time I do the refill it will be better. But my experience with customer service has been excellent.</li>
            <li> Good fro the price, you have to keep the reservior clean to avoid smells.  I have found the rinse with alcohol between fills helps with this issue.</li>
            <li> Great replacement , really works and smell better .</li>
            <li> Product smells nice.  Instructions were clean on how to clean existing cartridge.  Product smells nice and fees good on the skin.</li>
            <li> So much more reasonable than buying the cartridges and works just as well.  I would not hesitate to purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Husband liked the product. Clean and refreshing, thus far just as good if not better than more expensive product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Gave this product a try because the replacement packs are wicked expensive and frankly not worth it with a substitute like this.</li>
            <li> The best way to go for me, easy &amp; fast refill. I come back in future &amp; do business w/ you. Can&#x27;t beat the price &amp; I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Purchased these from this merchant but on eBay. Product is just okay. Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s difficult to continue to recondition the old Clean and Renew cartridges. As much as you flush with water and try to clean, they just don&#x27;t get that clean and ready for new solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second complaint: this fluid stays wet on the razor for days. The Braun name brand fluid contains more alcohol and therefore evaporates much better.</li>
            <li> I rarely post a review on Amazon.  But, this is truly terrible stuff.  I had to spill it out after the 2nd refill and go back to the more expensive approach.  I didn&#x27;t mind that the razor was wet when it came out of the holder.  What I did mind was that my shaver was gunky and I didn&#x27;t get the same good shave that I was getting before I started to use this stuff.  I used it according to instructions; I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this product and have returned to using new new Braun cartridges.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with a lot of hope; however, it was not exactly what I had expected.  In terms of performance it does the job and that is why I gave it 2 stars.  The down side of the product is that it has left a musty smell in my shaver and every time I use it I get this musty smell.  This was not apparent at first, but now it is quite apparent.  I have been forced to refill the container to keep the order down and/or eliminate it completely.  This is unacceptable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I made the switch to an electric razor about a year ago.  I was turned on by the ease and quickness of a close shave, without having to shell out $20 every few weeks for new blades.  I didn’t do much research and I asked my girlfriend to pick me up an electric razor.  She brought home a Braun 360 Complete.  I love the razor.  It gives me a nice, close shave with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My irritation comes with the cleaning cartridges.  They don’t last all that long and they’re expensive!  I’ve seen a 3-pack for as expensive as $25.  This annoyed me, and I began looking online for some alternatives.  I love my razor, I didn’t want to switch, but I’m frugal.  $25 for three measly refills is a non-starter for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a daily shaver, owing to my eastern European heritage.  My beard comes in quite thick and very quickly.  A smooth, close shave with no snags is extremely important to me.  Shaving is an art form, and my razor is my brush.  Keeping it in top shape is of the utmost importance to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Shaver Shebang refills.  When it came time to change the original Braun cartridge, I was excited to see if the new cleaning solution would work as well.  I was not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of regular use, I found my Braun 360 Complete just as clean as if I were using the Braun cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and I had been dealing with some irritation from time to time.  That ceased completely when I switched to the Shaver Shebang solution.  Something in the formula moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling oily, and my shave is much smoother.  No more itching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shaver Shebang refills are easy to use… simply rinse your old cartridge with water and add in the cleaning solution.  The thirty seconds of extra work are worth the 80% savings, for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is minty and very pleasing.  Depending on my plans for the day, I’ll often forgo aftershave and just splash on a little Shaver Shebang instead. The cooling effect lasts a long time, but the scent is gone in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shaver Shebang is better than advertised.  Cost savings, great smell, great clean razor, and a great shave.  You have a customer for life.ttle Shaver Shebang instead.

            <li> I am an engineer, having worked in the aviation business my entire career. So when it comes to functionality and how stuff should work, I know what I am talking about. English is not my native tongue, so please excuse any spelling errors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product both because of the price of new cartridges, the alcohol left on your upper lip after shaving with a newly rinsed razor and the environmental issues. I really hoped this would work, but alas, it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, you need to rinse your old cartridge. OK, I thought. No big deal. Well, I was wrong. I flushed it thoroughly multiple times for about 10 minutes in total. There were still a lot of old fun left in the cartridge, and the water still turned white. If this is needed every single time... Nuff said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second. I had had my razor for about two years, without ever having any issues with it whatsoever. The first time I shaved after having used this product, the razor over sped which means it had an RPM substantially higher than what it is supposed to have for a short second. It did so twice in the period I tried the product. Never before, never after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third. After having used the product for three or four weeks, I opened up my razor. I have never ever seen it that dirty! Even after being on a four week business trip where I didn&#x27;t do anything but flushing it under the faucet every other day. And when you think of it, it makes perfectly sense. Several other customers have complained the product doesn&#x27;t dry perfectly, and it leaves a residue. Organek Living then answers this is correct and the product has been designed this way, so don&#x27;t worry. I should have started to think when I read that, but I guess my desire to have an alternative to the OEM cartridges drowned the alarm bells. Thing is, when an engineer design a product, it is to meet certain requirements. So the engineer will find the solutions needed in order to meet these requirements. When the engineers in Organek Living deviates from the requirements created by the OEM, it will inevitably mean trouble. The residue this product leaves behind is a perfect film to bind up all the hair your razor cuts off. And as the razor never really dries, you will never be able to remove the hair completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read someone used it as aftershave. Good for you. Personally, Mint Tree is not my smell, so I am emptying this stuff in the sink. Good thing its organic and won&#x27;t hurt the nature by me doing so. ;-)</li>
            <li> The 6 refills of Mint tree are definitely not better than the original one. They are too wet; but they cost less.</li>
            <li> First bought this item to save money, they are doing that. This does a good job of cleaning the razor as intended.</li>
            <li> Not so good. Thought this was better than the actual Braun Clean &amp; Renew Solution. I was better off using water.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as the original Braun cleaner but it does work.</li>
            <li> The refill solution is as advertised, and actually smells very good.  However, when the razor is cleaned on the Braun charger, it does not dry, meaning that your next shave is wet.  If you plan on shaving with a shave gel or other wet skin lubricant, then this is the stuff for you.  If you like to shave with a dry face like I do, then pass on this refill, not because its a bad product, but because its the wrong product for you.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase, so I figured it&#x27;s time to post a review.  Obviously I like the product, but at first I felt differently.  With the seller&#x27;s fantastic support I was able to fix an issue with my base that I wasn&#x27;t aware of.  The problem ws masked by how quickly the Braun liquid evaporates and the thinness of the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;The problem was that my shaver wasn&#x27;t completely clean after a cycle and there was some leakage during cleaning .  The seller provided instructions on how to fix a couple of possible causes.&lt;br /&gt;So here is what I like:  terrific savings , much smaller environmental footpring, made the US and a company that seems to stand behind their product in every way.</li>
            <li> After reading some good reviews I gave this product a try.  Very disappointed, it did&#x27;nt clean my shaver very well at all. It left shaving stubble all packed behind the screen and after a few days I noticed it smelled dreadful. I had to clean the shaver by hand and go back to using the Braun alcohol based product.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Saves a lot of money.  Just a little messy. Needless to say, rinse and refill it in the kitchen sink.</li>
            <li> Did not work well with Braun e- Shaver . . . But it is an awsome after shave and shaving lotion !!!</li>
            <li> That is horrible stuff. It  smells good out of the bottle, but is is losing the smell soon. This stuff made my Foil and cutter on my Braun shaver braun... like rust. I had to buy new ones. I am trying right now a other stuff from Canada. It is cheaper and there are more fragrances, too.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!! It is a  sorry cheap formula that does not clean well, does not dry in the Braun device, and develops a putrid odor from bacterial decomposition of the ingredients. I am a PhD chemist. The guy who developed this must not know chemistry and certainly did not test this well before putting on the market.</li>
            <li> Sorry, wanted to like it.  Leaves shaver wet, so shaver bogs down, doesn&#x27;t seem to lubricate or clean, yeah it gets most of it out but leaves a yuckky residue around the cutting head.</li>
            <li> I been spending a bloody fortune over the past 5 years on my self cleaning cartridges. Wish i found this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good thanks.</li>
