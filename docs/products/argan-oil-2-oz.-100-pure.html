            <li>It is serving its intended purpose just fine!</li>
            <li>For 100% pure argan oil it is a great deal.</li>
            <li>I love Argan Oil for many reasons.</li>
            <li>I would order from them again for sure.</li>
            <li>, I have been so pleased with the results that I ordered 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li>I am still on the fence of whether this product is authentic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is 100 % authentic.</li>
            <li>Many products will state that it it authetic and then....</li>
            <li>I love how it dissolves and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>Always inexpensive, always satisfied with this brand</li>
            <li>I love argan oil and how it helps the condition of your hair, but this one had a funky smell to it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>please better bottles.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this Argan Oil</li>
            <li>I love how it works.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Josie Maran 100%, and it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I love the light consistency of the oil, it absorbs very quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>I did not expect much from this oil, however, I was very pleased by the effects of using this oil.  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of any fine lines around my eyes and mouth</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, but the bottle it is packaged in leaks...</li>
            <li>reason I purchased this oil to use as a facial moisturizer, and it been a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>One of the biggest and most surprising thing that I have noticed since using the Argan oil is that I have had a reduction in the number of facial wrinkles that I have!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just repackaged olive oil...</li>
            <li>The oil doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as jojoba so combined it with a light cream and that helped the absorption.</li>
            <li>There is no point in spending more money for 100% pure Argan oil</li>
            <li>I love this produtct and being it is pure argan oil</li>
            <li>I use it to keep my skin and cuticles soft with amazing results.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>Order came in quick.</li>
            <li>Not only amazing, but hte aroma is worth it too!  </li>
            <li>Good for dry hair.</li>
            <li>It even dries nail polish fast!!</li>
            <li>Same amazing</li>
            <li>Great for using as a oil in homemade shampoos especially for sensitive skin types.  </li>
            <li>and this oil proves just that.  </li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>To apply, it&#x27;s best for your skin (face, hands, neck) to be slightly damp and this oil literally sinks right into your skin without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>this was my first time ordering this product from this company.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you really have nothing to lose!</li>
            <li>Seriously, it works great for my hair as well</li>
            <li>Just a little amount is all it takes to make sure my waves look like silk!</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s my fault for expecting an oil I paid less than five dollars for to be a quality product.</li>
            <li>Have used high-grade Argan oil and this is much thinner, not near as rich-feeling as the better oil.</li>
            <li>Unlike others, I did detect the same nutty aroma, just not as strong.  </li>
            <li>This does not seem like PURE argan oil and it doesn&#x27;t smell like it either.</li>
            <li>- 100% Pure  is not the best-smelling in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot tell a difference in the quality compared to the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.  </li>
            <li>Although, I know they say that Argan oil is supposed to reduce wrinkles, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting that it would.  </li>
            <li>and I really like what it does for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish it had a smell to it</li>
            <li>but, it really didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil for my hair.</li>
            <li>it is very healing and works on Skin and Hair.  </li>
            <li>It comes packed really well.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the other oils I have tried - coconut, olive, sesame, etc.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, The main ingredient is argan oil.  </li>
            <li>Not wanting to waste a good thing, but not &#x27;hardy&#x27; enough to rub it on my face, I rubbed it in my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to pay the high price for moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I really like to use natural skin products.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped to me in the normal shipping time period.</li>
            <li>Pure argan oil tends to be expensive -- this was a good deal.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only brand of Argan oil that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I also mix this in with my hair conditioner to keep my hair soft which is a challenge if you color your hair!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of Argan oil and this is by far the cheapest and it works better than the others mixed with silicones, i use it mostly for dark circles under my eyes at night, and for dry hair ends.</li>
            <li>This is the 4th manufacturer I&#x27;ve purchased pure Argan oil from over the last two years.</li>
            <li>My skin is always moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>I then started looking for another natural oil that I could use on my face and discovered Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I am currently using it on my face and hair, and it is working well so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my old brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this without my normal standard of background research on the actual product.</li>
            <li>I generally use a brand called Essential Argan oil because it&#x27;s 100% certified Organic Moroccan Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 right away, it keeps well in a dark dry location</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I ordered 2 right away, it keeps well in a dark dry location</li>
            <li> but I have used other Argan oils before and they made my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I use this product in combination of other products to make a hair grease that keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I can really see and feel the difference using this product everyday!</li>
            <li> and I have coarse dry hair</li>
            <li> It does work, but I noticed the quality is a little thinner than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> just what I need living in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I was previously using coconut oil as my facial moisturizer but</li>
            <li> This one compares very favorably to the ones that advertise as being &amp;#34;organic, virgin, cold pressed&amp;#34; (more expensive).</li>
            <li> It has a wide variety of uses.</li>
            <li> I apply Argan Oil after my shower while my skin is still wet.</li>
            <li> Well, a few days ago I accidently spilled a bunch of this next to the sink.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and thus I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare it to</li>
            <li> I ran out, but felt that 100% is 100%, and any other bells &amp; whistles pricier brands clai is just marketing/packaging.  </li>
            <li> My other Argan oil I have got are not like this.</li>
            <li> Actually, when I think about it, I have not had any negative effects from using the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Waste of money this is NOT real Argan oil</li>
            <li> I needed a small bottle at work to prevent my hands from getting dry from the HVAC.</li>
            <li> It made my face breakout in pimples and I&#x27;ve never had that problem with my previous brand.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy.</li>
            <li> waste your money on glitzy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over do it, a few drops if all you need.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my hairbrush before brushing my kinky, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It calms my hair without being heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> Waste of money .</li>
            <li> not sure if it arrived slightly rancid or if it always smells that way.</li>
            <li> Rather heavy and unpleasant, it really does feel like canola oil</li>
            <li> I use this product on my curly hair to tame it.  </li>
            <li> I applied it to my hair and it made my hair feel hard like straw.</li>

            <li> Was leaking a bit when it came.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid chemicals as much as possible so I like that this is 100% argan oil and not some chemical laden crap with a drop of argan oil in it.  This oil is great for my hair and skin.  I like it better than the other oils I have tried - coconut, olive, sesame, etc.  I also like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.  Comes in a handy container, too.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil for many reasons. It has a wide variety of uses. I use it to keep my skin and cuticles soft with amazing results. I apply Argan Oil after my shower while my skin is still wet. My skin is always moist and soft.  I also use is as a moisturizer on my face. It gets rid of any fine lines around my eyes and mouth and I don&#x27;t have to pay the high price for moisturizers. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and it isn&#x27;t greasy. There is no point in spending more money for 100% pure Argan oil</li>
            <li> Great for using as a oil in homemade shampoos especially for sensitive skin types.  A little goes a long way.  Is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This does not seem like PURE argan oil and it doesn&#x27;t smell like it either. It is very thin, seems to be diluted. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil - 2 oz. - 100% Pure  is not the best-smelling in my opinion. not sure if it arrived slightly rancid or if it always smells that way.</li>
            <li> good quality for cost...this companies oils do NOT smell rancid &#x3D; they are good and inexpensive. I ordered 3 different kinds of oils</li>
            <li> I love this oil! Just a little amount is all it takes to make sure my waves look like silk!</li>
            <li> The oil is light on the hair and feels good to the skin. It is muli-purpose for me. Not to heavy.</li>
            <li> For 100% pure argan oil it is a great deal. It is serving its intended purpose just fine! I would order from them again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only brand of Argan oil that I have ever used. I did not expect much from this oil, however, I was very pleased by the effects of using this oil.  I use it every morning and evening as a facial moisturizer and I must say that since I have been using it my skin has been moist and supple. Once I apply the oil in the morning, the oil keeps my face moisturized all day without any need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reason I purchased this oil to use as a facial moisturizer, and it been a great moisturizer. It has exceeded my expectations!  I was previously using coconut oil as my facial moisturizer but after several months’ usage, the coconut oil started to clog my pores.  I then started looking for another natural oil that I could use on my face and discovered Argan oil.  I have not had any problems with clogged pores since switching to Argan oil.  Actually, when I think about it, I have not had any negative effects from using the Argan oil. One of the biggest and most surprising thing that I have noticed since using the Argan oil is that I have had a reduction in the number of facial wrinkles that I have!  Although, I know they say that Argan oil is supposed to reduce wrinkles, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting that it would.  I love the light consistency of the oil, it absorbs very quickly into the skin and I really like what it does for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though Essential Depot&#x27;s Argan oil is the only brand of Argan oil I have used and thus I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare it to, I have been so pleased with the results that I ordered 2 more bottles.  For the great quality and the excellent cost, there is no reason for me to try any other brands!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I would recommend this product to anyone. I am still on the fence of whether this product is authentic. I applied it to my hair and it made my hair feel hard like straw.I am AA and I have coarse dry hair but I have used other Argan oils before and they made my hair feel soft and silky. This oil does not have a smell and it is a lighter oil sort of like grapeseed oil in texture. It did not come with a seal on it or any listing of ingredients ( whether it had any oil additives in it is still up in the air) I don&#x27;t know if it is 100 % authentic. Many products will state that it it authetic and then....you read the list of ingredients and find otherwise.  It was shipped to me in the normal shipping time period. I have been using it for about 1 month now and I am not impressed. Maybe others felt different about it. I bought it because it was affordable at the time of my purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed. I purchase this for hair cream mix. I really wish it had a smell to it but, it really didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> This is a good all-purpose oil. I am currently using it on my face and hair, and it is working well so far. I love how it dissolves and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Also, it is a great value for your money.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my curly hair to tame it.  It does work, but I noticed the quality is a little thinner than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I discovered argan oil in the luckiest of ways...I won a bottle of Joanna Vargas serum which sells for $100/oz! Not only amazing, but hte aroma is worth it too!  Anyway, The main ingredient is argan oil.  I tried the Josie Maran 100%, and it was pretty good.  I ran out, but felt that 100% is 100%, and any other bells &amp; whistles pricier brands clai is just marketing/packaging.  I went for this.  Simple plastic bottle, simple label.&lt;br /&gt;I always read Amazon reviews, and was struck by how others mentioned no aroma.  it made me wonder...is Josie Maran 100%, ir is there scent added too?  Unlike others, I did detect the same nutty aroma, just not as strong.  I put it on before going to bed, and my skin is GREAT in the morning.  this stuff rocks!&lt;br /&gt;I also use argan on my hair occasionally.  Rather than paying $40 for a monthly deep condition, I chelate at home, put some argan oil in my hair, go to bed, and after washing my hair in the morning, it&#x27;s AMAZING.  Silky, shiney, all that.  Well, a few days ago I accidently spilled a bunch of this next to the sink.  Not wanting to waste a good thing, but not &#x27;hardy&#x27; enough to rub it on my face, I rubbed it in my hair.  Same amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on glitzy.  The folks who put glitzy in that bottle bought the contents from somewhere in bulk.  Essentail Depot must be where!</li>
            <li> I bought this without my normal standard of background research on the actual product. I have ordered oils from this brand before and I was happy with my purchase. Unfortunately, this \\&quot;argan\\&quot; oil is questionable. It smells like vegetable oil and has none of the characteristics of certified argan oil. Honestly, it&#x27;s my fault for expecting an oil I paid less than five dollars for to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, but the bottle it is packaged in leaks... it leaked in the box on the way to me, it leaks when I use the bottle, it leaks in storage.  It leaks.  I ended up putting the unspilled portion into a different bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th manufacturer I&#x27;ve purchased pure Argan oil from over the last two years. This one compares very favorably to the ones that advertise as being &amp;#34;organic, virgin, cold pressed&amp;#34; (more expensive). This one was cheaper and only claimed to be of the &amp;#34;finest quality&amp;#34; so I decided to give it a try. I honestly cannot tell a difference in the quality compared to the more expensive ones. To apply, it&#x27;s best for your skin (face, hands, neck) to be slightly damp and this oil literally sinks right into your skin without leaving a greasy residue. Don&#x27;t over do it, a few drops if all you need. I plan to purchase a larger size next time.</li>
            <li> Always inexpensive, always satisfied with this brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just repackaged olive oil...</li>
            <li> I love this produtct and being it is pure argan oil you only need a drop to add to hair or skin so the 2oz will last forever &amp; if you get it as an add on you can not beat that price!! I ordered 2 right away, it keeps well in a dark dry location</li>
            <li> I love argan oil and how it helps the condition of your hair, but this one had a funky smell to it. I&#x27;ll keep it for nighttime use only probably. Still happy with it though</li>
            <li> I really like to use natural skin products.  this was my first time ordering this product from this company.  It shipped quickly.  The oil is great and not scented.  Love it.  Makes cologne stay on skin longer too.</li>
            <li> and this oil proves just that.  I generally use a brand called Essential Argan oil because it&#x27;s 100% certified Organic Moroccan Argan oil. However, it&#x27;s a bit expensive. So I came across this item and decided to give it a shot. Big mistake. The feel and texture is not the same. It made my face breakout in pimples and I&#x27;ve never had that problem with my previous brand. I&#x27;m going back to my old brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha:~)</li>
            <li> Order came in quick. I needed a small bottle at work to prevent my hands from getting dry from the HVAC. The oil doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as jojoba so combined it with a light cream and that helped the absorption.</li>
            <li> This helps your skin stay nice and hydrated - just what I need living in a dry climate. I can really see and feel the difference using this product everyday!</li>
            <li> Oil came in plastic bottle. And was leaking just a bit.  Have used high-grade Argan oil and this is much thinner, not near as rich-feeling as the better oil.</li>
            <li> leaks all over the box that came in. please better bottles. other wise the product is very good price you can not beat</li>
            <li> Smells and feels like vegetable oil. My other Argan oil I have got are not like this.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil for my hair. Good for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. I put a few drops on my hairbrush before brushing my kinky, frizzy hair. It calms my hair without being heavy or sticky. Pure argan oil tends to be expensive -- this was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  One of my staples.  Would reorder but in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about one year ago, and I absolutely love it! It is a daily part of my daily skin care routine. I like to massage it into my skin after cleansing. It has made such a difference in the appearance of my skin that I no longer feel the need for foundation, &amp; I&#x27;m 48 years young!&lt;br /&gt;Get this product!</li>
            <li> Waste of money this is NOT real Argan oil I wish I never bought this !!! Waste of money .</li>
            <li> I love this Argan Oil it is very healing and works on Skin and Hair.  It comes packed really well.  I love how it works.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair moisturized</li>
            <li> Had to try this after reading about how great Argan Oil is for the skin and hair.  It does live up to the hype and is WONDERFUL!  Worked great for me for my skin.  I use it for under the eye area to give it extra TLC and I have to say that works great!  I am oily so I am not prone to wrinkles, but I do make sure that I do everything in my power to NOT get wrinkles and this Argan Oil is part of my regiment to battle unwanted wrinkles!  :)  I also mix this in with my hair conditioner to keep my hair soft which is a challenge if you color your hair!  Shhhh.  Don&#x27;t tell anyone!  :)  Seriously, it works great for my hair as well and I use it after my bath every day and have been loving how my hair feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks good.  Hair looks good!  It&#x27;s all good!  This will be part of my beauty regime from now on and I encourage others to check it out.  For the price, you really have nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> I use this product in combination of other products to make a hair grease that keeps my hair soft and moisturized. I would recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of Argan oil and this is by far the cheapest and it works better than the others mixed with silicones, i use it mostly for dark circles under my eyes at night, and for dry hair ends.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be lighter in texture like jojoba oil.  Rather heavy and unpleasant, it really does feel like canola oil</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s replaced my moisturizer and my expensive leave-in conditioner. I use it on hair, skin, face, everything.  It even dries nail polish fast!!</li>
