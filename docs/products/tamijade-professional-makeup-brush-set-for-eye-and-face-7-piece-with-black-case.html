            <li>Loved the case, the brushes are super soft - giving this to my makeup aficionado sister as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>you first open it will smell kind a like paint</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great little brush set!</li>
            <li>Initially had a very strong plastic smell but has since gone away</li>
            <li>Very soft and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>When you open the case you will immediately notice a VERY strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>I think this would be a good starter set if you are new to make-up, or if you want an extra set of brushes for travel, the office etc...</li>
            <li>Has a general Foundation brush which I use the most with my mineral makeup.  </li>

            <li>Not only are they soft and gentle on my skin, easy to clean, and professional, they also come wonderfully packaged and have their own little carrying case!!!</li>
            <li>I hear and read about how people tend to judge brushes as being cheap or something about the chemical odor they smell when they get new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I use and wash my brushes constantly and these are easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>she loves them and feel amazing quality would absolutely recommend for any daily makeup user!</li>
            <li>My makeup is so much easier to apply and looks more professional when using the correct brush for each task.  </li>
            <li>Overall, not unhappy, but I think you can find better.</li>
            <li>Not only am I pleased with the product, but we had a minor issue and their customer service is BEYOND AMAZING.</li>
            <li>That is extremely important when you want good quality brushes that will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got them very fast.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this set if you are looking for some super soft makeup brushes with the convenience of a handy pouch.</li>
            <li>When i ordered these i was really excited to use new brushes</li>
            <li>These are nice, solid, high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I usually spend between $10-30 a brush so this set is an amazing deal!</li>
            <li>but my makeup goes on much better than the last brushes I owned.</li>
            <li>The metal top has separated from the wooden bottle and is awaiting an application of gorilla glue to see if it will work going forward.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love these brushes, have officially made them my daily use brushes.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but when I first received the makeup bag it smelled from the glue.</li>
            <li>First I wanna get this issue out of the way.</li>
            <li>Passed the &amp;#34;pull test&amp;#34; I do to make sure I won&#x27;t have brush hairs all over my face later.</li>
            <li>them before you use them a first time.</li>
            <li>Better yet, the TamiJade Essential Makeup Set comes with a roll up storage bag.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Very affordable!</li>

            <li>like paint/chemicals when first opened (although the smell did go away after a day)&lt;br /&gt;-one or two bristles sticking out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first time using a couple of the brushes</li>
            <li>Had a funny smell to it and</li>
            <li>I really like these!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended :)</li>
            <li>Much softer than the brush I had!  </li>

            <li>The blush brush is a little small but for a kit that will fit in your purse easily and make you look amazing its fine.  </li>
            <li>I bought  these brushes because i needed something new, quick, and affordable .</li>
            <li>And since I&#x27;m new to the whole professional world of make-up and contouring, I wasn&#x27;t sure which brushes to use.</li>
            <li>I love how professional and stylish these all black brushes look.</li>
            <li>The case is good enough, but I don&#x27;t expect the case to last years and years.  </li>
            <li>The soft flexible bristles cover much more of my face than my old brush did.</li>
            <li>awesome, my only complaint will be that I have had them for a month, and the powder brush and the angled brush popped off the handle on mine.</li>
            <li>The first thing you notice when your brushes arrive is that they come in a super cute black case.</li>
            <li>When you first open the package, there is a strong &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve received other brushes in silk type holders and I can&#x27;t stand touching that type of material, so I never ended up using the brushes.</li>
            <li>helps blend in the makeup in a very appealing manner so it doesn&#x27;t just stay up like a thick layer of application rather smoothly blends in each application that&#x27;s meant for an individual brush.</li>

            <li>I have NEVER owned makeup brushes this soft in my LIFE!!</li>
            <li>So soft and well made!!</li>
            <li>They will not get stained and they can withstand a little alcohol to take out more oily or creamy products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over the fact they&#x27;re so soft!!</li>
            <li>All you need is in this cute 7 piece set with a cute/stylish little case for them to keep them all together and not all over the place.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and soft, although maybe a little too soft.  </li>
            <li>They apply make up very well, professional type brushes.</li>
            <li>They feel cheap, and the synthetic bristles are rough.</li>

            <li>Soft bristles and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>The matte handles allow for me to apply my makeup without the brushes slipping from my grip (which is a HUGE plus).</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes because the bristles are soft and the hand is sturdy and sleek.</li>
            <li>the tools used for applying and the simple useful tips that can come along with them for customers like</li>

            <li>I like this set of brushes because it has everything you need to out on a normal around of makeup and some added detail.</li>
            <li>Not too many, not too few,</li>
            <li>The set would have been better if they had included one fluffy, dome type eye brush.</li>
            <li>and even come in a black roll up case to store them in! :)</li>
            <li>Just as good as the bare materials brushes I&#x27;ve used for forever, if not better!</li>
            <li>Only issue is that the tops came off of the handle but glue puts it back together fine</li>
            <li>I had so many brushes from at least a dozen different brands and this set is by far superior and costs less than what I have paid for one brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes are normal size and not small ones.</li>
            <li>appreciate the effort put forth by TamiJade to introduce new users like me to their company and product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been needing some new brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend $24 on one brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new</li>
            <li>I had been putting off buying new makeup brushes for a while.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;grown</li>
            <li>I honestly stopped even trying to use them after using both the blush brush (too soft) and the eyeshadow brush (too hard).</li>
            <li>Super cheap, either too soft or too hard to be useable.</li>
            <li>I like it comes with a black pouch for easy transport and protection.</li>
            <li>The only thing missing for me would be a nice fluffier brush to blend out eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them to any makeup user, new or professional.</li>

            <li>This is an absolute must-have for the budding professional or seasoned veteran, or anyone that loves applying makeup.</li>
            <li>But as an adult using high quality products, these brushes are sub-par.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and includes the essentials in make up application brushes.</li>

            <li>They also include an eBook on the different uses for each brush, which will come in handy for a makeup amateur like my friend.</li>
            <li>They were heavily scented with a strong type chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Also I had to let them &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; for a few days because of the strong chemical, plastic smell (I think its from the roll).</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft on my sensitive face!</li>
            <li>Such quality brushes, I have become a life customer and will certainly recommend to friends and family.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have them long enough to clean them.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and almost tickle when I use them due to their softness.</li>
            <li>Each brush comes with a clear plastic cover.</li>
            <li>– it features a snap to close the roll, and a clear plastic piece to cover and protect the brush bristles.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I was WRONG!</li>
            <li>They come in a small bag which I really liked and overall seem really solid.</li>
            <li>They come wrapped in a convenient carrying case that folds up small enough to be able to put in your purse.  </li>
            <li>I hope they make a fan brush and bigger contouring and blending brushes with the same exact quality as these soon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them to anyone, and I will definitely repurchase.  </li>
            <li>They are made of such high quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and not cheaply made at all.</li>
            <li>The bristles look super soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li>I have very expensive name brand brushes that don&#x27;t even feel or work close to how great these brushes do.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>I use shadow brushes that are longer like sigma, with long bristles but these are flat little paddle brushes, they don&#x27;t really pat on shadow well and don&#x27;t blend easily, but are soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last night I used the foundation blush to apply a mask and washed it with brush cleaner and the brush didn&#x27;t lose any hairs and looks just like new this morning.</li>
            <li>No single problem so far.</li>
            <li>set seems to be well suited for someone just starting out with more complex makeup techniques.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear minimal make up, but what I have tried to really like so far.</li>
            <li>Complete With The Essential Cosmetic Brushes You Need For a Natural or Glamorous Look</li>
            <li>I own some of the more expensive makeup brushes available and TamiJade brushes are of comparable quality but much less expensive.</li>
            <li>I generally use sponges but after ordering these I&#x27;m converted to brush blending and clown contouring.</li>
            <li>I replaced these with some old brushed.</li>
            <li>I plan to take these to my next makeup class (my friend is a professional makeup artist) to show off to my friends.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft enough, but I can&#x27;t get over the smell!</li>
            <li>They are soft and make applying my make up very simple.  </li>
            <li>The set contains every brush you could possibly need to complete your beauty routine.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft yet sturdy at the same time.</li>
            <li>The powder brush is fluffy and and absorbs just the right amount of loose/setting powder.</li>
            <li>The roll is just the right size for everyday use and/or travel.  </li>
            <li>No loose hairs at all.</li>
            <li>I use them daily and no other brushes for me from now on.</li>
            <li>These jet black brushes look as dark as a raven and feel as smooth as cashmere.</li>
            <li>I used to be super lazy and only use 1 brush for everything.</li>
            <li>With the foundation brush, only a small amount of product goes a long way as the soft flexible bristles cover much more of your face than the stiff bristles on my old brush</li>
            <li>All the eyeshadow brushes are pretty dense and firm.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and they weren&#x27;t all shiny and stiff like some of the other synthetic brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them just due to their softness.</li>
            <li>High quality construction and applies eye shadow extremely well.</li>
            <li>The bristles are steady &amp; firm but soft enough to cause no discomfort.</li>
            <li>So far the make-up used with them seems to apply evenly, just have to dab a little extra on - right now - due to the newness of the brushes...</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any bristles come loose</li>
            <li>I really like that the brushes and metal are solid black.</li>
            <li>The ones provided are just a little too dense to get that smokey look really blended</li>
            <li>I was in need of some new brushes, and I don&#x27;t know if I will ever buy any other than these.</li>
            <li>Some of the big ones are a little softer and don&#x27;t hold as much product as a denser brush</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When you open the case you will immediately notice a VERY strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> I think this would be a good starter set if you are new to make-up, or if you want an extra set of brushes for travel, the office etc...</li>
            <li> Has a general Foundation brush which I use the most with my mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li> Super soft brushes that are packaged in a very nice leather pouch - each brush has its own spot - and I was even able to add a few my other ones!!</li>
            <li> Not only are they soft and gentle on my skin, easy to clean, and professional, they also come wonderfully packaged and have their own little carrying case!!!</li>
            <li> I hear and read about how people tend to judge brushes as being cheap or something about the chemical odor they smell when they get new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I use and wash my brushes constantly and these are easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> she loves them and feel amazing quality would absolutely recommend for any daily makeup user!</li>
            <li> My makeup is so much easier to apply and looks more professional when using the correct brush for each task.  </li>
            <li> Overall, not unhappy, but I think you can find better.</li>
            <li> Not only am I pleased with the product, but we had a minor issue and their customer service is BEYOND AMAZING.</li>
            <li> That is extremely important when you want good quality brushes that will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got them very fast.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this set if you are looking for some super soft makeup brushes with the convenience of a handy pouch.</li>
            <li> When i ordered these i was really excited to use new brushes</li>
            <li> These are nice, solid, high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I usually spend between $10-30 a brush so this set is an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> but my makeup goes on much better than the last brushes I owned.</li>
            <li> The metal top has separated from the wooden bottle and is awaiting an application of gorilla glue to see if it will work going forward.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes, have officially made them my daily use brushes.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but when I first received the makeup bag it smelled from the glue.</li>
            <li> First I wanna get this issue out of the way.</li>
            <li> Passed the &amp;#34;pull test&amp;#34; I do to make sure I won&#x27;t have brush hairs all over my face later.</li>
            <li> them before you use them a first time.</li>
            <li> Better yet, the TamiJade Essential Makeup Set comes with a roll up storage bag.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very affordable!</li>
            <li> I have used several of them already and love them.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> and I love the variety for different types of makeup.</li>
            <li> like paint/chemicals when first opened (although the smell did go away after a day)&lt;br /&gt;-one or two bristles sticking out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first time using a couple of the brushes</li>
            <li> Had a funny smell to it and</li>
            <li> I really like these!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended :)</li>
            <li> Much softer than the brush I had!  </li>
            <li> I bought a set to try first before I get a set for each of my bridesmaids.</li>
            <li> I love them and will buy only these brushes if I ever need to reset.</li>
            <li> either the whole thing or split up!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Soft, luscious brushed with more size variations than I realized I needed!  </li>
            <li> Nice all black look and super super soft</li>
            <li> The blush brush is a little small but for a kit that will fit in your purse easily and make you look amazing its fine.  </li>
            <li> I bought  these brushes because i needed something new, quick, and affordable .</li>
            <li> And since I&#x27;m new to the whole professional world of make-up and contouring, I wasn&#x27;t sure which brushes to use.</li>
            <li> I love how professional and stylish these all black brushes look.</li>
            <li> The case is good enough, but I don&#x27;t expect the case to last years and years.  </li>
            <li> The soft flexible bristles cover much more of my face than my old brush did.</li>
            <li> awesome, my only complaint will be that I have had them for a month, and the powder brush and the angled brush popped off the handle on mine.</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice when your brushes arrive is that they come in a super cute black case.</li>
            <li> When you first open the package, there is a strong &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> 7 piece brush set of the essential and most popular brushes girls use everyday.</li>
            <li> The pack pretty much have every type of brush she wanted.</li>

            <li> Super soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> They are super soft and when I washed them, there were no shedding.</li>
            <li> Now I know how to be sure they are truly completely dry after cleaning.</li>

            <li> I like them so much.</li>
            <li> much more than expected</li>

            <li> High Quality!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very &amp;#34;girly girl&amp;#34; however these brushes help me to apply my makeup easier and more evenly.</li>
            <li> My daughter wants a set.</li>
            <li> washed all of the brushes and out of 7 brushes only TWO hairs came free.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>

            <li> but these are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely will refer this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Spend a few extra bucks and get a good set, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> the brushes are super soft and seem really high quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received other brushes in silk type holders and I can&#x27;t stand touching that type of material, so I never ended up using the brushes.</li>
            <li> helps blend in the makeup in a very appealing manner so it doesn&#x27;t just stay up like a thick layer of application rather smoothly blends in each application that&#x27;s meant for an individual brush.</li>
            <li> These were better than I expected!  </li>
            <li> I notice I pick these brushes up more than other brushes I have at my vanity.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes -  does not leave little black brush remnants on my face, like cheap brushes can do.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem to made very well and after a weeks use still look brand new!</li>
            <li> The brushes even come with a plastic over for help keeping them extra clean and</li>
            <li> The brushes as so soft and easy to use and they are extra gentle on my skin.</li>

            <li> Two of the brushes shed a little, but the others far exceed my expectations--soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the brushes with super soft and flexible bristles.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important because you DONT want to be picking little bristles out of your freshly applied foundation.</li>
            <li> I will buy this set again when I need new brushes!</li>
            <li> I washed these before using them on my face and did not see any shedding of the bristles like you typically would with many makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> All made to the highest quality and kept together in the lovely black case.  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of the concealer brush in particular.</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes for different applications.</li>

            <li> They feel very natural and the application from foundation powder, to blush/bronzer &amp; eye shadows is much easier &amp; better looking than the stubby brushes I had previously.</li>
            <li> Very soft and made very well.</li>
            <li> They are very soft!</li>

            <li> I only wear make up casually but absolutely love these easy to use and clean brushes.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER owned makeup brushes this soft in my LIFE!!</li>
            <li> So soft and well made!!</li>
            <li> They will not get stained and they can withstand a little alcohol to take out more oily or creamy products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over the fact they&#x27;re so soft!!</li>
            <li> All you need is in this cute 7 piece set with a cute/stylish little case for them to keep them all together and not all over the place.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft, although maybe a little too soft.  </li>
            <li> They apply make up very well, professional type brushes.</li>
            <li> They feel cheap, and the synthetic bristles are rough.</li>

            <li> The two sizes of eyeshadow brushes allow me to try out some more complicated looks and it always comes out smooth and blended without much effort.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li> The matte handles allow for me to apply my makeup without the brushes slipping from my grip (which is a HUGE plus).</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes because the bristles are soft and the hand is sturdy and sleek.</li>
            <li> the tools used for applying and the simple useful tips that can come along with them for customers like</li>
            <li> Overall worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like this set of brushes because it has everything you need to out on a normal around of makeup and some added detail.</li>
            <li> Not too many, not too few,</li>
            <li> The set would have been better if they had included one fluffy, dome type eye brush.</li>
            <li> and even come in a black roll up case to store them in! :)</li>
            <li> Just as good as the bare materials brushes I&#x27;ve used for forever, if not better!</li>
            <li> Only issue is that the tops came off of the handle but glue puts it back together fine</li>
            <li> I had so many brushes from at least a dozen different brands and this set is by far superior and costs less than what I have paid for one brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are normal size and not small ones.</li>
            <li> appreciate the effort put forth by TamiJade to introduce new users like me to their company and product.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the effort put forth by TamiJade to introduce new users like me to their company and product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been needing some new brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend $24 on one brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new</li>
            <li> I had been putting off buying new makeup brushes for a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;grown</li>
            <li> I honestly stopped even trying to use them after using both the blush brush (too soft) and the eyeshadow brush (too hard).</li>
            <li> Super cheap, either too soft or too hard to be useable.</li>
            <li> I like it comes with a black pouch for easy transport and protection.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing for me would be a nice fluffier brush to blend out eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them to any makeup user, new or professional.</li>
            <li> These are high quality brushes - incredibly soft.  </li>

            <li> They are very soft and does the job.  </li>
            <li> but  from what I learned about professional or high quality makeup brushes is that&#x27;s</li>

            <li> Very soft and applied my makeup well.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft.  </li>
            <li> This is an absolute must-have for the budding professional or seasoned veteran, or anyone that loves applying makeup.</li>
            <li> But as an adult using high quality products, these brushes are sub-par.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and includes the essentials in make up application brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and look like they&#x27;re high quality.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and dont fall apart while using them.</li>

            <li> These are professional brushes without having to pay the outrageously high price.</li>
            <li> Very soft and don&#x27;t seem to fall apart as alot of makeup brushes do.</li>

            <li> Very soft and give an even application.</li>
            <li> I like the Brushes they are very soft works</li>

            <li> The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft, pick up color well, and sturdy handles.</li>
            <li> Each brush is well made and so soft!  </li>
            <li> When I open the case that comes with the brushes, the whole thing smelled like spray paint or/and chemicals!</li>
            <li> these brushes are extremely soft!</li>
            <li> They are all so soft and work so well with my products!</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> not sure if it was from the brushes or the carrying case - but after a day or 2 of airing out I don&#x27;t notice it any more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a small, thin, slanted brush that is PERFECT for lining the eye!</li>
            <li> The handles are a nice diameter for both small and larger hands.</li>
            <li> They also include an eBook on the different uses for each brush, which will come in handy for a makeup amateur like my friend.</li>
            <li> They were heavily scented with a strong type chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Also I had to let them &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; for a few days because of the strong chemical, plastic smell (I think its from the roll).</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft on my sensitive face!</li>
            <li> Such quality brushes, I have become a life customer and will certainly recommend to friends and family.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have them long enough to clean them.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft and almost tickle when I use them due to their softness.</li>
            <li> Each brush comes with a clear plastic cover.</li>
            <li> – it features a snap to close the roll, and a clear plastic piece to cover and protect the brush bristles.  </li>
            <li> I finally got rid of all my old brushes and now have a matching set, in a convenient case that keeps them organized and travel ready.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, well made and</li>
            <li> the only issue is my foundation brush seemed to shed so much</li>

            <li> They are really soft and flexible for all kinds of makeup application.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, but don&#x27;t seem to hold the make-up as well as my natural hair brushes.</li>
            <li> while these brushes look and feel soft to the touch .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into makeup and these have helped a lot, plus they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes are beyond professional.</li>
            <li> I really like the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft and flexible, contouring to my face when I use them.</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference they make when applying my makeup, especially the foundation brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so so soft.</li>
            <li> TamiJade 1 Professional Make up brush..</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t seem to have much if any fall out when using, which is a big deal!!  </li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for my sister to replace her OLD set.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re no where near as soft as Too</li>
            <li> I would not use these if you&#x27;re a self respecting adult.</li>
            <li> My foundation and bronzer used to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; in my old brushes</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are REALLY soft which makes it easier to apply your makeup.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> They are so soft and well made.</li>
            <li> They are soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-each brush is neither too light nor too heavy in your hand</li>
            <li> They are so soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and high-quality.</li>
            <li> They are holding up well so far.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is the bag where they are saved as it smelled really plasticy.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, no problems.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and makeup applies evenly.</li>
            <li> The bristles are silky soft.</li>
            <li> They are soft yet durable.</li>
            <li> All brushes are velvet soft.</li>
            <li> and so far no shedding of the brushes.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes were sent to me for a complete review</li>
            <li> I was surprised how the seller gave me updates every step of the way.</li>
            <li> Brushes seem soft and pliable</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and distribute my make up evenly.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (face).</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, packed with plenty of bristles, and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> This 7 piece brush set by TamiJade is heavenly soft.</li>
            <li> She has never had a complete &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; for use before.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and they don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li> I like the way they don&#x27;t let a lot of the powder blush fall off like with my old brushes.</li>
            <li> They are soft, and I am not a make up person</li>
            <li> This TamiJade Professional Make</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, well made and</li>
            <li> smell means your brushes have been properly treated to protect the synthetic fibers so the brushes hold their intended shape and form as well as protect them from unwanted bacteria and parasites while in storage and during transport until they reach your door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mostly been using my Bestope brushes for everyday makeup</li>
            <li> I love that this makeup set includes the everyday essential makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> They are nice and soft and the varying shapes make it so you aren&#x27;t confused about which brush to use for what.</li>
            <li> I was NOT expecting such high quality brushes, but I am SO pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> High quality brushes can so expensive; I was juggling to find a place in my budget because the cheap ones just aren&#x27;t worth wasting my money on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> They come in a small bag which I really liked and overall seem really solid.</li>
            <li> They come wrapped in a convenient carrying case that folds up small enough to be able to put in your purse.  </li>
            <li> I hope they make a fan brush and bigger contouring and blending brushes with the same exact quality as these soon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them to anyone, and I will definitely repurchase.  </li>
            <li> They are made of such high quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and not cheaply made at all.</li>
            <li> The bristles look super soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I have very expensive name brand brushes that don&#x27;t even feel or work close to how great these brushes do.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I use shadow brushes that are longer like sigma, with long bristles but these are flat little paddle brushes, they don&#x27;t really pat on shadow well and don&#x27;t blend easily, but are soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last night I used the foundation blush to apply a mask and washed it with brush cleaner and the brush didn&#x27;t lose any hairs and looks just like new this morning.</li>
            <li> No single problem so far.</li>
            <li> set seems to be well suited for someone just starting out with more complex makeup techniques.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear minimal make up, but what I have tried to really like so far.</li>
            <li> Complete With The Essential Cosmetic Brushes You Need For a Natural or Glamorous Look</li>
            <li> I own some of the more expensive makeup brushes available and TamiJade brushes are of comparable quality but much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I generally use sponges but after ordering these I&#x27;m converted to brush blending and clown contouring.</li>
            <li> I replaced these with some old brushed.</li>
            <li> I plan to take these to my next makeup class (my friend is a professional makeup artist) to show off to my friends.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft enough, but I can&#x27;t get over the smell!</li>
            <li> They are soft and make applying my make up very simple.  </li>
            <li> The set contains every brush you could possibly need to complete your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft yet sturdy at the same time.</li>
            <li> The powder brush is fluffy and and absorbs just the right amount of loose/setting powder.</li>
            <li> The roll is just the right size for everyday use and/or travel.  </li>
            <li> No loose hairs at all.</li>
            <li> I use them daily and no other brushes for me from now on.</li>
            <li> These jet black brushes look as dark as a raven and feel as smooth as cashmere.</li>
            <li> I used to be super lazy and only use 1 brush for everything.</li>
            <li> With the foundation brush, only a small amount of product goes a long way as the soft flexible bristles cover much more of your face than the stiff bristles on my old brush</li>
            <li> All the eyeshadow brushes are pretty dense and firm.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and they weren&#x27;t all shiny and stiff like some of the other synthetic brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them just due to their softness.</li>
            <li> High quality construction and applies eye shadow extremely well.</li>
            <li> The bristles are steady &amp; firm but soft enough to cause no discomfort.</li>
            <li> So far the make-up used with them seems to apply evenly, just have to dab a little extra on - right now - due to the newness of the brushes...</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any bristles come loose</li>
            <li> I really like that the brushes and metal are solid black.</li>
            <li> The ones provided are just a little too dense to get that smokey look really blended</li>
            <li> I was in need of some new brushes, and I don&#x27;t know if I will ever buy any other than these.</li>
            <li> Some of the big ones are a little softer and don&#x27;t hold as much product as a denser brush</li>
            <li> They are soft, but hold your makeup so when you put it on you can actually see the makeup go on, vs other brushes where you have to apply and apply and apply.  </li>
            <li> They are SO soft and extremely well made.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend spending a little time reading and watching the downloads.</li>
            <li> The set includes a powder brush, an angled blush brush, a foundation brush, a concealer brush, a large and a small eyeshadow brush and an angled eyebrow brush.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall I have found so far was the smell.</li>
            <li> , I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush, I do not use, I don&#x27;t like flat paddle makeup brushes so..</li>
            <li> quality brushes with no apparent shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same application make up brushes for way too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only time will tell how long they will last</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at doing make-up but these brushes certainly make it easier.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a makeup lover and looking for soft brushes, and tired of stiff, cheap brushes that shed you should try these brushes.</li>
            <li> You will receive a set of 7 makeup brushes in a soft black case.</li>
            <li> Very soft but firm and not flimsy.</li>
            <li> Power brush, angled blush brush, concealer brush, foundation brush, large eye shadow brush, small eye shadow brush, and an eye brow brush!</li>
            <li> and I will be using them a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional makeup artist but with these tools I feel like I am..</li>
            <li> and you can use them for different things other than what they are specified for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a month now and haven&#x27;t had any hairs fall out during application like I do with my more expensive brushes!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these but have still been unable to use them, weeks after purchase.</li>
            <li> black carry roll is soft and durable and extremely well stitched.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Example: I thought all my brushes were dry.</li>
            <li> : I thought all my brushes were dry.</li>
            <li> I had already washed and hung my go-to brushes to dry, so I broke these out in a pinch.</li>
            <li> The slanted liner brush is firm enough to line the upper and lower lid if you want to.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a 7 piece set that inlcudes the powder brush, Angle blush brush, the foundation, concealer, a large and small eyeshadow an angle eyebrow brush and the black brush roll.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are hand-made of synthetic hair, and none of my brushes have shed a single hair.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any loose hairs fall</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t and still have not found a loose thread anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have paid big money in the past for individual brushes and this collection rivals those.  </li>
            <li> There is a smell upon opening, but nothing a little air and an initial wash can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these brushes a little while ago, and its been about 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Some brushes are often hard and irritate my sensitive skin....</li>
            <li> not too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li> With the foundation brush, only a small amount of product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> minimal hair loss from brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only con was the smell from the case but that eventually went away after a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these brushes for a few months and the foundation brush is already falling apart...</li>
            <li> After a few uses those brushes won&#x27;t have any bristles left since they&#x27;re falling out about 10 at a time.</li>
            <li> does what it says, emphasis of color on the center and blends its out to the edge.</li>
            <li> Some can dry in a few hours, while others may take up to even a few days to dry properly.  </li>
            <li> The blush brush bristles are a little too long</li>
            <li> The sleek handles make them easier to blend and couture with than some of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> Only thing is, I wish they would have came with a lip brush... :/</li>
            <li> not so with these brushes, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these over other brands, any day.</li>
            <li> Brushes were just as described in other reviews. .</li>
            <li> plan on putting a few of these in my professional kit, keeping a few, and gifting a few.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve moved into other products requiring brushes I hadn&#x27;t used.</li>
            <li> I mean totally dry after only a day because</li>
            <li> I mean totally dry after only a day because</li>
            <li> Some can dry in a few hours, while others may take up to even a few days to dry</li>
            <li> The faux leather case is pleasant to the touch and doesn&#x27;t drive me insane as some packaging</li>
            <li> The cases end up being too big and hard to store.</li>
            <li> Sadly after only using these brushes after a few weeks my brushes have started to completely separate from the handles.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes December 2nd to replace a set of brushes I have had for at least 10yrs.</li>
            <li> Other than that we give them five stars!</li>
            <li> all know how frustrating it is when you open your makeup bag and see that the bristles of your favorite brush have been bent and broken, rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li> In the mundane routines of everyday life, I actually feel a little glamorous while using these brushes!!</li>
            <li> Brushes come in a black roll case, in plastic.</li>
            <li> In this set, there are 7 brushes and a black roll in which to store them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of brushes and hate how stiff and scratchy most of them seem to be, these are nothing like that.  </li>
            <li> The package came with a little pamphlet with instructions on how to use each brush which is helpful for beginners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a little while now</li>
            <li> like not even like a little bit..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the flat &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; brush or the &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; brush, not because they&#x27;re not good, just because they are too flimsy for my liking.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little firmer.</li>
            <li> Usually they are too flimsy, too stiff, rough on the face, etc.  </li>
            <li> I give 5 stars to these brushes they are not cheap at all</li>
            <li> I use them everyday to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a few days now</li>
            <li> A few eye makeup brush and brow brush as well.  </li>
            <li> I am an everyday mom who needed some brushes.</li>
            <li> I feel that softer brushes dont take to the product as well as what firm brushes do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its been a few months</li>
            <li> I do not notice the smell other reviewers complained about.</li>
            <li> the hair seems a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> the bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff and they had no packaged smell upon opening.</li>
            <li> I have been trying them out for the past 30 minutes</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re no better than any of the run of mill brushes you&#x27;d find at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> The smell is so hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at doing makeup, but this brush set makes me feel like I at least have hope!  </li>
            <li> So delicate!</li>
            <li> It makes a mean cat eye!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes a few weeks ago to expand my meager collection.</li>
            <li> The smell decreased after washing, but it is still there.  </li>
            <li> just a bad apple in the lot other than that can&#x27;t beat the deal</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and order them you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I like them, they  look expensive.</li>
            <li> Sadly one broke, though that was my son&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup brush addict just as much as I&#x27;m addicted to makeup!</li>
            <li> They do have a weird odor though.</li>
            <li> I hate spending money on brushes just to find out that the bristles are so hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about makeup</li>
            <li> :( Will have to replace it soon.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Buy these you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is VERY disappointing.</li>
            <li> The brush heads on the foundation brush and concealer brush have already started to come off of the base.</li>
            <li> I hate putting on makeup</li>
            <li> but the odor was very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re terrible.</li>
            <li> Has a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Terrifying).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these brushes for about a week but my makeup goes on much better than the last brushes I owned. However, the company keeps emailing me directly since my purchase to ask if I have any questions and if I am enjoying my purchase. Never had this happen before on an Amazon order but if they could stop emailing that would be wonderful. There is an unsubscribe link but I don&#x27;t need 6 emails asking if I enjoy my purchase.</li>
            <li> Brochas de muy buena calidad.  Estuche practico, cantidad de brochas ideal!!</li>
            <li> Love the quality of the brushes they are very soft .  Great product will defiantly order again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. Bought them for my self then bought another set for my daughter. The bristles are  soft but work great.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes.  I am a vegetarian &amp; I prefer synthetic brushes over animal hair.  These are high quality brushes - incredibly soft.  I am a fan of the concealer brush in particular.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for about a month and really like them with the exception of the foundation brush.  The metal top has separated from the wooden bottle and is awaiting an application of gorilla glue to see if it will work going forward.  Bristles are nice though, no shedding or breaking, seem to work well.</li>
            <li> Not only am I pleased with the product, but we had a minor issue and their customer service is BEYOND AMAZING. Truly a great experience. Thank you TamiJade Cosmetics! We will buy from you again.</li>
            <li> These brush are soft and nice. But come with some plastic smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes, have officially made them my daily use brushes. Very soft and pick up the powdered pigments amazingly. There is a smell upon opening, but nothing a little air and an initial wash can&#x27;t get rid of. Will be watching this brand for future sales!</li>
            <li> What a fantastic set of brushes!  Conveniently portable, perfect for travel with the handy carrying case included, superb quality, at an astoundingly affordable price. I love that these are animal friendly yet there is no sacrifice on quality.  These brushes are soft, well made and essentially everything you would need.  They pick up product and distribute evenly and flawlessly. I could not be more satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Love them!!! they’re soft and do a wonderful job distributing my makeup</li>
            <li> These are great makeup brushes. Very soft and made very well. I have a ton of makeup brushes but find myself always using these! My only wish is that there was a looser eye makeup blend brush in the kit but overall great!</li>
            <li> High quality brushes, works well to put on makeup. Initially had a very strong plastic smell but has since gone away</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, great selection, and overall good quality</li>
            <li> Perfectly good set of brushes. When you first get them, there is a strong smell from the plastic packaging. That will air out. The bristles do not fall out and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Easy to use, good application,  minimal hair loss from brushes.&lt;br /&gt;only thing was a strong smell when first opened- but it&#x27;s going away as I leave them to air out.</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes, good quality.</li>
            <li> Very soft nice brushes</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality of these brushes!</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes . They apply make up very well, professional type brushes. I have try so many makeup brushes so i can compare and this are ones of my favorites. The size is very good too. I have clean the brushes many times already and they are still great ! I haven&#x27;t had any problem . The quality is very good !</li>
            <li> I own some of the more expensive makeup brushes available and TamiJade brushes are of comparable quality but much less expensive. Last night I used the foundation blush to apply a mask and washed it with brush cleaner and the brush didn&#x27;t lose any hairs and looks just like new this morning. I&#x27;m very impressed with the entire set. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Great brushes so far!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are great quality and I&#x27;m glad I purchased them!</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes.  Great case to carry them around in.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great brushes and soft but they have such a funky smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to my brushes. I really like the eye brushes the most.  Some of the big ones are a little softer and don&#x27;t hold as much product as a denser brush would but they are still good for finishing powders.</li>
            <li> These Brushes from Tami Jade are exceptional and very soft. All the brushes are shed free and they apply blend and pack color. I give 5 stars to these brushes they are not cheap at all and you can use them for different things other than what they are specified for.</li>
            <li> Love this set of makeup brushes. They are the best. Great quality.</li>
            <li> My wife love these! I&#x27;m a hero!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful makeup brushes!  I am so thrilled with the quality of them and the variety of brush sizes and shapes.  I have paid big money in the past for individual brushes and this collection rivals those.  I wish I found these brushes sooner....they are awesome.  Go ahead and order them you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The smell is so hard but it is so nice to use. I like it!</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes I was fortunate eniugh to snag via a special promotion. Lucky me!</li>
            <li> I had gotten this set as a gift for my fiance. She absolutely loves it! She had brushes but not as a complete set and the travel case that it comes in completes it even more. I&#x27;m glad that I got this and she is very excited to have it so that makes both of us happy! Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> Great brush set! Really high quality. No shedding at all. They are very well made. They apply my makeup flawlessly. Feel great on my skin. Nice and soft. The larger brushes have plastic protectors. All come in a beautiful case. I really like that the brushes and metal are solid black. I am happy to recieve this set to review. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price got the FB offer to try them they arrived super fast the brushes are super soft and seem really high quality the only issue is my foundation brush seemed to shed so much it almost fell apart prob just a bad apple in the lot other than that can&#x27;t beat the deal</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! They are super soft and when I washed them, there were no shedding. The prices was very affordable and the shipping was a breeze. I find myself reaching for these brushes more than my higher end brushes because the quality is that good!</li>
            <li> Discounted price.  I think if we ever need to put on make up these will be great!</li>
            <li> There was an odor to these gloves.  I have had them for a while and it is still there.  I am hoping it will soon go away so that I can figure out how to use all of them.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are extremely soft. Everything you need is in this set. I wear a tinted moisturizer and concealer and using the TamiJade brushes, application is flawless!  The quality is fantastic and the bristles don’t fall out.</li>
            <li> Beautifully designed brush set. They are really soft and flexible for all kinds of makeup application. Brushes come in a black roll case, in plastic. Excellent quality and I would definitely recommend these brushes. *sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be a beginner&#x27;s set. When you first open the package, there is a strong &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell. The case is good enough, but I don&#x27;t expect the case to last years and years.  The brushes are soft, but don&#x27;t seem to hold the make-up as well as my natural hair brushes. I like this set, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at doing make-up but these brushes certainly make it easier.  They look great and are great quality.  I&#x27;ve tried all types of brushes and hate how stiff and scratchy most of them seem to be, these are nothing like that.  They&#x27;re so soft and better yet - help apply makeup flawlessly.  The brush holder roll is so nice and great for travel.  And the e-guide that comes with this order is full of helpful tips.  I highly recommend these brushes.  Great seller as well.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty amazing! Excellent coverage, very well made. I will buy this set again when I need new brushes!</li>
            <li> I bought  these brushes because i needed something new, quick, and affordable . while these brushes look and feel soft to the touch . they could not hold a powder or eye shadow whatsoever. i tried it time after time and the powder always fall through . i had to use my old sigma brushes which surely did not disappoint .</li>
            <li> Great set! I love the brushes and they were the perfect first set for me. I&#x27;m just getting into makeup and these have helped a lot, plus they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great deal for the price! I have used them for a few weeks and love them!</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes great packaging , everything i need for my makeup - can&#x27;t wait to use</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes for days.....I love getting new makeup brushes!  These really serve their purpose and are great for applying shadows, liners, concealer, blush, etc.  It&#x27;s a great multipurpose set. This would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> Really nice set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the carrying case that the brushes arrived in. So convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> These are some quality makeup brushes.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a set of brushes for themselves or their kit.  The brushes can be used with cream or powder which is a real plus.  I have told all my FB friends about this set.</li>
            <li> This TamiJade make-up brush set are of high quality and really well made. it&#x27;s a 7 piece set that inlcudes the powder brush, Angle blush brush, the foundation, concealer, a large and small eyeshadow an angle eyebrow brush and the black brush roll.  They are made of synthetic hair, really easy to clean, I can use them with both cream or powder makeup products and they do well on either.  I loved the way they were packaged, and will recommend them to family and friends</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. There are well made, and easily cleanable. Great price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great customer service! I loved the brushes and the bag but when I first received the makeup bag it smelled from the glue. I was told to let it air out for a few days which I did and now everything it great! I love this product and the travel bag! 😄😄</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! The foundation brush is so much better than the *high price* one that I bought when I bought my foundation. I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes are beyond professional. The complete set of different size is awesome for a newbie or someone who is a pro doing make up. I was offered this product  at a reduced price but this is a unbiased  review and it solely based upon my usage of this product. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was an outstanding brush set!&lt;br /&gt;This brush set is very professional looking. The only downside is that I have had some bristles fall out while doing my makeup. Otherwise this is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a small, thin, slanted brush that is PERFECT for lining the eye! I have never been able to use shadow for liner before this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I love the large blush brush to line my cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is perfect for traveling with my makeup! I just went out of town for a couple of days, and this carrying case is easy to add on to my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is fantastic! I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is love..love...love!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of make up brushes &amp; wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but these are very high-quality. they make Applying Your mineral pigments easy &amp; go on so smooth.  I would recommend them to anyone they are flawless.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!!!! I have NEVER owned makeup brushes this soft in my LIFE!! I seriously love these brushes so much! I have not had any loose hairs fall and they are really easy to clean! These brushes pick up the product perfectly! I can not tell you enough at how happy I am with them! The case is so nice I love the style of these brushes they are very trendy! The packaging is great too I love all the information on the box and the additional card in the box!!</li>
            <li> shipped fast, good quality. Love the case they came in!</li>
            <li> Love my makeup brushes.  They are very soft and does the job.  I really like the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes that are packaged in a very nice leather pouch - each brush has its own spot - and I was even able to add a few my other ones!! So far the make-up used with them seems to apply evenly, just have to dab a little extra on - right now - due to the newness of the brushes...Kind of like your hair after a fresh shampooing - it&#x27;s always better on day 2, once some natural oils distribute!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these brushes. They are incredibly soft and flexible, contouring to my face when I use them. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding of bristles and I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Okay..I loved these when I saw the photo on box when I got them. They are a beautiful black and have nice matte finish. First I wanna get this issue out of the way. I hear and read about how people tend to judge brushes as being cheap or something about the chemical odor they smell when they get new makeup brushes. Yes, these have that odor but  from what I learned about professional or high quality makeup brushes is that&#x27;s smell means your brushes have been properly treated to protect the synthetic fibers so the brushes hold their intended shape and form as well as protect them from unwanted bacteria and parasites while in storage and during transport until they reach your door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mostly been using my Bestope brushes for everyday makeup looks. Which I love and I have others I&#x27;m fond of as well. Oh! but these darlings are my *Brand New Love. They look and feel elegant, classy and sophisticated. They are the SOFTEST brushes I have found so far, they are practically baby soft and they perform just an beautiful as they look. The sleek handles make them easier to blend and couture with than some of my other brushes. I can really see the difference they make when applying my makeup, especially the foundation brush. It blends my liquid foundation so well. I get a real clean flawless look. No tiny creases or speckling. The flat angel brush is simply masterful and the blush brush softly glides over my cheeks. I LOVE them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black carry roll is soft and durable and extremely well stitched. I didn&#x27;t and still have not found a loose thread anywhere. It won&#x27;t fall apart in a couple weeks or months after you bought it. The brushes fit nice and snug but you don&#x27;&#x27;t have to struggle to get them in or out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You receive eBook when you order. It&#x27;s is one of the best I have seen so far. It&#x27;s visually beautiful with simple step by step by step instructions on how to use them and take care of them. I&#x27;m crazy about makeup the tools used for applying and the simple useful tips that can come along with them for customers like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example: I thought all my brushes were dry. I mean totally dry after only a day because of course they felt like they were. Now I know how to be sure they are truly completely dry after cleaning. Some can dry in a few hours, while others may take up to even a few days to dry properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the effort put forth by TamiJade to introduce new users like me to their company and product. I&#x27;m grateful for tips and the assistance with using their FANTASTIC Makeup Brushes. Thank you SO much!!..:-)&lt;br /&gt;I was given the product at a discount in exchange for an honest review and my opinions are my own.that can come along with them for customers like me.

            <li> I love the synthetic composition. They&#x27;re easy to use, and even easier to clean</li>
            <li> I am actually VERY surprised at how much I enjoyed these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I bought them for a dollar, the company emailed me a code to use for the purchase and then asked that I review them, so here I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blush brush is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t shed it&#x27;s so so soft. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The angled powder brush, also amazing, doesn&#x27;t shed, just as soft, I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush, I do not use, I don&#x27;t like flat paddle makeup brushes so..eh&lt;br /&gt;All of the eye shadow brushes I&#x27;m not a fan of.I use shadow brushes that are longer like sigma, with long bristles but these are flat little paddle brushes, they don&#x27;t really pat on shadow well and don&#x27;t blend easily, but are soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my one dollar, I am beyond impressed by these brushes. I don&#x27;t know how much these retail for, but if you&#x27;re looking for a nice travel brush set, these are awesome. I would highly recommend them just due to their softness. I think it&#x27;s a great buy for under 10-20 dollars.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for anything you can think of. Very soft bristles and don&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> High quality.  I like that there is various sizes to choose from.  I used to be super lazy and only use 1 brush for everything.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes a couple of weeks ago and I love them. My foundation goes on super smooth and the eyebrow brush helps me fill in little spots to get the perfect brows!</li>
            <li> This set of makeup brushes is so beautiful!  And I love how easily and smoothly it helps me put my makeup on in the mornings.  Each brush is well made and so soft!  They are by far the best makeup brushes I have ever owned and I will be using them a long time.  And I know where to find them when I need another set!  My favorite brush is the angles blush brush.  It just seems to put the blush right where I want it and it blends it perfectly!  These brushes make doing my makeup each morning a joy again!</li>
            <li> I love makeup brushes! Some brushes are often hard and irritate my sensitive skin....however, so glad I found these TamiJade brushes! Not only are they soft and gentle on my skin, easy to clean, and professional, they also come wonderfully packaged and have their own little carrying case!!! Only thing is, I wish they would have came with a lip brush... :/</li>
            <li> Very impressed with these brushes!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter love he brushes.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the bristles on these brushes are super soft and are of great quality!</li>
            <li> When I open the case that comes with the brushes, the whole thing smelled like spray paint or/and chemicals! The case and the brushes! It was like inhaling a sharpie or something. Decided to return it without using it or trying to wash the smell from the brushes. They were super soft and look like they were good quality but I just couldn’t.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good quality and a good assortment of sizes for the price.</li>
            <li> Very great high quality make up brushes! Would recommend for any MUA</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Passed the &amp;#34;pull test&amp;#34; I do to make sure I won&#x27;t have brush hairs all over my face later. Love the packaging. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I loved the set......very good quality with affordable price. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Totally love my new brushes...they are very soft and amazing quality...i own several brands of makeup brushes and this one is already a favorite!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes! Very soft and apply makeup wonderfully! The folding case they come in make it easy to locate and to travel with. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very soft and applied my makeup well.</li>
            <li> Blown away by the quality of these brushes. I ha a promo code so they were very inexpensive. They are sturdy and and have good handles. I love these!!</li>
            <li> bought these to keep in my dancer&#x27;s bag for performances.  they do an excellent job.  do not lose hairs &amp; are perfect for different types fo make up.</li>
            <li> These are great. I love every single brush in this set. Ive ordered another set I like them so much. They are VERY nice quality. Very soft but firm and not flimsy. Def Recommend.</li>
            <li> high qaulity. super soft brissels. much more than expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on wearing makeup but needed a college set for when I do decide to wear some. Great set. Everything I need in one convenient pouch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised how beautiful these brushes are. Great value. The company followed up with a guide right way.</li>
            <li> Great brushes!  Very soft and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> These are great! I use them everyday to apply my makeup. The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the foundation brush sheds one or two bristles when I use it.</li>
            <li> wife&#x27;s review --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality brushes with no apparent shedding. Well priced for the level of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash them before you use them a first time.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Perfect set, includes all you need for daily applications.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a perfect brush set for a perfect makeup TamiJade 1 Professional Make up brush.. If for you... Great quality.. I loved this product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> love them..cant believe I got them for such a deal!! thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing set of brushes! I love that they are full size brushes in a convenient roll up pouch so you can still take them with you on the go.  It&#x27;s the perfect for every day use and great for traveling as well. 4/28/15 UPDATE - I&#x27;ve had these brushes for almost two months now. While I still enjoy using the brushes they are already starting to show wear. On the two brushes that I use most, the metal part that connects the brush to the handle is loosening and wiggling like the metal part is going to fall off soon. I haven&#x27;t lost any bristles from the brushes, however if the entire brush falls off the handle it doesn&#x27;t matter how well the bristles stay in the metal.</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes but the arrived smelling like spray paint.</li>
            <li> I ordered these with special pricing to do a review. They are really nice and in a nice case. The only con was the smell from the case but that eventually went away after a few days.</li>
            <li> Very soft. Ease of use is awesome. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best brush sets that I have purchased.  I love how soft the bristles are and how the handles feel in your hand.  They come wrapped in a convenient carrying case that folds up small enough to be able to put in your purse.  This set would make a great gift for someone just starting with brushes. I can see them holding up really well with care.</li>
            <li> Super fab brushes!!  And I love the packaging!  I&#x27;ve received other brushes in silk type holders and I can&#x27;t stand touching that type of material, so I never ended up using the brushes. The faux leather case is pleasant to the touch and doesn&#x27;t drive me insane as some packaging does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are really high quality and much better than what I had anticipated when I purchased!! The foundation brush is actually the perfect size to get around the creases around your nose, etc. the brushes sizes are a good variety to have on hand and would make s great starter set for someone just beginning to get into makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft, and they feel good on the face to me.  The don&#x27;t seem to have much if any fall out when using, which is a big deal!!  Overall, I&#x27;m pretty impressed by the quality with these!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have since become among the most used brushes I own and I own about three complete sets of brushes.  I can&#x27;t convey how much I love these!!  Please note that the white cup displayed in one of the pics does NOT come with this set, It came with another set I have received....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**. I received this at a promotional price, however my thoughts and opinions are 100% honest and my own!</li>
            <li> These are great.  Very soft.  Only issue is that the tops came off of the handle but glue puts it back together fine</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for my sister to replace her OLD set.  She seems to like them.  I have not tried them out myself, however when she opened them, I cleaned them for her.  The brushes seems fairly dense and did not shed during or after cleaning. her makeup appears to apply more evenly with this set.&lt;br /&gt;There was a mild smell from these poly case, but not the overpowering experience some reviewers have reported.&lt;br /&gt;This set seems to be well suited for someone just starting out with more complex makeup techniques.&lt;br /&gt;If I use these I will update review with my experience.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for my niece. She really liked the quality and how her makeup was applied.</li>
            <li> What a great quality set of brushes for a reasonable price. The case is quality too.</li>
            <li> OMG these brushes are amazing .Great  quality workmanship that has gone into each brush(a set of 7 brushes), but there is nothing in comparable softness to these remarkable synthetic bristles.No matter what the look, whether it be girl- next-door natural, or a smoldering sexy for a night out look , these brushes can do it all.I can rest easy knowing you have the absolute best tools to create your perfect appearance. Better yet, the TamiJade Essential Makeup Set comes with a roll up storage bag. It&#x27;ll fit perfectly in your purse, so you can take your beauty skills anywhere! This is an absolute must-have for the budding professional or seasoned veteran, or anyone that loves applying makeup.I brought this for my sis-in-law and she absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt; I received this product to test in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these brushes for a few months and the foundation brush is already falling apart...:( Will have to replace it soon.</li>
            <li> tarte maracuja bronzing serum</li>
            <li> Really nice quality brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice, high quality! I&#x27;ve been using them for a month now and haven&#x27;t had any hairs fall out during application like I do with my more expensive brushes! Sometimes you don&#x27;t get what you pay for! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> These fancy brushes are women&#x27;s best friend ,they shape the new look we want .These are the fashion tools .....All said and done they are something that should be smooth so the makeup applied should blend in softly and nicely without a crease on the skin.These makeup brushes that I orederd from Tami jade cosmetics are perfect in that case.These come In a  nice case .They have nice bristles that are well shaped .It helps blend in the makeup in a very appealing manner so it doesn&#x27;t just stay up like a thick layer of application rather smoothly blends in each application that&#x27;s meant for an individual brush.All the brushes serves it purpose like the blush the eyeshadow etc.I am very happy with the quality and the price I paid for it.My review is based on my personal experience from the use of this product and is unbiased.I totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this brush set!  High quality construction and applies eye shadow extremely well. Great price! Thank you for the speedy delivery!  Am recommending to friends.</li>
            <li> I like them, they  look expensive. However the foundation brush could be better. Overall worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes for different applications. Strong durable bristles.</li>
            <li> These brushes are OK... They aren&#x27;t the best and they aren&#x27;t the worst. the hair seems a bit stiff. However they work perfect for what I wanted them for and that a spare brush set to carry with me for emergency makeup application!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and nice on my skin, they apply make up and eye shadow etc pretty good. And you don&#x27;t really need more than 7.</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> My daughter said she loves the feel of these makeup brushes...Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this brushes very high quality would defendtly but again</li>
            <li> This brush set it so nice. My girls and I really like them. They help my makeup go on really smooth. I got them very fast. Thank you</li>
            <li> Soft and good quality brushes. They allow makeup to glide on but not stay on the brush. The tutorials were also useful.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s the best kit of brushes that I&#x27;ve ever tried 😍</li>
            <li> My husband bought these for me. He made a great choice. This is an amazing set that has all the brushes I need and a great little storage case. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the brushes with super soft and flexible bristles. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> Soft and amazing at blending. I generally use sponges but after ordering these I&#x27;m converted to brush blending and clown contouring.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality.  Two of the brushes shed a little, but the others far exceed my expectations--soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Like it! All the brushes are pretty good</li>
            <li> Honestly, these are great for anyone starting out with makeup. But as an adult using high quality products, these brushes are sub-par. They feel cheap, and the synthetic bristles are rough. They&#x27;re no where near as soft as Too Faced&#x27;s Teddy Bear brushes (which I would recommend). I would not use these if you&#x27;re a self respecting adult. I returned them immediately.</li>
            <li> My wife got these and she loves them. These are now her main brushes to do makeup.</li>
            <li> these brushes are extremely soft! i love them. I replaced these with some old brushed. good for the price and does what it needs to do. The package came with a little pamphlet with instructions on how to use each brush which is helpful for beginners.</li>
            <li> Very affordable! Great quality! Work well! The only thing is some of the brushes are smaller, so I would use them for different purposes than they are defined. Great deal!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes a couple weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been so busy with work I haven&#x27;t been able to take a time to do a review. This a a really nice set of brushes that would be great as a gift or to add to your own brush collection. They come in an attractive black carrying case and with every order they give you instructions for how to wash and care for your brushes. They are nice and soft and the varying shapes make it so you aren&#x27;t confused about which brush to use for what. I&#x27;m just now starting to explore my face as a palette for makeup so these brushes allow me to do that with ease. I plan to take these to my next makeup class (my friend is a professional makeup artist) to show off to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a little while now and I absolutely love them! They are so soft and gentle. Makeup brushes tend to irritate my skin, but these haven&#x27;t given me any issues! My foundation and bronzer used to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; in my old brushes and I would always have use more product to get any converge, not so with these brushes, a little goes a long way! My personal favorite is the angled brow brush, I use it as an eyeliner brush and it works PERFECTLY!  The two sizes of eyeshadow brushes allow me to try out some more complicated looks and it always comes out smooth and blended without much effort. All the brushes came in a nice leather folio that is perfect for storage and traveling, would even work for putting eyeliner pencils and mascara in it. The handles are solid and good quality. I haven&#x27;t had any issues loosing bristles either. I will be definitely looking into more products by TamiJade and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend these brushes to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I really like this set of makeup brushes and I think they will be my go-to travel brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft enough, but I can&#x27;t get over the smell! The whole set smells just like acetone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same application make up brushes for way too long. It was really nice to change them out for these make up brushes. I really appreciate the quality &amp; variety in sizes. They feel very natural and the application from foundation powder, to blush/bronzer &amp; eye shadows is much easier &amp; better looking than the stubby brushes I had previously. I really like the carrier case for travel as well. In the mundane routines of everyday life, I actually feel a little glamorous while using these brushes!!</li>
            <li> These were better than I expected!  Even rounded cut of bristles, nice handles and they come in a snazzy convenient holder.  I would recommend to my own friends and family.  Even bought one for my mom after I received mine.  She loved the set.</li>
            <li> Soft, luscious brushed with more size variations than I realized I needed!  Easy to clean and no shedding!</li>
            <li> Really great brush set, especially for the price. I was surprised by the quality of the brushes. Came in a very nice roll-up case which helps to protect the brushes and make them easy to bring along while traveling. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for a great price. Good quality!</li>
            <li> Edited: 7/12/15 I have had the brushes for 3 months now and they are falling apart. The wood stick will no longer stay inside of several of the brushes. Although I really like them a lot and would love to keep using them, I have to throw them out and continue on my search of a great make up brushes that last longer than 3 months. I think the sellers/makers need to find better glue/adhesive for them.   These brushes are awesome. I have used several of them already and love them. They are soft, but hold your makeup so when you put it on you can actually see the makeup go on, vs other brushes where you have to apply and apply and apply.  The only down fall I have found so far was the smell. When I open the package it smelled like paint. Could be because of where they were stored at but the odor was very unpleasant. After a couple of days, the smell went away.</li>
            <li> Bought these to take on a trip.  Nice case and the brushes were full and worked well.</li>
            <li> High quality brushes. Love the .</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!! Exactly what I was expecting and great price. Awesome customer service. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> These brushes came in an awesome case that snaps shut.  It keeps the brushes very well protected. Also great for Traveling.  These brushes are REALLY soft which makes it easier to apply your makeup.  Very good quality brushes. I will be recommending these to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Not bad!!! Pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been needing some new brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend $24 on one brush. What a great price for amazing brushes!! They are so soft and well made. I also love the case! I&#x27;m going to have to remember these for gifts!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice makeup brush set.  It&#x27;s very soft and includes the essentials in make up application brushes. I like the black brush roll that it comes with and makes it great for storage and taking it on the go. The brushes are easy to clean and so far has not shed.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great and I love the variety for different types of makeup. The case folds up smaller which is nice because I can take them with me and they stay secure in their spots. So far I haven&#x27;t had any bristles come loose which is often the problem with brushes. This set is just perfect for all my makeup needs.</li>
            <li> Awesome and fantastic product!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for the price. No bristle fallout which is a plus. They are soft. Just not as plush as I feel they should be. Do a decent job at picking up and applying the product. I do have cheaper brushes that do a better job but I am a brush snob.</li>
            <li> The angled eyebrow brush alone is worth the cost of this bundle!!! It makes a mean cat eye! It&#x27;s perfect, from the size to the stiffness.  I had this set for a while before I actually put it to use.  I had already washed and hung my go-to brushes to dry, so I broke these out in a pinch. They have exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds!!! They are all so soft and work so well with my products! They&#x27;re easy to clean, too.  The foundation brush doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. The powder brush is fluffy and and absorbs just the right amount of loose/setting powder. The shadow brushes are great for blending and packing on liquid/powder/pigment.  But the star of the show is for sure the angled eyebrow brush! I haven&#x27;t actually used it for my brows (I use ABH&#x27;s #12 spoolie/brush combo with Dipbrow and/or Brow Wiz). Do this...get some Inglot AMC gel liner and buy this set. You&#x27;ll LOVE the result! Don&#x27;t thank me, thank TamiJade!! I received promotional pricing for this item and agreed to provide my honest feedback, which you see here.</li>
            <li> Ordering this set of make up brushes I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It was the first full set I had ever ordered. But upon receiving them, I was totally impressed. They are SO soft and extremely well made. These aided in the application of my makeup and made it look so natural.&lt;br /&gt;To all brush beginners I would recommend these!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best make-up brushes that I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I am so looking for a brush that will work best for me and this is it! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great price for great brushes! I am happy I was lucky enough to stumble across a special offer for these brushes on Facebook. I have tried other brands, but these brushes are the best. Easy to clean as well. I definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> I was NOT expecting such high quality brushes, but I am SO pleasantly surprised! The packaging is adorable and the brushes are sturdy, and the bristles are soft and so easy to clean. Thanks for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Very happy! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> These high quality brushes  are very nicely made and come with a large variety. They are Professional brushes for sure!</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for all your brush needs. Makes putting on your makeup like a work of art. The bristles are steady &amp; firm but soft enough to cause no discomfort. I would highly recommend them to any makeup user, new or professional.</li>
            <li> This is the Best Brand! Won&#x27;t use another, Great Product - Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> Bought these for the wife. She thinks they are pretty good quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- SUPER soft and plush&lt;br /&gt;-each brush is neither too light nor too heavy in your hand&lt;br /&gt;-handle is perfectly designed to fit in your hand&lt;br /&gt;-picks up makeup really well&lt;br /&gt;-application of makeup looks flawless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-smelled like paint/chemicals when first opened (although the smell did go away after a day)&lt;br /&gt;-one or two bristles sticking out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell how long they will last but I imagine my my wife will get really good use out of them before they need to be replaced. Would recommend to others. :)</li>
            <li> I recently received these brushes and they are really great so far. I wear minimal make up, but what I have tried to really like so far. They are very soft! The eBook is nice as the attachment for help keeping up with them.</li>
            <li> I received these make up brushes with a discount, and I was honestly expecting a not so great product because of the price. I&#x27;m happy to say that I was WRONG! I&#x27;ve experienced no shedding with these brushes yet, they are easy to clean, and are an excellent quality product. They work great too. I plan to even purchase a couple more to give as gifts! I&#x27;d recommend these over other brands, any day. Very happy I decided to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality, does everything I expected, and it comes in a nice carry case</li>
            <li> Amazing set for the price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a few days now and I must say that I&#x27;m very impressed. They have a nice feel to them and they are smooth and soft on my face. I love them. I doubt that I&#x27;ll ever purchase any other kind of brushes because these are just that fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, I&#x27;m super impressed!  I usually spend between $10-30 a brush so this set is an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> Im new to learning the art of &amp;#34;blending&amp;#34; makeup, so I thought I would get a nice set of blender brushes to practice with. Tami Jade nailed it with this one. These are nice, solid, high quality brushes. Ive not had the randoms come off on my face as Im applying foundation. That&#x27;s important because you DONT want to be picking little bristles out of your freshly applied foundation.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good quality. My wife super love it. And i highly recommend this thank you.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and look like they&#x27;re high quality.  My first time using a couple of the brushes the bristles started falling out.  After a few uses those brushes won&#x27;t have any bristles left since they&#x27;re falling out about 10 at a time.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. I personally use younique make up , &amp; these brushes are perfect for all of my needs :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves it.  The pack pretty much have every type of brush she wanted.</li>
            <li> When i ordered these i was really excited to use new brushes but when i got them they REAKED of paint thinner. like not even like a little bit.. like my husband walked into the kitchen and asked me what that smell was..</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeee it! Excellent customer service too. had it for over 5 months. No single problem so far.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful makeup brushes. They are so soft and do not shed. There is a brush for every need. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Item just as described. Had a funny smell to it and not really a big fan of the quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes -  does not leave little black brush remnants on my face, like cheap brushes can do.</li>
            <li> These brushes came in a cute travel case and are very soft. Works well with shadows and powders.</li>
            <li> Great brushes well made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to purchase this TamiJade make-up brush set for a while because of all the great reviews. So when the opportunity presented itself to get it a promotional price as a product tester, I jumped at the opportunity. When I first opened up my kit, I did&#x27;t want to use it because the brushes where so nice and very professional looking. And since I&#x27;m new to the whole professional world of make-up and contouring, I wasn&#x27;t sure which brushes to use. But with purchase comes a free ebook download and video library. I highly recommend spending a little time reading and watching the downloads. It taught me a lot on how to use each type of brush and what type of make-up to use it with. After using a couple of the brushes, I can see the difference in the way my make-up looks now versus before this set. The brushes are soft and high-quality. Each one handles nicely and comes in a perfect, easy to-go case. Great addition for any make-up artist, beginning and advance.</li>
            <li> The brush heads on the foundation brush and concealer brush have already started to come off of the base. The blush and powder brush have held up better. I like the texture of the brushes though.</li>
            <li> Good sized brushes in a nice carrying case for easy travel.  Wished they were a bit softer but they blend well and the bristles aren&#x27;t falling out with daily use.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They have soft bristles and the quality is exceptional.  There is a brush for everything you need when buying makeup brushes.  They come in a very nice roll up storage bag that will fit in your purse. They also come with a free ebook download and video library that helps with learning proper care and maintenance of the brushes. Also makeup tips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these brushes.  They are soft and make applying my make up very simple.  They are holding up well so far.  Sadly after only using these brushes after a few weeks my brushes have started to completely separate from the handles. I had brushes prior to this last years. This is VERY disappointing. I&#x27;m not happy with the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are Amazing they feel soft and work great.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome!!! The only thing I dislike is the bag where they are saved as it smelled really plasticy. Overall these brushes are great and are absolutely worth it</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product.  The brushes are great. However, the case smells like paint fumes.  I sat it outside to try in order to air it out. It&#x27;s been there for two days and still smells. I was going to give it as a gift but the smell is off too off putting.</li>
            <li> This brush set is very nice! Good quality,very very professional</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!  These are great quality makeup brushes.  I am very impressed.  I would highly recommend them to anyone, and I will definitely repurchase.  These brushes are great!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a makeup artist of any experience level. Super soft, easily builds color and beautifully blends for a seamless look.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly impressed. Got them on offer. Totally worth it. Wish I would have grabbed another set at that price for a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this set, I use the foundation, eye shadow, eyeliner ones the most. I use a different sephora one for cheeks because I like the angled ones. Soft bristles, no problems. It comes with me on every trip I take. Set is a great value, easy to clean. Overall, such a great quality set that provides great application.</li>
            <li> Set has a great mix of brushes. The set seems very well made and the brush tips have a really nice feel.</li>
            <li> OMGeeeeee I love this brush set!!!</li>
            <li> I needed new brushes and these are nice, even for a newbie like myself. Very good quality with no shedding.</li>
            <li> So, I fell for all the 5 star reviews, most of which had to be from people who received these brushes for free. They&#x27;re terrible. Super cheap, either too soft or too hard to be useable. I honestly stopped even trying to use them after using both the blush brush (too soft) and the eyeshadow brush (too hard). Spend a few extra bucks and get a good set, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes!!! The bristles are soft and makeup applies evenly. So happy I found these brushes. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> Item as described.  I love using the brushes to apply my make-up.</li>
            <li> After  receiving the brush set I was not disappointed. The brushes are super soft and they weren&#x27;t all shiny and stiff like some of the other synthetic brushes I&#x27;ve used. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft, professional grade brushes. The case is very handy and keeps the brushes well organized and clean. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and most importantly there has been no shedding from the brush hairs. AWESOME</li>
            <li> Loved the case, the brushes are super soft - giving this to my makeup aficionado sister as a Christmas present. She&#x27;s gonna be psyched! Thanks so much :)</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice when your brushes arrive is that they come in a super cute black case. The case makes it easy to take the brushes wherever you go. The quality of the brushes is fantastic. The brushes are very soft and dont fall apart while using them. The set contains every brush you could possibly need to complete your beauty routine. I am happy that I was able to try these brushes through a promotion from the seller.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality. I have included these into my makeup routine and I am very satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li> I love that this makeup set includes the everyday essential makeup brushes. Most sets have too many brushes that I never use or need. I end up overpaying and having too many brushes. The cases end up being too big and hard to store. This set is just right! It&#x27;s the perfect size for every day use and great for traveling. You will receive a set of 7 makeup brushes in a soft black case. The case has a plastic cover that is placed over the bristles of the brushes. This helps to keep the brushes clean from and dust and dirt. Another great thing about this case is that the plastic cover is also under the bristles of the makeup brushes. This helps to prevent makeup from getting in the pouch. Each brush comes with a clear plastic cover. The powder and blush brushes also come with a brush guard. These brushes are normal size and not small ones. The bristles are silky soft. I am thoroughly impressed with the softness. It has a velvety feel. I hate spending money on brushes just to find out that the bristles are so hard. They glide on your face smoothly and apply your makeup with perfection. They work great for cream and powder applications. These brushes are synthetic and are 100% cruelty free. The brush handle are made of solid wood. You will also receive a free ebook with your order. This will describe each brush and tell you what each one is used for. It will also give you some great cleaning tips. Also included are some great tutorials with step-by-step instructions on how to create certain makeup looks. What a great bonus! I received this product to test in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. This is a great makeup brush set for any age. It would make a great gift option too. I would definitely recommend this set if you are looking for some super soft makeup brushes with the convenience of a handy pouch.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great, i did not have any bristle fall out when I washed them so I an completely happy with these brushes!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up the makeup all that well.  The blush brush bristles are a little too long, I don&#x27;t feel that I can get a good grip.</li>
            <li> Brushes were just as described in other reviews. . .excellent quality, especially for the price, and minimum bristle loss. I love the roll case it came in! Very professional transaction with company follow-up to make sure the product met my expectations. Highly recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li> Best make up brust set! Thank you</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are awesome.  I use and wash my brushes constantly and these are easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Soft and amazing brushes!</li>
            <li> I really like these! Did not make my face itchy.... Always a plus!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes a few weeks ago to expand my meager collection. The carrying case is very nice and the brushes are super-soft. The handles are a nice diameter for both small and larger hands. I use the largest brush most often and it works great to blend in my powder over my BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the smaller brushes are too similar in size to provide the variety of sizes I would like for my eyes. If you&#x27;re looking for a value set of quality brushes to start with, these would good good.</li>
            <li> So delicate! I love these brushes! They are so soft! and even come in a black roll up case to store them in! :) love them! They are soft yet durable. The come individually wrapped and are very well made, a great deal on high quality super soft and durable brushes :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality. They are very soft and made well. Applies makeup very easy.</li>
            <li> I am so very happy with this brush set! The box was well packaged and shipped so fast. I love the case because it is soft and I am able to keep all the brushes in one place. The brushes even come with a plastic over for help keeping them extra clean and no worries about make-up getting every where. The brushes as so soft and easy to use and they are extra gentle on my skin. These are professional brushes without having to pay the outrageously high price. I got these for my teenage daughter that is getting into make-up so I love the fact that these came with an e-book to tell her all about the brushes and what they are used for! The brushes are also easy to clean! we love them!</li>
            <li> Wow! Some of the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Just got these brushes very nice good and soft well made so the ones I have before this order are now in the trash</li>
            <li> This brushes are amazing they are soft and great to work with!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to make-up and these are so easy to use! the bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff and they had no packaged smell upon opening. Will definitely consider ordering for gifts!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOOOOVE these brushes!  They are so soft and work great!!</li>
            <li> High Quality! Better then any brushes i ever bought! Well Worth the money! Buy everyone a set . You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes!! Definitely recommended :)</li>
            <li> 7 piece makeup brush set! Soft bristles and gentle on my face.  Picks up makeup easily.  Has a general Foundation brush which I use the most with my mineral makeup.  Much softer than the brush I had!  Has a contour brush for my contouring palate.  A blush brush. A few eye makeup brush and brow brush as well.  The basics to what I need with a makeup bag to keep clean and organized.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes in this set alone are worth the money. I&#x27;m so picky when it comes to brushes. Usually they are too flimsy, too stiff, rough on the face, etc.  These, however, perform just like high end brands. I&#x27;m not a fan of the flat &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; brush or the &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; brush, not because they&#x27;re not good, just because they are too flimsy for my liking. The angled &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; brush, is a dream though.  All brushes are velvet soft. The eyeliner brush is perfect to use for gel liner, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for brows. Overall, If you are looking for some great eyeshadow brushes, this is the set I would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Good brush set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution is to wash them immediately before use. They were heavily scented with a strong type chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Brushes seem nice so far.  Had to get rid of the holder....stinky plastic.</li>
            <li> Very well made brushes, clean beautifully. Makes my makeup application look flawless and comes in a beautiful Carry case which is perfect for travel or even just storage. I personally like to have them on display in a monogram cup on my vanity. A definite must buy! So happy I made this purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they are exactly what i needed, makeup goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Brushes pick up makeup just like they cost $100 brushes</li>
            <li> Beautiful and good quality. Very soft and don&#x27;t seem to fall apart as alot of makeup brushes do.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! The blush brush is my absolute favorite. It&#x27;s the perfect size and the cut is lovely. The angled brush is another favorite. I use it on my brows with Anastasia brow powder, and it gives me a wonderful, natural look. All of the brushes are great, but for me, those were the two &amp;#34;standouts&amp;#34;. The brushes are well made and are nice and soft. I received these at a promotional price for review, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I really recommend them!</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are very soft and I like the case they come in, although it does have a chemical off gassing smell that takes a while to dissipate. These would get a five star rating but unfortunately the foundation brush is much smaller than others I have purchased and is the brush I would use most often.</li>
            <li> Very excited to use these brushes. I&#x27;m not a make-up expert. I am an everyday mom who needed some brushes. They are super soft and apply make-up well. They come in a separated case. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my makeup very well. I&#x27;m not a very &amp;#34;girly girl&amp;#34; however these brushes help me to apply my makeup easier and more evenly. They are also very soft!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are great</li>
            <li> super nice, The best brush I ever had. Love it!</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes and I like that they come in a storage pouch. They were nicely packaged and individually wrapped. The bristles are super soft and almost tickle when I use them due to their softness. I liked the price and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I like this set of brushes because it has everything you need to out on a normal around of makeup and some added detail. I bought a set to try first before I get a set for each of my bridesmaids. I love the feel, makeup goes on nice and they are a good quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> Received these yesterday and used this morning.  Absolutely love them. Super soft brushes which not only feel amazing, but give the perfect coverage.  With the foundation brush, only a small amount of product goes a long way. The soft flexible bristles cover much more of my face than my old brush did. Love that they have a plastic covering over the brushes to prevent excess makeup rubbing off on the case.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!! So soft and well made!!</li>
            <li> This makeup brush set is awesome. The quality is so good and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes. My daughter wants a set.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Very soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft and look great.  I can tell already they will do a great job with dry and liquid make-up.  The only downfall, is the smell from the case is so strong…..its just like others described as paint or permanent marker.  Overwhelming…..airing out the case right now, hopefully it will dissipate soon.</li>
            <li> Nice set of portable brushes. They are soft and easy to clean. They blend well and so far no shedding of the brushes. I do not notice the smell other reviewers complained about.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these brushes a little while ago, and its been about 2 months now. I adore these. The quality is really good. I have a lot of make up brushes and these are my go to every day. They are still intact and holding strong even after daily use and weekly cleaning. They are super soft and not cheaply made at all. These are a very high quality brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality brushes in every size and shape for your every makeup needs. All this in a handy carrying case.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft on my sensitive face! Some brushes make my face itchy, not these :) Great value, too!</li>
            <li> Just as good as the bare materials brushes I&#x27;ve used for forever, if not better!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister as a gift for her college graduation. She really liked them and I thought the quality was very nice. They come in a small bag which I really liked and overall seem really solid.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes.  I like them.  Very soft and give an even application.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes at a great price, I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love make-up and make-up tools and these brushes are worth every cent. Love them! They were supposed to be a gift but I kept them and I&#x27;m so happy that I did.</li>
            <li> What super nice looking brushes these are! Got them as a gift for mom who needed some nice quality brushes and these are certainly it! Nice all black look and super super soft she loves them and feel amazing quality would absolutely recommend for any daily makeup user!</li>
            <li> I like the Brushes they are very soft works awesome, my only complaint will be that I have had them for a month, and the powder brush and the angled brush popped off the handle on mine. I bought one for my daughter and she had the same problem but with the angled brush only...</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes. They are extremely soft. I can easily apply my makeup and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding. You will not be disappointed with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes, they are super strong, durable and have not shed. I love them and will buy only these brushes if I ever need to reset.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes!  I gave these to my granddaughter- she loves to get anything relating to make-up.  She&#x27;s at that age!  She is also picky &amp; likes quality items.  She loves these!  A matching set of brushes for every type of make-up.  What a great deal! Thanks so much for offering these!</li>
            <li> High quality brushes in great leather case.</li>
            <li> My daughter spends hours doing Her makeup and lives these brushes! They are soft, give her great control and she looks great! She does wish that the brushes were individually labeled as to their specific function. Other than that we give them five stars!</li>
            <li> These jet black brushes look as dark as a raven and feel as smooth as cashmere. I have more brushes than I would ever need and these happen to be at the very top of my must-have and must-use list. The matte handles allow for me to apply my makeup without the brushes slipping from my grip (which is a HUGE plus). The hairs of the brush are extremely fine and pick up makeup with ease. I love it when a makeup brush can glide across my face without causing irritation or leaving hairs in their midst. These brushes were sent to me for a complete review and I must say they definitely passed the test. If they are in your price range, I definitely advise you to give them a try.</li>
            <li> Good set for the price</li>
            <li> This set is lovely. I use all the brushes daily and they are great as well as coming in a nice package!</li>
            <li> Good value, fast delivery, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I got this brush set for my teenager for her birthday, she was very happy with them and the quality of each brush.</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift for someone and she loves them!!</li>
            <li> For the Price the brushes are well worth it I just wish they were a little firmer. I feel that softer brushes dont take to the product as well as what firm brushes do.</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to say their customer service is phenomenal, very friendly and pleasant. The brushes are well made and have no issues with bristles falling out. They are very good at applying and blending out eyeshadow. They are compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I love these brushes...they are high quality, clean easily and are super smooth!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Works great!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes, love the bag they come in, keeps them organized. Contains all my favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price, smallest blush brush is perfect shape and size for my contouring powder application.</li>
            <li> I love the handle of the brush, very easy to use. Don&#x27;t really like the eyeshadow brush because it&#x27;s flat top, (I wish they had a blending brush) but I absolutely love the rest of the brushes, it&#x27;s very soft and it does not shed! It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes in a nice case. The bristles are smooth and work well</li>
            <li> These are my first set of brushes and I absolutely love them! Extra soft brushes that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, and a wide selection for putting on all my makeup. I highly recommend these brushes if you&#x27;re looking for your first professional set of brushes!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how the seller gave me updates every step of the way. The brushes just arrived today. When I opened the package I noticed a strong plastic smell so I am letting them air out before I close the package back up (they are a gift for a friend). Otherwise I am very pleased with the quality. The softness of the brush and sturdiness of the brush handle was very surprising. This set includes all of the essentials and has a great travel bag to protect brushes. I am confident that the company will correct any issues if the recipient finds any. They also include an eBook on the different uses for each brush, which will come in handy for a makeup amateur like my friend. So far I am extremely happy. I feel like the company showed outstanding customer service and made me feel like a valued customer.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes December 2nd to replace a set of brushes I have had for at least 10yrs. I didn&#x27;t even have them long enough to clean them. On Monday the powder brush came unglued. Very disappointed. I would definitely not buy them again.</li>
            <li> Just used them for the first time today and I am LOVING them, they apply makeup much better than most brushes I&#x27;ve tried in their price range!</li>
            <li> I washed these before using them on my face and did not see any shedding of the bristles like you typically would with many makeup brushes. Very soft and easy to work with these brushes are great and do most of the work when it comes to blending. The angles are perfect for each of their assigned tasks.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes, would highly recommend all makeup artist or not, brushes are sleek and stylish enabling a brilliant application of product whilst being extremely reasonable in price!</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend these makeup brushes enough!!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, they come in a super stylish case, which is the perfect size to pop in your handbag for use on the go! They also have a plastic covering over the brushes to prevent excess makeup rubbing off on the case - a brilliant idea to keep clean!!&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, they are the softest brushes I have ever come across! This not only feels amazing on your skin but also gives the perfect coverage. With the foundation brush, only a small amount of product goes a long way as the soft flexible bristles cover much more of your face than the stiff bristles on my old brush I was using!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, my favourite brush is the eyebrow brush. Big brows are in! Every brow brush I have used before is of a small size and takes time to achieve the perfect shape . (Including the most popular brand at present.) This brush takes one sweep to achieve the perfect shape. I could not be without this brush now I have found it.&lt;br /&gt;A brilliant find and a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love everything about these brushes!!! Highly recommend them!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great little brush set! I love to use these kind of synthetic brushes as a  makeup artist.  I love how they apply product and how they clean up so easily. This set is wonderful because they are actually really sturdy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles have a nice weight and they are nice and long to give you a lot of control as you apply product. I do not think these are an all inclusive set but they are an excellent set for a beginner. I love the blush and powder brush best of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed all of the brushes and out of 7 brushes only TWO hairs came free. That is pretty amazing for brushes. So the shedding is almost non existent. That is extremely important when you want good quality brushes that will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These synthetic bristles are idea for cream products. They will not get stained and they can withstand a little alcohol to take out more oily or creamy products. The only thing missing for me would be a nice fluffier brush to blend out eyeshadow. The ones provided are just a little too dense to get that smokey look really blended out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on putting a few of these in my professional kit, keeping a few, and gifting a few. This would make an excellent gift.. either the whole thing or split up!</li>
            <li> These brushes were amazing. So plush and sturdy. I really love how they are many and the price was great! Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I love these make-up brushes they are so soft and the bristles are just the right consistency. not too hard or too soft. A definite must have.</li>
            <li> Applies very smooth and excellent quality</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a makeup lover and looking for soft brushes, and tired of stiff, cheap brushes that shed you should try these brushes. I really like these brushes because the bristles are soft and the hand is sturdy and sleek. I would compare these to more expensive brands but for a cheaper prize. One thing I really liked about the brushes is that they came with a case. The case is very convenient for me since I can put them in my purse and reapply my makeup if need be. The case also has a faux leather feel to it which I like. All together I really enjoy this brushes and have been using them non-stop since I receive them!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the quality of these brushes!  Got my order really fast.  Love that I also received an ebook with instructions for applications and also maintaining these brushes.  Great Customer service with follow ups to my order, and making sure that I was 100% satisfied!  Thanks TamiJade Cosmetics, you have a VERY SATISFIED customer!</li>
            <li> Has a horrible smell. Washed them immediately and threw away the case on it. Brushes seem soft and pliable</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft, although maybe a little too soft.  I like stiffer brushes for my blush and eyeshadow brushes. Also I had to let them &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; for a few days because of the strong chemical, plastic smell (I think its from the roll).</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes !!! Best quality I have ever gotten for that price .</li>
            <li> Bought this and LOVE it! They&#x27;re so soft and distribute my make up evenly. Sadly one broke, though that was my son&#x27;s fault. I can&#x27;t get over the fact they&#x27;re so soft!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good makeup brushes! Nothing spectacular, but a good basic set. Great pieces included though.</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice quality, love them so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup brush set as a gift and I&#x27;m very happy with the quality. The variety is excellent- from powder and foundation to concealer and a variety of brow and eye shadow brushes. Not too many, not too few, just the right number of brushes that a normal woman would use in the morning to get ready for work or errands. The bristles look super soft and fluffy. These brushes come in a beautiful pouch, and every brush has an individual cover to ensure cleanliness. I&#x27;ll be proud to gift these! (The 1D fan in me also fangirled to see these were manufactured in the UK.)</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, My makeup went on beautifully and the quality is great..Definitely worth buying these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Great, affordable brush set. The company sends you care instructions when you purchase them, they seem like they&#x27;re high quality, and feel wonderfully soft on my face. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I soooo love this! They are so soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (face).</li>
            <li> I really like the variety in this brush set - pretty much all you will need.  They are sturdy, a nice size to easily handle and come in a nice storage pouch.  All in all, a great purchase.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I only wear make up casually but absolutely love these easy to use and clean brushes.</li>
            <li> Cute brush set, works great!</li>
            <li> I gave this brush set to my daughter and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup brush addict just as much as I&#x27;m addicted to makeup! I love finding a good quality set of brushes that applies my makeup smoothly and flawlessly. I was very happy with this set of brushes from TamiJade Cosmetics. This set is great for anyone in any level of makeup application whether a beginner or novice. The brushes are soft, packed with plenty of bristles, and don&#x27;t shed. This set comes with a brush for everything needed in a daily makeup routine. Power brush, angled blush brush, concealer brush, foundation brush, large eye shadow brush, small eye shadow brush, and an eye brow brush! I love how professional and stylish these all black brushes look. They are made of such high quality craftsmanship. The included pouch is great to keep all the brushes together while traveling. I notice I pick these brushes up more than other brushes I have at my vanity. I love the foundation brush and eye shadow brushes the most. The foundation brush never leaves any streaks and provides a flawless foundation application. I&#x27;m very impressed with this brush set and will continue to use them for a long time. *Sample provided for review and testing*</li>
            <li> I Love Everything about this TamiJade 7 Piece Professional Quality Brush Set; from the velvety soft brush quality, to the brush guards, and nicely protective brush roll case with under and over brush head guards.  The roll is just the right size for everyday use and/or travel.  I had been putting off buying new makeup brushes for a while.  High quality brushes can so expensive; I was juggling to find a place in my budget because the cheap ones just aren&#x27;t worth wasting my money on.  Problem solved!  I like to actually use a product for a while before giving a review.  There has been no shed.  The application is smooth and even.  Such quality brushes, I have become a life customer and will certainly recommend to friends and family.  TamiJade even includes a free ebook to download for assistance in use and care.  Quality!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! I hate putting on makeup but I&#x27;ve been wearing it more often because I get so excited to use these brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Received this with a promotional discount and so far have been happy! The brushes seem to made very well and after a weeks use still look brand new! For the price they can&#x27;t be beat! So much more affordable and still great quality than the high priced ones!</li>
            <li> I been using this and i love it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this for a friend</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and so affordable!</li>
            <li> This 7 piece brush set by TamiJade is heavenly soft. They feel great to hold in hand and make me feel like a makeup professional. The brush handle is crafted from solid wood, it is in perfect weight and length for easy application. The brush is plush and smooth, makes applying makeup so easy and evenly. I like it comes with a black pouch for easy transport and protection. It is a great makeup brush set and can be an awesome gift for girl friends.&lt;br /&gt;I got it at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The above is my unbiased review for this product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these brushes and appreciate that they work as expected and can be easily washed.  The bristles are very soft and feel great on my skin.  They come in a nice soft black case that is very convenient as well.  All in all a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set of makeup brushes.  I am so happy to have the opportunity to purchase this brush set during a promotion, because I&#x27;ve wanted to upgrade my makeup brushes for some time.  In this set, there are 7 brushes and a black roll in which to store them.  The set includes a powder brush, an angled blush brush, a foundation brush, a concealer brush, a large and a small eyeshadow brush and an angled eyebrow brush.  My makeup is so much easier to apply and looks more professional when using the correct brush for each task.  These brushes are hand-made of synthetic hair, and none of my brushes have shed a single hair.  The bristles are so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know how frustrating it is when you open your makeup bag and see that the bristles of your favorite brush have been bent and broken, rendering it useless.  I don&#x27;t think that will happen when you use the brush roll included in this set.  I really like the brush roll – it features a snap to close the roll, and a clear plastic piece to cover and protect the brush bristles.  The quality of this brush set is exceptional and I look forward to using them for a long time.  Also included in this purchase is an ebook which shares hints and tips on how to care for and get the most from your brushes.  It tells the best way to clean the brushes as well as shows examples of how to get specific makeup looks using this brush set.</li>
            <li> I love these make up brushes.  I tried them the minute I got them.  They are easy to clean and handle really well.  The blush brush is a little small but for a kit that will fit in your purse easily and make you look amazing its fine.  The slanted liner brush is firm enough to line the upper and lower lid if you want to.  The foundation applicator is AMAZING.  Buy these brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; make up world. I wanted a brush set that wouldn&#x27;t be overwhelming (20 piece brush set? Terrifying). This set is great - it&#x27;s got a brush for all the basics and they work fantastically. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my make up, too! Super soft and they clean up perfectly with warm water and shampoo.</li>
            <li> A high quality makeup brush set! Thanks!</li>
            <li> well putting on make-up. These brushes didn&#x27;t shed when used and worked great. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> High end quality with an affordable price. I like these makeup brushes, not only did they feel super soft to the touch but they apply my makeup perfectly. I did not notice any shedding of bristles, which is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do like the brushes though - A nice variety of different sizes, Blush - Contour - Eye liner - Brow - Crease - Eye Shadow - Foundation...This set can apply each of those- I am not a professional makeup artist but with these tools I feel like I am..I can easily get the look I am going for! - A complete starter bundle or good addition to brushes already owned. I was provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The most Amazing brushes I have ever used so far...Very soft on ur skin and the application when using is just Awesome!!! I def. recommend these over any brushes I have used, A Must Have for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these.  She has never had a complete &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; for use before.  She likes how there is the proper tool for the job no matter what she is doing.  I purchased this product at a reduced cost.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes today and immediately were impressed with how soft they were.  I have been trying them out for the past 30 minutes and I have to say, I really really really love them! I was in need of some new brushes, and I don&#x27;t know if I will ever buy any other than these. Time will tell if they last, and I will update If needed. But as for now, I highly recommend these brushes! Great value!</li>
            <li> They were decent for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no pro so these work great for what I need and for the price it was a good purchase. TJ Customer Service followed up to make sure I was happy with my purchase. I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Its been a few months and I&#x27;ve moved into other products requiring brushes I hadn&#x27;t used. I really love this set, everything I need and they feel great.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these but have still been unable to use them, weeks after purchase. The overwhelming chemical smell on these brushes hasn&#x27;t diminished at all. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes. Can&#x27;t wait to use them all.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really good. They do have a weird odor though.</li>
            <li> I had so many brushes from at least a dozen different brands and this set is by far superior and costs less than what I have paid for one brush. I finally got rid of all my old brushes and now have a matching set, in a convenient case that keeps them organized and travel ready.  I love the high quality of these brushes!!! I changed my rating  from 2 stars to 5 stars  because I had a problem with one brush. I am so impressed with this company&#x27;s prompt customer service, they took care of my issue immediately!!</li>
            <li> The best brush i have, very nice great quality.</li>
            <li> These are well made and very soft.</li>
            <li> These are the best makeup brushes I have ever used! So soft!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect brush set.  All you need is in this cute 7 piece set with a cute/stylish little case for them to keep them all together and not all over the place.  The brushes are soft and they don&#x27;t shed.  They are perfect, great for personal use or as a gift.</li>
            <li> Love love love these makeup brushes.  I have very expensive name brand brushes that don&#x27;t even feel or work close to how great these brushes do. No shedding what so ever and they feel so soft and gentle on my face and the best makeup application I have ever gotten from any other brushes for a fraction of the cost.my favorite is the foundation and concealer brushes. They work so amazing and apply makeup perfectly. I hope they make a fan brush and bigger contouring and blending brushes with the same exact quality as these soon. I will buy then in a second. Worth every penny. I recommend them to every makeup artist and makeup user. I use them daily and no other brushes for me from now on.</li>
            <li> great make up brushes. doesn&#x27;t shed like some I have used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to experiment with make up and this was an excellent set of brushes to start out with.</li>
            <li> Got a Facebook deal for these - the entire set with case for $10 with free shipping. For $10 I say go for it but they&#x27;re no better than any of the run of mill brushes you&#x27;d find at Target or Walmart. The case is nice to have if you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
            <li> Excellent I love these brushes.  These arrived really quickly and I am thrilled with them.  All made to the highest quality and kept together in the lovely black case.  I am really pleased and would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love it ! very good Quality</li>
            <li> This is a super great brush set. They are the most soft brushes I have ever used, and they remain that way even after washing. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am used to my make up brushes splintering and the bristles falling out but these are very sturdy. I like the way they don&#x27;t let a lot of the powder blush fall off like with my old brushes. I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these brushes!! They are so easy to use</li>
            <li> I love the case and brushes.  I travel for work often and packing these brushes is awesome!!</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes, no shedding.  I highly recommend washing them before you use them.  They will feel better and be softer.  I found they do not pick up a lot of product at one but, that is no big deal.</li>
            <li> These are amazing soft and easy to clean.  They come in a nice case for storage.  May get more for my daughter&#x27;s friends!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality of bristles. I love the carrying pouch that the brushes came in and the number of number of brushes I received. I would recommend these brushes to a friend.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Work great and do not fall apart.</li>
            <li> This awesome set of brushes came in a really nice package to keep them all together.  I&#x27;m not very good at doing makeup, but this brush set makes me feel like I at least have hope!  These would make a very nice gift.... very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> 7 piece brush set of the essential and most popular brushes girls use everyday. Makeup brush set for ages. Complete With The Essential Cosmetic Brushes You Need For a Natural or Glamorous Look</li>
            <li> For the price- these brushes are amazing- I would gladly pay 4x&#x27;s the amount. The bristles are very soft, pick up color nicely and feel great on my skin. I am a hoarder of good eyeshadow brushes and these two made it into my regular routine (a lot don&#x27;t). I also have never used and angled brush for blush and tried this one out- does what it says, emphasis of color on the center and blends its out to the edge. I have not tried the foundation brush yet- and actually will likely use it as a blending brush instead, I have a beauty blender I use for makeup. Win win here! Buy these you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are the beset brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. Soft, well made, great storage pouch.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Very soft, pick up color well, and sturdy handles. Best of all? They are cruelty free!</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice. They are soft, and I am not a make up person but they seem like they are good quality. I gave them to my cousin and she was so excited.</li>
            <li> I bought these on my husband&#x27;s prime account.&lt;br /&gt;When you first open it will smell kind a like paint but after about an hour or so it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are good quality, no loose parts falling out, they maintain their shape.&lt;br /&gt;They are really soft and I love the leather case that holds it.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re as expected.</li>
            <li> Great set!  Love these!</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes! I especially love the instruction book for added help!</li>
            <li> Excellent set of make up brushes and this is coming from a makeup artist! This set is great for on the go since it comes in a little travel case.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!  The brushes are soft yet sturdy at the same time. No loose hairs at all. There was a bit of a chemically smell when I unpacked these - not sure if it was from the brushes or the carrying case - but after a day or 2 of airing out I don&#x27;t notice it any more. These are really a very nice addition to my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> I so love ths. Thank you so much. It is perfect for me starting on learning to do my make up. Absolutely will refer this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Awesome, great brushes</li>
            <li> Fantastic set of brushes! This TamiJade Professional Make Up Brush set is Conveniently portable, perfect for travel with the handy carrying case included, superb quality, affordably priced. When these they came in they had a weird smell to them but after washing them with soapy water It got better &amp; there was no shedding. These brushes are soft, well made and essentially everything you would need to use on a daily basis. They pick up product and distribute evenly and flawlessly. Very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> These are okay. When you open the case you will immediately notice a VERY strong chemical smell.  The smell decreased after washing, but it is still there.  I think this would be a good starter set if you are new to make-up, or if you want an extra set of brushes for travel, the office etc... But I do think there are better quality brushes on Amazon for a comparable price.  All the eyeshadow brushes are pretty dense and firm. The set would have been better if they had included one fluffy, dome type eye brush. Overall, not unhappy, but I think you can find better.</li>
