            <li>I love this item!</li>
            <li>Nice, albeit fleeting almond scent is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>It would absorb into my skin nice</li>
            <li>It can drip off, or for me slide off if you are warm</li>
            <li>There is just something warm and inviting about Almonds</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, soothing treatment for dry skin and great for eye make-up removal.</li>
            <li>Great for winter, super moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant and light almond scent, too.</li>
            <li>Best of all it has 3 all natural ingredients-with nothing unpronounceable.</li>
            <li>It is very mild, and the smell is light and pleasant (not perfume-y) which I like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it very lightly either under my moisturizer after I get out of the shower or in the morning under my makeup...but not both.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s the combination, perhaps not, but I am surplus grease-free, and have been enjoying a healthier complexion ever since.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love how the oil is packed in this cute purple glass bottle, and the way the dispenser(dropper) works.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this oil a lot.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love everything about almonds.</li>
            <li>I love to eat them</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of them.</li>
            <li>but I do feel better knowing it&#x27;s there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love beauty oils</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me feel moisturized like most oils do.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with it, enough to have bought it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One bottle has lasted me from January until now, so it&#x27;s cost-effective, even when I used a lot more in the winter.</li>
            <li>I love the argan oil for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>use Weleda Almond face wash with good success (I&#x27;m 33 and have severe rosacea).  </li>
            <li>I assume most people won&#x27;t use more than a drop or two a day.  </li>
            <li>I love Weleda as a brand &amp; their products.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>What can I say about Weleda - I love their products.  </li>
            <li>This facial oil smells wonderful and is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I have so many allergies.</li>
            <li>my skin looks more refreshed and I have not had ANY issue with additional oil or breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying 3-4 drops of this almond oil twice a day instead of my regular moisturizer and it has made my skin so happy!  </li>
            <li>I love to use it around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It feels good to know that there are no chemicals absorbing into my skin!</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice glow if you pat it in freshly washed skin and let it soak in.</li>
            <li>It feels so good and is very moisturizing...seems to plump my skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and use anytime.</li>
            <li>For me and my easily blemish prone skin that also reacts to products this works well.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a great stopper top that allows only a couple of drops out at a time, which saves you from over using.</li>
            <li>I am actually able to just wash my face in the morning with plain water and its perfect.</li>
            <li>My sister suggested using it with sugar as a light scrub.</li>
            <li>So smooth and light.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is so clean and pure!  </li>
            <li>The oil is not fragrance free (in my opinion) because I can still smell the sweet and distinctive scent of almond when I apply it on my skin.</li>
            <li>So even though I&#x27;ve been wary of oils since what I&#x27;ll call The Great Jojoba Mishap of 2012, I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about Weleda products that I couldn&#x27;t help trying it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this oil at night after I clean my face for about 2 months now</li>
            <li>bottle is very convenient, it is more like a dropper</li>
            <li>but it still smells good enough.</li>
            <li>I have purchased three bottles, which for me is significant because I love to try new products.</li>
            <li>I prefer Weleda&#x27;s almond moisturizer, because while the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have great benefits, at least it&#x27;s more soothing and calming on the face.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Well, the morning after I started using it the redness had already cleared up, and my skin just looks more supple and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that would be a good thing if you were already oily but for dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very sensitive area for me, but when I didn&#x27;t experience any immediate burning, I was able to breathe a sigh of relief.  </li>
            <li>It is chemical free and works very well.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find more natural products for my beauty regimen-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t testify for sure to the protection it offers</li>
            <li>Mostly it&#x27;s the packaging-- blue glass prevents light degradation, and the tip allows drop by drop dispensing.</li>
            <li>but I still like to use products for sensitive skin because if you can be more gentle to your face, than why not?</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend facial/skin care products easily, but this is a must-have for those suffering with rosacea, psoriasis and generally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I didnt like this product at first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product consistently for about 4 weeks now and while I didn&#x27;t suffer for any adverse effects, I can&#x27;t notice any difference either.  </li>
            <li>The Weleda Almond Soothing Product line is especially gentle on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>that even the most basic of skin care products make break out or rash.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product if you have dry skin or are looking for a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is also great to be used as a medium to help thicker facial cream (like Weleda Cold Cream) to spread more evenly on and absorb into the skin better.</li>
            <li>I had read good reviews of facial oils in general and this one in particular.</li>
            <li>It REALLY lessens the redness, is easily absorbed into my skin, seems to be calming and is of a high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs relatively quickly (it&#x27;s oil, it won&#x27;t absorb completely, and that&#x27;s part of the point of oil).</li>
            <li>I put my usual undereye concealer on after the oil, and it went on much more smoothly, without any caking up.  </li>
            <li>I had also tried pure argan oil before this one, and it made my face hurt.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use much each time and the bottle has a controlled dropper so you won&#x27;t mistakingly over pour.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have very dehydrated, ultra-sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use for a night time, it&#x27;s really works very well.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was very hopeful of its effectiveness and living up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those reasons, I&#x27;m very cautious about what I put on my face, and I don&#x27;t like to do a lot of experimentation.  </li>
            <li>I started out very cautiously, just dabbing a dot of oil underneath both of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried some very spendy oils, creams, and lotions.  </li>
            <li>it works very well for me .</li>
            <li>I love that this product has minimal scent.  </li>
            <li>It is nice, but not any different than buying a cheaper one at your local store.</li>
            <li>You would think that putting an oil on the oily parts of my face would result in more breakouts, but because it has controlled my oil production, I actually have barely any</li>
            <li>Love it...make my face feel so soft and provides good coverage for the incoming cold winds.</li>
            <li>The main way I use it is to add 2 drops to a dollop of my Nivea cream, work them together, and apply as a night cream in the summer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product, and you only need to use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to discover this face oil after doing some research on natural cosmetics and essential oil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have all that sensitive of skin</li>
            <li>The Soothing Facial Oil is designed to calm and nourish and provides a protective barrier for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thirty eight years old, I really need to take care of my face.</li>
            <li>The almond oil is non-irritating, and did not cause break-outs, and I have normal to combination skin.  </li>
            <li>ive tried numerous oils to help my extremely dry, flaky winter skin but most make be break out.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with eclos moisturizer which I live but may try this line moisturizer since I do like the oil.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hesitant when it comes to using new beauty products.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin to the point where it gets chapped and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have combination dry/oily skin and this has helped reduce the excessive dryness and make my skin more even looking.</li>
            <li>It was my first facial oil ever</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also excellent to help relieve the sensitive skin around your nose when you have a cold!</li>
            <li>My skin is way less red after using this for a couple months now and feel much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but penetrates deeply to reduce the dry tightness you can get in winter.  </li>
            <li>And recently I used it on my legs after a very close shave inflamed my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I started using this in conjunction with quitting coffee; I was fed up with adult acne.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>However, it is a natural scent derived from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>And did I mention that my skin is extremely sensitive, too?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had reactions to some facial products/moisturizers that are so intense that my eyes have swollen shut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my oily, sensitive and break out prone skin.</li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>This facial oil and the Weleda Baby Oil are my new staples for the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Really does wonders for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>but since half the products I buy end up in the garbage because they irritate my sensitive skin, I&#x27;d been reluctant to shell out the cash for this pretty spendy brand.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other higher priced facial oils, this one is a bargain.  </li>
            <li>Although the price seems a little high, a little goes a long way with oils like this, so I have a feeling it won&#x27;t come out to much more than my old moisturizer in the long run.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to scent and chemical, I&#x27;d recommend you to try it in a small amount first to see how your system would react to it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Because of the design of the cap and the band around the neck of the bottle, it is not sealed very tightly, it might spill when it does not stand up right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this product is worth it.  </li>

            <li> bottle is very convenient, it is more like a dropper</li>
            <li> but it still smells good enough.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three bottles, which for me is significant because I love to try new products.</li>
            <li> I prefer Weleda&#x27;s almond moisturizer, because while the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have great benefits, at least it&#x27;s more soothing and calming on the face.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Well, the morning after I started using it the redness had already cleared up, and my skin just looks more supple and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that would be a good thing if you were already oily but for dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very sensitive area for me, but when I didn&#x27;t experience any immediate burning, I was able to breathe a sigh of relief.  </li>
            <li> It is chemical free and works very well.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find more natural products for my beauty regimen-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t testify for sure to the protection it offers</li>
            <li> Mostly it&#x27;s the packaging-- blue glass prevents light degradation, and the tip allows drop by drop dispensing.</li>
            <li> but I still like to use products for sensitive skin because if you can be more gentle to your face, than why not?</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend facial/skin care products easily, but this is a must-have for those suffering with rosacea, psoriasis and generally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I didnt like this product at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product consistently for about 4 weeks now and while I didn&#x27;t suffer for any adverse effects, I can&#x27;t notice any difference either.  </li>
            <li> The Weleda Almond Soothing Product line is especially gentle on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> that even the most basic of skin care products make break out or rash.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product if you have dry skin or are looking for a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is also great to be used as a medium to help thicker facial cream (like Weleda Cold Cream) to spread more evenly on and absorb into the skin better.</li>
            <li> I had read good reviews of facial oils in general and this one in particular.</li>
            <li> It REALLY lessens the redness, is easily absorbed into my skin, seems to be calming and is of a high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs relatively quickly (it&#x27;s oil, it won&#x27;t absorb completely, and that&#x27;s part of the point of oil).</li>
            <li> I put my usual undereye concealer on after the oil, and it went on much more smoothly, without any caking up.  </li>
            <li> I had also tried pure argan oil before this one, and it made my face hurt.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use much each time and the bottle has a controlled dropper so you won&#x27;t mistakingly over pour.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have very dehydrated, ultra-sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use for a night time, it&#x27;s really works very well.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was very hopeful of its effectiveness and living up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those reasons, I&#x27;m very cautious about what I put on my face, and I don&#x27;t like to do a lot of experimentation.  </li>
            <li> I started out very cautiously, just dabbing a dot of oil underneath both of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried some very spendy oils, creams, and lotions.  </li>
            <li> it works very well for me .</li>
            <li> I love that this product has minimal scent.  </li>
            <li> It is nice, but not any different than buying a cheaper one at your local store.</li>
            <li> You would think that putting an oil on the oily parts of my face would result in more breakouts, but because it has controlled my oil production, I actually have barely any</li>
            <li> Love it...make my face feel so soft and provides good coverage for the incoming cold winds.</li>
            <li> The main way I use it is to add 2 drops to a dollop of my Nivea cream, work them together, and apply as a night cream in the summer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product, and you only need to use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to discover this face oil after doing some research on natural cosmetics and essential oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have all that sensitive of skin</li>
            <li> The Soothing Facial Oil is designed to calm and nourish and provides a protective barrier for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thirty eight years old, I really need to take care of my face.</li>
            <li> The almond oil is non-irritating, and did not cause break-outs, and I have normal to combination skin.  </li>
            <li> ive tried numerous oils to help my extremely dry, flaky winter skin but most make be break out.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with eclos moisturizer which I live but may try this line moisturizer since I do like the oil.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hesitant when it comes to using new beauty products.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin to the point where it gets chapped and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I have combination dry/oily skin and this has helped reduce the excessive dryness and make my skin more even looking.</li>
            <li> It was my first facial oil ever</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also excellent to help relieve the sensitive skin around your nose when you have a cold!</li>
            <li> My skin is way less red after using this for a couple months now and feel much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but penetrates deeply to reduce the dry tightness you can get in winter.  </li>
            <li> And recently I used it on my legs after a very close shave inflamed my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this in conjunction with quitting coffee; I was fed up with adult acne.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> However, it is a natural scent derived from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> And did I mention that my skin is extremely sensitive, too?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had reactions to some facial products/moisturizers that are so intense that my eyes have swollen shut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my oily, sensitive and break out prone skin.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> This facial oil and the Weleda Baby Oil are my new staples for the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Really does wonders for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> but since half the products I buy end up in the garbage because they irritate my sensitive skin, I&#x27;d been reluctant to shell out the cash for this pretty spendy brand.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other higher priced facial oils, this one is a bargain.  </li>
            <li> Although the price seems a little high, a little goes a long way with oils like this, so I have a feeling it won&#x27;t come out to much more than my old moisturizer in the long run.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to scent and chemical, I&#x27;d recommend you to try it in a small amount first to see how your system would react to it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Because of the design of the cap and the band around the neck of the bottle, it is not sealed very tightly, it might spill when it does not stand up right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I try to at least use a moisturizer that is more on the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; side, but it has been hard to find one that moisturizes enough without making me break out.  </li>
            <li> I use the Almond cleanser and moisturizer and this oil is totally a necessity to my regime because of my dry flakey complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started to use the oil on the dry patches around my mouth, and I can see some definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will only use on dry areas from now on.</li>
            <li> I use this Weleda Almond Smoothing Facial Oil, when my skin starts to get dry, flakey patches during the transition periods from Summer into Fall, and Fall into Winter, etc.  </li>
            <li> By the way, if you have very dry skin, this can be used as a moisturizing serum, just follow your regular moisturizer(cream) after it.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for more moisture.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive, acne prone, combination skin that goes crazy this time of year (winter).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a little bit per application to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get used to the faint fragrance of almond, but after that, I started to fall in love with it and have used it since then.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my dry cheek areas well, but doesn&#x27;t make my t zone too oily.</li>
            <li> but then I would feel dry.</li>
            <li> It adds moisture to my skin face during the dry summer of the desert.</li>
            <li> This is one of my problem areas for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It soothes my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Keeping my acne under control requires me to use cleansers and benzoyl peroxide which leave my skin feeling dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> Soothing Facial Oil is a little bit pricey at $25.50 for a small bottle but since you use so little at a time, it will probably last several months and turn out to be not so expensive in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel better knowing that the Soothing Facial Oil is protecting my skin while it nourishes it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when this product showed up with my mail a couple weeks ago, apparently I won a drawing I only vaguely remember entering several months ago.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, has a very faint scent, and moisturizes completely.</li>
            <li> Calmed it down instantly.</li>
            <li> Seriously wish I had known about the oil sooner; particularly for the winter months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It sinks into my dry skin and caused no irritation at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount, and my skin is instantly relieved.  </li>
            <li> I use it on face daily all year round while I lived in the Bay Area in California because the weather is dry there.</li>
            <li> Essential in the Winter, but not too heavy for Summer.</li>
            <li> The Almond smell isn&#x27;t quite what I expected it to smell like</li>
            <li> It lasts forever since you only need to use a few drops a day.</li>
            <li> small bottle is going to last me a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate people who has extremely oily skin all year long, as well as patches of skin that get extremely dry and flaky, particularly in winter.  </li>
            <li> I previously used Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil but it never seemed to absorb into my skin or alleviate my dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about using an oil on my skin because by the end of the day I often have shine that I try to manage with matte foundation/primers/powders/etc.  </li>
            <li> So the lack of stars is due to the price, not efficacy.</li>
            <li> I figure its going to last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive, but I only use a few drops once before bed (although now I also use it on my crazy dry hands!), so it is going to last.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with happier, less irritated skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no benefits - I was looking for a facial oil that would at least balance the dryness and make my face less ashen, but in fact, it&#x27;s only made my skin even dryer.  </li>
            <li> The polar vortex this past winter killed my skin.</li>
            <li> I see this bottle is going to last at least 6+month!</li>
            <li> It smells almond like or a little yeasty to me.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been softer and the little bumps I had for some time have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been revamping my beauty products to get rid of all chemicals, even my products from Aveda are not totally free of harmful stuff.</li>
            <li> and it was too harsh.</li>
            <li> Although I had my worst skin problems pretty much under control, I had still been noticing some small red bumps, uneven tone, and weird texture before I tried this product, probably due to irritation from my skin treatments.  </li>
            <li> I use very little and it&#x27;s helped out a lot.</li>
            <li> It has very little fragrance (from what I can detect, it&#x27;s the odor of the oils in the mix).</li>
            <li> Just a few drops will do it!</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming to me.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with spray Evian water, which I mist on my face after I apply a small amount of the oil.</li>
            <li> The price point isn&#x27;t bad compared to other facial products on the market</li>
            <li> But over the winter I decided my skin had a dull look and a friend suggested that it was dryness and recommended this product.</li>
            <li> also add a little into my makeup to make it go on smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend!!</li>
            <li> The bottle has one of those lids commonly used in cooking oils that allows just one drop to come out at a time, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally spilling.</li>
            <li> After showering, I apply to face, followed by a thin layer of the almond cream.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been revamping my beauty products to get rid of all chemicals, even my products from Aveda are not totally free of harmful stuff. This in combination with the Welda 2 in 1 cleanser toner has been awesome. I use this for removing my eye makeup and then following the cleanser toner. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find more natural products for my beauty regimen- and I also like to keep it simple and low maintanance. I have been using this oil at night after I clean my face for about 2 months now and I love it. It moisturizes my dry cheek areas well, but doesn&#x27;t make my t zone too oily. It soothes my face so that when I wake up in the morning any irritated areas I had the night before are gone. I am actually able to just wash my face in the morning with plain water and its perfect. You would think that putting an oil on the oily parts of my face would result in more breakouts, but because it has controlled my oil production, I actually have barely any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;The big test was when I used it during a plane flight- which always dries out my face and the the next day I break out ( of course at the start of a vacation!) But again it kept my face well controlled.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t use much each time and the bottle has a controlled dropper so you won&#x27;t mistakingly over pour. Thus it&#x27;s a good value as well- I figure its going to last me at least 6 months. Best of all it has 3 all natural ingredients-with nothing unpronounceable. I would recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> I started using this in conjunction with quitting coffee; I was fed up with adult acne. Perhaps it&#x27;s the combination, perhaps not, but I am surplus grease-free, and have been enjoying a healthier complexion ever since. I pat 3 drops on my face, morning and night. Nice, albeit fleeting almond scent is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> This is a well priced item that is also very effective.  I use it as a facial moisturizer at night.  It is chemical free and works very well.</li>
            <li> I didnt like this product at first. It would absorb into my skin nice but then I would feel dry. My sister suggested using it with sugar as a light scrub. WOW! Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this item! So smooth and light. No greasy at all. Easy to use and use anytime.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have very dehydrated, ultra-sensitive skin and I have not gotten redness, rashes or itching from using this product.  It is very mild, and the smell is light and pleasant (not perfume-y) which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very convenient, it is more like a dropper so there&#x27;s no spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product consistently for about 4 weeks now and while I didn&#x27;t suffer for any adverse effects, I can&#x27;t notice any difference either.  It has absolutely no benefits - I was looking for a facial oil that would at least balance the dryness and make my face less ashen, but in fact, it&#x27;s only made my skin even dryer.  I&#x27;m not sure if this product is worth it.  I prefer Weleda&#x27;s almond moisturizer, because while the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have great benefits, at least it&#x27;s more soothing and calming on the face.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It adds moisture to my skin face during the dry summer of the desert. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am excited to discover this face oil after doing some research on natural cosmetics and essential oil. I love how the oil is packed in this cute purple glass bottle, and the way the dispenser(dropper) works. I only used like one drop to moisture the entire face, and another drop for the neck. Definitely a must buy from Weleda, a brand I thrust. By the way, if you have very dry skin, this can be used as a moisturizing serum, just follow your regular moisturizer(cream) after it. A little goes a long way. I see this bottle is going to last at least 6+month!</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail &#x27;moisturizer&#x27;. It has made such a difference for my skin. Not to heavy, absorbs really well, calms my skin. My skin is way less red after using this for a couple months now and feel much better. Doesn&#x27;t cause my skin any irritation.</li>
            <li> Who knew, but it totally helps to balance my facial skin and I&#x27;m oily and prone to break out even at 40. Essential in the Winter, but not too heavy for Summer. Gives you a nice glow if you pat it in freshly washed skin and let it soak in.</li>
            <li> Great product! My skin has never looked better. I also bought one for me niece and she uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I started using this product to help even out and soothe my skin. I have combination dry/oily skin and this has helped reduce the excessive dryness and make my skin more even looking. I use it every night and periodically through the day if needed.</li>
            <li> For me and my easily blemish prone skin that also reacts to products this works well. It was my first facial oil ever and I love it. It smells almond like or a little yeasty to me. I wash my face, do a mask, then put this on at night and I wake up with happier, less irritated skin in the morning. It can drip off, or for me slide off if you are warm but it gives me great results and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil a lot. It makes my skin soft. I use for a night time, it&#x27;s really works very well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have purchased three bottles, which for me is significant because I love to try new products. Great for winter, super moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It does take a while to soak in, which you would need to let it do before applying makeup. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have all that sensitive of skin but I still like to use products for sensitive skin because if you can be more gentle to your face, than why not? The Weleda Almond Soothing Product line is especially gentle on sensitive skin and I tried the Soothing Facial Oil to see how it worked on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about almonds. I love to eat them and I love the smell of them. There is just something warm and inviting about Almonds so it makes sense that a product line would use them for your face. The Soothing Facial Oil is designed to calm and nourish and provides a protective barrier for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At thirty eight years old, I really need to take care of my face. I spend a lot of time outside and knowing that this provides a protective barrier from the elements gives me peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little bit per application to cover your entire face. Just a few drops will do it! The Almond smell isn&#x27;t quite what I expected it to smell like but it still smells good enough. The oil absorbs quickly into the skin. I noticed my skin looked healthier and fresher after a couple of weeks. I can&#x27;t testify for sure to the protection it offers but I do feel better knowing it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soothing Facial Oil is a little bit pricey at $25.50 for a small bottle but since you use so little at a time, it will probably last several months and turn out to be not so expensive in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel better knowing that the Soothing Facial Oil is protecting my skin while it nourishes it.</li>
            <li> ive tried numerous oils to help my extremely dry, flaky winter skin but most make be break out. This does not. I&#x27;ve been using it very lightly either under my moisturizer after I get out of the shower or in the morning under my makeup...but not both. I use very little and it&#x27;s helped out a lot. I use it in conjunction with eclos moisturizer which I live but may try this line moisturizer since I do like the oil.</li>
            <li> I love beauty oils but this one didn&#x27;t do it for me. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel moisturized like most oils do. Maybe that would be a good thing if you were already oily but for dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Very gentle, no fragrance.  After showering, I apply to face, followed by a thin layer of the almond cream.  My skin has never been softer and the little bumps I had for some time have disappeared.  Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. I dampen my face and apply 2-3 drops at night.</li>
            <li> Rosecea and Celiac Sprue sufferer. This possesses a delightful soothing formula which calms my skin. I use on my face after cleansing and before moisturizer.  And recently I used it on my legs after a very close shave inflamed my sensitive skin. Calmed it down instantly. I use the Almond cleanser and moisturizer and this oil is totally a necessity to my regime because of my dry flakey complexion.</li>
            <li> The polar vortex this past winter killed my skin. I was desperate for more moisture. I had read good reviews of facial oils in general and this one in particular. I&#x27;m impressed with it, enough to have bought it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: The main way I use it is to add 2 drops to a dollop of my Nivea cream, work them together, and apply as a night cream in the summer. In the winter, I might do this twice a day. Sometimes I apply 6-7 drops on moist skin for instant moisture. Rub the excess from hands into cuticles to keep them soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like it: Mostly it&#x27;s the packaging-- blue glass prevents light degradation, and the tip allows drop by drop dispensing. One bottle has lasted me from January until now, so it&#x27;s cost-effective, even when I used a lot more in the winter. It has very little fragrance (from what I can detect, it&#x27;s the odor of the oils in the mix). It absorbs relatively quickly (it&#x27;s oil, it won&#x27;t absorb completely, and that&#x27;s part of the point of oil). I had also tried pure argan oil before this one, and it made my face hurt. I must react to it or something. I love the argan oil for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this Weleda Almond facial oil. I started to use this oil in 2008 while I was living in Freigburg, Germany. It took me a little while to get used to the faint fragrance of almond, but after that, I started to fall in love with it and have used it since then. If you are sensitive to scent and chemical, I&#x27;d recommend you to try it in a small amount first to see how your system would react to it. The oil is not fragrance free (in my opinion) because I can still smell the sweet and distinctive scent of almond when I apply it on my skin. However, it is a natural scent derived from natural ingredients. It is not overwhelming to me. I use it on face daily all year round while I lived in the Bay Area in California because the weather is dry there. It is also great to be used as a medium to help thicker facial cream (like Weleda Cold Cream) to spread more evenly on and absorb into the skin better. In the Northeast, I limit my use of this oil during peak summer time. Because of the design of the cap and the band around the neck of the bottle, it is not sealed very tightly, it might spill when it does not stand up right or when there is in a pressurized environment like on a plane. Therefore, when I travel, I always put the bottle in a small-size zip-log bag and seal it so that if it spills, the oil is contained within the zip-log bag.</li>
            <li> Well -- just received this in the mail.  After reading the reviews I was very hopeful of its effectiveness and living up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Weleda Almond face wash with good success (I&#x27;m 33 and have severe rosacea).  I have found the face wash + the facial oil to be a dynamic duo. Seriously wish I had known about the oil sooner; particularly for the winter months. It REALLY lessens the redness, is easily absorbed into my skin, seems to be calming and is of a high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend facial/skin care products easily, but this is a must-have for those suffering with rosacea, psoriasis and generally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate people who has extremely oily skin all year long, as well as patches of skin that get extremely dry and flaky, particularly in winter.  And did I mention that my skin is extremely sensitive, too?  I&#x27;ve had reactions to some facial products/moisturizers that are so intense that my eyes have swollen shut.  For those reasons, I&#x27;m very cautious about what I put on my face, and I don&#x27;t like to do a lot of experimentation.  Also, I would not have purchased an oil to put on my already oily skin, but since I won this Weleda almond oil in a contest, I figured I&#x27;d try it.  I started out very cautiously, just dabbing a dot of oil underneath both of my eyes.  This is one of my problem areas for dry skin.  It&#x27;s also a very sensitive area for me, but when I didn&#x27;t experience any immediate burning, I was able to breathe a sigh of relief.  I put my usual undereye concealer on after the oil, and it went on much more smoothly, without any caking up.  I&#x27;ve also started to use the oil on the dry patches around my mouth, and I can see some definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This small bottle is going to last me a very long time.  I assume most people won&#x27;t use more than a drop or two a day.  The bottle has one of those lids commonly used in cooking oils that allows just one drop to come out at a time, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally spilling.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is so clean and pure!  Use it on my face at night and during the day. It feels good to know that there are no chemicals absorbing into my skin!</li>
            <li> I love Weleda as a brand &amp; their products. I use this for an eye makeup remover as well as moisturizer. For make-up remover, I put it on a cotton pad and all mascara is gone. I also will use it during winter as a moisturizer (simply spread on palms and smother on skin). It absorbs quickly, has a very faint scent, and moisturizes completely. I have very sensitive and dry skin. Weleda Almond products work great -I tried going back to the basic Weleda cleansing milk &amp;/or toner and it was too harsh. This series is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my oily, sensitive and break out prone skin. It is great! I use it for cleansing and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> very good. It soothes my dry skin. I combine it with a moisturizer and my night and day creams. even though it is an oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue</li>
            <li> I received this item in under 2 days!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sinks into my dry skin and caused no irritation at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also add a little into my makeup to make it go on smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face oily at all, and skin feels great in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really like this but it does seem to clog my pores around my oily spots.  I will only use on dry areas from now on.</li>
            <li> Love it...make my face feel so soft and provides good coverage for the incoming cold winds.</li>
            <li> I use this Weleda Almond Smoothing Facial Oil, when my skin starts to get dry, flakey patches during the transition periods from Summer into Fall, and Fall into Winter, etc.  It only takes a small amount, and my skin is instantly relieved.  I use it in combination with spray Evian water, which I mist on my face after I apply a small amount of the oil. The almond oil is non-irritating, and did not cause break-outs, and I have normal to combination skin.  I noticed it seems to diminish wrinkles around the eye area as well.  I think this is a great product, and you only need to use a very small amount.  It has a pleasant and light almond scent, too.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have super dry skin to the point where it gets chapped and nothing seemed to work. I previously used Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil but it never seemed to absorb into my skin or alleviate my dry skin. I also have extremely sensitive skin so I&#x27;m hesitant when it comes to using new beauty products. I would definitely recommend this product if you have dry skin or are looking for a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Wow! What can I say about Weleda - I love their products.  This facial oil smells wonderful and is not greasy at all.  It&#x27;s light but penetrates deeply to reduce the dry tightness you can get in winter.  The price point isn&#x27;t bad compared to other facial products on the market and I&#x27;ve tried some very spendy oils, creams, and lotions.  This facial oil and the Weleda Baby Oil are my new staples for the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have so many allergies. This is a wonderful, soothing treatment for dry skin and great for eye make-up removal.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about using an oil on my skin because by the end of the day I often have shine that I try to manage with matte foundation/primers/powders/etc.  But over the winter I decided my skin had a dull look and a friend suggested that it was dryness and recommended this product. I could not be happier - my skin looks more refreshed and I have not had ANY issue with additional oil or breakouts. It is pretty expensive, but I only use a few drops once before bed (although now I also use it on my crazy dry hands!), so it is going to last.</li>
            <li> vey happy ...it works very well for me .</li>
            <li> Using this in combination with the lotion keeps skin hydrated</li>
            <li> I was surprised when this product showed up with my mail a couple weeks ago, apparently I won a drawing I only vaguely remember entering several months ago.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Weleda products for a while now, but since half the products I buy end up in the garbage because they irritate my sensitive skin, I&#x27;d been reluctant to shell out the cash for this pretty spendy brand.  So even though I&#x27;ve been wary of oils since what I&#x27;ll call The Great Jojoba Mishap of 2012, I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about Weleda products that I couldn&#x27;t help trying it.  Wow.  I&#x27;m hooked.  I have super sensitive, acne prone, combination skin that goes crazy this time of year (winter).  Keeping my acne under control requires me to use cleansers and benzoyl peroxide which leave my skin feeling dry and irritated.  I try to at least use a moisturizer that is more on the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; side, but it has been hard to find one that moisturizes enough without making me break out.  Although I had my worst skin problems pretty much under control, I had still been noticing some small red bumps, uneven tone, and weird texture before I tried this product, probably due to irritation from my skin treatments.  Well, the morning after I started using it the redness had already cleared up, and my skin just looks more supple and vibrant.  I&#x27;ve been applying 3-4 drops of this almond oil twice a day instead of my regular moisturizer and it has made my skin so happy!  And best of all, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be making me break out!  Although the price seems a little high, a little goes a long way with oils like this, so I have a feeling it won&#x27;t come out to much more than my old moisturizer in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of almond facial oil. I love to use it around my eyes. It feels so good and is very moisturizing...seems to plump my skin. I do have acne, but the oil did not cause breakouts. The bottle has a great stopper top that allows only a couple of drops out at a time, which saves you from over using. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this for oil cleansing my face. It is nice, but not any different than buying a cheaper one at your local store. So the lack of stars is due to the price, not efficacy.</li>
            <li> Love it. Leaves skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> As always great amazon delivery. Really does wonders for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this oil every day and my skin feels great.  I love that this product has minimal scent.  Compared to other higher priced facial oils, this one is a bargain.  It lasts forever since you only need to use a few drops a day.</li>
            <li> Very nice, absorbs well, leaves skin beautiful.</li>
            <li> I never though putting oil on my face would be a good thing! But this product is definitely a GOOD thing! I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin that even the most basic of skin care products make break out or rash. This oil is excellent to use as an eye make-up remover and night time moisturizer.  It&#x27;s also excellent to help relieve the sensitive skin around your nose when you have a cold! The only thing I find is that if I use the oil and then put on mascara at times during the the day my mascara will be under my eyes. So I&#x27;ll stick to using this in the evenings.</li>
