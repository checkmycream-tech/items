            <li>It is also very easy to clean my hair from the bristles.</li>
            <li>The Tangle Teezer is a lot more comfortable to use (feels awesome on my scalp) and I do notice that it doesn&#x27;t pull as much as my other brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to bring with you during the trip.</li>
            <li>Easily bent bristles, but also easy to carry.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars, but holding on to it is not that easy.</li>
            <li>so it tangles really easy all the time.</li>

            <li>this comb is very cute and when i recive it ,i deem i really like it</li>
            <li>My four year old daughter brushed her own hair this morning, and it looked great!  </li>
            <li>Normally I see a glob of hair collected using my mason comb (good brand comb,</li>
            <li>Kids can use this to brush their hair on their own and it works pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fine.</li>
            <li>but baby fine</li>
            <li>brushes really nicely and smoothly, my hair feels really neat and all the tangled hairs are gone!</li>
            <li>extensions, and my daughters fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is very very soft, like giving my head a good massage.</li>
            <li>Easy to take hair out and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Gets the tangles out pain free</li>
            <li>We liked it so much, bought another.</li>
            <li>This seems to help smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and after running this through my hair 10 or so times my hair is tangle free.</li>
            <li>but does leave the hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li>Amazong had free shipping</li>
            <li>But for daily brushing it is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great essential for my purse</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic solution to tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>its good ...no tangling , just not so soft , sometimes make my scalp hurt</li>
            <li>My daughter has beautiful long hair, but it was always a pain to brush out the tangles.  </li>
            <li>It fit right in the palm of my hand, but I need a bit more to hold onto.  </li>
            <li>Best for Juwt plain brushing hair to untangle it</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>It is simple and yet very effective.  </li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>No more stuck knotts does not hurt she is very happy :0)</li>
            <li>I have the original, it works so well on my hair.</li>
            <li>Original is for home, and this one has a cover and can be took out.</li>
            <li>I found much more hair on the floor after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Useful!</li>
            <li>I just love it so much!</li>
            <li>hair loss, significantly reduced the number of.</li>
            <li>I have the original Tangle Teezer, which I use every day, but I wanted something compact for on the go.</li>
            <li>It works great for natural, straight, and two textured hair.</li>
            <li>Does any one know how to clean it?</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is more suitable for short hair.</li>
            <li>Really good, looking forward to the next buy</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>this one is good to use, my hair is fragile, so I chose to buy it with the recommendation by  my friends.</li>
            <li>Will order a full size one</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to those who like the tangle teezer, and would like to take it with you.&lt;br /&gt;Bright, cool looking accessory.</li>
            <li>And bought several, really good.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;s better for straight hair before I bought one.  </li>
            <li>I have the regular one for home and loved it</li>
            <li>plan on purchasing the full size one for home soon.</li>
            <li>and they were not, and they are pretty easy to break, mine is broke and made my hair fall out.</li>
            <li>However, after a bit of practice brushing one medium-sized strand of hair at a time, we have both gotten proficient at using the brush, and it is definitely the best tool we&#x27;ve found so far that is both effective at combing through tangles and relatively painless.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon compared to other retailers.  </li>
            <li>P.S this brush is sooo much cuter than the original version!</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and is far superior to faux knock offs.</li>
            <li>We cannot be more happier with it and would highly recommend this comb/brush.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife and she likes it very much!</li>
            <li>I like to use it very much!</li>
            <li>Another new love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a year now and it has never failed me!</li>
            <li>It works exactly like the original by untangling my unruly hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it can slip out of your hands when you are working with conditioner-drenched hair (which is the best way to use this tool - I would NEVER use it on dry hair!).  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to give credit unless it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And now that I&#x27;m living in the tropics abroad, I need to wash my hair even more frequently.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 5 yr old grand daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and works great for easy teezing (i&#x27;m an amateur teezer).  </li>
            <li>Love the way it fits in my hand since the original tangle teezer is a lot bigger.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair like I do, it may take you more time to make it smooth.</li>
            <li>Great small size to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier, and not painful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see huge differences beween tangle&#x27;s and normal hair brush.</li>
            <li>Nice product, hopefully it lasts long.</li>
            <li>i like it，make your hair light, anti-deta.love myself ，and love this  Tangle Teezer Compact Styler Hair Brush,Black and Pink .tks</li>
            <li>This brush is very gentle on your hair.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;teeth &amp;#34; is not very long (shorter than most of the brush I have),  I still have to comb section by section.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is useful for me to solve the problem.and it is also smart to put in my handbag</li>
            <li>when I tried it for the first time, I was in tears again, as I always am when I brush my hair.</li>
            <li>and I can even use it without wetting my hair first.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>First time buy this for my girl, and she loves it.</li>
            <li>I expect much more but totally not tuen out satifying</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Actually, it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>She really likes it!</li>
            <li>The color looks exactly as it is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>And the ship speed was soooooo fast!</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i want</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair shiny and takes the kinks out!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m so glad they finally made a pocket sized one with a snap on bristle protector.</li>
            <li>so you will find two or three more tangles to fix but not a big deal.</li>
            <li>The shape of the brush is contoured to fit the right palm....and doesn&#x27;t quite feel right in the left.</li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old woman with naturally curly hair that is thinning on top.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice brush, but it is not as convenient to handle as the normal long holder ones.</li>
            <li>a hair brush is really on the expensive side but as a solution for hair tangling it is priceless.</li>
            <li>Combs is very small, easy to carry, it is also very easy to comb, but no other buyers said so well, or very satisfied overall</li>
            <li>Relatively small, suitable to carry!</li>
            <li>This little brush goes through my hair like magic -- no tangles, no pulls, no yanking out handfuls of hair that I can&#x27;t afford to lose!  </li>
            <li>Great for long hair that gets tangled when wet.</li>
            <li>They are also on the large side.</li>
            <li>If you have thin fine hair, this brush does a pretty good job on detangling, which is the case for my 4-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>but it is very close and certainly solved the problem completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My niece was thrilled to receive as a gift - her little sister even let her comb her hair with it</li>
            <li>When I tried on myself, it still does a good job brushing, however I feel like the brush has a hard time brushing all the way through to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>This one is amazing, after using, you will see the diffident.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to detangle my hair now.</li>
            <li>It hurts my scalp so much that lots of scalp drop after using it to brush my hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair can be a real rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li>Untangles hair really well.</li>
            <li>This is a reasonable size to use for kids though we still drop it from time to time.  </li>
            <li>I brought this for my friend, she really loves it</li>
            <li>Also the bristles are not the softest rubber ones, so you might want to be gentle on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>, it really does get the tangles out without the ouch factor.  </li>
            <li>I was also very hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>i feel very relax~&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>But the color is a real eye candy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much faith that it would work, but for $4.00 I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>This gets the tangles out gently without yanking out my hair.</li>
            <li>It really untangle hair.  </li>
            <li>Even my niece who has very curly hair loves using this brush, as it doesn&#x27;t pull like the others.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But this comb regular price adjustment, suggest everybody, cheap to buy.</li>
            <li>but it is much cheaper here on amazon US than in London.</li>
            <li>(One hand holds my hair straight)</li>
            <li>Since day one I&#x27;ve always had a very tender head.</li>
            <li>because 27 years later I enjoy brushing my hair.</li>
            <li>you so much. )</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for me the brush produced pretty much the same results as my other brushes, but I still love the TT because its compact, feels like I&#x27;m giving myself a mini scalp massage when I use it, and is a unique design.</li>
            <li>Only thing I want to mention is that this seems to feel more made for right handed people rather than left.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair that tangles very easily when I wash it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is any better than the other tangle brushes on the market.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that I don&#x27;t know how to clean it...</li>
            <li>The outlook is cute, but it is super hard to pull out of to get the comb, I haven&#x27;t got that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to brush her hair all the way down at once without pulling her hair at all.  </li>
            <li>Not like a new one!</li>
            <li>I thought the idea was interesting and figured for less than $15</li>
            <li>Apart from that, my hair doesn&#x27;t look more or less smooth/soft or shiny (as it claims).</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s elegant and it has a very similar design as the regular tangle teezer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>But the hairs themselves are thin and a bit dry, they electrify static, and tangle whenever they touch anything, like my clothes, or bedsheets - everything that isn&#x27;t my own skin.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised that it really detangled my hair</li>
            <li>My only negative comment would be to make sure your hands are product free before detangling.</li>
            <li>My mom told me about this brush, and it&#x27;s worth every last penny!</li>
            <li>When touching the scalp, not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>and normally it just went all tangled after maybe 5 minutes when I was out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has long and short bristles and for some reason it works its magic and untangle hair.  </li>
            <li>Because I have purchased and used the same kind products from UK and NZ before, I could tell the quality is so different as soon as I open its package.</li>
            <li>Which I can&#x27;t live without and will never use a comb or denman brush ever again.</li>
            <li>The size is smaller and better for lady&#x27;s hand, but it is harder than the original pink.</li>
            <li>cause i have another one that the bursh is very soft.</li>
            <li>second time buy it.like it very much</li>
            <li>This WILL still pull out some hair but pulls out significantly fewer strands compared to other brushes and combs or even when combing with my hands.</li>
            <li>the funny thing is that I noticed although it is a British brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on the scalp and there is little to no pain.</li>
            <li>While it fits nicely into the curve of my hand, it is a bit bulky at 2&amp;#34; thick and takes up a decent amount of space in a smaller sized purse.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable for me, but it a little big.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything, sometimes the situation got better, but in winters, when it&#x27;s dry inside and windy outside, it all got back to this nightmare.</li>
            <li>It smooths the top layer of hair and then if I try to brush underneath then the middle of my hair remains a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li>am including an old picture where you can see what my hair looks like</li>
            <li>The comb is very helpful to open the knot of the hair.</li>
            <li>If someone picks up this item near you, RUN.</li>
            <li>It makes wigs a bit frizzy but on natural hair</li>
            <li>, I thought they were soft</li>
            <li>If  you&#x27;ve got natural or synthetic hair extentions</li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s 3 year old daughter will not let you brush her hair.</li>
            <li>You can gently go over the tangle several times until it eventually straightens, maybe 8 to 10 times depending on how matted your hair is.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super fine and very thick, causes a LOT of tangles in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that is not as soft as the classic one</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>This does a great job of detangling my wet hair, which is quite long and moderately thick.</li>
            <li>At first, I just wanna have a try, cuz a lot of people said it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;After using several month, now I totally buy it.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it is easy to tangle, especially in winter because of the dry air.</li>
            <li>My hair is super frizzy, so normal brushes and combs don&#x27;t usually work.</li>
            <li>I have really really frizzy long hair</li>
            <li>I have extremely long hair,  and I am searching for something I could comb my hair without breaking too much of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Compact and comfortable even for small bag.  </li>
            <li>I have Tangle Teezers already (full sized) but you can&#x27;t pack in your everyday bag without bending the bristles.</li>
            <li>how much it affected my life: just try getting up 40-60 extra minutes earlier for brushing in the morning, or braiding your hair whenever you are going to have sex, otherwise you might as well go and shave your head afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the shower its easy to use a handle because my hair is so thick and the tangle teezer i use for the front section and to comb through the sections as a prepare a twist out.</li>
            <li>Dry, wet, tangled as a mop, it makes no difference - I am able to detangle it in just a couple of strokes, with my eyes closed and hands tied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is not very hair Mania, but it does not have much effect on my head .</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a really soft brush with different bristles than regular brushes.</li>
            <li>The rubber bristles are to short and soft for my super thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has long and soft hair.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not using it on the go or don&#x27;t have the small purse size problem, it&#x27;s the perfect brush to have around that will not leave you terribly frustrated with your tangled hair.</li>
            <li>and I am just so amazed how the Tangle Teezer really works i.e. untangling hair whether wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a little less than half the size of the original, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and so thick that salons charge me double or even more for dyeing due to amount of work and dye expense.</li>
            <li>Not significant better than the common ones</li>

            <li> Fitting hand</li>
            <li> I also love the protective plastic part over the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of it and would probably pic up another one to leave in my car.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The product is ok, but I became desapointed with this mistake.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , tho it cost a lot of more.</li>
            <li> Got two more, worked like charm.</li>
            <li> Already got mine and bought for gifting, love this brush.</li>
            <li> Outstanding job provided</li>
            <li> It is much more pocket sized, works just as well as the large one, and the design/color scheme is very nice.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and very useful.</li>
            <li> Works Good and pretty</li>
            <li> , pretty good deal</li>
            <li> It fits in her hand perfectly and she can brush out her long locks without the tangles!</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean my hair from the bristles.</li>
            <li> The Tangle Teezer is a lot more comfortable to use (feels awesome on my scalp) and I do notice that it doesn&#x27;t pull as much as my other brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to bring with you during the trip.</li>
            <li> Easily bent bristles, but also easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but holding on to it is not that easy.</li>
            <li> so it tangles really easy all the time.</li>
            <li> I t doesn&#x27;t easy to take out for me.</li>
            <li> this comb is very cute and when i recive it ,i deem i really like it</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter brushed her own hair this morning, and it looked great!  </li>
            <li> Normally I see a glob of hair collected using my mason comb (good brand comb,</li>
            <li> Kids can use this to brush their hair on their own and it works pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fine.</li>
            <li> but baby fine</li>
            <li> brushes really nicely and smoothly, my hair feels really neat and all the tangled hairs are gone!</li>
            <li> extensions, and my daughters fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> It is very very soft, like giving my head a good massage.</li>
            <li> Easy to take hair out and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Gets the tangles out pain free</li>
            <li> We liked it so much, bought another.</li>
            <li> This seems to help smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and after running this through my hair 10 or so times my hair is tangle free.</li>
            <li> but does leave the hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> Amazong had free shipping</li>
            <li> But for daily brushing it is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great essential for my purse</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic solution to tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> its good ...no tangling , just not so soft , sometimes make my scalp hurt</li>
            <li> My daughter has beautiful long hair, but it was always a pain to brush out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> It fit right in the palm of my hand, but I need a bit more to hold onto.  </li>
            <li> Best for Juwt plain brushing hair to untangle it</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> It is simple and yet very effective.  </li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> No more stuck knotts does not hurt she is very happy :0)</li>
            <li> I have the original, it works so well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Original is for home, and this one has a cover and can be took out.</li>
            <li> I found much more hair on the floor after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Useful!</li>
            <li> I just love it so much!</li>
            <li> hair loss, significantly reduced the number of.</li>
            <li> I have the original Tangle Teezer, which I use every day, but I wanted something compact for on the go.</li>
            <li> It works great for natural, straight, and two textured hair.</li>
            <li> Does any one know how to clean it?</li>
            <li> nothing special.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is more suitable for short hair.</li>
            <li> Really good, looking forward to the next buy</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> this one is good to use, my hair is fragile, so I chose to buy it with the recommendation by  my friends.</li>
            <li> Will order a full size one</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those who like the tangle teezer, and would like to take it with you.&lt;br /&gt;Bright, cool looking accessory.</li>
            <li> And bought several, really good.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;s better for straight hair before I bought one.  </li>
            <li> I have the regular one for home and loved it</li>
            <li> plan on purchasing the full size one for home soon.</li>
            <li> and they were not, and they are pretty easy to break, mine is broke and made my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> However, after a bit of practice brushing one medium-sized strand of hair at a time, we have both gotten proficient at using the brush, and it is definitely the best tool we&#x27;ve found so far that is both effective at combing through tangles and relatively painless.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon compared to other retailers.  </li>
            <li> P.S this brush is sooo much cuter than the original version!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal and is far superior to faux knock offs.</li>
            <li> We cannot be more happier with it and would highly recommend this comb/brush.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she likes it very much!</li>
            <li> I like to use it very much!</li>
            <li> Another new love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year now and it has never failed me!</li>
            <li> It works exactly like the original by untangling my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it can slip out of your hands when you are working with conditioner-drenched hair (which is the best way to use this tool - I would NEVER use it on dry hair!).  </li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to give credit unless it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And now that I&#x27;m living in the tropics abroad, I need to wash my hair even more frequently.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 yr old grand daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and works great for easy teezing (i&#x27;m an amateur teezer).  </li>
            <li> Love the way it fits in my hand since the original tangle teezer is a lot bigger.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair like I do, it may take you more time to make it smooth.</li>
            <li> Great small size to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier, and not painful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see huge differences beween tangle&#x27;s and normal hair brush.</li>
            <li> Nice product, hopefully it lasts long.</li>
            <li> i like it，make your hair light, anti-deta.love myself ，and love this  Tangle Teezer Compact Styler Hair Brush,Black and Pink .tks</li>
            <li> This brush is very gentle on your hair.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;teeth &amp;#34; is not very long (shorter than most of the brush I have),  I still have to comb section by section.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is useful for me to solve the problem.and it is also smart to put in my handbag</li>
            <li> when I tried it for the first time, I was in tears again, as I always am when I brush my hair.</li>
            <li> and I can even use it without wetting my hair first.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> First time buy this for my girl, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I expect much more but totally not tuen out satifying</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> She really likes it!</li>
            <li> The color looks exactly as it is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> And the ship speed was soooooo fast!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i want</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair shiny and takes the kinks out!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m so glad they finally made a pocket sized one with a snap on bristle protector.</li>
            <li> so you will find two or three more tangles to fix but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> The shape of the brush is contoured to fit the right palm....and doesn&#x27;t quite feel right in the left.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old woman with naturally curly hair that is thinning on top.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice brush, but it is not as convenient to handle as the normal long holder ones.</li>
            <li> a hair brush is really on the expensive side but as a solution for hair tangling it is priceless.</li>
            <li> Combs is very small, easy to carry, it is also very easy to comb, but no other buyers said so well, or very satisfied overall</li>
            <li> Relatively small, suitable to carry!</li>
            <li> This little brush goes through my hair like magic -- no tangles, no pulls, no yanking out handfuls of hair that I can&#x27;t afford to lose!  </li>
            <li> Great for long hair that gets tangled when wet.</li>
            <li> They are also on the large side.</li>
            <li> If you have thin fine hair, this brush does a pretty good job on detangling, which is the case for my 4-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> but it is very close and certainly solved the problem completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My niece was thrilled to receive as a gift - her little sister even let her comb her hair with it</li>
            <li> When I tried on myself, it still does a good job brushing, however I feel like the brush has a hard time brushing all the way through to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> This one is amazing, after using, you will see the diffident.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to detangle my hair now.</li>
            <li> It hurts my scalp so much that lots of scalp drop after using it to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair can be a real rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> Untangles hair really well.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonable size to use for kids though we still drop it from time to time.  </li>
            <li> I brought this for my friend, she really loves it</li>
            <li> Also the bristles are not the softest rubber ones, so you might want to be gentle on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> , it really does get the tangles out without the ouch factor.  </li>
            <li> I was also very hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> i feel very relax~&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> But the color is a real eye candy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much faith that it would work, but for $4.00 I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> This gets the tangles out gently without yanking out my hair.</li>
            <li> It really untangle hair.  </li>
            <li> Even my niece who has very curly hair loves using this brush, as it doesn&#x27;t pull like the others.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But this comb regular price adjustment, suggest everybody, cheap to buy.</li>
            <li> but it is much cheaper here on amazon US than in London.</li>
            <li> (One hand holds my hair straight)</li>
            <li> Since day one I&#x27;ve always had a very tender head.</li>
            <li> because 27 years later I enjoy brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> you so much. )</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, for me the brush produced pretty much the same results as my other brushes, but I still love the TT because its compact, feels like I&#x27;m giving myself a mini scalp massage when I use it, and is a unique design.</li>
            <li> Only thing I want to mention is that this seems to feel more made for right handed people rather than left.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair that tangles very easily when I wash it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is any better than the other tangle brushes on the market.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that I don&#x27;t know how to clean it...</li>
            <li> The outlook is cute, but it is super hard to pull out of to get the comb, I haven&#x27;t got that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to brush her hair all the way down at once without pulling her hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Not like a new one!</li>
            <li> I thought the idea was interesting and figured for less than $15</li>
            <li> Apart from that, my hair doesn&#x27;t look more or less smooth/soft or shiny (as it claims).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s elegant and it has a very similar design as the regular tangle teezer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> But the hairs themselves are thin and a bit dry, they electrify static, and tangle whenever they touch anything, like my clothes, or bedsheets - everything that isn&#x27;t my own skin.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised that it really detangled my hair</li>
            <li> My only negative comment would be to make sure your hands are product free before detangling.</li>
            <li> My mom told me about this brush, and it&#x27;s worth every last penny!</li>
            <li> When touching the scalp, not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> and normally it just went all tangled after maybe 5 minutes when I was out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has long and short bristles and for some reason it works its magic and untangle hair.  </li>
            <li> Because I have purchased and used the same kind products from UK and NZ before, I could tell the quality is so different as soon as I open its package.</li>
            <li> Which I can&#x27;t live without and will never use a comb or denman brush ever again.</li>
            <li> The size is smaller and better for lady&#x27;s hand, but it is harder than the original pink.</li>
            <li> cause i have another one that the bursh is very soft.</li>
            <li> second time buy it.like it very much</li>
            <li> This WILL still pull out some hair but pulls out significantly fewer strands compared to other brushes and combs or even when combing with my hands.</li>
            <li> the funny thing is that I noticed although it is a British brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on the scalp and there is little to no pain.</li>
            <li> While it fits nicely into the curve of my hand, it is a bit bulky at 2&amp;#34; thick and takes up a decent amount of space in a smaller sized purse.  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable for me, but it a little big.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, sometimes the situation got better, but in winters, when it&#x27;s dry inside and windy outside, it all got back to this nightmare.</li>
            <li> It smooths the top layer of hair and then if I try to brush underneath then the middle of my hair remains a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> am including an old picture where you can see what my hair looks like</li>
            <li> The comb is very helpful to open the knot of the hair.</li>
            <li> If someone picks up this item near you, RUN.</li>
            <li> It makes wigs a bit frizzy but on natural hair</li>
            <li> , I thought they were soft</li>
            <li> If  you&#x27;ve got natural or synthetic hair extentions</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s 3 year old daughter will not let you brush her hair.</li>
            <li> You can gently go over the tangle several times until it eventually straightens, maybe 8 to 10 times depending on how matted your hair is.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super fine and very thick, causes a LOT of tangles in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that is not as soft as the classic one</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> This does a great job of detangling my wet hair, which is quite long and moderately thick.</li>
            <li> At first, I just wanna have a try, cuz a lot of people said it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;After using several month, now I totally buy it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it is easy to tangle, especially in winter because of the dry air.</li>
            <li> My hair is super frizzy, so normal brushes and combs don&#x27;t usually work.</li>
            <li> I have really really frizzy long hair</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair,  and I am searching for something I could comb my hair without breaking too much of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Compact and comfortable even for small bag.  </li>
            <li> I have Tangle Teezers already (full sized) but you can&#x27;t pack in your everyday bag without bending the bristles.</li>
            <li> how much it affected my life: just try getting up 40-60 extra minutes earlier for brushing in the morning, or braiding your hair whenever you are going to have sex, otherwise you might as well go and shave your head afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the shower its easy to use a handle because my hair is so thick and the tangle teezer i use for the front section and to comb through the sections as a prepare a twist out.</li>
            <li> Dry, wet, tangled as a mop, it makes no difference - I am able to detangle it in just a couple of strokes, with my eyes closed and hands tied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is not very hair Mania, but it does not have much effect on my head .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a really soft brush with different bristles than regular brushes.</li>
            <li> The rubber bristles are to short and soft for my super thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long and soft hair.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not using it on the go or don&#x27;t have the small purse size problem, it&#x27;s the perfect brush to have around that will not leave you terribly frustrated with your tangled hair.</li>
            <li> and I am just so amazed how the Tangle Teezer really works i.e. untangling hair whether wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little less than half the size of the original, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and so thick that salons charge me double or even more for dyeing due to amount of work and dye expense.</li>
            <li> Not significant better than the common ones</li>
            <li> This works through my toddlers super long hair, and doesn&#x27;t hardly pull at all.</li>
            <li> So far, the falls haven&#x27;t cracked it, but I worry that it could, especially since I average two drops per comb out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends, who were perfectly aware of how bad it was for me, and will buy more, just because I can&#x27;t think of getting back to my previous routine if I somehow lose this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are some scratches, doesn&#x27;t look like new, no introduction worked so well, open is not easy to comb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Surely I didn&#x27;t expect Tangle Teezer to completely solve this problem, but in my situation even slight improvements make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> i finally got something that can deal with my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Although it really does thing of detangling, i feel it is hard to be held in my hand.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe in a few strokes my hair was completely detangled.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, my morning routine included tons of detangling liquids, and tons of tears.</li>
            <li> and I like the brush with long holder</li>
            <li> We all have long heir.</li>
            <li> She cries and cries because she has curly long hair.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it has a cover over the bristles to keep them from getting crushed.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly, thick hair</li>
            <li> Really worked on my daughter thick semi curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great for little kids who hate getting their hair cut.  </li>
            <li> That said, I have not used this on toweled dry hair (and didn&#x27;t need to after conditioning)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t know that I see a big difference between this brush and my regular round brush.</li>
            <li> not worth the money, it is just a simple hair brush with a cover on it.</li>
            <li> price actually went down by $4 since I bought it</li>
            <li> It does not rip or pull your hair out when it gets tangled wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Use with both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> No more painful pulling hair, even my 5-year old doesn&#x27;t fight my combing her hair any more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough on the scalp, so encourage little ones to focus on the &amp;#34;tangles&amp;#34; at the bottom and use a soft bristle brush for the bangs.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little pricy for a simple hair brush, but it does its job.  </li>
            <li> I do like that the bristles are soft plastic and do not grip hard.  </li>
            <li> Works well when hair is wet out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I used to carry a mini Wet Brush with me in my purse, but the bristles would ALWAYS get pushed into the brush.</li>
            <li> Works as expected-</li>
            <li> It works well as I expected.</li>
            <li> The combination of product and the plastic surface makes the brush harder to hold.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> have REALLY long hair, down to my waist.</li>
            <li> It is not very large, and has no handle, so it slips and falls unless I am very careful.</li>
            <li> Although the brush itself can be used just fine, this experience is so unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long they will last going through my thick, coarse, curly hair twice a day.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help to get my thick course, curly hair evenly conditioned, it actually takes out the tangles with little effort.</li>
            <li> Or any other.</li>
            <li> It is no better than regular hair brush.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it would have the same effect.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by imitations in other stores.  </li>
            <li> The tiny ones with mirrors always fold inside out on me or I end up pulling it open because of poor design .</li>
            <li> I have quite long hair, and this little gem does the job!</li>
            <li> Not useful...</li>
            <li> the bursh is very hard，i think its fake.</li>
            <li> The only thing with this one is I had trouble holding it because it really is small.  </li>
            <li> but she told me that for shot thin hair will remove all the volume of the natural hair.</li>
            <li> The compact one also works for thick hair if anyone&#x27;s wondering if it will be too tiny if you have loads of hair!</li>
            <li> You may as well pass a bristle brush through your hair for a jacked up, frizzy mess and split ends.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters  have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is thick</li>
            <li> I have Tightly Coiled/kinky hair</li>
            <li> I little to small and hard to hold, so I stick with my regular size tangle teezers!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that is so hard to comb through when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> Do not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Every girl needs this little brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is not original.</li>
            <li> verdict still out), but not with this little plastic contraption.</li>
            <li> My wife found this little hair brush that could do the trick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a little snap on addition that protects the teeth when it rattles around inside my purse.</li>
            <li> It was always a strugle, lot of crying and screaming every morning but all is well with this brush.</li>
            <li> She misplaced it for a a couple of days</li>
            <li> It is not a perfect product but it does seem to treat my hair softly when combing it out.  </li>
            <li> using this everyday now</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first but after suffering years of my daughter morning tears while combing  her hair</li>
            <li> Paddle brushes, round brushes, boar hair brushes...</li>
            <li> It cut my hair styling time in half!</li>
            <li> It is a little hard, not very comfortable</li>
            <li> The brush part is made out of plastic and is very sharp and hard</li>
            <li> My hair was always messy and hard to take care.</li>
            <li> you really have to get out bad tangles...</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is simply unbelievable for me.</li>
            <li> not a magic brush</li>
            <li> No more tears brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Her messy hair began to shine after just 15 minutes of brushing!</li>
            <li> Certainly is not magic</li>
            <li> The hair brush is small.</li>
            <li> No more tangles.</li>
            <li> It is too small and hard to grab that is not easy to use.</li>
            <li> This pink and black tangle teezer is fake.</li>
            <li> These Pink &amp; Black Tangle Teezers are fake products.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is so thick and snarlly I was too afraid to try it on dry or toweled dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because this is the compact size and bristles are too short, or if it&#x27;s just the design of the bristles, so it feels a little awkward to me.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed if it is long, straight hair, do not recommend you buy, uncomfortable,it is come from china,I  do not like</li>
            <li> The bristles are very stiff and scratchy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard for scalp and the box is defective.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say my hair is hard to brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken combs with my hair and this little guy glides through any tangles without pulling.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair that tends to clump into a gigantic cocoon-like ball if I don&#x27;t brush it.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with thick, wavy hair and some frizz.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all on my hair or my daughter&#x27;s hair, wet or dry :(</li>
            <li> no more tangle and pain!  </li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> No more tangle hair after I have this brush!</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have very thick, type 4A hair with 3C in the back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worse thing I ever think to buy</li>
            <li> : Tend to make my thin hair look even thinner.</li>
            <li> The package is broken.</li>
            <li> , just seem to be made with thin plastic.</li>
            <li> When I use other brushes it always painful and doesn&#x27;t brush well to detangle hairs.</li>
            <li> Little disappointed.</li>
            <li> fake, came without a brush head, had to return this</li>
            <li> Completely useless for me.</li>
            <li> forget this, it is useless.</li>
            <li> It is a shame that Amazon.com does not screen its sellers, I have always believed that consumers are not beable to buy fake produccts on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s always afraid to have her hair combed.</li>
            <li> It is unfair!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me feel painful when I use it to detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> so disappointed at the product.</li>
            <li> i am really disappointed about this item.</li>
            <li> My Mom loves it, she used to hate comb</li>
            <li> I used to hate the combing out part of washing my hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gets the tangles out pain free</li>
            <li> love the service and product&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s changed my life!!!</li>
            <li> Really nice, no pain any more</li>
            <li> This is harsher on my hair than a regular drugstore comb. The bristles are very stiff and scratchy. I tried to brush as gently as possible but it seemed to want to rip my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great service. This product is a life saver. It&#x27;s so much easier to detangle my hair now.</li>
            <li> I love it.I love it.I love it.I love it.I love it.I love it.I love it very much.</li>
            <li> Really good, looking forward to the next buy</li>
            <li> I have Tightly Coiled/kinky hair and I can&#x27;t believe in a few strokes my hair was completely detangled. It cut my hair styling time in half! P.S this brush is sooo much cuter than the original version!</li>
            <li> This is so over rated...so disappointed at the product. It hurts my scalp so much that lots of scalp drop after using it to brush my hair. Worked the same on guys hair...</li>
            <li> the best hair brush I have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> Love!!!!  Makes brushing hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> Just purchased one from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for $9 and I am VERY pleased! Detangling is finally a breeze! The only thing is that it can slip out of your hands when you are working with conditioner-drenched hair (which is the best way to use this tool - I would NEVER use it on dry hair!).  Comes with a handy guide with detailed instruction for use.  Also, check out YouTube for instructional videos &amp; reviews on Tangle Teezer.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair can be a real rat&#x27;s nest. And she screams out each time one of us brushes her hair. Except with this thing. No knots, no screaming. We liked it so much, bought another.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and so thick that salons charge me double or even more for dyeing due to amount of work and dye expense. But the hairs themselves are thin and a bit dry, they electrify static, and tangle whenever they touch anything, like my clothes, or bedsheets - everything that isn&#x27;t my own skin. For as long as I can remember, my morning routine included tons of detangling liquids, and tons of tears. I&#x27;ve tried everything, sometimes the situation got better, but in winters, when it&#x27;s dry inside and windy outside, it all got back to this nightmare. You have no idea how much it affected my life: just try getting up 40-60 extra minutes earlier for brushing in the morning, or braiding your hair whenever you are going to have sex, otherwise you might as well go and shave your head afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Surely I didn&#x27;t expect Tangle Teezer to completely solve this problem, but in my situation even slight improvements make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;So when I tried it for the first time, I was in tears again, as I always am when I brush my hair. But this time my tears were happy. I just couldn&#x27;t believe this nightmare ended, once and for all. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve grown different hair. Dry, wet, tangled as a mop, it makes no difference - I am able to detangle it in just a couple of strokes, with my eyes closed and hands tied.&lt;br /&gt;That is simply unbelievable for me. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends, who were perfectly aware of how bad it was for me, and will buy more, just because I can&#x27;t think of getting back to my previous routine if I somehow lose this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am including an old picture where you can see what my hair looks like just so you understand what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old woman with naturally curly hair that is thinning on top.  The Tangle Teezer  dosen&#x27;t pull my hair out and I can even use it without wetting my hair first.  If I had it 10 years ago, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t be losing my hair!</li>
            <li> I love it! I will recommand it to my friends!</li>
            <li> quite good, also introduce to friend.</li>
            <li> My hair is super frizzy, so normal brushes and combs don&#x27;t usually work. But this works! I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have very curly, thick hair and I was surprised that it really detangled my hair</li>
            <li> It really is amazing.  My four year old daughter brushed her own hair this morning, and it looked great!  It&#x27;s a little rough on the scalp, so encourage little ones to focus on the &amp;#34;tangles&amp;#34; at the bottom and use a soft bristle brush for the bangs.</li>
            <li> This is great product and really works. It was always a strugle, lot of crying and screaming every morning but all is well with this brush.</li>
            <li> Worse thing I ever think to buy</li>
            <li> Good design，my daughter likes to use!</li>
            <li> This brush is very gentle on your hair.  It does not rip or pull your hair out when it gets tangled wet or dry.  Works well when hair is wet out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people like this. A dog hair brush does the same... Or any other.</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> I actually really love this product! Does not pull hair and can be used for a good scalp massage/scratcher. I got the compact because I did not want to damage the teeth on the regular one--plus I can throw the compact one in my bag.</li>
            <li> I little to small and hard to hold, so I stick with my regular size tangle teezers! Which I can&#x27;t live without and will never use a comb or denman brush ever again. It works great for natural, straight, and two textured hair.</li>
            <li> This pink and black tangle teezer is fake. It is different from the product i bought in Sephora</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is any better than the other tangle brushes on the market.  We didn&#x27;t bother trying them because this worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a handle and it has a bristle cover makes it perfect for carrying in a purse or bag.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters  have long thick hair. It works wonderful and they love. It I recommend this for the person who has everything.</li>
            <li> Relatively small, suitable to carry!</li>
            <li> It is fine. Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush, but it is not as convenient to handle as the normal long holder ones. I use Denman now and I like the brush with long holder I think</li>
            <li> Works Good and pretty</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife that took a lot of time doing her hair every morning. It definitely untangles the hair but she told me that for shot thin hair will remove all the volume of the natural hair. Nice product, hopefully it lasts long.</li>
            <li> my daughter lets me brush her hair with it... My mom told me about this brush, and it&#x27;s worth every last penny!</li>
            <li> The comb is very helpful to open the knot of the hair.</li>
            <li> i love this brush it only takes one brush to take the tangles out.</li>
            <li> Combs is very small, easy to carry, it is also very easy to comb, but no other buyers said so well, or very satisfied overall</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair that tends to clump into a gigantic cocoon-like ball if I don&#x27;t brush it. This seems to help smooth it out. I have shoulder length hair and after running this through my hair 10 or so times my hair is tangle free.</li>
            <li> Really worked on my daughter thick semi curly hair. No more stuck knotts does not hurt she is very happy :0)</li>
            <li> I just received the compact one and it&#x27;s so cute and much sophisticated. Now I can carry it with me in my bag. I have the original, it works so well on my hair. After brushing it, it looks shiny and my color didn&#x27;t fade. It really works! I got the flowerpot for my niece, and now she brushes her hair herself. It is the BEST brush for kids.&lt;br /&gt;What I love is that it fits my hand and I can cover the teeth to protect it and just drop it in my clutch.&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY GIRLS, it&#x27;s a must have. I don&#x27;t like to give credit unless it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever invented it, you are a genius!! Thanks for making us happy. :)</li>
            <li> It is a little hard, not very comfortable</li>
            <li> I love the compact size as well as the fitted cover.  I can carry it in my purse or pack it in my luggage without bending or otherwise damaging the bristles.</li>
            <li> My niece was thrilled to receive as a gift - her little sister even let her comb her hair with it and she&#x27;s always afraid to have her hair combed.</li>
            <li> Literately the best hair brush I have ever used in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> love this! really love this!</li>
            <li> Perfect travel brush. Great small size to pack when traveling. Easy to take hair out and easy to clean. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to bring with you during the trip. not a magic brush but does leave the hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> First time buy this for my girl, and she loves it. This one is amazing, after using, you will see the diffident.</li>
            <li> Not useful... Do not worth the money! I just do not like this product..... I expect much more but totally not tuen out satifying</li>
            <li> The best hair brush ever. It won&#x27;t tear of your hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I used to carry a mini Wet Brush with me in my purse, but the bristles would ALWAYS get pushed into the brush. I got this to carry around my purse, and since this has a cap, the bristles never get messed up.</li>
            <li> Very useful. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> fake, came without a brush head, had to return this</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! Like it.</li>
            <li> It would be better if they are not made of plastic. Good for traveling though and the price paid .</li>
            <li> very good! I love this Brush! It is bigger than i thought! Good to use and nice color!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought six hair brush.it makes the hair smooth，and doesn&#x27;t pull  so much hairs.it‘s very good and easy to carry</li>
            <li> My Mom loves it, she used to hate comb</li>
            <li> If my wife loves it then I love it.  I had gotten her the bigger version before and she loves it.  She misplaced it for a a couple of days so I ordered this one for her to use when she travels.  She uses it all the time and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good product! It&#x27;s like what the product have described!!! I think every girls should get one like this !!! So I would like to recommend this to every one who needs it!</li>
            <li> no more tangle and pain!  Before I got this, my daughter was scare about to comb her hair and now she really enjoy it!</li>
            <li> this one is good to use, my hair is fragile, so I chose to buy it with the recommendation by  my friends. And finally, I got this perfect product!</li>
            <li> Great Brush...really does get the tangles out easy</li>
            <li> Although it really does thing of detangling, i feel it is hard to be held in my hand. It might be the shape of this comb. Anyway, good for detangle!</li>
            <li> There is a good deal of wear and tear......... Not like a new one! And I wont buy it again!</li>
            <li> Very convenient and works great for easy teezing (i&#x27;m an amateur teezer).  Love the way it fits in my hand since the original tangle teezer is a lot bigger.  And it comes with a cover that protects the brissels.</li>
            <li> Easily bent bristles, but also easy to carry.</li>
            <li> The rubber bristles are to short and soft for my super thick hair.  It smooths the top layer of hair and then if I try to brush underneath then the middle of my hair remains a tangled mess.  Completely useless for me.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that tangles easily.  I saw the TV ad for this product on HSN and thought I would give it a try.  Amazong had free shipping so I bought it from Amazon instead of HSN.  It is not a perfect product but it does seem to treat my hair softly when combing it out.  I do like that the bristles are soft plastic and do not grip hard.  It is also very easy to clean my hair from the bristles.</li>
            <li> i love this product its great quality and very worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;I hope to buy more of them thx</li>
            <li> Untangles hair really well.</li>
            <li> Combs the hair with this comb, will not pull the hair. Also, it can massage the scalp. I really like it! I also bought one as a gift to my best friend.</li>
            <li> this comb is very cute and when i recive it ,i deem i really like it .when i use ,my hair become striaght and comfortable ! i recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> The color on the website looks like rose, I prefer the color on the website. Actually, it&#x27;s hot pink.&lt;br /&gt;The hair brush is really good.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed if it is long, straight hair, do not recommend you buy, uncomfortable,it is come from china,I  do not like</li>
            <li> I love this hair brush a lot. It is very very soft, like giving my head a good massage. bought another.</li>
            <li> Got it for my gf as a gift.  She like the way it looks and feel because it&#x27;s compact so she can take it with her in per purse.</li>
            <li> I love the design of it. Fitting hand well.&lt;br /&gt;I give it to my best friend , she loves it so much.</li>
            <li> i like it，make your hair light, anti-deta.love myself ，and love this  Tangle Teezer Compact Styler Hair Brush,Black and Pink .tks</li>
            <li> Good product. The size is smaller and better for lady&#x27;s hand, but it is harder than the original pink. I prefer both of them. Original is for home, and this one has a cover and can be took out.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I don&#x27;t know how to clean it...scouring with water cannot remove the hair stuck to the bottom...</li>
            <li> Love it! Totally worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with thick, wavy hair and some frizz. I discovered this product because I follow a lot of UK beauty personalities and noticed that at some point they all raved about this brush. I thought the idea was interesting and figured for less than $15 I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t know that I see a big difference between this brush and my regular round brush. The Tangle Teezer is a lot more comfortable to use (feels awesome on my scalp) and I do notice that it doesn&#x27;t pull as much as my other brush. Apart from that, my hair doesn&#x27;t look more or less smooth/soft or shiny (as it claims). I do like it for lightly teasing my hair and its great to keep in my purse. I also love the protective plastic part over the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for me the brush produced pretty much the same results as my other brushes, but I still love the TT because its compact, feels like I&#x27;m giving myself a mini scalp massage when I use it, and is a unique design. I love the convenience of it and would probably pic up another one to leave in my car. These would also be really cute stocking stuffers or inexpensive gifts. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> the bursh is very hard，i think its fake. cause i have another one that the bursh is very soft.</li>
            <li> It is no better than regular hair brush. It can detangle hair but with lots of breaking. Only thing I like about  it is that hair don&#x27;t fall on floor and get tangle in the brush.</li>
            <li> This is a very good brush! It&#x27;s like a head message every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have REALLY long hair, down to my waist. This WILL still pull out some hair but pulls out significantly fewer strands compared to other brushes and combs or even when combing with my hands.</li>
            <li> Great for little kids who hate getting their hair cut.  She loves this brush.  The best brush ever.!!!!!!  Yeah! Yeah!</li>
            <li> Very nice! My hair would not hurt by my combing any more.</li>
            <li> No more tears brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair.  My daughter calls this the miracle brush.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have the regular size one in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> My wife says this is the best investment of her life. Her messy hair began to shine after just 15 minutes of brushing! Even I tried it because the surface feels good scratching my head.</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I found much more hair on the floor after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonable size to use for kids though we still drop it from time to time.  I wish there were a handle of sorts.  But it is still a very nice product.</li>
            <li> love it. Does any one know how to clean it?</li>
            <li> A gift for friend! She really likes it!</li>
            <li> super coooooooool!!!!</li>
            <li> I brought this for my friend, she really loves it and she tells me that it treats her hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> There are some scratches, doesn&#x27;t look like new, no introduction worked so well, open is not easy to comb.Buy cautiously to quality requirements</li>
            <li> Not good at all. My hair hurts when using this brush and there are still a lot of hairs on my brush when I comb my hair. Also didn&#x27;t do the detangle. takes me a lot of effort to comb my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from my friend&#x27;s bought in England. Till now, it&#x27;s OK but I won&#x27;t buy it again as a gift for my mom.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Great for long hair that gets tangled when wet. This makes brushing hair simple and painless!</li>
            <li> If you have thin fine hair, this brush does a pretty good job on detangling, which is the case for my 4-year old daughter.  I&#x27;m able to brush her hair all the way down at once without pulling her hair at all.  When I tried on myself, it still does a good job brushing, however I feel like the brush has a hard time brushing all the way through to the scalp.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because this is the compact size and bristles are too short, or if it&#x27;s just the design of the bristles, so it feels a little awkward to me.  Also the bristles are not the softest rubber ones, so you might want to be gentle on your scalp.  Overall does what it says to do.</li>
            <li> using this everyday now</li>
            <li> The comb is very smooth, hair does not knot.</li>
            <li> Best comb I have ever used in my life! Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price actually went down by $4 since I bought it, pretty good deal</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing! For the record, I have very thick, type 4A hair with 3C in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the longest, I have dreaded my  bi-weekly wash. And now that I&#x27;m living in the tropics abroad, I need to wash my hair even more frequently. I purchased this and it was like my prayers had been answered. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve loved a hair product more. The big rake comb has been cast aside. I use this in combo with a goodie paddle brush. Another new love. In the shower its easy to use a handle because my hair is so thick and the tangle teezer i use for the front section and to comb through the sections as a prepare a twist out. COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER!</li>
            <li> Perfect for curly hair haighly recommnded👍👍👍&lt;br /&gt;Great service</li>
            <li> At first, I just wanna have a try, cuz a lot of people said it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;After using several month, now I totally buy it.</li>
            <li> Thank you: ) quite Nice!</li>
            <li> This works so well, it really does get the tangles out without the ouch factor.  The only thing with this one is I had trouble holding it because it really is small.  It fit right in the palm of my hand, but I need a bit more to hold onto.  For travel though, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Every girl needs this little brush. Saved my hair forever.</li>
            <li> Pulled out my hairs every time. I have way better brushes.</li>
            <li> The size is just perfect for hold.</li>
            <li> When touching the scalp, not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> I found this product while watching one Dragon&#x27;S Den episode and I was intrigued. I was very skeptical at first but after suffering years of my daughter morning tears while combing  her hair I was also very hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;Well I am glad I did buy this product. Certainly is not magic but it is very close and certainly solved the problem completely.&lt;br /&gt;As a hair brush is really on the expensive side but as a solution for hair tangling it is priceless.</li>
            <li> it is a really good product</li>
            <li> This brush is not original.</li>
            <li> Pro: Smoooooth. Painless.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Tend to make my thin hair look even thinner. I suppose I need to do some extra styling after using this.</li>
            <li> Useful! Amazing quality!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I carry it in my purse all the time!</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s now the only brush I carry around with me. Great at detangling or smoothing out hair. It also looks so cute!</li>
            <li> After watching the promotional videos for the Tangle Teaser, my daughter was sure that the brush would slide through her tangled hair like magic. That actually didn&#x27;t happen. However, after a bit of practice brushing one medium-sized strand of hair at a time, we have both gotten proficient at using the brush, and it is definitely the best tool we&#x27;ve found so far that is both effective at combing through tangles and relatively painless.</li>
            <li> i feel very relax~&lt;br /&gt;it give me a big hand to solve my hair problems&lt;br /&gt;i think we should have it</li>
            <li> This does a great job of detangling my wet hair, which is quite long and moderately thick. I used to hate the combing out part of washing my hair. No more! It is so much easier, and not painful. I would have given it 5 stars, but holding on to it is not that easy. It is not very large, and has no handle, so it slips and falls unless I am very careful. So far, the falls haven&#x27;t cracked it, but I worry that it could, especially since I average two drops per comb out.</li>
            <li> My hair is not very hair Mania, but it does not have much effect on my head . And  pulling my hair 。 I do not recommend it</li>
            <li> My favorite hair brush. Will order a full size one</li>
            <li> NOW this one is beautiful. The color looks exactly as it is shown in the picture. The hair brush is small. You can hold it in your palm. If you have long hair like I do, it may take you more time to make it smooth. But the color is a real eye candy. You gonna love it when you see it!</li>
            <li> i am really disappointed about this item. because it takes almost a month to get the staff and after i got it, i found that now it sells $7.96. But I spend 16.99 to buy it. It is unfair!</li>
            <li> It works well. Maybe it is more suitable for short hair.</li>
            <li> NIce product, just like the picture, cute and nice to use, love this product, and good price, just fine .</li>
            <li> I love this item, very good! All my friends have it! We all have long heir. It makes my heir glossy.</li>
            <li> not worth the money, it is just a simple hair brush with a cover on it. nothing special. will not recommend</li>
            <li> Amazing! I saw this at Marshall&#x27;s for $4. I didn&#x27;t have much faith that it would work, but for $4.00 I thought I would give it a try. I use it while I have my conditioner in my hair. Not only does it help to get my thick course, curly hair evenly conditioned, it actually takes out the tangles with little effort. I&#x27;ve broken combs with my hair and this little guy glides through any tangles without pulling. Normally I see a glob of hair collected using my mason comb (good brand comb, said to not cause hair breakage...verdict still out), but not with this little plastic contraption. Again, I picked this up at Marshall&#x27;s, so might be slightly different. All I can say is that it works. It saves a ton of time detangling my unruly hair, and allows each strand of hair to get evenly conditioned when used after applying a good hair conditioner. That said, I have not used this on toweled dry hair (and didn&#x27;t need to after conditioning) so I&#x27;m not sure if it would have the same effect. Since my hair is so thick and snarlly I was too afraid to try it on dry or toweled dry hair.</li>
            <li> The outlook is cute, but it is super hard to pull out of to get the comb, I haven&#x27;t got that.</li>
            <li> I had the displeasure of being introduced to this contraption at a hair salon where the language barrier prevented me from saying, &amp;#34;stop ripping my hair to streads with that dog brush.&amp;#34; This is NOT for curly hair. You may as well pass a bristle brush through your hair for a jacked up, frizzy mess and split ends. If someone picks up this item near you, RUN.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those who like the tangle teezer, and would like to take it with you.&lt;br /&gt;Bright, cool looking accessory.</li>
            <li> I used it every day~ love it</li>
            <li> Love this. I have long hair that is thick but baby fine and it tangles during the day. This gets the tangles out gently without yanking out my hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works as expected- I bought this for my 5 yr old grand daughter and she loves it. It fits in her hand perfectly and she can brush out her long locks without the tangles!</li>
            <li> I had gotten this.  It makes wigs a bit frizzy but on natural hair it&#x27;s okay.  Not the best brush, especially if you have a knot but good for travel.  Fits in the purse and can come those stray hairs from driving with your car window open</li>
            <li> Good products worthy of trust</li>
            <li> This hair brush really detangles your frizzy messy hair without any pain and any hair loss. I just love it so much!</li>
            <li> It really untangle hair.  I love it.  Only wish the bristle material is stronger. I also bought the regular size one.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Love it! And the ship speed was soooooo fast! Great!</li>
            <li> Best ever. I told my Mom about this and she nicely asked me to give it to her. So I got another one immediately. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel painful when I use it to detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! Best for Juwt plain brushing hair to untangle it, it is a bit cumbersome to use it you are trying to put your kid&#x27;s hair up in a ponytail. Even my niece who has very curly hair loves using this brush, as it doesn&#x27;t pull like the others.</li>
            <li> The package is broken. The hair brush looks like it has been used. Although the brush itself can be used just fine, this experience is so unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and very useful. My hair was always messy and hard to take care. This helps me a lot.</li>
            <li> Really works. Doesn&#x27;t hurt as regular hair brushes or combs. Nice look and feel too.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  I have long thick hair that is so hard to comb through when it&#x27;s wet.  I have the handled one but I wanted an extra one to keep in my bag...this one is perfect for travel because it closes into a case that protects the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again...perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very fine hair so it tangles really easy all the time. When I use other brushes it always painful and doesn&#x27;t brush well to detangle hairs. However when I got this one, &amp;#34;eureka&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;It brushes really nicely and smoothly, my hair feels really neat and all the tangled hairs are gone! My daughter likes it too. I am very happy about this product! I want to get more for my family. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The brush part is made out of plastic and is very sharp and hard, I thought they were soft and they were not, and they are pretty easy to break, mine is broke and made my hair fall out. is only been a week, jut don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> This brand of comb has several series. There are salon, portable and family. And bought several, really good. The color is very bright, hair loss, significantly reduced the number of. Is a good comb. In addition to their own use, to friends is also a good choice. But this comb regular price adjustment, suggest everybody, cheap to buy. I hope my advice will help you.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Tangle Teezer Compact Styler-PINK and I received one with a ENgland&#x27;s flag on it.&lt;br /&gt;The product is ok, but I became desapointed with this mistake.</li>
            <li> I think this is counterfeit!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see huge differences beween tangle&#x27;s and normal hair brush.</li>
            <li> It is too small and hard to grab that is not easy to use. Not doing a good with its purpose.</li>
            <li> Not so good as I presumed</li>
            <li> I bought the regular size and the compact size.  They work rather well, just seem to be made with thin plastic. Not sure how long they will last going through my thick, coarse, curly hair twice a day.</li>
            <li> Something good very good I really like a wonderful shopping!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i want</li>
            <li> I love it!!  It really makes my hair shiny and takes the kinks out!</li>
            <li> I have really really frizzy long hair and normally it just went all tangled after maybe 5 minutes when I was out.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot of brushes but this is the only one worked. And it doesn&#x27;t hurt your scalp at all. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the funny thing is that I noticed although it is a British brand but it is much cheaper here on amazon US than in London.</li>
            <li> This works through my toddlers super long hair, and doesn&#x27;t hardly pull at all.</li>
            <li> like it, but i do not think it is as good as people  tell me</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she likes it very much! It works well as I expected. Also beautiful color!</li>
            <li> I have Tangle Teezers already (full sized) but you can&#x27;t pack in your everyday bag without bending the bristles. Once the bristles are bent they don&#x27;t perform quite as well and can start pulling hair out. They are also on the large side. So I&#x27;m so glad they finally made a pocket sized one with a snap on bristle protector. It is much more pocket sized, works just as well as the large one, and the design/color scheme is very nice. Only thing I want to mention is that this seems to feel more made for right handed people rather than left. The shape of the brush is contoured to fit the right palm....and doesn&#x27;t quite feel right in the left.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair,  and I am searching for something I could comb my hair without breaking too much of the hair.  The &amp;#34;teeth &amp;#34; is not very long (shorter than most of the brush I have),  I still have to comb section by section.  Not significant better than the common ones, tho it cost a lot of more.</li>
            <li> I have a bigger one without the cap, for home use and I am just so amazed how the Tangle Teezer really works i.e. untangling hair whether wet or dry. The compact one also works for thick hair if anyone&#x27;s wondering if it will be too tiny if you have loads of hair!</li>
            <li> My wife bought one and really liked it. Got two more, worked like charm. No more painful pulling hair, even my 5-year old doesn&#x27;t fight my combing her hair any more. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the dream one for me~ thank god i finally got something that can deal with my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great detangler. My only negative comment would be to make sure your hands are product free before detangling. The combination of product and the plastic surface makes the brush harder to hold.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! Great for my hair. extensions, and my daughters fine curly hair. Gets all tangles out</li>
            <li> Works like magic!  I have thin, fine hair that tangles very easily when I wash it.  Even using a wide-tooth comb, I had difficulty combing my hair. This little brush goes through my hair like magic -- no tangles, no pulls, no yanking out handfuls of hair that I can&#x27;t afford to lose!  EXCELLENT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> decent, great for price!</li>
            <li> My daughter can now brush her own hair with no fuss, miracle!</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable for me, but it a little big. I t doesn&#x27;t easy to take out for me.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;s better for straight hair before I bought one.  Then I found it&#x27;s amazing for my curly hair and easy to use.  No more tangle hair after I have this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is an amazing tangle remover!</li>
            <li> This is a travel brush wonder. I was looking for a durable travel brush . The tiny ones with mirrors always fold inside out on me or I end up pulling it open because of poor design . I won&#x27;t have to worry about that now.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick...?&lt;br /&gt;Have to use two hands to make it work..(One hand holds my hair straight)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all on my hair or my daughter&#x27;s hair, wet or dry :(</li>
            <li> Product is just so so. It&#x27;s a bit hard for scalp and the box is defective. Little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Kids can use this to brush their hair on their own and it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really have to get out bad tangles... forget this, it is useless. But for daily brushing it is great.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long and soft hair.  However, she always have problems getting her hair tangled.  Untangling her hair is an effort that could take 5 minutes.  My wife found this little hair brush that could do the trick.  Yes, it is a little pricy for a simple hair brush, but it does its job.  It is simple and yet very effective.  It has long and short bristles and for some reason it works its magic and untangle hair.  It has a cover to protect its bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have the regular one for home and loved it so when I saw someone with this one I bought it for travel. The protective cap helps keep it nice and its the best brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Very good product, it&#x27;s elegant and it has a very similar design as the regular tangle teezer. The only thing is that is not as soft as the classic one so you will find two or three more tangles to fix but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Since day one I&#x27;ve always had a very tender head. Brushing my hair was a constant battle either with myself or my mother. We tried every kind of brush on the market. Paddle brushes, round brushes, boar hair brushes...every thing hurt. My hair is super fine and very thick, causes a LOT of tangles in a short amount of time. This brush has been a God-send. My mom bought it on a whim at Sephora&#x27;s and I have not touched another brush since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing the full size one for home soon. It is a beautiful piece of work. It&#x27;s easy on the scalp and there is little to no pain. I LOVE THIS BRUSH! Instead of tears from pain I want to cry tears of joy...because 27 years later I enjoy brushing my hair. I suggest this for anyone with a child or themselves who have a tender head.</li>
            <li> Already got mine and bought for gifting, love this brush.</li>
            <li> Outstanding job provided</li>
            <li> My middle school daughter loves this and the item shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> If  you&#x27;ve got natural or synthetic hair extentions this brush is excellent for de tangling without tearing out your natural hair or the extentions... It&#x27;s good to remove shedding hair without pull or tug on the extentions.</li>
            <li> I like to use it very much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for problem hair. Compact and comfortable even for small bag.  Always with me.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much. )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year now and it has never failed me! The description wasn&#x27;t kidding when it said &amp;#34;pain-free detangling&amp;#34;. This is amazing for brushing out tangles in the morning from rolling around in bed all night, and for brushing out any tangles through out the day. It&#x27;s a great essential for my purse and I love how it fits so nicely in my hand. If this brush ever gets messed up, I will definitely buy another one!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s 3 year old daughter will not let you brush her hair. She cries and cries because she has curly long hair. I finally bought this brush just to try it and she now lets him brush her hair with no problem and does not cry! He didn&#x27;t even use conditioner. I tried it on my own hair and it&#x27;s a really soft brush with different bristles than regular brushes. Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The best brush ever invented!</li>

            <li> amazing! ordered another one for my mom. will come back again to order for my friend</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without my Tangle Teezer.  Works great and very gentle on the hair yet removes tangles, etc. Great price on Amazon compared to other retailers.  Highly recommend this product.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by imitations in other stores.  This is the real deal and is far superior to faux knock offs.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say my hair is hard to brush. THIS product believe it or not was like a miracle to me. I brush my hair with ease now and it DOES NOT HURT one bit ! I used to take 30-40 mins brushing my hair, but now with this thing 5 minutes was enough ! The bristle somehow untangle the tangle without ripping them apart.</li>
            <li> very useful, love it!</li>
            <li> Very good for my hair and pirfact for my bag</li>
            <li> my favorite hair brush!</li>
            <li> These Pink &amp; Black Tangle Teezers are fake products. Beaware of what you are buying!!! Because I have purchased and used the same kind products from UK and NZ before, I could tell the quality is so different as soon as I open its package. It is a shame that Amazon.com does not screen its sellers, I have always believed that consumers are not beable to buy fake produccts on Amazon.com but now my belief is destroyed.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Use with both wet and dry hair. No more tangles.</li>
            <li> I have the original Tangle Teezer, which I use every day, but I wanted something compact for on the go. I keep this version in my purse, and I love it! It&#x27;s got a little snap on addition that protects the teeth when it rattles around inside my purse. It&#x27;s also a little less than half the size of the original, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space. It works exactly like the original by untangling my unruly hair. I have quite long hair, and this little gem does the job!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it is easy to tangle, especially in winter because of the dry air.I think this product is useful for me to solve the problem.and it is also smart to put in my handbag so I can use it anytime I want.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m impressed!  Even using conditioner, my hair still ends up in tangles at the end of a shower and I&#x27;ve always had to coax out the tangles by starting brushing at the ends and working up.  I haven&#x27;t had to do that with this brush.  The bristles are designed to &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; so if it runs into a tangle, it&#x27;s not going to yank until the hair falls out.  You can gently go over the tangle several times until it eventually straightens, maybe 8 to 10 times depending on how matted your hair is.  I especially like that it has a cover over the bristles to keep them from getting crushed.  The only thing I can see that is a downfall is in the design.  While it fits nicely into the curve of my hand, it is a bit bulky at 2&amp;#34; thick and takes up a decent amount of space in a smaller sized purse.  If you&#x27;re not using it on the go or don&#x27;t have the small purse size problem, it&#x27;s the perfect brush to have around that will not leave you terribly frustrated with your tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I just found this product here so I bought it here, is a very good, good for hair , I have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t belive that it works as the seller promises. It works :)) I like it and my child liked it too</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic solution to tangled hair.  My daughter has beautiful long hair, but it was always a pain to brush out the tangles.  This was recommended to us so we looked it up on Amazon.  We cannot be more happier with it and would highly recommend this comb/brush.</li>
