            <li> I drink it mixed with cold filtered water, one tablespoon a couple times a day</li>
            <li> In fact if you have an night where you&#x27;ve overindulged in food and have that miserably overfull feeling, drink it just the way I described above immediately after eating and it takes away that horrible tight bloat!  </li>

            <li> My 90 year old Mother was prescribed prilosec for acid reflux a few years ago. She stopped taking prilosec a year ago and began taking 1 table spoon of ACV at night and has had no need of prilosec since. I have had some stomach issues too, was diagnosed with h pylori of which I took a round of antibiotics that didnt work, I have had bloating and fullness, and this stuff relieves it better than anything.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. But you can get this at fresh and easy or any nutrional store for under 5 bucks..</li>
            <li> What took me so long to try this!?  By far the best Apple Cider Vinegar available.  I drink it daily in water with a bit of cinnamon, it&#x27;s quite palatable. I do notice a difference in the better quality and it is worth the extra cost over store brand vinegars. Does have some sediment on the bottom between uses, so shake before using.</li>
            <li> Great product. I learned after I bought it I could have easily bought the same type of product in Wal-Mart, just a different brand and save myself the shipping and handling charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be used in so many way toward you health. Its great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS mist with orange juice or something. Don&#x27;t drink it straight or you will wish you had.</li>
            <li> I have an acidic system which causes quite a few problems within one&#x27;s body.  I have skin sensitivities, acid re-flux, candida and frequent Urinary Tract Infections.  I read that Bragg-Apple Cider Vinegar can help create a more alkaline system as well as fight fungal infections such as candida.  I drink it mixed with cold filtered water, one tablespoon a couple times a day and since then I&#x27;ve seen many positive changes in my system.  My favorite being no burning during urination due to battling an ongoing urinary tract infection that had kept recurring.  My second favorite is my acid reflux!  Gone!  No chemicals or RX drugs needed.  Just drinking this 1 Tbsp. in about 4 ounces of water twice a day and I&#x27;m good.  In fact if you have an night where you&#x27;ve overindulged in food and have that miserably overfull feeling, drink it just the way I described above immediately after eating and it takes away that horrible tight bloat!  I just love this product and won&#x27;t be without it ever!</li>
            <li> Very good and good for you too.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with a face mask I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This however can be used for cooking, and consumed on it&#x27;s own for great health benefits. It&#x27;s a quality product and derived from pure sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! shipped so quick!</li>
            <li> Bragg is the best!!!  Apple Cider Vinegar is good for everything and I plan on using it for everything.  They provide you with a recipe on the label too!  This won&#x27;t be my last bottle!  I highly recommend the use of it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> What I was exactly looking for in continuing to hone my diet and to assist is controlling my type 2 diabetes thru diet and exercise.</li>

            <li> I love this apple cider vinegar. It is organic and the best of the market. I tried many brands and think this is the best one. ACV has so many health benefits and household uses. It&#x27;s important that it&#x27;s organic to receive the health benefits though. I have this ACV on subscribe and save and won&#x27;t go with any other brand. If you haven&#x27;t tried it give it a try. I&#x27;m most likely be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It came within two days, and its much bigger than it looks in the picture. :)</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. For help with acne, hand warts, detoxing - whatever your ailment a simple tonic with ACV does the job.&lt;br /&gt;My daily recipe is: 2tbs of ACV - tsp Honey - squeeze of lime - 6oz warm water. Sometimes I add rooibos or black tea.</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  I been drinking this ACV with honey for about a week now.  I have had so much energy. It&#x27;s been so obvious that my daughter is drinking it now.  I am also using it to balance the pH level in my hair.</li>
            <li> It removed one of the moles on my face in about a week!</li>
            <li> On time, perfect condition, item as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started taking one tablespoon per day for health reasons. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love it! I started using it in a lemon water instead of my morning coffee few moths ago. What a change! I feel refreshed and no more coffee cravings.</li>
            <li> It was wonderful thank you</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this yet, but since I bought the book on all the properties of&lt;br /&gt;cider vinegar I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy to have purchased this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for restoring the ph balance in hair and skin (It always aids in clearing pimples and blemishes). You can even mixed this with water to drink or put on a salad or add in foods. This Apple Cider really does the trick for everything. It&#x27;s very healthy and wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great will order again</li>
            <li> Good with veggies....</li>
            <li> this is the best thing for acne. It really clear up for face. but half water and half of the apple cider vinger into a bottle ( as a toner)  put the toner on a cotton ball. Its so simple and acne goes away within a week. I had bad trouble skin with dark spots and it has all cleared up due to this stuff . AMAZING !!!!!</li>
            <li> Get Healthy - this stuff works!</li>
            <li> Drink this all the time in the morning it helped clear up my skin and helps ease a mild upset stomach.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service. I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent delivery.  ACV can be used for so many different things, google earth clinic dot com for a whole host of natural remedy ideas.  This is the best there is.</li>
            <li> This is excellent ACV, however the price is a bit steep. I just discovered it in my local grocery store and it is much less expensive there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I switched to this organic version of apple cider vinegar.  I love that I can order on Amazon Prime!</li>
