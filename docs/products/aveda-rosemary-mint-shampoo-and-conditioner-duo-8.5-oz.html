            <li>so it&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li>If you have migraine and headaches this is a great shampoo to use.</li>
            <li>i was so happy</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner, makes my hair feel great and is wonderful smelling with out being &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is fairly pricey but for that spa get away at home</li>
            <li>The shampoo is good - but the conditioner is so so.</li>
            <li>I had used this in a hotel and loved the smell.</li>
            <li>and i loved the shampoo</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so good</li>
            <li>While it has an amazing smell, it doesn&#x27;t have a good lather</li>
            <li>Just love it &amp; my hair does too !</li>
            <li>Ordering through this vendor was easy and the price was great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells great, fabulous product, however, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like Rosemary Mint.</li>
            <li>But I may as well be putting more water on my hair for all the good it does.</li>
            <li>Amazing product amazing smell I gave tried every exspensive shampoo and conditioner going to buy more</li>
            <li>I love Aveda products, but they won&#x27;t ship to APO addresses.  </li>
            <li>I go to an Aveda salon and love all the products.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Costs too much - shampoo is great</li>
            <li>love that this product doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The hair now looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is just about okay</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>For 1 this is more than&lt;br /&gt;Aveda&#x27;s suggested retail prize</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair very clean without stripping it like some clarifying shampoos tend to do.  </li>
            <li>However, some of my friends have noted they do not like the strong minty smell for their hair.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo was fine and worked well</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is an entry level product from Aveda and design for fine hair that doesn&#x27;t have any problems like dryness or damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Aveda products are by far the best on the market if you want something really natural but still affordable.</li>
            <li>The rosemary mint smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and how calm it gets me after wearing it.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo because it leaves your scalp tingling and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>The product smelled good, but didn&#x27;t lather and everybody&#x27;s hair ended up feeling and looking like old straw.</li>
            <li>Instead it looks clean, glossy, and well managed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well, but it does an okay job of getting my hair clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Aveda products, especially the smell.  </li>
            <li>and if you visit Aveda.com you will quickly see that</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for my skin but strong enough for a great cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am in a spa right at home.</li>
            <li>Also, if you buy from your local salon they generally have great return policies and will recommend the right products based on your needs.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t dissappoint in that category and actually, the shampoo was nice and left my hair clean and light.  </li>
            <li>i like it very much.  </li>
            <li>I love to take a deep breath of it in the shower to wake myself up.</li>
            <li>and I usually use more conditioner than most</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the clean scalp with the first use.</li>
            <li>My hair grew pretty fast with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>So much so, that others noticed the smell and complimented them.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; feeling in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine blonde hair and most products leave too much build up in my hair, leaving it brassy and limp.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner feels clean and I use it daily on my dyed hair</li>
            <li>The salon close to my house that carried Aveda products has closed down, so I am happy that I can order both Rosemary Mint products from amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo,</li>
            <li>The price is a bit on the high end</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s the water in the area where I live.</li>
            <li>But be aware, if it gets in your eyes it definitely stings!</li>
            <li>As my headline says, I tried so hard to love it.</li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>No heavy residue at the end.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft either.</li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t give that soft touch to the hair like conditioners are suppose to do.</li>
            <li>I hesitantly visited Aveda shop after reading several reviews on their website praising this particular shampoo.</li>
            <li>stinky, stinky, not not not not good not good product ivory soap would be better or nothing would be better.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much about the long lasting smell though!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner seems to be watered down because my hair didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it should when I rinse it with other products.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past and had forgotten how gentle but cleansing it is.</li>
            <li> I have natural curl and average thickness.</li>
            <li> My hair is left looking dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> so you use a ton of it and the conditioner still created snarl upon snarl after a towel dry.</li>
            <li> I use these Aveda products regularly and usually purchase them at a local salon.</li>
            <li> my hair was wet</li>
            <li> The conditioner left my hair weighed down, greasy-looking and limp.  </li>
            <li> I Bought this product due to scalp issues and have not had any problems since.</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner every other time I shampoo</li>
            <li> For the rest of the day, I can&#x27;t smell the products, but other people can</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t leave buildup in my hair, which often happens with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveda for many years, but am disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no good at detangling, and after my hair dries, it feels as rough and coarse as if I&#x27;ve gone swimming and didn&#x27;t shampoo afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For as expensive and as much as everyone raves about Aveda</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister - I have purchased via retail store previously.  </li>
            <li> These bottles arrived unsealed which seemed odd.</li>
            <li> believe these were NOT true Aveda products.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> But it does not clean my hair well.</li>
            <li> It never leaves my hair brassy or limp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years.</li>
            <li> so I cut it down to a quarter-size and still was not happy with the results after my hair had dried.</li>
            <li> At least online i won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But I just can&#x27;t get behind this product.</li>
            <li> ** was a tad expensive.</li>
            <li> ill be using it all up though.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong stuff.  </li>
            <li> I do not like the smell of the conditioner, it stinks.</li>
            <li> im disappointing cus</li>
            <li> And it was very expensive.</li>
            <li> but the conditioner seemed like it was a bad batch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame people are buying it though here and ending up with a bad experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am greatly disappointed and will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Terrible stuff.</li>

            <li> I love Aveda products, but they won&#x27;t ship to APO addresses.  The shampoo smells great, fabulous product, however, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like Rosemary Mint.</li>
            <li> I use these Aveda products regularly and usually purchase them at a local salon. And I won&#x27;t buy it again online. The shampoo was fine and worked well but the conditioner seemed like it was a bad batch. It smelled like school glue and had no conditioning effect at all! Terrible stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister - I have purchased via retail store previously.  Ordering through this vendor was easy and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I Bought this product due to scalp issues and have not had any problems since. I highly recommend this shampoo,</li>
            <li> Amazing product amazing smell I gave tried every exspensive shampoo and conditioner going to buy more they make a great product</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine blonde hair and most products leave too much build up in my hair, leaving it brassy and limp.  The shampoo leaves my hair very clean without stripping it like some clarifying shampoos tend to do.  I use the conditioner every other time I shampoo and it is the perfect weight for my hair.  It never leaves my hair brassy or limp.  Instead it looks clean, glossy, and well managed.  I also have extremely sensitive skin and I have never had any problems when using this shampoo.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for my skin but strong enough for a great cleansing.  I also find the rosemary mint soothing. However, some of my friends have noted they do not like the strong minty smell for their hair.  But be aware, if it gets in your eyes it definitely stings!</li>
            <li> I go to an Aveda salon and love all the products.  This shampoo and conditioner feels clean and I use it daily on my dyed hair and it doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Great shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s the water in the area where I live. Perhaps it&#x27;s my hair. Or perhaps it&#x27;s the product. For whatever reason, Aveda Rosemary Mint Shampoo and Conditioner leave my hair feeling roughened and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well, but it does an okay job of getting my hair clean. And it smells wonderful. So does the conditioner. But I may as well be putting more water on my hair for all the good it does. It&#x27;s no good at detangling, and after my hair dries, it feels as rough and coarse as if I&#x27;ve gone swimming and didn&#x27;t shampoo afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing this duo again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, fragrant and effective.</li>
            <li> i bought this shampoo because others claimed that it left their hair smelling minty. So much so, that others noticed the smell and complimented them. This was NOT my experience at all. The conditioner, to me, smelled like paint. i asked a friend who had no prior knowledge of the shampoo to smell it and she said it smelled like glue. The shampoo had a minty smell. But that was just it. It didn&#x27;t smell like mint. In fact, it smelled a lot like Vic&#x27;s Vapor Rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am greatly disappointed and will not buy this product again. At least online i won&#x27;t. Perhaps it is a product best bought at salons for an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> Costs too much - shampoo is great but you can get same thing for $13.50 each at Aveda website.</li>
            <li> It is like going to a spa when you use this product.  The rosemary mint smell is fantastic.  The shampoo and conditioner are very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; feeling in your hair. No heavy residue at the end.  It is fairly pricey but for that spa get away at home it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years. I love to take a deep breath of it in the shower to wake myself up. For the rest of the day, I can&#x27;t smell the products, but other people can and I often get compliments on the scent. The product doesn&#x27;t leave buildup in my hair, which often happens with other shampoos and conditioners. The salon close to my house that carried Aveda products has closed down, so I am happy that I can order both Rosemary Mint products from amazon.</li>
            <li> love that this product doesn&#x27;t strip my hair. smells great. wish it were a lower price point but will use it on a splurge from time to time.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Makes your head tingle with delight.  I will need to purchase bigger bottles next time though.</li>
            <li> I bought this product cause I love the scent and how calm it gets me after wearing it. I feel like I am in a spa right at home. The price is a bit on the high end but I think one deserves a treat once in a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past and had forgotten how gentle but cleansing it is. Excellent product. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works great and I&#x27;ve purchased this set three times now so it&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li> I hesitantly visited Aveda shop after reading several reviews on their website praising this particular shampoo. The staff helped me to pick travel size shampoo n conditioner. I was surprised to see the clean scalp with the first use. Can&#x27;t say much about the long lasting smell though!! The hair now looks shiny and healthy. Conditioner is just about okay as there is no lather formed. I used head and shoulders for almost one year with no improvements.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good - but the conditioner is so so.</li>
            <li> Just love it &amp; my hair does too !</li>
            <li> I had used this in a hotel and loved the smell. But it does not clean my hair well. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft either. And it was very expensive.</li>
            <li> As my headline says, I tried so hard to love it. But I just can&#x27;t get behind this product. I gave this shampoo and conditioner a week but in the end I&#x27;m scrapping it. While it has an amazing smell, it doesn&#x27;t have a good lather so you use a ton of it and the conditioner still created snarl upon snarl after a towel dry. I have natural curl and average thickness. My hair is left looking dry and damaged. I&#x27;m going back to Redkin.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo because it leaves your scalp tingling and feeling fresh. If you have migraine and headaches this is a great shampoo to use. My hair grew pretty fast with the shampoo. I took one star away because I do not like the conditioner. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t give that soft touch to the hair like conditioners are suppose to do. I use a different conditioner when I use this shampoo. I definitely recommend the shampoo!</li>
            <li> stinky, stinky, not not not not good not good product ivory soap would be better or nothing would be better.</li>
            <li> I like the tingling I get when I use this shampoo. I like the smell of the rosemary and mint. I do not like the smell of the conditioner, it stinks. The conditioner seems to be watered down because my hair didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it should when I rinse it with other products.</li>
            <li> My mother, my husband and I all tried this shampoo and conditioner. All of us have different hair types, from normal/thick to fine/oily. The product smelled good, but didn&#x27;t lather and everybody&#x27;s hair ended up feeling and looking like old straw. I&#x27;ve used Aveda for many years, but am disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I just got mine and used it last night. i was so happy and i loved the shampoo but my conditioner didnt smell the same as the shampoo it smelt like gross past/glue and didnt detangle my hair. im disappointing cus this  s*** was a tad expensive. ill be using it all up though.</li>
            <li> For as expensive and as much as everyone raves about Aveda I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed. I especially don&#x27;t like the conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize your hair at all.  Smells good is about all I can say.</li>
            <li> These bottles arrived unsealed which seemed odd. I am an Aveda lover and the products from this distributor appear to be IMITATIONS.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo felt like horse shampoo with lots of mint oil added. Ditto for the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looked like greasy straw.&lt;br /&gt;I believe these were NOT true Aveda products. This distributor should be investigated asap!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good I had a dream last night my hair was wet and I could smell it.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am at a spa when I use these.  I love the smell.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST SHAMPOO EVER! makes my hair cooperate and it smells great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Aveda products, especially the smell.  This doesn&#x27;t dissappoint in that category and actually, the shampoo was nice and left my hair clean and light.  The conditioner left my hair weighed down, greasy-looking and limp.  I have long, thick hair and I usually use more conditioner than most so I cut it down to a quarter-size and still was not happy with the results after my hair had dried.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY AVEDA PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON. The sellers that are selling this online are not authorized to sell here. For 1 this is more than&lt;br /&gt;Aveda&#x27;s suggested retail prize and if you visit Aveda.com you will quickly see that and if you buy from an unapproved source the product could be diluted or expired. Also, if you buy from your local salon they generally have great return policies and will recommend the right products based on your needs. This shampoo and conditioner is an entry level product from Aveda and design for fine hair that doesn&#x27;t have any problems like dryness or damaged hair. Aveda products are by far the best on the market if you want something really natural but still affordable. It&#x27;s a shame people are buying it though here and ending up with a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong stuff.  But A+++ on this.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner, makes my hair feel great and is wonderful smelling with out being &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> i like it very much.  I will be ordering this shampoo and Conditioner again.</li>
