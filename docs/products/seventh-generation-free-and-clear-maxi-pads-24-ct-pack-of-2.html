            <li>I like any of these products because of the natural fibers used in making them.</li>
            <li>Organic good material aside, I don&#x27;t know how a modern woman can use this in her normal day and not feel very uncomfortable and not walk funny!&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>They are not really long</li>
            <li>cheap, hassle free, and not too thick or too thin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great. It is good for those who have sensitive skin. Just wish they had wings.</li>
            <li> I love these!  They are natural, feel great and they don&#x27;t  irritate my skin like other pads. Will buy these again!</li>
            <li> Another product for a foster child which worked great for her allergies.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have to use for my sensitive skin because I&#x27;m allergic to chlorine and latex. I can&#x27;t understand why grocery stores do not sell these.</li>
            <li> I started using these months ago and I love them.  I was getting chapped with other products and these don&#x27;t do that!!!</li>
            <li> Little did I know what I was putting on (or in) my body!  I had no idea all those pads/tampons had been bleached!  And your skin is your biggest organ.  It eats more than what you put in your mouth so I had to switch over to these.  My only complaint is the paper that you peel off to reveal the sticky part has been chlorinated (states so on the package), but the company says they&#x27;re working on not having to use the chlorine so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stick to any of my undies. Move and/or fall straight out within minutes of putting one on &amp;#34;/</li>
            <li> My daughters use these and find them as comfortable as any other brands that they have insisted on trying. Now they are sticking to organic!</li>
            <li> Personally, I can&#x27;t have any scents or chemical absorbent materials in my pads since I&#x27;m allergic to them. These work great and I never have any issues with them.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I have always had severe skin irritations with other brands that are not chemically free like these.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I discovered I was having an allergic reaction to the chemicals in Always pads. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and had to use soap for sensitive skin but never thought there was a concern with feminine products. Boy was I wrong,  I knew maxi pads were looking and feeling different with the rough textures and the blue coloring recently but I still thought of them as hypoallergenic- wrong again.&lt;br /&gt;The Seventh Generation pad is so soft and it fits so well,  you won&#x27;t notice or remember you have it on. It just fits so well whether you wear it during the day or sleep with it. And it stays in place perfectly. It will not chafe your skin and no harsh chemicals to irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> i love these because they do NOT irritate like chlorinated ones and they are unscented, simple. shipped VERY fast. cheap, hassle free, and not too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked since I found these. No chemicals, natural cotton. No gel even though I saw a previous review say it had gel. They hold very well for the most part but you&#x27;ve got to rub them on to be sure they stick. They are very absorbent.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this&lt;br /&gt;I bought it only because it&#x27;s environmentally friendly but these are useless. Leaked all the time and don&#x27;t stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to Kotex</li>
            <li> Good product , will order again</li>
            <li> I got these because they are chemical free- and I will be getting them again because of that reason and because they work great.</li>
            <li> I found that Natracare products are safe and now use them.Loaded with toxins, especially msg. They are manufactured by Alibaba in China - I have pictures from their site. If you wish to see the information I found on them, email me at cj4nomsg@gmail.com. I compared them with others can purchase several places and the gel in the pad is more toxic then the absorbing materials in the others.The cover is less toxic than covers or others. I am finding Seventh Generation is less than honest in its product claims.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Love these pads as I had to break myself into them.  They are about an inch or two shorter than your typical Stayfree maxi, and have a slight contoured fit.  I like that they don&#x27;t use chlorine in their processing.  If your not hemorrhaging during your cycle these may work for you.</li>
            <li> Love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li> Love these pads! I really like that they are individually wrapped, makes it easy to carry in a purse or pocket.</li>
            <li> My sister gave these to me as a gift for after the birth of my daughter.  I hadn&#x27;t even known seventh gen made pads before that, and now I&#x27;ll never use anything else!  These are comfortable and from a trusted company--I know they aren&#x27;t using ingredients that I&#x27;m afraid to put in my delicate areas...</li>
            <li> I really like the material used in 7th Generation.  I interchange this product with regular ultra thins.  I like any of these products because of the natural fibers used in making them.</li>
            <li> These bunch up when you wear them and leak everywhere. They need to be longer and wider. Not at all happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very happy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It is bulky and very uncomfortable. Organic good material aside, I don&#x27;t know how a modern woman can use this in her normal day and not feel very uncomfortable and not walk funny!&lt;br /&gt;There are no wings so it will move around in your pants.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy these.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I&#x27;ve been using them for wound drainage, and it absorbs more than the abdominal pads provided by the hospital.</li>
            <li> I got these for post-partum use. Not too big and bulky, but offers good protection. They are not really long which I like but others may not. Natural too! I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
