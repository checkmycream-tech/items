            <li>OPI nailpolish is always great, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>This color was a bit more nude than I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Like always i love O.P.I. nail polish as well.</li>

            <li>i love this polish</li>
            <li>My nail polish chips easily</li>
            <li>I will purchase this brand again in the future as I have been doing my own nails for years.</li>
            <li>Nice, light pink.</li>
            <li>Shipped right away and arrived before schedule.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this rare color to make a bold statement.</li>
            <li>I like the color very much, and it will most definitely become my go-to polish in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I love wearing it on my toenails especially!</li>
            <li>This has been my fav polish of all time i first had done at a nail salon</li>
            <li>Highly recommend by me and alsoy to daughters!</li>
            <li>This colour looks really pink-ish</li>
            <li>Great quality product but the color is much less pink and more grey in person.</li>
            <li>I do like colors that are a little more saturated for spring/summer.  </li>
            <li>love the color (nice and subtle, but different), and the quality is the same (one coat won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>While the color is pretty it is not a rose color as shown but more of a lavender</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of OPI: the brush is easy (though not as easy on my small toenails), the color is pigmented (I have no problem with using two coats of polish, although some people do), and I love this slightly muted pink.</li>
            <li>It has like a light pink mixed with a light purple and has a paleness at the same time</li>
            <li>as bare as this nail color looks, it is absolutely noticeable when wearing.</li>
            <li>but when it arrived I was surprised to find that it was a sort of greyish lavender colour.</li>
            <li>First time i have used this product and was quit surprised of the quality and how long it lasted on my nails.</li>

            <li> Like always i love O.P.I. nail polish as well. It&#x27;s my NO.1 choice. Love it Love it Love it.Love it Love it Love it.</li>

            <li> i bought this after a recent salon manicure. love the color (nice and subtle, but different), and the quality is the same (one coat won&#x27;t do it. two coats, it is!)</li>
            <li> First time i have used this product and was quit surprised of the quality and how long it lasted on my nails. I will purchase this brand again in the future as I have been doing my own nails for years.</li>

            <li> I really liked this color!!! It has like a light pink mixed with a light purple and has a paleness at the same time so it brings out that soft/sweet color. I love wearing it on my toenails especially!</li>
            <li> Nice, light pink. As with all OPI polishes, the formula isn&#x27;t streaky and covers the nail well in two coats. Also love the size of the brush.</li>
            <li> Great quality product but the color is much less pink and more grey in person.</li>
            <li> While the color is pretty it is not a rose color as shown but more of a lavender</li>
            <li> Looks pinkish in the pic but came out looking grayish/mauve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice color but not what it appeared to be from looking at the bottle</li>
            <li> This is a great summer color.  A little edgy without being garish .  It is a pale lilac color but still sort of neutral.</li>
            <li> Love OPI and I Love these colors! Can&#x27;t say enough  about them. Highly recommend by me and alsoy to daughters!</li>

It&#x27;s still nice but I was expecting something pink because the name of the colour has \\&quot;rose\\&quot; in it. Shipped right away and arrived before schedule.</li>
