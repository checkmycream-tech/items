            <li>product can be found for better prices through some vendors, so be sure to shop around to get the best price.  </li>
            <li>that since it is very lightly scented I still think it is great stuff.</li>

            <li>Love this deodorant!  </li>

            <li>An easy sacrifice to make considering how great it works.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Now that it&#x27;s warm here in South Carolina, this deodorant has been put to the test.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to how effective it is as deodorant because I couldn&#x27;t bear to put it on my body.</li>
            <li>Dries nicely.  </li>
            <li>--I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d actually be effective alone...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to antiperspirant it will take some getting used to; it&#x27;s effective at controlling odor</li>
            <li>Smells great works great, feels good works better than all those clinical strength deodorants on the market and all natural.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant ever!</li>
            <li>The best holistic all natural hypo-allergenic deodorant you&#x27;ll ever have!</li>
            <li>Some of them had more pleasant smells or smelled strongly for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the best deodorant I have ever used, natural or otherwise.  </li>
            <li>BEST NATURAL DEODORANT</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant that I have found.</li>
            <li>Best natural deo.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>So far (one week in) this is the best non-aluminum deoderant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>By far the best all day protection that I have found yet.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s the best natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to others that want a good clean deodorant to use that won&#x27;t cause harm to their body.</li>
            <li>Best one I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>so great job Real Purity!</li>
            <li>Smells very nice and works extremely well, even after a really good work out at the gym!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It also works okay as an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the scent!&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this deodorant</li>
            <li>It is okay.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this and the ease of it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works, smells great and is natural and kindly sourced.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li>Still my favorite :)</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it every day</li>
            <li>No propylene glycol which is found in many &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; (e.g. Kiss My Face), and not sticky (Jason), and even better than Peoples Pharmacy Magnesium Women&#x27;s Deo (flowery smell).</li>
            <li>Better than the reg non-natural deo</li>
            <li>my favorite....</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get better</li>
            <li>I love the scent too :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve referred many people to this deodorant, and they all love it as well.</li>
            <li>I found that if you apply by tapping on the armpit to just get enough on the skin and then move your arm around to spread it that works the best.</li>
            <li>I think it works better than any deodorant or antiperspirant that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>mostly toxic products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this deodorant more than any I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is a healthy deodorant too.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It started out okay, but after a couple of weeks the roller ball no longer distributed any product.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works well and is safe to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I have YET to have any odor even when sitting in 100 degree weather in the sun in a truck with no a/c, unloading a ton of hay or anything else I&#x27;ve done and my pits still haven&#x27;t broke out using this :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than this spray which stinks-as in literally</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This product is working well so far - the scent is light and pleasant and the roll on is great for easy application.</li>
            <li>As many others have said, this is a great natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>The deodorant itself was fairly effective, and I like the mild smell.</li>
            <li>Rolls on nice, dries quick...</li>
            <li>It works incredibly well, and actually lasts all day - unlike many non-toxic deodorants on both of those counts.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you&#x27;re funky like me you&#x27;ll understand that it doesn&#x27;t prevent sweat, but it sure does a good job eliminating/preventing so much odor.</li>
            <li>I have tried many since moving away from using chemical filled products, but nothing worked as well as this.</li>
            <li>and I used to apply this 2-3 times a day but now am at 1x per day and way more odor &amp; wetness free...</li>
            <li>This natural deodorant is great.</li>
            <li>It has a very light, clean scent that fades away.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, Real Purity is by far the best out of the batch...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has a strong smell like I can remember someone posting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe someday I will be able to find the perfect natural deodorant sans harmful chemicals that holds up on days when life makes you sweat buckets, but until then, this is my go-to natural deodorant of choice.</li>
            <li>I honestly did not like any of them as much as Real Purity&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I was excited about this natural product, even my sister had tried it and it worked great for her.  </li>
            <li>and I will say that this is hands down the very best in terms of ingredients and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It did come packaged with a warning about not being FDA evaluated ... but honestly, that really isn&#x27;t saying much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using it during some stressful period this summer and it did help me to stay smell free, even tho</li>
            <li>It keeps me odor free all day.</li>
            <li>It keeps me oder free.</li>
            <li>so I do appreciate this product is gluten free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, smell and sweat free underarms.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good and my breakouts have gone</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It has been winter, so I am hoping I still feel this way through the summer, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I am also not normally a fan of roll-ons, but this one dries very quickly and the scent (which is wonderfully neutral) dissipates equally fast.  </li>
            <li>But I know that I am  worth it!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Real Purity is the only deodorant that has ever worked and the scent is perfect - not too powerful.</li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling fresh all day!</li>
            <li>But I have been looking for a good natural deodorant for ages, even going so far as to make my own, which just irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and it is worth trying it!!!</li>
            <li>This is truly the best natural deodorant, It actually works and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li>Definitely superior to any other healthy brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>On special occasions when I don&#x27;t want any perspiration, I will use the aluminum-containing antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>This is the first an only product that has helped me smell great and has reduced how damp my under arms are, or were.</li>
            <li>That means I did NOT have stinky pits after working up several good sweats exercising (indoor and out).</li>
            <li>This one actually DOES work (surprisingly).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Real Purity but this has a lot better antiperspirant effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works for a full 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>I am so thankful that I found Real Purity and this deodorant is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a liquid (roll-on), but it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was super stinky when I put it on and the smell immediately disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>
            <li>Was excited to finally find a natural deodorant with great reviews and success!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>Its all natural, but works way better than drug store brands that ate full of aluminum.</li>
            <li>Even then though, you stand a better chance with this than most other popular natural deodorants out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>The initial smell isn&#x27;t my favorite thing (it&#x27;s a bit floral and strong), but it doesn&#x27;t linger after you put it on.</li>
            <li>also a little dab of powder is welcome in some cases.  </li>
            <li>but it really keeps me stink free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Better than a lot of natural deodorants....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased so many organic, natural deodorants and not one of them has ever worked.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, allergic to all others</li>
            <li>Now, a month later and nearly every day usage, I&#x27;m happy to report my world has been rocked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have tried everything else, spend the $10 + shipping and try this, it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>with this one you still smell fresh way into the evening.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been okay.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite natural deoderant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorant brands - Tom&#x27;s, Burts Bees, homemade essential oil blends - and this is ok but not the best.  </li>
            <li>If you have been a long time antiperspirant user, you might go through a stinky detox period when switching over to a healthier option, but unlike all the other *better choice deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the best!!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this deodorant because it&#x27;s natural and it REALLY works!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that deals with odor and doesn&#x27;t leave me with an itchy rash (even right after shaving).</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot and even though I don&#x27;t have strong odor the natural products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made the rounds on natural deodorants, including Lavanila, Crystal, and a natural Collodial silver kind</li>
            <li>I have a pretty sensitive sense of smell (but no fragrance allergies), and I find this deodorant&#x27;s fragrance to be very mild.  </li>
            <li>I had nothing to worry about, this deodorant has a pleasant smell and so far I haven&#x27;t had a single day where my armpits were smelly at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a while looking for a deodorant that does not include aluminum and is also effective.  </li>
            <li>deo has a light natural scent.</li>
            <li>I have some pretty gnarly scent sensitivities, but this product does not set them off.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working out really well--even with the heat of the summer and sleeveless tanks!</li>
            <li>and you will not stink the whole day!</li>
            <li>But the deodorant is pretty runny...</li>
            <li>As for if the product works, I&#x27;d say it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it and purchased the first one.</li>
            <li>absolutely love the scent and the power of keeping me fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many deodorants over the decades, and switched to healthier, non-toxic versions about 8 years back.</li>
            <li>and it has not failed me.</li>
            <li>It is, as many have said, the only one that works.</li>
            <li>And who wants aluminum being absorbed through the skin and entering the bloodstream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first I have found that works.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to apply it more than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>I always end up back with my favorite anti-persperant.</li>
            <li>I have used it for the last 5 years and it remains my favorite.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant without a strong smell, is made of natural ingredients with no aluminum like other deordorants and kept me dry and clean smelling all day.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to find this is actually better than  ANY deodorant I have used, natural or not.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the high price.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side it works well, I just can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>When I tried it for the first time I absolutely could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is the first natural deodorant I have been truly happy with (I like the salt crystal too, but it&#x27;s usually a layer under something else).</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I agree with the others who cite the strong scent of this product as a potential issue.</li>
            <li>and I have not found that it lingers in an undesirable way, like a perfume or even strong essential oils</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth every penny; I work in a professional environment so B.O. is not an option!</li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant I have ever tried that actually keeps me odor free, and I have tried a ton!  </li>
            <li>In the beginning I had to reapply but after a months applied one time for the whole day.</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t nornally pay so much for an item.  </li>
            <li>This really gets the job done for me.</li>
            <li>went searching again and ran across Real Purity on Amazon.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>none of them have worked like this real purity deodorant has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I choose a natural deodorant because I&#x27;m trying to minimize the amount of chemicals that are absorbed into my body.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this deodorant, and I am so very please with it that I will use it from now on.</li>
            <li>No scent, dries fast.</li>
            <li>I really sweat.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>Try the real purity stick deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Feel fortunate it&#x27;s only 11 dollars in  the states .  </li>
            <li>I never review products on here because I can&#x27;t really be bothered.</li>
            <li>The problem with most natural deodorants is that they simply can&#x27;t get rid of that sweaty, stinky, underarm odor for me.  </li>
            <li>I tried many different natural deodorants...</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural product that had just the right ingredients to stop odor.  </li>
            <li>It really works i have used so many other and nothing like this one.</li>
            <li>did not work like the many other non-aluminum I have tried</li>
            <li>This stuff is honestly better than any other deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I decided to do some research on natural deodorants, and gave this one a try first since it was very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I do reapply once during the warmer and more active days</li>
            <li>The roller works fine, and it does keep me dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I kept using it even though it was such a process to give it a fair chance, but eventually it actually seemed like the deodorant began to smell like b.o. from being used as opposed to actually preventing b.o.</li>
            <li>It is THE BEST DEODORANT EVER, SERIOUSLY!!!</li>
            <li>- it smells like several wonderful things in nature - not like fake perfume or a chem lab.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even with the smell, I would still reorder, but my only suggestion to the company would be to look at perhaps adding some essential oils to make it a bit more pleasing to the nostrils</li>
            <li>I am a loyal fan and future customer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a deodorant that works, I had high hopes for this based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>My Functional Medicine Doctor told me about Real Purity Deodorant and swore that&#x27;s THE only natural deodorant she was able to find, that actually works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 more, one for each of my young daughters so that they won&#x27;t be putting aluminum and other chemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li>A bit more expensive than your avg (toxic) deodorant, but worth the money!!</li>
            <li>It does smell nice, and it takes a minute to dry (though I often don&#x27;t wait for it to dry because I am running out the door, and it has not seemed to matter).</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this natural deodorant really works....and all day!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice it when I had on long sleeves or even short sleeves, but now that I&#x27;ve been wearing more sleeveless tops, I definitely smell this deodorant throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Very natural, not perfumey.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be unscented but it is very masculine smelling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone who wants a safe and natural deodorant and to avoid the serious dangers of antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>It just keeps you smelling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>So, needless to say, I was thrilled when baking soda was not one of the ingredients here!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all natural goodness!</li>
            <li>My search for an all natural deodorant that works is over!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of natural ingredients which I like and is made in the USA!  </li>
            <li>After trying pretty much all of the natural deodorants at Whole Foods and then giving up and going back to my old chemical deodorant, I can&#x27;t believe I actually ordered this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients:  purified water, organic kosher vegetable glycerin, organic aloe, organic pure grapefruit essential oil, organic pure olive leaf extract, Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols), organic pure sandalwood essential oil, organic pure grapeseed oil, organic pure rosemary essential oil, organic pure geranium essential oil, organic pure sage essential oil, organic pure rosewood essential oil, cleavers extract, organic pure apricot oil, (minerals - magnesium &amp; potassium).</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>First natural deo that actually helped with wetness (I&#x27;m a sweater!)</li>
            <li>only gave it 4 stars because there have been some days where I have perspired more than usual, and I don&#x27;t really feel like</li>
            <li>I use this on an everyday basis and it does just fine.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it went dry really quickly, until I clued in that it needs to be shaken to wet the application ball.</li>
            <li>The stick ones I tried were a little gritty and my underarms started breaking out, this goes on smooth and it seems to really work so far</li>
            <li>After experimenting with numerous natural deodorants, including sprays, roll-ons and crystals (all of which did not work for me), I found Real Purity.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that really works for me.</li>
            <li>Have searched the world over for a truly natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Usually &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants don&#x27;t work so well as &#x27;harmful&#x27; ones, but I would still use them for the health sake.</li>
            <li>but I was naturally apprehensive when I hit the purchase button.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, Real Purity deodorant smells terrific!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, some worked really well for a short time but nothing lasted.</li>
            <li>If you are at all sensitive to smells, do NOT purchase this product.</li>
            <li>After trying any roll on, stick, powder, or rub on that I could get my hands on, I finally found real purity.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this product works.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd bottle of Real Purity Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>A friend convinced me to give it a shot after she researched it as a natural option for her pre-teen daughter.  </li>
            <li>It works well and is a safer natural formula.</li>
            <li>real purity deodorant was strange to get used to at first, as I&#x27;d never used a roll on applicator before, but it didn&#x27;t take long to acclimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this, I stay dry and clean all day long.</li>
            <li>It also has a subtle fragrance that I love.</li>
            <li>But I can live with that, knowing that this deodorant actually works for me, and the fact that it is all natural and does not contain aluminum.</li>
            <li>recently moved in upper 80&#x27;s and high eastern US humidity and held up very well - could not tell difference between this and old regular antiperspirant</li>
            <li>No more underarm rash, it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using during major heat waves if you need an antiperspirant, but the deodorant seems to be working well.</li>
            <li>While I typically make my own, when I run out or am feeling lazy, this is my go-to.</li>
            <li>Only critique is that it&#x27;s much more expensive buying through Amazon vs buying directly from Real Purity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because this was the first and only natural deodorant I ever tried, I have since tested out a few more brands - namely the \\&quot;Primal Pit Paste\\&quot; that everyone has been raving about lately.</li>
            <li>It lasted as long as the commercial natural deodorants that are half the price and easily available at stores.  </li>
            <li>would much rather smell like this than like a longshoreman on a hot day (no offense to hard</li>
            <li>It is much safer to use a natural deodorant than conventional ones with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work fine, and I allow to dry a few minutes before putting my shirt on just in case.  </li>
            <li>Have tried several natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the ONLY natural deodorant that</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this was possible with a natural deo.</li>
            <li>Almost 20 years later I have tried every natural deodorant on the market</li>
            <li>I have tried countless natural deodorants and they are always too sticky, stinky, don&#x27;t do anything at all, or</li>
            <li>I believe the natural iodine in the seaweed extract kills the odorous bacteria, you only need a little bit - the more you use it, the less you have to use because it manages the bacteria in your skin.</li>
            <li>The fact that it works extremely well and is natural is the main selling point, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another deodorant again.</li>
            <li>(It is a tad bit expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!!!)</li>
            <li>even this deodorant has held up in days of extreme perspiration unless you really use a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I tried several different natural deodorants before finding this one.</li>
            <li>For years, I have been researching, reading reviews and trying out countless natural deodorants, only to find that I would want to run away from myself at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>But this left me with the problem of finding natural deodorants that actually worked for me.</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant I have tried that actually works!</li>
            <li>It has a slight essential oil smell at first but that fades.</li>
            <li>I forgot mine at home on a long road trip and bought some of my old brand and realized how ineffective it is in comparison.</li>
            <li>I almost decided to give up and go back to conventional deodorants when a friend recommended that I try Real Purity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t dry completely on</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I smell better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> An easy sacrifice to make considering how great it works.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Now that it&#x27;s warm here in South Carolina, this deodorant has been put to the test.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to how effective it is as deodorant because I couldn&#x27;t bear to put it on my body.</li>
            <li> Dries nicely.  </li>
            <li> --I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d actually be effective alone...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, but</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to antiperspirant it will take some getting used to; it&#x27;s effective at controlling odor</li>
            <li> Smells great works great, feels good works better than all those clinical strength deodorants on the market and all natural.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant ever!</li>
            <li> The best holistic all natural hypo-allergenic deodorant you&#x27;ll ever have!</li>
            <li> Some of them had more pleasant smells or smelled strongly for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the best deodorant I have ever used, natural or otherwise.  </li>
            <li> BEST NATURAL DEODORANT</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant that I have found.</li>
            <li> Best natural deo.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> So far (one week in) this is the best non-aluminum deoderant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> By far the best all day protection that I have found yet.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s the best natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to others that want a good clean deodorant to use that won&#x27;t cause harm to their body.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> so great job Real Purity!</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and works extremely well, even after a really good work out at the gym!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It also works okay as an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the scent!&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this deodorant</li>
            <li> It is okay.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and the ease of it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works, smells great and is natural and kindly sourced.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every day</li>
            <li> No propylene glycol which is found in many &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; (e.g. Kiss My Face), and not sticky (Jason), and even better than Peoples Pharmacy Magnesium Women&#x27;s Deo (flowery smell).</li>
            <li> Better than the reg non-natural deo</li>
            <li> my favorite....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get better</li>
            <li> I love the scent too :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve referred many people to this deodorant, and they all love it as well.</li>
            <li> I found that if you apply by tapping on the armpit to just get enough on the skin and then move your arm around to spread it that works the best.</li>
            <li> I think it works better than any deodorant or antiperspirant that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> mostly toxic products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant more than any I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is a healthy deodorant too.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It started out okay, but after a couple of weeks the roller ball no longer distributed any product.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well and is safe to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> I have YET to have any odor even when sitting in 100 degree weather in the sun in a truck with no a/c, unloading a ton of hay or anything else I&#x27;ve done and my pits still haven&#x27;t broke out using this :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than this spray which stinks-as in literally</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This product is working well so far - the scent is light and pleasant and the roll on is great for easy application.</li>
            <li> As many others have said, this is a great natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself was fairly effective, and I like the mild smell.</li>
            <li> Rolls on nice, dries quick...</li>
            <li> It works incredibly well, and actually lasts all day - unlike many non-toxic deodorants on both of those counts.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you&#x27;re funky like me you&#x27;ll understand that it doesn&#x27;t prevent sweat, but it sure does a good job eliminating/preventing so much odor.</li>
            <li> I have tried many since moving away from using chemical filled products, but nothing worked as well as this.</li>
            <li> and I used to apply this 2-3 times a day but now am at 1x per day and way more odor &amp; wetness free...</li>
            <li> This natural deodorant is great.</li>
            <li> It has a very light, clean scent that fades away.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, Real Purity is by far the best out of the batch...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has a strong smell like I can remember someone posting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe someday I will be able to find the perfect natural deodorant sans harmful chemicals that holds up on days when life makes you sweat buckets, but until then, this is my go-to natural deodorant of choice.</li>
            <li> I honestly did not like any of them as much as Real Purity&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I was excited about this natural product, even my sister had tried it and it worked great for her.  </li>
            <li> and I will say that this is hands down the very best in terms of ingredients and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It did come packaged with a warning about not being FDA evaluated ... but honestly, that really isn&#x27;t saying much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using it during some stressful period this summer and it did help me to stay smell free, even tho</li>
            <li> It keeps me odor free all day.</li>
            <li> It keeps me oder free.</li>
            <li> so I do appreciate this product is gluten free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, smell and sweat free underarms.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good and my breakouts have gone</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It has been winter, so I am hoping I still feel this way through the summer, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am also not normally a fan of roll-ons, but this one dries very quickly and the scent (which is wonderfully neutral) dissipates equally fast.  </li>
            <li> But I know that I am  worth it!  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Real Purity is the only deodorant that has ever worked and the scent is perfect - not too powerful.</li>
            <li> It keeps me smelling fresh all day!</li>
            <li> But I have been looking for a good natural deodorant for ages, even going so far as to make my own, which just irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and it is worth trying it!!!</li>
            <li> This is truly the best natural deodorant, It actually works and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li> Definitely superior to any other healthy brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> On special occasions when I don&#x27;t want any perspiration, I will use the aluminum-containing antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> This is the first an only product that has helped me smell great and has reduced how damp my under arms are, or were.</li>
            <li> That means I did NOT have stinky pits after working up several good sweats exercising (indoor and out).</li>
            <li> This one actually DOES work (surprisingly).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Real Purity but this has a lot better antiperspirant effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works for a full 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful that I found Real Purity and this deodorant is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a liquid (roll-on), but it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was super stinky when I put it on and the smell immediately disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>
            <li> Was excited to finally find a natural deodorant with great reviews and success!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Its all natural, but works way better than drug store brands that ate full of aluminum.</li>
            <li> Even then though, you stand a better chance with this than most other popular natural deodorants out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> The initial smell isn&#x27;t my favorite thing (it&#x27;s a bit floral and strong), but it doesn&#x27;t linger after you put it on.</li>
            <li> also a little dab of powder is welcome in some cases.  </li>
            <li> but it really keeps me stink free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Better than a lot of natural deodorants....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many organic, natural deodorants and not one of them has ever worked.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, allergic to all others</li>
            <li> Now, a month later and nearly every day usage, I&#x27;m happy to report my world has been rocked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have tried everything else, spend the $10 + shipping and try this, it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> with this one you still smell fresh way into the evening.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been okay.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deoderant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorant brands - Tom&#x27;s, Burts Bees, homemade essential oil blends - and this is ok but not the best.  </li>
            <li> If you have been a long time antiperspirant user, you might go through a stinky detox period when switching over to a healthier option, but unlike all the other *better choice deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the best!!!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this deodorant because it&#x27;s natural and it REALLY works!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that deals with odor and doesn&#x27;t leave me with an itchy rash (even right after shaving).</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and even though I don&#x27;t have strong odor the natural products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made the rounds on natural deodorants, including Lavanila, Crystal, and a natural Collodial silver kind</li>
            <li> I have a pretty sensitive sense of smell (but no fragrance allergies), and I find this deodorant&#x27;s fragrance to be very mild.  </li>
            <li> I had nothing to worry about, this deodorant has a pleasant smell and so far I haven&#x27;t had a single day where my armpits were smelly at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a while looking for a deodorant that does not include aluminum and is also effective.  </li>
            <li> deo has a light natural scent.</li>
            <li> I have some pretty gnarly scent sensitivities, but this product does not set them off.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working out really well--even with the heat of the summer and sleeveless tanks!</li>
            <li> and you will not stink the whole day!</li>
            <li> But the deodorant is pretty runny...</li>
            <li> As for if the product works, I&#x27;d say it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it and purchased the first one.</li>
            <li> absolutely love the scent and the power of keeping me fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many deodorants over the decades, and switched to healthier, non-toxic versions about 8 years back.</li>
            <li> and it has not failed me.</li>
            <li> It is, as many have said, the only one that works.</li>
            <li> And who wants aluminum being absorbed through the skin and entering the bloodstream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first I have found that works.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to apply it more than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> I always end up back with my favorite anti-persperant.</li>
            <li> I have used it for the last 5 years and it remains my favorite.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant without a strong smell, is made of natural ingredients with no aluminum like other deordorants and kept me dry and clean smelling all day.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to find this is actually better than  ANY deodorant I have used, natural or not.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the high price.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side it works well, I just can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> When I tried it for the first time I absolutely could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is the first natural deodorant I have been truly happy with (I like the salt crystal too, but it&#x27;s usually a layer under something else).</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I agree with the others who cite the strong scent of this product as a potential issue.</li>
            <li> and I have not found that it lingers in an undesirable way, like a perfume or even strong essential oils</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth every penny; I work in a professional environment so B.O. is not an option!</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I have ever tried that actually keeps me odor free, and I have tried a ton!  </li>
            <li> In the beginning I had to reapply but after a months applied one time for the whole day.</li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t nornally pay so much for an item.  </li>
            <li> This really gets the job done for me.</li>
            <li> went searching again and ran across Real Purity on Amazon.</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> none of them have worked like this real purity deodorant has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I choose a natural deodorant because I&#x27;m trying to minimize the amount of chemicals that are absorbed into my body.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this deodorant, and I am so very please with it that I will use it from now on.</li>
            <li> No scent, dries fast.</li>
            <li> I really sweat.  </li>
            <li> and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Try the real purity stick deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Feel fortunate it&#x27;s only 11 dollars in  the states .  </li>
            <li> I never review products on here because I can&#x27;t really be bothered.</li>
            <li> The problem with most natural deodorants is that they simply can&#x27;t get rid of that sweaty, stinky, underarm odor for me.  </li>
            <li> I tried many different natural deodorants...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural product that had just the right ingredients to stop odor.  </li>
            <li> It really works i have used so many other and nothing like this one.</li>
            <li> did not work like the many other non-aluminum I have tried</li>
            <li> This stuff is honestly better than any other deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I decided to do some research on natural deodorants, and gave this one a try first since it was very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I do reapply once during the warmer and more active days</li>
            <li> The roller works fine, and it does keep me dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I kept using it even though it was such a process to give it a fair chance, but eventually it actually seemed like the deodorant began to smell like b.o. from being used as opposed to actually preventing b.o.</li>
            <li> It is THE BEST DEODORANT EVER, SERIOUSLY!!!</li>
            <li> - it smells like several wonderful things in nature - not like fake perfume or a chem lab.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even with the smell, I would still reorder, but my only suggestion to the company would be to look at perhaps adding some essential oils to make it a bit more pleasing to the nostrils</li>
            <li> I am a loyal fan and future customer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deodorant that works, I had high hopes for this based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> My Functional Medicine Doctor told me about Real Purity Deodorant and swore that&#x27;s THE only natural deodorant she was able to find, that actually works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 more, one for each of my young daughters so that they won&#x27;t be putting aluminum and other chemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li> A bit more expensive than your avg (toxic) deodorant, but worth the money!!</li>
            <li> It does smell nice, and it takes a minute to dry (though I often don&#x27;t wait for it to dry because I am running out the door, and it has not seemed to matter).</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this natural deodorant really works....and all day!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice it when I had on long sleeves or even short sleeves, but now that I&#x27;ve been wearing more sleeveless tops, I definitely smell this deodorant throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very natural, not perfumey.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be unscented but it is very masculine smelling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone who wants a safe and natural deodorant and to avoid the serious dangers of antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> It just keeps you smelling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> So, needless to say, I was thrilled when baking soda was not one of the ingredients here!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s all natural goodness!</li>
            <li> My search for an all natural deodorant that works is over!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of natural ingredients which I like and is made in the USA!  </li>
            <li> After trying pretty much all of the natural deodorants at Whole Foods and then giving up and going back to my old chemical deodorant, I can&#x27;t believe I actually ordered this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients:  purified water, organic kosher vegetable glycerin, organic aloe, organic pure grapefruit essential oil, organic pure olive leaf extract, Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols), organic pure sandalwood essential oil, organic pure grapeseed oil, organic pure rosemary essential oil, organic pure geranium essential oil, organic pure sage essential oil, organic pure rosewood essential oil, cleavers extract, organic pure apricot oil, (minerals - magnesium &amp; potassium).</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> First natural deo that actually helped with wetness (I&#x27;m a sweater!)</li>
            <li> only gave it 4 stars because there have been some days where I have perspired more than usual, and I don&#x27;t really feel like</li>
            <li> I use this on an everyday basis and it does just fine.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it went dry really quickly, until I clued in that it needs to be shaken to wet the application ball.</li>
            <li> The stick ones I tried were a little gritty and my underarms started breaking out, this goes on smooth and it seems to really work so far</li>
            <li> After experimenting with numerous natural deodorants, including sprays, roll-ons and crystals (all of which did not work for me), I found Real Purity.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that really works for me.</li>
            <li> Have searched the world over for a truly natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Usually &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants don&#x27;t work so well as &#x27;harmful&#x27; ones, but I would still use them for the health sake.</li>
            <li> but I was naturally apprehensive when I hit the purchase button.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, Real Purity deodorant smells terrific!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, some worked really well for a short time but nothing lasted.</li>
            <li> If you are at all sensitive to smells, do NOT purchase this product.</li>
            <li> After trying any roll on, stick, powder, or rub on that I could get my hands on, I finally found real purity.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this product works.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle of Real Purity Deodorant.  </li>
            <li> A friend convinced me to give it a shot after she researched it as a natural option for her pre-teen daughter.  </li>
            <li> It works well and is a safer natural formula.</li>
            <li> real purity deodorant was strange to get used to at first, as I&#x27;d never used a roll on applicator before, but it didn&#x27;t take long to acclimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this, I stay dry and clean all day long.</li>
            <li> It also has a subtle fragrance that I love.</li>
            <li> But I can live with that, knowing that this deodorant actually works for me, and the fact that it is all natural and does not contain aluminum.</li>
            <li> recently moved in upper 80&#x27;s and high eastern US humidity and held up very well - could not tell difference between this and old regular antiperspirant</li>
            <li> No more underarm rash, it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using during major heat waves if you need an antiperspirant, but the deodorant seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> While I typically make my own, when I run out or am feeling lazy, this is my go-to.</li>
            <li> Only critique is that it&#x27;s much more expensive buying through Amazon vs buying directly from Real Purity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because this was the first and only natural deodorant I ever tried, I have since tested out a few more brands - namely the \\&quot;Primal Pit Paste\\&quot; that everyone has been raving about lately.</li>
            <li> It lasted as long as the commercial natural deodorants that are half the price and easily available at stores.  </li>
            <li> would much rather smell like this than like a longshoreman on a hot day (no offense to hard</li>
            <li> It is much safer to use a natural deodorant than conventional ones with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work fine, and I allow to dry a few minutes before putting my shirt on just in case.  </li>
            <li> Have tried several natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ONLY natural deodorant that</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this was possible with a natural deo.</li>
            <li> Almost 20 years later I have tried every natural deodorant on the market</li>
            <li> I have tried countless natural deodorants and they are always too sticky, stinky, don&#x27;t do anything at all, or</li>
            <li> I believe the natural iodine in the seaweed extract kills the odorous bacteria, you only need a little bit - the more you use it, the less you have to use because it manages the bacteria in your skin.</li>
            <li> The fact that it works extremely well and is natural is the main selling point, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another deodorant again.</li>
            <li> (It is a tad bit expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!!!)</li>
            <li> even this deodorant has held up in days of extreme perspiration unless you really use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I tried several different natural deodorants before finding this one.</li>
            <li> For years, I have been researching, reading reviews and trying out countless natural deodorants, only to find that I would want to run away from myself at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> But this left me with the problem of finding natural deodorants that actually worked for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant I have tried that actually works!</li>
            <li> It has a slight essential oil smell at first but that fades.</li>
            <li> I forgot mine at home on a long road trip and bought some of my old brand and realized how ineffective it is in comparison.</li>
            <li> I almost decided to give up and go back to conventional deodorants when a friend recommended that I try Real Purity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t dry completely on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and this is the only one that works.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other natural formulas that didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> I have been searching endlessly for a natural deodorant sans aluminum that would keep me stink-free all day.</li>
            <li> No need to re-apply throughout the day like other natural deodorants</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other types and brands of natural deodorants including: Herban Cowboy, Crystal Body Stick, and Tom&#x27;s of Maine....</li>
            <li> Other natural deodorants work for me</li>
            <li> All other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried stop working at the end of the day, but</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the smell can be a little bit strong.</li>
            <li> Even though it is expensive, it&#x27;s worth every penny as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> It never burns or stings (as I regularly have open skin under my arm due to my condition).  </li>
            <li> Only, and I mean only, natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve found that actually works for men and women alike.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little masculine...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably bought &amp; tried at least 20 other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants over the past year or more...</li>
            <li> Antiperspirant because it works so well at keeping me from smelling all day long.  </li>
            <li> With all the essential oils, I expected it to smell feminine, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a quest for a less toxic product that actually works--I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of natural deodorants after finally breaking away from the major brand names that all use unhealthy chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this after having bought several other brands/kinds</li>
            <li> Such a relief to know I am not absorbing all that aluminum, but am using something that works!</li>
            <li> Only complains is that it&#x27;s a roll-on, so very wet.  </li>
            <li> Have to wait for it to dry before putting a shirt on.  </li>
            <li> and so you have to let it dry.</li>
            <li> It also takes some time to dry.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it smells a bit masculine.  </li>
            <li> It rolls on wet, but I just adjusted my routine to give it time to dry before dressing.</li>
            <li> Example: This afternoon I spent over 2 hours cleaning out my storage unit in about 75 - 80 degree F weather.</li>
            <li> Rollerball-type of deodorant goes on wet, but is not sticky.  </li>
            <li> It is a roll on, so it goes on wet.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant actually keeps body odor down while providing a slight gender-neutral fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy any other brand again - because other brands DO NOT cover up the smell.</li>
            <li> Other products I have tried over the years have made my skin break</li>
            <li> i usually sweat a lot before a presentation or public speaking.</li>
            <li> like other reviews also mentioned.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thick, so much that I had to squeeze the bottle to get a little lotion onto the roller ball.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition and have found very few deoderant&#x27;s that do not aggrivate it and that actually work.  </li>
            <li> (I looked on their website and the company does seem to make a solid deodorant, but it is not the same formula and seemed to get poor reviews).</li>
            <li> You need to put it on and let is dry for a few seconds before you put your clothes on.</li>
            <li> As always, comes in time and always* works to keep really bad odors away - as long as you wash properly then apply it, keeps armpits that can get really smelly from smelling at all for two days.</li>
            <li> It works for me just as well as the conventional brands.</li>
            <li> It is a little wet if you&#x27;re not used to that</li>
            <li> but my BO like with the other previously mentioned</li>
            <li> No smell other than the slightly medicinal-smelling oils that comprise the deodorant.</li>
            <li> an average day where I&#x27;m not doing anything that makes me sweat in excess, I can still smell this deodorant by the end of the day rather than smelling nothing</li>
            <li> I bought this based on Amazon reviews, and they did not let me down.  </li>
            <li> but I find if you use less it is not so damp...</li>
            <li> The less bacteria you have, the slower your armpits begin to smell so you can go longer periods with less.</li>
            <li> I sweat less</li>
            <li> I have tried others, and half way through the day I can already detect the smell of B.O.</li>
            <li> But neither is dumping deadly chemicals into my bloodstream via conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li> Major complaint is the slow drying after application.  </li>
            <li> I had to shake it vigorously to get a little bit on the ball.</li>
            <li> Turns out that my body reacts negatively to baking soda, which is a very common ingredient in natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to Secret.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS DEODORANT BASED ON AN ARTICLE FROM MIND, BODY, GREEN</li>
            <li> I WORK OUT A LOT AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH SMELL :~)</li>
            <li> I will say that it&#x27;s a tad messy to apply because the formula is creamy like a stick deodorant</li>
            <li> After a few hours the smell did dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who can get pretty bad under-arm odor - I just put a little on, guy or girl, after you shower</li>
            <li> You might want to store it upside down to keep the roll-on ball damp; otherwise it can dry and become difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy sweater and this works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been camping for the past two days.  </li>
            <li> Deodorant\\&quot; from The People&#x27;s Pharmacy I&#x27;ve found a combination that for the most part keeps me from smelling horrible!  </li>
            <li> My usual test was by the end of the day if I could smell myself and none of the deodorant scent remained, then I needed to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive, but lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure exactly what it is, but to me it is very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Not that it smelled bad, but again, just a bit masculine.  </li>
            <li> No ones complained?  </li>
            <li> Another negative is this is a roll-on</li>
            <li> The fragrance reminds me of Bert&#x27;s Bees - neutral and subtle.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive with shipping.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, in fact it only has a very subtle scent, it isn&#x27;t chalky and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes</li>
            <li> but still not great.</li>
            <li> I feel like I smell worse than if I didn&#x27;t use any deodorant.</li>
            <li> No one in my family understands how horrible it was to have ridiculous body odor every time I exercised, had a panic attack, or was outside in the heat.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the poor packaging made it a wast of money for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all - Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Nature&#x27;s Gate, Trader Joes, those mineral rocks, anything else I could get at the health food store - they all crap out on me half way through the day.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about giving up my &amp;#34;Secret&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I continued to sweat like crazy (</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try this since it wasn&#x27;t an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> my body hardly stinks</li>
            <li> However, after about 20-30 applications, it became impossible to get the stuff out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out really badly in my armpit area.</li>
            <li> some smell bad, some don&#x27;t work, some stain, and some don&#x27;t apply well.  </li>
            <li> This one works and works well without all the crap.</li>
            <li> Now I have to go in and change AGAIN because I smell bad!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Take a chance and give it a try, odds are you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I have used prescription-strength, aluminum-filled deodorant forever and got to the point where I cringed every time I used it at the thought of the horrible things it was probably doing to me.</li>
            <li> rancid, awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle.  Very effective without harmful ingredients!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants and this is the only one that works.  Only complains is that it&#x27;s a roll-on, so very wet.  Have to wait for it to dry before putting a shirt on.  An easy sacrifice to make considering how great it works.</li>
            <li> This deoderant is amazing. It really works i have used so many other and nothing like this one. In the beginning I had to reapply but after a months applied one time for the whole day.</li>
            <li> this deodorant actually works so well, I am amazed. I will never go back to Secret. I have bought it twice. I have tried other natural formulas that didn&#x27;t work...so great job Real Purity!</li>
            <li> did not work like the many other non-aluminum I have tried</li>
            <li> It is the best deodorant I have ever used, natural or otherwise.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorant brands - Tom&#x27;s, Burts Bees, homemade essential oil blends - and this is ok but not the best.  It lasted as long as the commercial natural deodorants that are half the price and easily available at stores.  The lotion is very thick, so much that I had to squeeze the bottle to get a little lotion onto the roller ball.</li>
            <li> Have tried several natural deodorants. This is the only one that really works for me. It doesn&#x27;t react with perspiration and cause additional odor. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> No ones complained?  I assume it is working.</li>
            <li> BEST NATURAL DEODORANT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It really works.</li>
            <li> I have spent a while looking for a deodorant that does not include aluminum and is also effective.  This one seems to do the trick for me.  It also works okay as an antiperspirant.  At first I thought it went dry really quickly, until I clued in that it needs to be shaken to wet the application ball.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ONLY natural deodorant that works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried others and they do not work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one always keeps me smelling FANTASTIC!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price.  I wouldn&#x27;t nornally pay so much for an item.  But I know that I am  worth it!  It is much safer to use a natural deodorant than conventional ones with chemicals.  And I feel good doing something nice for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this deodorant and it is the ONLY ONE I USE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I still smell.  This had great reviews so I thought I would try it.  It is okay.  Better than a lot of natural deodorants....but still not great.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant that I have found. All the others that I have tried did not work.</li>
            <li> I read about this deo on someone&#x27;s blog stating that they had tried everything else on the market and this was the answer. I read some reviews and instantly bought it. I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 days, but let me tell you...I have been raving about it for 3 days! No one in my family understands how horrible it was to have ridiculous body odor every time I exercised, had a panic attack, or was outside in the heat. It was always &#x27;Great! Now I have to go in and change AGAIN because I smell bad!&#x27; NOT ANYMORE KIDDO. I will NEVER buy any other brand again - because other brands DO NOT cover up the smell. I am so grateful I ran across that blog!!&lt;br /&gt;This deo has a light natural scent. It&#x27;s a roll on. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and the ease of it.  It is a little wet if you&#x27;re not used to that but I find if you use less it is not so damp...also a little dab of powder is welcome in some cases.  I recommend this to others that want a good clean deodorant to use that won&#x27;t cause harm to their body.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works so well, and doesn&#x27;t cause me any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I have tried many since moving away from using chemical filled products, but nothing worked as well as this. It also has a subtle fragrance that I love.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, smells great and is natural and kindly sourced. Perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many organic, natural deodorants and not one of them has ever worked. With this, I stay dry and clean all day long. The initial smell isn&#x27;t my favorite thing (it&#x27;s a bit floral and strong), but it doesn&#x27;t linger after you put it on. It just keeps you smelling fresh all day long. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I agree with the others who cite the strong scent of this product as a potential issue. I have some pretty gnarly scent sensitivities, but this product does not set them off. I actually like the scent and I have not found that it lingers in an undesirable way, like a perfume or even strong essential oils would.&lt;br /&gt;The scent has fruit and spice tones with a hint of a floral(?) - it smells like several wonderful things in nature - not like fake perfume or a chem lab.&lt;br /&gt;I would much rather smell like this than like a longshoreman on a hot day (no offense to hard working men).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it every day for about two weeks with great results. That means I did NOT have stinky pits after working up several good sweats exercising (indoor and out). Example: This afternoon I spent over 2 hours cleaning out my storage unit in about 75 - 80 degree F weather. I was dripping sweat when I was done, but not reeking. This product was up to the challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also had zero allergic reaction to this. Other products I have tried over the years have made my skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave a film or powder either. That&#x27;s another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to ding it for anything, it would be the price. It is a little expensive with shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant!  I prefer non-scented but this works so well that since it is very lightly scented I still think it is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would be hypoallergenic, but no.  I used it once, broke out in an itchy rash, and had to use hydrocortisone cream for three days afterward.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant!  Smells very nice and works extremely well, even after a really good work out at the gym!</li>
            <li> Smells like baby powder. And thats about all it does</li>
            <li> I have used prescription-strength, aluminum-filled deodorant forever and got to the point where I cringed every time I used it at the thought of the horrible things it was probably doing to me. I decided to do some research on natural deodorants, and gave this one a try first since it was very highly recommended. I absolutely love it. It works perfectly and lasts the entire day. The fragrance reminds me of Bert&#x27;s Bees - neutral and subtle. It did come packaged with a warning about not being FDA evaluated ... but honestly, that really isn&#x27;t saying much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this was the first and only natural deodorant I ever tried, I have since tested out a few more brands - namely the \\&quot;Primal Pit Paste\\&quot; that everyone has been raving about lately. I honestly did not like any of them as much as Real Purity&#x27;s! Still my favorite :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It smells pleasant without a strong smell, is made of natural ingredients with no aluminum like other deordorants and kept me dry and clean smelling all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing natural deodorant!  It works -- even in the hottest days of a Phoenix summer!!  It&#x27;s a liquid (roll-on), but it dries quickly.  And it&#x27;s long-lasting, too!!!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of health-food-store deodorants, and this one outperforms all of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> It Doesn&#x27;t Hurt and you won&#x27;t stink like a hippie lol. I love this product and use it every day</li>
            <li> I tried several different natural deodorants before finding this one. Turns out that my body reacts negatively to baking soda, which is a very common ingredient in natural deodorants.  So, needless to say, I was thrilled when baking soda was not one of the ingredients here! The roller works fine, and it does keep me dry throughout the day. My only complaint is that the smell can be a little bit strong. It&#x27;s not fruity or flowery, but moreso medicine like.  I didn&#x27;t really notice it when I had on long sleeves or even short sleeves, but now that I&#x27;ve been wearing more sleeveless tops, I definitely smell this deodorant throughout the day. Even with the smell, I would still reorder, but my only suggestion to the company would be to look at perhaps adding some essential oils to make it a bit more pleasing to the nostrils</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant ever! Well worth the money! I am a heavy sweater and this works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> As many others have said, this is a great natural deodorant. No propylene glycol which is found in many &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; (e.g. Kiss My Face), and not sticky (Jason), and even better than Peoples Pharmacy Magnesium Women&#x27;s Deo (flowery smell). Works well and feels good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now that it&#x27;s warm here in South Carolina, this deodorant has been put to the test. I am surprised to find this is actually better than  ANY deodorant I have used, natural or not. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Best natural deo. Better than the reg non-natural deo.... I got this for my husband and he works construction... even in a desert climate working manual labor it works great!</li>
            <li> Worth the price, allergic to all others</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deodorant that works, I had high hopes for this based on the reviews. When I tried it for the first time I absolutely could not stand the smell. I am not sure exactly what it is, but to me it is very unpleasant. On the positive side it works well, I just can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Have searched the world over for a truly natural deodorant. This really gets the job done for me. Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed by this one. Usually &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants don&#x27;t work so well as &#x27;harmful&#x27; ones, but I would still use them for the health sake. This one actually DOES work (surprisingly). I was using it during some stressful period this summer and it did help me to stay smell free, even tho i usually sweat a lot before a presentation or public speaking. Thus said I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> As always, comes in time and always* works to keep really bad odors away - as long as you wash properly then apply it, keeps armpits that can get really smelly from smelling at all for two days.</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself was fairly effective, and I like the mild smell. However, after about 20-30 applications, it became impossible to get the stuff out of the bottle. Sadly, the poor packaging made it a wast of money for me.</li>
            <li> my favorite....still the same  product even though packaging has changed</li>
            <li> Smells great works great, feels good works better than all those clinical strength deodorants on the market and all natural. Doesn&#x27;t get better</li>
            <li> I have been searching endlessly for a natural deodorant sans aluminum that would keep me stink-free all day. For years, I have been researching, reading reviews and trying out countless natural deodorants, only to find that I would want to run away from myself at the end of the day. I was convinced that I&#x27;m just a stinky person who must resort to chemicals to keep my friends around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went searching again and ran across Real Purity on Amazon. The reviews had my interest peaked but I was naturally apprehensive when I hit the purchase button. Now, a month later and nearly every day usage, I&#x27;m happy to report my world has been rocked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, Real Purity deodorant smells terrific! Secondly, with the 90-degreeish heat upon us already, I had put it through the ultimate test. No need to re-apply throughout the day like other natural deodorants and I still smell good! I put the deodorant through another test--hot yoga class set at 100-degrees. I continued to sweat like crazy (which is what humans are supposed to do,) but I did not chase anyone out of that class, including myself! I&#x27;m completely impressed that my worlds have collided where chemical-free meets pleasantry.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have ever used. I think it is even comparable to the non-natural kinds. I love the scent too :)</li>
            <li> Works very well! Best one I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants. I can officially stop looking. It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on Amazon reviews, and they did not let me down.  I&#x27;ve been camping for the past two days.  I don&#x27;t wear commercial deodorant and was waiting patiently for this to arrive.  It was sitting in my mailbox when I got home tonight so I thought I would just try it out.  I was super stinky when I put it on and the smell immediately disappeared.  It&#x27;s now hours later and I still smell good.  This stuff is honestly better than any other deodorant I have ever used.  I am a loyal fan and future customer.  Could not recommend a product anymore..</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and even though I don&#x27;t have strong odor the natural products all seem to make me sweat more! This is the first an only product that has helped me smell great and has reduced how damp my under arms are, or were. Very happy customer!</li>
            <li> First natural deo that actually helped with wetness (I&#x27;m a sweater!) and I used to apply this 2-3 times a day but now am at 1x per day and way more odor &amp; wetness free...I didn&#x27;t think this was possible with a natural deo. I&#x27;ve tried them all, some worked really well for a short time but nothing lasted. This has worked for 8 months and if anything is a bit drying if I over apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so stinky I had to throw it away. If you are at all sensitive to smells, do NOT purchase this product. I can&#x27;t attest to how effective it is as deodorant because I couldn&#x27;t bear to put it on my body.</li>
            <li> Since finding this product through a friend, I will never use anything else.  A bit more expensive than your avg (toxic) deodorant, but worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS DEODORANT BASED ON AN ARTICLE FROM MIND, BODY, GREEN AND IT SEEMS TO WORK REALLY WELL. I WORK OUT A LOT AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH SMELL :~)</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever. I&#x27;ve made the rounds on natural deodorants, including Lavanila, Crystal, and a natural Collodial silver kind I found here on amazon. This one works and works well without all the crap. It has a slight essential oil smell at first but that fades. I find myself not having to reapply for days when I don&#x27;t work out. I&#x27;ve referred many people to this deodorant, and they all love it as well. So happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all - Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Nature&#x27;s Gate, Trader Joes, those mineral rocks, anything else I could get at the health food store - they all crap out on me half way through the day.  Real Purity is the only deodorant that has ever worked and the scent is perfect - not too powerful.</li>
            <li> Rollerball-type of deodorant goes on wet, but is not sticky.  Dries nicely.  It is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant.  I use this on an everyday basis and it does just fine.  On special occasions when I don&#x27;t want any perspiration, I will use the aluminum-containing antiperspirant.  Somewhat expensive, but lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  purified water, organic kosher vegetable glycerin, organic aloe, organic pure grapefruit essential oil, organic pure olive leaf extract, Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols), organic pure sandalwood essential oil, organic pure grapeseed oil, organic pure rosemary essential oil, organic pure geranium essential oil, organic pure sage essential oil, organic pure rosewood essential oil, cleavers extract, organic pure apricot oil, (minerals - magnesium &amp; potassium).</li>
            <li> So far (one week in) this is the best non-aluminum deoderant I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve been using Real Purity but this has a lot better antiperspirant effect.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d noticed that some complaints were that it was &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; on the armpit. I found that if you apply by tapping on the armpit to just get enough on the skin and then move your arm around to spread it that works the best. It&#x27;s working out really well--even with the heat of the summer and sleeveless tanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably bought &amp; tried at least 20 other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants over the past year or more...none of them have worked for me! I wish I would have documented them all--it would have made for an entertaining/informational blog!  Anyway, Real Purity is by far the best out of the batch...it&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s one of two brands that I&#x27;ve actually reordered!  I don&#x27;t use it alone--I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d actually be effective alone...but when used in combination with the \\&quot;Milk of Magnesia Roll-On Deodorant\\&quot; from The People&#x27;s Pharmacy I&#x27;ve found a combination that for the most part keeps me from smelling horrible!  If you&#x27;re on a quest for a less toxic product that actually works--I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Very effective deodorant! Only critique is that it&#x27;s much more expensive buying through Amazon vs buying directly from Real Purity.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!!  I think it works better than any deodorant or antiperspirant that I have tried.  I became concerned with the chemicals and aluminum in commercial antiperspirant and the health concerns pertaining to them.  After experimenting with numerous natural deodorants, including sprays, roll-ons and crystals (all of which did not work for me), I found Real Purity.  It keeps me smelling fresh all day!</li>
            <li> When I was 12 (I&#x27;m 33 now) I started breaking out really badly in my armpit area. My doctor recommended that I stop using chemical deodorant and whaddya know, the breakouts stopped almost immediately. But this left me with the problem of finding natural deodorants that actually worked for me. Almost 20 years later I have tried every natural deodorant on the market and I will say that this is hands down the very best in terms of ingredients and effectiveness. I do believe that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but for mine this deodorant works overtime, I can always trust that I will smell like flowers if I remember to put this stuff on. I forgot mine at home on a long road trip and bought some of my old brand and realized how ineffective it is in comparison. If you have tried everything else, spend the $10 + shipping and try this, it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> The best holistic all natural hypo-allergenic deodorant you&#x27;ll ever have! I&#x27;m a guy who can get pretty bad under-arm odor - I just put a little on, guy or girl, after you shower and you will not stink the whole day! No more underarm rash, it&#x27;s totally worth it! I believe the natural iodine in the seaweed extract kills the odorous bacteria, you only need a little bit - the more you use it, the less you have to use because it manages the bacteria in your skin. The less bacteria you have, the slower your armpits begin to smell so you can go longer periods with less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of natural deodorants after finally breaking away from the major brand names that all use unhealthy chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the ones I have tried haven&#x27;t worked for me. My usual test was by the end of the day if I could smell myself and none of the deodorant scent remained, then I needed to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This real purity deodorant was strange to get used to at first, as I&#x27;d never used a roll on applicator before, but it didn&#x27;t take long to acclimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other types and brands of natural deodorants including: Herban Cowboy, Crystal Body Stick, and Tom&#x27;s of Maine....none of them have worked like this real purity deodorant has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On an average day where I&#x27;m not doing anything that makes me sweat in excess, I can still smell this deodorant by the end of the day rather than smelling nothing but my BO like with the other previously mentioned brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because there have been some days where I have perspired more than usual, and I don&#x27;t really feel like even this deodorant has held up in days of extreme perspiration unless you really use a lot of it. Even then though, you stand a better chance with this than most other popular natural deodorants out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe someday I will be able to find the perfect natural deodorant sans harmful chemicals that holds up on days when life makes you sweat buckets, but until then, this is my go-to natural deodorant of choice.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant.  It works well and I love the smell.  Very natural, not perfumey.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I was afraid to try this since it wasn&#x27;t an antiperspirant. Amazingly enough I don&#x27;t sweat at all when using it. I highly recommend this product to everyone who wants a safe and natural deodorant and to avoid the serious dangers of antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DEODORANT!!!!! it is amazing. By far the best all day protection that I have found yet. Love the smell too!!! Rolls on nice, dries quick... I do reapply once during the warmer and more active days but it really keeps me stink free. And it&#x27;s all natural goodness! LOVEEE it</li>
            <li> Other natural deodorants work for me but this one doesn&#x27;t.  However, I did give it a friend who loves it so maybe it&#x27;s a body chemistry thing?</li>
            <li> After suffering through breast cancer, I decided never to put chemicals on my body again if I can avoid it.  I was skeptical about giving up my &amp;#34;Secret&amp;#34; Antiperspirant because it works so well at keeping me from smelling all day long.  I had nothing to worry about, this deodorant has a pleasant smell and so far I haven&#x27;t had a single day where my armpits were smelly at the end of the day.  I purchased 2 more, one for each of my young daughters so that they won&#x27;t be putting aluminum and other chemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li> I choose a natural deodorant because I&#x27;m trying to minimize the amount of chemicals that are absorbed into my body.  The problem with most natural deodorants is that they simply can&#x27;t get rid of that sweaty, stinky, underarm odor for me.  After trying any roll on, stick, powder, or rub on that I could get my hands on, I finally found real purity.  For me, it eliminates underarm odor.  It is a roll on, so it goes on wet.  It dries within 5 minutes and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  It has a very light, clean scent that fades away.  It keeps me odor free all day. The best part is that one application in the morning works throughout the night too.  I don&#x27;t wake up with stinky odor in the morning either.  It is well worth the high price.  I wish that my local stores carried it.  I don&#x27;t want to ever run out.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before, but had to do it for this deodorant. It is THE BEST DEODORANT EVER, SERIOUSLY!!! All other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried stop working at the end of the day, but with this one you still smell fresh way into the evening. I love the smell too! I just wish they made this same formula in a solid (I looked on their website and the company does seem to make a solid deodorant, but it is not the same formula and seemed to get poor reviews). Even though it is expensive, it&#x27;s worth every penny as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Take a chance and give it a try, odds are you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I just love this deodorant!!! Best organic deodorant I have ever tried!!! I have super sensitive skin and I can actually use this deodorant. The scent is a little masculine...but it wears off after an hour or so. Even my husband loves it and started using it. But the deodorant is pretty runny...like other reviews also mentioned. But I can live with that, knowing that this deodorant actually works for me, and the fact that it is all natural and does not contain aluminum. I highly recommend it and it is worth trying it!!!</li>
            <li> As for if the product works, I&#x27;d say it works pretty well. However, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  I thought it would be unscented but it is very masculine smelling.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an antiperspirant, and it is a great product!</li>
            <li> My Functional Medicine Doctor told me about Real Purity Deodorant and swore that&#x27;s THE only natural deodorant she was able to find, that actually works. I decided to try it and purchased the first one. After two days of using it, went back and purchased another 2 so my family can convert from the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; mostly toxic products.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the scent and the power of keeping me fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> I ordered this deodorant, and I am so very please with it that I will use it from now on. The fragrance is very nice, and the protection lasts for days. I like this deodorant more than any I have ever used. It is a healthy deodorant too. I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> recently moved in upper 80&#x27;s and high eastern US humidity and held up very well - could not tell difference between this and old regular antiperspirant</li>
            <li> Only, and I mean only, natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve found that actually works for men and women alike. Try not to &amp;#34;contaminate&amp;#34; the roller ball by using it when you&#x27;re &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best natural deodorant, It actually works and I&#x27;ve been using it for years. In the beginning I did have to re-apply once or twice during the day but once my body adjusted to it only need it once in the morning like a traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li> After switching from antiperspirants, I tried several holistic deodorants. Some of them had more pleasant smells or smelled strongly for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is the only one that has reliably worked, and I continue to buy it. It does smell nice, and it takes a minute to dry (though I often don&#x27;t wait for it to dry because I am running out the door, and it has not seemed to matter). I sweat less and I smell better!</li>
            <li> I am a recent convert from aluminum deodorants, and this stuff actually works. I have a desk job, but I have also put it to the test working outside in the July heat. No smell other than the slightly medicinal-smelling oils that comprise the deodorant. Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Was all it claimed to be. Very nice scent and long lasting. Will be ordering this product again. Great price.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this product works. It works for me just as well as the conventional brands. It even seems to reduce the amount of wetness under my arms, although that isn&#x27;t why I purchased it. It keeps me oder free. I don&#x27;t think it has a strong smell like I can remember someone posting. I find that it&#x27;s mild and pleasant. I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deodorant because it&#x27;s natural and it REALLY works! If I don&#x27;t want to shower every day, I don&#x27;t need to. It works that well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many a natural deo with each one as disappointing as the one prior (including home-made concoctions of cornstarch, baking soda, arrowroot, coconut oil, etc.) This is the first product that deals with odor and doesn&#x27;t leave me with an itchy rash (even right after shaving). I think it&#x27;s worth every penny; I work in a professional environment so B.O. is not an option! But neither is dumping deadly chemicals into my bloodstream via conventional deodorants. BONUS: it&#x27;s not advertised as an antiperspirant but it seems to alleviate wetness too.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this natural deodorant really works....and all day!  I have been looking for a natural product that had just the right ingredients to stop odor.  Amazing!  (It is a tad bit expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it!!!)</li>
            <li> It started out okay, but after a couple of weeks the roller ball no longer distributed any product. I had to shake it vigorously to get a little bit on the ball. At this point, whatever did come out didn&#x27;t seem to work at all anymore. I kept using it even though it was such a process to give it a fair chance, but eventually it actually seemed like the deodorant began to smell like b.o. from being used as opposed to actually preventing b.o.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many deodorants over the decades, and switched to healthier, non-toxic versions about 8 years back. While I typically make my own, when I run out or am feeling lazy, this is my go-to. It works incredibly well, and actually lasts all day - unlike many non-toxic deodorants on both of those counts. Definitely superior to any other healthy brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m celiac so I do appreciate this product is gluten free. However, keep this in your purse because you&#x27;ll need to reapply throughout the day. Another negative is this is a roll-on and so you have to let it dry.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant I have tried that actually works! I have tried others, and half way through the day I can already detect the smell of B.O. I&#x27;ve been wearing it on a daily basis (in the summer!) for about 2 weeks now and it has not failed me. I even feel like it helps slightly with perspiring, but the main thing is that I don&#x27;t smell of B.O. I will say that it&#x27;s a tad messy to apply because the formula is creamy like a stick deodorant but it&#x27;s in a roll-on. It also takes some time to dry. In fact, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t dry completely on it&#x27;s own, but after about 10 minutes I just pat any extra and I&#x27;m good to go. The fact that it works extremely well and is natural is the main selling point, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another deodorant again.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this natural product, even my sister had tried it and it worked great for her.  I gave it several weeks and each day it made me smell rancid, awful. Was really disappointed!  Was excited to finally find a natural deodorant with great reviews and success!  Just wasn&#x27;t meant for me I guess!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well and is safe to use. If you&#x27;re used to antiperspirant it will take some getting used to; it&#x27;s effective at controlling odor but you may still perspire some. It rolls on wet, but I just adjusted my routine to give it time to dry before dressing. You might want to store it upside down to keep the roll-on ball damp; otherwise it can dry and become difficult to use.</li>
            <li> My search for an all natural deodorant that works is over! Works for a full 24 hrs. No scent, dries fast.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found.  I have a skin condition and have found very few deoderant&#x27;s that do not aggrivate it and that actually work.  This product doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell, but I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t smell it at all after it dries.  It&#x27;s made of natural ingredients which I like and is made in the USA!  It never burns or stings (as I regularly have open skin under my arm due to my condition).  It&#x27;s odor protection lasts all day, even on days I really sweat.  My search for a deoderant tolerated by my skin condition is finally over.  Thank you to the makers of this product!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle of Real Purity Deodorant.  I apply the deodorant once in the morning and have no problem with odor all day.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 4 yrs.  This product is amazing!!!  If you have been a long time antiperspirant user, you might go through a stinky detox period when switching over to a healthier option, but unlike all the other *better choice deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the best!!!  ***I even made my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my body hardly stinks and I was the gal who had to reapply antiperspirant about 4xs a day....now I go days with nothing because I don&#x27;t stink....it is amazing what happens w/o toxins!!!  All good things!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after having bought several other brands/kinds and I really like this one. The stick ones I tried were a little gritty and my underarms started breaking out, this goes on smooth and it seems to really work so far but it hasn&#x27;t had to deal with 100+ weather while sitting in a truck with no a/c lol but so far so good and my breakouts have gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Well I&#x27;ve bought this product a couple times now and still love it!! I have YET to have any odor even when sitting in 100 degree weather in the sun in a truck with no a/c, unloading a ton of hay or anything else I&#x27;ve done and my pits still haven&#x27;t broke out using this :)</li>
            <li> Try the real purity stick deodorant.  It&#x27;s much better than this spray which stinks-as in literally and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The deodorant worked well, throughout the day and I didn&#x27;t need to re-apply, a good buy.</li>
            <li> Works great, and smells good.  I have tried everything - EVERYTHING - and am very happy with this product. I would say that this is the first natural deodorant I have been truly happy with (I like the salt crystal too, but it&#x27;s usually a layer under something else). Of course, if you&#x27;re funky like me you&#x27;ll understand that it doesn&#x27;t prevent sweat, but it sure does a good job eliminating/preventing so much odor.</li>
            <li> I tried many different natural deodorants... some smell bad, some don&#x27;t work, some stain, and some don&#x27;t apply well.  I almost decided to give up and go back to conventional deodorants when a friend recommended that I try Real Purity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m glad I did!  This deodorant actually keeps body odor down while providing a slight gender-neutral fragrance.  I have a pretty sensitive sense of smell (but no fragrance allergies), and I find this deodorant&#x27;s fragrance to be very mild.  It is a liquid-type that you shake up and apply with the roller-ball.  Seems to work fine, and I allow to dry a few minutes before putting my shirt on just in case.  I have been very pleased that it does not stain my shirts either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can be found for better prices through some vendors, so be sure to shop around to get the best price.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s the best natural deodorant.  In Ireland and the UK, it sells for 16 pounds sterling!  (about $24.00).  I&#x27;ve also found it for 21 euro from Denmark (about $25).  Feel fortunate it&#x27;s only 11 dollars in  the states .  It is, as many have said, the only one that works.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful that I found Real Purity and this deodorant is at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I have ever tried that actually keeps me odor free, and I have tried a ton!  It seems to help with wetness, too.  Love it.  Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This natural deodorant is great. Keeps me dry and smelling fresh. Love it!</li>
            <li> After trying pretty much all of the natural deodorants at Whole Foods and then giving up and going back to my old chemical deodorant, I can&#x27;t believe I actually ordered this.  A friend convinced me to give it a shot after she researched it as a natural option for her pre-teen daughter.  Well, amazingly, it actually works--and truly as well as the chemical stuff.  I am also not normally a fan of roll-ons, but this one dries very quickly and the scent (which is wonderfully neutral) dissipates equally fast.  I am a convert.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this worked!  Its all natural, but works way better than drug store brands that ate full of aluminum. And who wants aluminum being absorbed through the skin and entering the bloodstream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it smells a bit masculine.  With all the essential oils, I expected it to smell feminine, but it didn&#x27;t.  Not that it smelled bad, but again, just a bit masculine.  After a few hours the smell did dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, smell and sweat free underarms.  Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been okay.  Major complaint is the slow drying after application.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using during major heat waves if you need an antiperspirant, but the deodorant seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I never review products on here because I can&#x27;t really be bothered. But I have been looking for a good natural deodorant for ages, even going so far as to make my own, which just irritated my skin. This is the first I have found that works. I love it, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, in fact it only has a very subtle scent, it isn&#x27;t chalky and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and I don&#x27;t need to apply it more than regular deodorant. Such a relief to know I am not absorbing all that aluminum, but am using something that works!</li>
            <li> So far so good. This product is working well so far - the scent is light and pleasant and the roll on is great for easy application. I find that when the applying the solids sometimes your armpits get scratched</li>
            <li> I have tried countless natural deodorants and they are always too sticky, stinky, don&#x27;t do anything at all, or I feel like I smell worse than if I didn&#x27;t use any deodorant. I always end up back with my favorite anti-persperant. A friend of mine said I had to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been two months and I am still using it daily. It has been winter, so I am hoping I still feel this way through the summer, but so far so good. I do wear it and go to the gym five days a week and teach spin classes then lift weights and it does hold through that, so I am optimistic about summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used a roll on before it may take some getting used to. You need to put it on and let is dry for a few seconds before you put your clothes on. This doesn&#x27;t both me, but it is something to know. Will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deoderant. It works well and is a safer natural formula. I have used it for the last 5 years and it remains my favorite.</li>
