            <li>THAT REALLY DOES MAKE ME LOOK YOUNGER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL  </li>
            <li>I am SO excited about this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I bought for myself that I never would&#x27;ve had the money to buy at full price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this kit after being at a Mary Kay show and was convinced the hype was true.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot; for 2 full weeks, I even took an iPad picture of myself on day Zero and day 14 - no noticeable change</li>
            <li>The feel of my skin is fabulous, from the first time I used the product.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these products work better than those I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>it works far better than i thought it would.</li>
            <li>I love all the other products..and love that too</li>
            <li>I have tried several different products and this one is the best by far!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, but be extremely careful who you buy it from online.</li>
            <li>exactly what I paid for</li>
            <li>First time I ordered it, it was a scam.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase for a total skin system in many years.</li>
            <li>i am very please with my purchase and will buy again!</li>
            <li>FIRST MAKE-UP I&#x27;VE USED</li>
            <li>I enjoy the soft skin I get from using it.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the product for about a month and already see a difference in the fine lines over my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than what your distributor sells it for.  </li>
            <li>very please with the service and products recieved.</li>
            <li>I feel I get the same results with the time wise set minus break outs and stinging eyes.  </li>
            <li>I often returned to my old standby face cleaner to feel as though my face was fully clean AND THEN would complete the 4-step cleaning process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>face did NOT feel clean especially after working out or yard work.</li>
            <li>I use the Conair True Glow Sonic Facial Skincare System Set with this</li>
            <li>and you will most likely see similar</li>
            <li>I will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>Internet sales to strangers are in direct violation of legal terms of the Mary Kay Independent Beauty Consultant contract, and are a slap in the face to the \\&quot;Golden Rule\\&quot; ethics that are the foundation of Mary Kay&#x27;s 50 year history.</li>
            <li>so I can live without it at the refill price.</li>
            <li>I am new to Mary Kay, and wanted to try this product.</li>
            <li>I have used Mary Kay since I was 18 years old and am now in my 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Skin is soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li>It is greatso far.</li>
            <li>Be aware though, that as an online, remote purchaser, you WILL NOT receive the Mary Kay 100% satisfaction guarantee and there is no way for you to be certain that you&#x27;re receiving the actual patented product.</li>
            <li>The winters generally dry my skin out and this is the first year my face feels the same smoothness as it does in the spring/fall time.</li>
            <li>well that you have to be very careful with if you sweat it really stings as it pours into your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Also had past problems with people selling expired items (and some products are very time sensitive).  </li>

            <li> I love the product but hate the new pump.  </li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in only 2 weeks, between using this, and their other skin care line that I&#x27;ve been using for 20 years.  </li>
            <li> By the time I wake in the morning my face is dry again after applying the serum and night cream the night before.</li>
            <li> dry skin is softer and wrinkles are softer as well.</li>
            <li> My pump didn&#x27;t work on one of the products so had to take the top off which was nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> I tried buying it from Amazon because the price was about half of what I would buy it from a local dealer.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but well worth it</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks and do not a difference yet.  </li>
            <li> the bottle of timewise repair seems to be almost empty..</li>
            <li> Now I am getting under eye wrinkles and bought over 500.00 of Estee Lauder and the only thing seems to work is the night repair serum, kills dead skin, the I ordered from Seropha Kate Sommersville eye repair gave 150.00 for a .5 oz bottle and used it now for over a week and for that price and such a small bottle, not sure of that, so if any Mary Kay reads this, please guide me to the products I am looking for!</li>
            <li> I paid less than half price of what the MK lady wanted for this.  </li>
            <li> and of course $199 is about $60 less than retail</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I am pushing 40 and have lots of little lines.  </li>
            <li> is a little dab.  </li>
            <li> After using these products for a few weeks, I find that my face is softer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now</li>
            <li> The first thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that the daytime moisturizer breaks my skin out something awful.</li>
            <li> I dont use the eye cream because it got in my eyes by mistake and burned badly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s annoying</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good deal....shipped quickly. Product as described.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these products work better than those I&#x27;ve tried before.  I&#x27;m now combining the serum with retinal cream from Dr. and still working out well.  Just reordered my 2nd set.</li>

            <li> I am SO excited about this purchase.  I am a regular Amazon customer.  I paid less than half price of what the MK lady wanted for this.  It&#x27;s the real deal, great quality, great packaging.  An after Christmas gift I bought for myself that I never would&#x27;ve had the money to buy at full price.  Definitely worth it to feel more beautiful about yourself, great anti-aging products.  Leave your face feeling so soft and smelling wonderful! Buy for you and a friend!</li>

            <li> exactly what I paid for</li>
            <li> After using these products for a few weeks, I find that my face is softer. I like the fact that there are no perfumes or odor associated with the use of these creams and cleanser. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Sucked!!!!! Doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money.</li>

The best I can say is that the product is \\&quot;ok\\&quot;...nothing miraculous that&#x27;s for sure. By the time I wake in the morning my face is dry again after applying the serum and night cream the night before. Not what I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li> Definite difference for my aging skin.  I can tell a difference in only 2 weeks, between using this, and their other skin care line that I&#x27;ve been using for 20 years.  I&#x27;ve already purchased another!</li>
            <li> My sister is a consultant so I only buy through her so that I get my 100% satisfaction guarantee.  Also had past problems with people selling expired items (and some products are very time sensitive).  I purchased this product as I am pushing 40 and have lots of little lines.  The first thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that the daytime moisturizer breaks my skin out something awful.The eye cream well that you have to be very careful with if you sweat it really stings as it pours into your eyes.  Overall I am not sold on this product I feel I get the same results with the time wise set minus break outs and stinging eyes.  The serum is so so I can live without it at the refill price.</li>
            <li> I do like the product.  Easy to use and the smell of the lotion is nice.  I have only been using this for a few weeks and do not a difference yet.  I will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> the bottle of timewise repair seems to be almost empty..I love all the other products..and love that too but it does not want to pump up and out</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  The only problem for me is the price.  I wish I could afford to continue this product.  I use it until gone, go back to another product and then back to this again.  Nothing is the same as this stuff.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, never bought it online but I have used it for a year now and I don&#x27;t look over 32 and I am 47. Now I am getting under eye wrinkles and bought over 500.00 of Estee Lauder and the only thing seems to work is the night repair serum, kills dead skin, the I ordered from Seropha Kate Sommersville eye repair gave 150.00 for a .5 oz bottle and used it now for over a week and for that price and such a small bottle, not sure of that, so if any Mary Kay reads this, please guide me to the products I am looking for! I spoke with a lady was in her 80s and looked to be 50 something she said make sure it has rentional in it, I am so lost!</li>
            <li> I have seen some results from these products.  Will reorder and give the product a while longer to see if skin looks has more improvement.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I have tried several different products and this one is the best by far! If u are considering using the best products for your skin this is the one to get!  It contains all the products you will nees to care for your skin/complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product for about a month and already see a difference in the fine lines over my forehead.  It is expensive&lt;br /&gt;but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, but be extremely careful who you buy it from online. First time I ordered it, it was a scam. Luckily Amazon is awesome and backs there products. Was given a credit and bought from a more reputable source</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase for a total skin system in many years. Had some good experience with another MK face cream so settled on the brand.  Going through a divorce so felt like treating myself.&lt;br /&gt;The box was so nice, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;All you need with the scrub is a little dab.  I use the Conair True Glow Sonic Facial Skincare System Set with this and then a warm wash cloth.  The repair serum is ok, as well as the day and night creams, but the eye cream makes my eyes water.  No discoloration to the skin or anything with the eye cream, but it&#x27;s annoying and I may just stop using it.  I had a similar reaction to a Roc product. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week now and I do notice a better look to my face.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay since I was 18 years old and am now in my 50&#x27;s.  I love this product; it is working as promised and would recommend it to anyone wanting firmer skin.</li>
            <li> Fabulous delivery, great product. Good price and promptly sent,</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference in my skin.  This is the best product that I have ever used.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, how my skin looks and feels!  Great price for great product.  I will be ordering more Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> Used it for 3 days and am loving it.  Skin is soft and radiant.  Will wait to see at the end of 12 weeks how my deep wrinkles look.</li>
            <li> Fast service and a good product</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this new product.  It is everything I was hoping for and more.  The feel of my skin is fabulous, from the first time I used the product.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> this product looked good on the web page so i gave it a try. when i got it, it is everything the ad said it was and more!! it works far better than i thought it would. i am very please with my purchase and will buy again! so people give this a try you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> FIRST MAKE-UP I&#x27;VE USED THAT REALLY DOES MAKE ME LOOK YOUNGER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL  NO ANIMAL TESTING. LASTS QUITE A WHILE. USE IT WITH THE TIMEWISE FOUNDATION.</li>
            <li> And I love this set!  The winters generally dry my skin out and this is the first year my face feels the same smoothness as it does in the spring/fall time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and I do see results.&lt;br /&gt;My dry skin is softer and wrinkles are softer as well.</li>
            <li> TimeWise VoluFirm Repair is an amazing state of the art product that does what it claims and then some. Six yrs and 3K test panelists in the making, it is groundbreaking!  Be aware though, that as an online, remote purchaser, you WILL NOT receive the Mary Kay 100% satisfaction guarantee and there is no way for you to be certain that you&#x27;re receiving the actual patented product. Internet sales to strangers are in direct violation of legal terms of the Mary Kay Independent Beauty Consultant contract, and are a slap in the face to the \\&quot;Golden Rule\\&quot; ethics that are the foundation of Mary Kay&#x27;s 50 year history. I would encourage you to go to MaryKay.com and use the consultant locator to find a consultant in your area. She/he will be thrilled to provide you with personalized customer service, including the opportunity to try before you buy, earn discounted or free products AND honor the guarantee.</li>
            <li> I am new to Mary Kay, and wanted to try this product. It seems to be all that it claims to be, however the 12 weeks it takes to show results has not yet elapsed since I started using it. I enjoy the soft skin I get from using it.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product and recommend it to all women.  This product make my skin look and feel good</li>
            <li> It is greatso far. I dont use the eye cream because it got in my eyes by mistake and burned badly.</li>
            <li> This Timewise repair kit from mary kay that i got from amazon works very well, leaves my skin feeling great! Give this product 5 stars, Especially the price, thank you</li>
            <li> I decided, after a lot of reservations, try it. Mary Kay was forever around, but I do not like anybody calling to me or coming to my house. Buying on line was fantastic deal. But the most important part - it does works!! My crow lines around eyes disapeared, skin look brighter. Highly recomend!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great luv it I would recommend it to everyone. My mom luvs it and my cousin luv it. I told a lot of people</li>
            <li> I love the product but hate the new pump.  My pump didn&#x27;t work on one of the products so had to take the top off which was nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> Ok, I purchased this product as I started a new job and wanted to look my best AND return to taking care of myself (NOT something we nurses excel at doing!). I followed the directions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot; for 2 full weeks, I even took an iPad picture of myself on day Zero and day 14 - no noticeable change seen!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my skin feels smooth and lovely - but it does whenever I am true to ANY skin care program!&lt;br /&gt;My face did NOT feel clean especially after working out or yard work. I often returned to my old standby face cleaner to feel as though my face was fully clean AND THEN would complete the 4-step cleaning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy vs. Not buy?  Save your the money!  Find a (cheaper) program you will stick to and you will most likely see similar benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I likt Mary Kay eye make remover - it is the best!</li>
