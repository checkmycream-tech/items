            <li> I bought this brand on my last re-stock of Omega 3 action at the local grocery and found it to be a good product. And, being the Amazon freak that I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve found yourself becoming, as you&#x27;re shopping for fish oil online, I knew I could get it cheaper here. So I did. Good clean oil, keep it in the fridge to avoid fish burps and take with food or a large glass of water. I, as a 200 lb 6&#x27; 1&amp;#34; male, take two every morning</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years as it was recommended by my doctor .The very best value for your money</li>
