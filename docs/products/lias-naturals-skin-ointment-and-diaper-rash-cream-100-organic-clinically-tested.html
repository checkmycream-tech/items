            <li>And the scent is very pleasant!</li>
            <li>Our family is 3 for 3 with this awesome diaper-skin-rash-healing cream!</li>
            <li>so it is no wonder that it works as beautifully as it does!</li>
            <li>But of course, we all want the very best for our babies and to that end</li>
            <li>THE VERY BEST!</li>
            <li>A great lotion for eczema!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to tell you what a great product this is!  </li>
            <li>My sister sent a jar of this ointment to me as a gift, When I opened the jar the scent was delightful</li>
            <li>It is an effective skin ointment that works!!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this cream for my wife and daughter and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!!</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>It also works great as a lip balm and heals cracked lips as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also smells great and, for those who cloth diaper, makes their poop and diapers smell good</li>
            <li>Love this ointment!  </li>
            <li>and although it is marketed as a diaper cream, rest assured that it is so much more as well!</li>
            <li>I love that I have found something that I know is safe for my body and won&#x27;t leave any harmful chemicals inside.</li>
            <li>They both love it.</li>
            <li>Love Lia&amp;#34;s Naturals</li>
            <li>I love this ointment.</li>
            <li>This is the best cream not only for diaper rash.</li>
            <li>Great product - love that it is all natural as well!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, and I would think for a baby it would be rather nice for diaper rash!</li>
            <li>Very mild and works within days.</li>
            <li>They told me it makes their skin feel so moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healing powers are fabulous.</li>
            <li>it is a very well made product and smells amazing .</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s offering me such great relief.</li>
            <li>this safe, chemical free, natural, non toxic and EFFECTIVE cream is exactly that:</li>
            <li>Its nice because it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Lia&#x27;s Naturals is the first thing I&#x27;ve tried in months that actually smells good when I sweat here in sunny HOT Florida!!</li>
            <li>I feel ten times better after I put this lotion on!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We have even used it as a healing salve for the many scrapes and skinned knees that our young family has encountered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a glass jar which means it will stay fresh longer</li>
            <li>This product was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but im sure its useful for many other</li>
            <li>And on those extra hot summer days when a diaper situation yields a diaper rash in no time, this cream has healed those precious bottoms in only just a couple of hours to the great relief of my baby and of course to my own mental relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope this more detailed info helps other parents out who want an all natural solution for their precious babies</li>
            <li>The awesome part is a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>Lia&#x27;s Naturals can be used so many different ways!</li>
            <li>When I first put it on I thought ohhh, it&#x27;s a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought this ointment for my wife and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>and so I will have to try it on my daughter when she gets that first diaper rash.</li>
            <li>This ointment is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Gently and efficiently, the healing properties have gone right to work and sealed those cracks shut.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised with how fast it absorbed!</li>
            <li>This gentle yet potent natural medicine has done a tremendous job on countless &amp;#34;ouchies&amp;#34; and we have since learned that the Lavender oil (one of the oils) in it is a natural antiseptic</li>
            <li>and it didnt really help it</li>
            <li>Works really well for her.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>When she pooped in her cloth diaper, it really irritated her skin to the point her rash looked like someone scratched her up because her poop had the bacteria ((thrush/yeast)) that continually tore her skin up and prevented it from fully healing.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different natural deodorants that have not worked one bit.</li>
            <li>You can tell how high quality it is by the feel and smell of it, and it really does a great job of moisturizing rough, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>At first I was worried it was too greasy, but it absorbed immediately and left my fingers feeling soft and soothed.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because the cream is made with the purest essential oils it gets absorbed into the skin, does its thing, and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a slippery feeling wherever it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a product worth investing in.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for the rest of their product line to be developed.</li>
            <li>She said it is now completely gone.</li>
            <li>Neither options worked and so I went and looked on Amazon for something natural and behold, I came across this ointment and decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Wow did this help my hands.  </li>
            <li>It glides on really easily, not too thick, and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>, I love that it is organic and contains herbal ingredients that I am familiar with (no chemical weird additives), I used it on some problematic skin on my lower legs which has not responded to other lotions (even perscriptive creams from the Dermo).</li>
            <li>After only a day my skin feels soft and moist</li>
            <li>My whole pregnancy I have been looking for a lotion to help with dry skin, and this has been the only product that has truly helped my skin.  </li>
            <li>It works really well to soften and moisten dry hands or dry skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Lia&#x27;s Naturals can be used so many different ways! I&#x27;ve used it as lip balm, eczema cream and also deodorant! I have stopped using antiperspirant deodorant after reading about the harmful effects of aluminum. I have tried so many different natural deodorants that have not worked one bit. I feel as though they made me even stinkier than if I had just used nothing at all. Lia&#x27;s Naturals is the first thing I&#x27;ve tried in months that actually smells good when I sweat here in sunny HOT Florida!! I love that I have found something that I know is safe for my body and won&#x27;t leave any harmful chemicals inside. Our armpits and skin is so sensitive we need to be careful what we put on there. So yay for Lia&#x27;s Naturals! Can&#x27;t wait for the rest of their product line to be developed.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my wife and daughter and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!! I highly recommend it. They both love it. They told me it makes their skin feel so moisturized and smooth. 5 Stars all the way! If I could vote 10 stars I would! Lol</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have diaper rash, cradle cap or eczema issues, I tried this ointment for a dry spot I&#x27;ve had on my hands. When I first put it on I thought ohhh, it&#x27;s a bit greasy. But I was pleasantly surprised with how fast it absorbed! And the spot on my hand has improved. And the scent is very pleasant! Highly recommend it, and I would think for a baby it would be rather nice for diaper rash!</li>
            <li> My mom had been suffering with cradle cap behind her ear for the past year and nothing seemed to get rid of it...until this!  She said it is now completely gone. So thankful we found this.</li>
            <li> Love Lia&amp;#34;s Naturals</li>
            <li> Love this ointment!  It&#x27;s healing powers are fabulous. After only a day my skin feels soft and moist</li>
            <li> Our family is 3 for 3 with this awesome diaper-skin-rash-healing cream! All 3 of our babies have benefitted from our application of this product as a diaper cream. And on those extra hot summer days when a diaper situation yields a diaper rash in no time, this cream has healed those precious bottoms in only just a couple of hours to the great relief of my baby and of course to my own mental relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has worked wonders for me personally during the winter months when my skin tends to crack especially on my hands and around my knuckles. Gently and efficiently, the healing properties have gone right to work and sealed those cracks shut. It also works great as a lip balm and heals cracked lips as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have even used it as a healing salve for the many scrapes and skinned knees that our young family has encountered. This gentle yet potent natural medicine has done a tremendous job on countless &amp;#34;ouchies&amp;#34; and we have since learned that the Lavender oil (one of the oils) in it is a natural antiseptic so it is no wonder that it works as beautifully as it does! Not to mention that it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the cream is made with the purest essential oils it gets absorbed into the skin, does its thing, and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a slippery feeling wherever it&#x27;s applied. This cream is an all around healing cream and although it is marketed as a diaper cream, rest assured that it is so much more as well! But of course, we all want the very best for our babies and to that end this safe, chemical free, natural, non toxic and EFFECTIVE cream is exactly that: THE VERY BEST!</li>
            <li> I love this ointment. It glides on really easily, not too thick, and it has a pleasant smell. My daughter loves it and asks for her ointment when we do diaper changes.</li>
            <li> Soothing and comforting. A great lotion for eczema!</li>
            <li> i tried for my sons yeast rash and it didnt really help it but im sure its useful for many other things.but it is a very well made product and smells amazing .</li>
            <li> I bought this ointment for my wife and she absolutely loves it! Its nice because it is all natural. It works really well to soften and moisten dry hands or dry skin. Highly recommend this product. Our son and daughter-in-law also use it for our grandchild&#x27;s diaper rash, if needed. Works really well for her.</li>
            <li> This stuff is helping so much with the horrible eczema on my hands. I don&#x27;t know if it will heal it though because my eczema is caused by leaky gut and not external factors like weather but it&#x27;s offering me such great relief. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you what a great product this is!  My whole pregnancy I have been looking for a lotion to help with dry skin, and this has been the only product that has truly helped my skin.  I feel ten times better after I put this lotion on!  I am a believer this works and so I will have to try it on my daughter when she gets that first diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Great product - love that it is all natural as well!</li>
            <li> Overpriced and was not helpful for my mother&#x27;s skin irritation.</li>
            <li> My sister sent a jar of this ointment to me as a gift, When I opened the jar the scent was delightful I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it, I love that it is organic and contains herbal ingredients that I am familiar with (no chemical weird additives), I used it on some problematic skin on my lower legs which has not responded to other lotions (even perscriptive creams from the Dermo). After a few applications the hard, crusty lesions softened up and the angry red color of the splotches faded. I am on my second jar of Lia&#x27;s Ointment... I use it as an all over skin treatment, it softens, hydrates, and takes care of the rough texture on my aging forearms and legs. It is an effective skin ointment that works!!!!!</li>
            <li> This ointment is the real deal! You can tell how high quality it is by the feel and smell of it, and it really does a great job of moisturizing rough, dry skin.  A little bit goes a long way! It&#x27;s in a glass jar which means it will stay fresh longer and I this is a bonus for me since I prefer not to use things out of plastic containers if I can help it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product was worth every penny. My daughter had a skin problem for over a few months and we tried several different prescription remedies, anti fungal creams, and tea tree essential oil. Neither options worked and so I went and looked on Amazon for something natural and behold, I came across this ointment and decided to purchase it. I received it on time. (For those who are wondering, her skin problems were 1. When she pooped in her cloth diaper, it really irritated her skin to the point her rash looked like someone scratched her up because her poop had the bacteria ((thrush/yeast)) that continually tore her skin up and prevented it from fully healing. This is called thrush or yeast infection. 2. It only happened when she pooped, her pee didnt do anything. I hope this more detailed info helps other parents out who want an all natural solution for their precious babies buns)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife applied this product on our daughter&#x27;s skin problems and we started having some results within 24 hours and now the skin problem has been resolved and healed literally within 3 days. This is definitely a product worth investing in. I highly recommend it. The awesome part is a little goes a long ways. I just wish there was an option for a bigger container. It also smells great and, for those who cloth diaper, makes their poop and diapers smell good so it overides the poop smell. I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Wow did this help my hands.  I was out of state where the weather was very dry. The skin around my fingernails began to crack and it was very painful.  I applied the cream all around my cuticles and the tips of my fingers. At first I was worried it was too greasy, but it absorbed immediately and left my fingers feeling soft and soothed.  Now I&#x27;ve used it on other rough patches of skin.  It always improves the area it&#x27;s applied to.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream not only for diaper rash. I use this when I have various skin rashes even on my face. Very mild and works within days. I always travel with Lia&#x27;s Ointment.</li>
