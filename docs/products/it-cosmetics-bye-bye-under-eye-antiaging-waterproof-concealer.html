            <li>This concealer was gifted to me quite a while ago</li>
            <li>I love all It Cosmetics products, but this one really does work great for a concealer.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>but it works ok.</li>
            <li>I have used so many brands, from hi-end to drugstore, and NOTHING COMPARES with this.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The coverage at first was good but part the way through the day</li>
            <li>Very happy to have gotten the travel size and try the product, although I know I will buy the full size next time!</li>
            <li>, this is travel size for the full size price!</li>
            <li>while I like this product, it easily cakes in the folds</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look cakey and seems to set &amp;#34;over&amp;#34; fine lines and wrinkles instead of highlighting them.</li>
            <li>Read the fine print.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth, blends well, is a wonderful concealer of black circles and lasts through a 12 hour day.</li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference myself.</li>
            <li>color seems too light</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly - just a teeny</li>
            <li>, I should have bought the light.</li>
            <li>It reflects light and has a dewy look to it.  </li>
            <li>It a very good product, But under my eye&#x27;s is so dark.</li>
            <li>Love this under eye Make up, I first recieved it it my IPSY bag.</li>
            <li>We have tried a lot of different products but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I could have bought a full size for $24</li>
            <li>It is a good sample size only!</li>
            <li>but it provides adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>I love it and so does my young daughter!</li>
            <li>They were not wrong!</li>
            <li>The product works great, a little dewy looking before it sets though.</li>
            <li>so I notice wear is maybe 6 hrs on my jaw line but to be honest every product including $50 foundation does the same.  </li>
            <li>Really covers them up and provides great color coverage to hide dark circles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confused why so many good reviews have for it ?</li>
            <li>good coverage in little amounts</li>
            <li>if more than a tiny &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; is used.</li>
            <li>Color matches my skin tone pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I had the issue with it settling or caking the first couple of times I tried it but</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey</li>
            <li>This definitely works much better for me.</li>
            <li>She certainly doesn&#x27;t need wrinkle protection yet.</li>
            <li>Feeling very ripped off at the moment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would absolutely be my holy grail if it didn&#x27;t crease.  </li>
            <li>realized that I was using too much product.  </li>
            <li>Really advise you follow directions for application</li>
            <li>but it really works well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become my absolute go-to undereye concealer</li>
            <li>it had faded/soaked in like most other concealer products.</li>
            <li>Originally received in my monthly ipsy bag as a sample and ultimately bought it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love this for dark circles.  </li>
            <li>It helps some, but not completely.if you don&#x27;t have dark under your eye&#x27;s, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>this by far works better than any other product Ive tried,I go out of my way to stop at Ulta to buy this,( and i cant stand ULTA)  </li>
            <li>It blends very well to your natural skin.</li>
            <li>For the amount I spent, I thought it was full size.</li>
            <li>Color is a little light</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just now starting to empty, if that gives you an idea of how little you need to use to provide good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to cover those under eye lines.</li>
            <li>I recieved the tiniest tube for too much money, I felt tricked and totally deceived.</li>
            <li>I love the coverage &amp; it lasts so long because a little goes so far.  </li>
            <li>It felt heavy and very light but within two minutes it took the skin color and brightened undereye area, stayed sooo long till i removed it at night.</li>
            <li>I like to use a flat foundation brush which helps it blend really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing and it takes such a tiny amount so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This tube is ridiculously small for about the same price as the full size tube i normally buy.  </li>
            <li>I am a 62 year old  female with moderate &#x27;crinkly&#x27; wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Makes dark circles disappear, but lines that make me look much older suddenly take their place.  </li>

            <li> A tiny, tiny bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> You only need a DAB, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am guilty of not looking at the fine print.  </li>
            <li> Be careful of the size you are ordering, I received a very tiny travel size.</li>
            <li> I spent thousands of dollars over the last 50 years trying different under eye coverage for dark circles.</li>
            <li> The tube is not full, and it does not last all day as it states.</li>
            <li> Only a little dab and bye bye circles.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and with allergies and sinusitis, I have had dark circles nearly all of my life.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> One small tube will last you months .  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the size - a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> I read about this in the Wall Street Journal a few months ago and ordered the sample version because other reviews said a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Yes a small dot goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use it both under eye on my chronic dark circles and on my dark spots/acne spots.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes (must be genetic because I&#x27;ve had them since I was a kid).  </li>
            <li> Like myself, my niece has milk allergies, which result in dark circles under her eyes.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who needs to cover up dark circles or discoloration.</li>
            <li> It is travel size .does not cover severe dark circles well</li>
            <li> So I get to either look sick &amp; tired but smooth, or old &amp; wrinkled but rested.  </li>
            <li> but they are less visible.  </li>
            <li> I have slight redness along my jaw, nose and hair line and</li>
            <li> I also use a little on my lids as a primer for my eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> but i do have to mix it with a lighter shade since i have very dark circles.</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Some products provide coverage for a little while but usually, the coverage is gone after a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product before but never received a tube this small.</li>
            <li> It is as expensive as the big size.</li>
            <li> With this product you can brighten the eye area, cover any dark circles you may have that make you look as though you are always tired.</li>
            <li> It is very small, like a trial size.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend well and really very small tube.</li>
            <li> I am also guilty of not looking at the size, it is so small for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other very expensive brands, including Durablend, which is made for burn victims.</li>
            <li> but if I dont have time, Ill buy it here</li>
            <li> money is hard to come by, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> , I think any bad reviews would be from people using globs of the stuff!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!  A tiny, tiny bit goes a long way!  It covers anything you don&#x27;t want showing.  It&#x27;s greaseless &amp; does not smudge off.  It&#x27;s the greatest stuff!!!</li>
            <li> NEVER RECIEVED THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> The product I received was smaller than the sample in my birch box.</li>
            <li> Incredible product....covers everything you don&#x27;t want to see on your face....and more. Yea!!!!</li>
            <li> Super disappointed. I am also guilty of not looking at the size, it is so small for the price. Double check the product size, this is travel size for the full size price!</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old  female with moderate &#x27;crinkly&#x27; wrinkles under my eyes. while I like this product, it easily cakes in the folds if more than a tiny &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; is used.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and it does cover but i do have to mix it with a lighter shade since i have very dark circles. I got the Medium color and thinking of purchasing the lighter shade for more coverage.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to cover those under eye lines. It blends so nicely with my coverup and gives a nice even appearance .</li>
            <li> color seems too light but it provides adequate coverage.</li>
            <li> Be careful of the size you are ordering, I received a very tiny travel size. For the amount I spent, I thought it was full size. Feeling very ripped off at the moment.</li>
            <li> It was a tiny sample size. I could have bought a full size for $24 I paid $18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My money is hard to come by, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this.  The coverage is out of this world!  Color matches my skin tone pretty well.  Lots of good-for-your-skin ingredients.  Goes on smoothly - just a teeny, tiny amount is needed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would absolutely be my holy grail if it didn&#x27;t crease.  And boy...it DOES crease something fierce!!  Makes dark circles disappear, but lines that make me look much older suddenly take their place.  So I get to either look sick &amp; tired but smooth, or old &amp; wrinkled but rested.  Boo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it over some different primers (I&#x27;m thinking Smashbox), maybe that&#x27;ll help....if so, I&#x27;ll update my review!</li>
            <li> Love love this.  Yes a small dot goes a long way.  My only problem was the price and size.  The tube arrived looking like a sample you get in a store.  Other than that it works beautifully.  I think however for the price I will purchase the larger tube at my store here.</li>
            <li> I spent thousands of dollars over the last 50 years trying different under eye coverage for dark circles. Some products provide coverage for a little while but usually, the coverage is gone after a couple of hours.  Bye Bye Under Eye is awesome.  It takes 10 years off my eyes!</li>
            <li> Once i applied it. It felt heavy and very light but within two minutes it took the skin color and brightened undereye area, stayed sooo long till i removed it at night.</li>
            <li> The tube is not full, and it does not last all day as it states.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my young daughter! She certainly doesn&#x27;t need wrinkle protection yet. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and I bought the neutral medium, I should have bought the light. However I can use this color as a face makeup and it&#x27;s great for that too! It&#x27;s truly amazing and it takes such a tiny amount so a little goes a long way. The only problem with this product is the size and cost. It is a good sample size only! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy again, but not at this price and size. The seller did a great job and listed the size truthfully. I just didn&#x27;t pay attention to it so that&#x27;s my fault not the seller!</li>
            <li> I am guilty of not looking at the fine print.  This tube is ridiculously small for about the same price as the full size tube i normally buy.  love the procduct. will not be buying from this merchant again!</li>
            <li> The coverage at first was good but part the way through the day it had faded/soaked in like most other concealer products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found another product that works this well.  I still have undereye circles but they are less visible.  Lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST concealer you will ever buy .  My daughter and I are both hooked on it . You only need a very tiny amount and it stays all day . One small tube will last you months .  We will never be without this .</li>
            <li> This concealer was gifted to me quite a while ago (I&#x27;m on my third tube) and I cannot let it go.  I love the coverage &amp; it lasts so long because a little goes so far.  I have slight redness along my jaw, nose and hair line and the works great.  I had the issue with it settling or caking the first couple of times I tried it but realized that I was using too much product.  I like to use a flat foundation brush which helps it blend really well.  My job requires me to be on the phone a lot so I notice wear is maybe 6 hrs on my jaw line but to be honest every product including $50 foundation does the same.  No complaints and the product has never caused a break out.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I love all It Cosmetics products, but this one really does work great for a concealer. Very happy to have gotten the travel size and try the product, although I know I will buy the full size next time! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t look cakey and seems to set &amp;#34;over&amp;#34; fine lines and wrinkles instead of highlighting them. Really covers them up and provides great color coverage to hide dark circles. Really advise you follow directions for application otherwise it&#x27;s too heavy. Really happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I like the product but I think it was misleading as the size of it.  Read the fine print.  It is very small, like a trial size. Again, had used at Ulta and found cheaper on Amazon (so I thought..but it was 1/5th the size.</li>
            <li> Its ok. Doesnt spread well but good coverage in little amounts</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Originally received in my monthly ipsy bag as a sample and ultimately bought it here on Amazon.  Pretty pricey but it really works well.  I use it both under eye on my chronic dark circles and on my dark spots/acne spots. I have very pale skin and with allergies and sinusitis, I have had dark circles nearly all of my life.  There is nothing holistically I can do to get rid of them so I require makeup to cover them every day.  I&#x27;ve used other very expensive brands, including Durablend, which is made for burn victims. This definitely works much better for me. It is creamy, but will set and not crease. It reflects light and has a dewy look to it.  It is waterproof.  It blends very well to your natural skin.</li>
            <li> Love byebye undereye!!!  (It Cosmetics)  are awesome. I get them !!!! With this product you can brighten the eye area, cover any dark circles you may have that make you look as though you are always tired. It brings out the pretty... in your eyes, Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this under eye Make up, I first recieved it it my IPSY bag. You only need a DAB, it goes a long way. this by far works better than any other product Ive tried,I go out of my way to stop at Ulta to buy this,( and i cant stand ULTA)  but if I dont have time, Ill buy it here, I think any bad reviews would be from people using globs of the stuff! try it.. ITS THE BEST</li>
            <li> Love this for dark circles.  Only a little dab and bye bye circles.  We have tried a lot of different products but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer!  I have dark circles under my eyes (must be genetic because I&#x27;ve had them since I was a kid).  This is one of the few concealers that really covers them.  A tiny bit goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using the same tiny tube since April (5 months now) and it&#x27;s just now starting to empty, if that gives you an idea of how little you need to use to provide good coverage.  I also use a little on my lids as a primer for my eye shadow.  It&#x27;s great for that purpose as well.</li>
            <li> The product works great, a little dewy looking before it sets though. Color is a little light but it works ok.</li>
            <li> I have used so many brands, from hi-end to drugstore, and NOTHING COMPARES with this.  It&#x27;s become my absolute go-to undereye concealer and I will buy again and again.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the size - a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> Love it.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused why so many good reviews have for it ? It doesn&#x27;t blend well and really very small tube.</li>
            <li> Like myself, my niece has milk allergies, which result in dark circles under her eyes. She was freaking out about it...you know how teenagers are. Anyway, I got her this. I will be getting a larger size once the tube is gone. She loves this stuff. I can see a huge difference myself. I recommend this to anyone who needs to cover up dark circles or discoloration.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before but never received a tube this small. Product is great but not at this price for this size tube. Get it somewhere else!</li>
            <li> It is travel size .does not cover severe dark circles well.......it is a rip off  It is as expensive as the big size. will not buy the  product again</li>
            <li> I read about this in the Wall Street Journal a few months ago and ordered the sample version because other reviews said a little goes a long way. They were not wrong! If you want to try it, order the sample size. I think after you try it you will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my fifties and I I have used a lot of concealers like Dermablend (which is also a nice product) This product goes on smooth, blends well, is a wonderful concealer of black circles and lasts through a 12 hour day.</li>
            <li> It a very good product, But under my eye&#x27;s is so dark. It helps some, but not completely.if you don&#x27;t have dark under your eye&#x27;s, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> I recieved the tiniest tube for too much money, I felt tricked and totally deceived. I like the product but will get it else where</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great coverage  A little bit goes a long way</li>
