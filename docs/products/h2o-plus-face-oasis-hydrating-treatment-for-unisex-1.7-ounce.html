            <li>me, it wasn&#x27;t worth the price and shelf space.</li>

            <li>It took me a long time to buy a full sized bottle, because it is pretty pricey, but I finally decided it is worth the money.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay&#x27;s Regenerist serum for my face for years, but frequently it caused little bumps (whiteheads?)</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and this moisturizer takes away that tight, just-washed feeling without making my face feel greasy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 54 and am outside a lot in wind and other things.</li>
            <li> Oily through the nose, dry around chin.</li>
            <li> It does last quite a long time, because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Because the gel dries in a thin layer above the skin, if it mixes with any sweat or natural oil, it will start balling up.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer that I have found that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, moisturizes extremely well, doesn&#x27;t make me oily, and doesn&#x27;t have my eyes burning mid-day.</li>
            <li> I am contemplating ordering other products within their line.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other H20 products.</li>
            <li> Its a small container but global lasted me about a year.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now, typically purchasing it from Ulta</li>
            <li> The difference in my skin when I don&#x27;t use it for a few days is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when using a very thin sheen and working it into the skin, H2O+ frequently accumulates a little build-up on the exterior of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then splash a little cold water onto my skin and then apply this moisturizer, allowing it to lock that extra moisture from the water into my skin.</li>
            <li> but after about 5 years my skin started weirdly reacting to it.</li>
            <li> It just seems to be on the expensive side for 1.7 ounces..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this moisturizer ramps up my oil production.</li>
            <li> Worst shipping.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this every day; I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay&#x27;s Regenerist serum for my face for years, but frequently it caused little bumps (whiteheads?) on my forehead.  A year ago, a friend who had a similar problem recommended H20 Face Oasis Hydrating Treatment.  After a week or so of using it on my forehead, the problem was solved.  A little goes a long way, and my first jar lasted almost a year.  I&#x27;m now on jar number two and continue to be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now, typically purchasing it from Ulta but I ordered it from Amazon for my most recent purchase. I love this moisturizer and it is worth every penny. After I wash and rinse my face I always pat it sry and then splash a little cold water onto my skin and then apply this moisturizer, allowing it to lock that extra moisture from the water into my skin. I have tried switching away from this stuff (even to another h2o product)  and my skin starts flaking. This is the only moisturizer that I have found that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, moisturizes extremely well, doesn&#x27;t make me oily, and doesn&#x27;t have my eyes burning mid-day.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick, and this product is wonderful!</li>
            <li> something different on smell, which i don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Excellent. We love the hydrating cream in the winter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while and really like it. It&#x27;s lightweight and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! My skin has suffered this winter season. It does not leave my skin oily or sticky. My face feels amazing. The makeup stays intact all day. I do not generally spend a lot on product with the hype these days. I am contemplating ordering other products within their line. The best investment in my akin care regime by far.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. Oily through the nose, dry around chin. I love this moisturizer. It looks and feels more like aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> The product feels refreshing when it&#x27;s first applied, but is not lasting. Because the gel dries in a thin layer above the skin, if it mixes with any sweat or natural oil, it will start balling up. In addition to that, it made my face feel noticeably warm because my skin couldn&#x27;t breathe properly.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it wasn&#x27;t worth the price and shelf space. Just be safe and try a sample before purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used!  I firt tried it when I got a sample size tube as part of a gift set many years ago.  It took me a long time to buy a full sized bottle, because it is pretty pricey, but I finally decided it is worth the money.  It does last quite a long time, because a little goes a long way.  I have very oily skin, and this moisturizer takes away that tight, just-washed feeling without making my face feel greasy or weighed down.  I will probably never use a different product again.</li>
            <li> What more can I say? It works very well. Gel soaks in quickly, keeps skin hydrated all day without any oiliness. Little fragrance, which is excellent.</li>
            <li> I found this product in the bx when I was in japan recently and the had testers. I fell in love with this product even now that I&#x27;m back in New Mexico I will keep using . I have been a Lancôme philosophy gal for years and this stuff works great for my combination skin and I&#x27;m 54 and am outside a lot in wind and other things.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the product is wonderful. I always wait for it to go on sale and get as many as I can get.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE -- BY FAR BEST MOISTURIZER I HAVE EVER USED!</li>
            <li> Love this cream. I have very dry extremely sensitive skin and this worked like a charm. Used to use Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge but after about 5 years my skin started weirdly reacting to it. This works even better. My skin looks bright and moisturized all day and I don&#x27;t get break outs. Can&#x27;t wait to try other H20 products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this moisturizer to anyone. I received it as a gift, and I absolutely love it, it doesn&#x27;t blog my pores or smell like sunscreen like so many other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. Its a small container but global lasted me about a year. I never felt like I had to use a lot and my face always felt hydrated. It just seems to be on the expensive side for 1.7 ounces..</li>
            <li> I have been using very moist.Capacity is much, can be used for a long time.Really like this kind of skin care products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, not heavy or greasy, no odor, goes on smoothly and feels great. Love this, would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> always have loved this product...the ONLY one I will use as a moisturizer in the heat of Arizona!</li>
            <li> I have oily, fair, sensitive skin that can&#x27;t take alot of products without breaking out. Unfortunately this moisturizer ramps up my oil production. I would recommend it for normal skin and dry skin but not for anyone prone to breakouts. My skin is not abnormally sensitive I don&#x27;t break out if I wear mineral makeup or use dove lotions but something about this moisturizer increasing my oil production so that an hour after i put on just a dab of this moisturizer I have a greasy sheen on my face that I have to wash off.</li>
            <li> Worst shipping. 2 weeks later. The product is not too good.</li>
            <li> This product is good, and not as pricey as others I&#x27;ve used.  I do put a daily moisturizer on over this.</li>
            <li> H2O+ face oasis is really amazing stuff.  I have been using it for 4+ years based on the recommendation of a fashionable friend.  The difference in my skin when I don&#x27;t use it for a few days is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not five stars?  It&#x27;s tendency to build up.  Even when using a very thin sheen and working it into the skin, H2O+ frequently accumulates a little build-up on the exterior of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, it&#x27;s an incredibly good deal.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive creams such as shiseido and even la prarie (which did nothing for me) yet I prefer Face Oasis.</li>
