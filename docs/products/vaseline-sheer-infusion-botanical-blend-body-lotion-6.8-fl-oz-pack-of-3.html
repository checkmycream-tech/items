            <li>it smells really good too&#x3D;]</li>
            <li>This is  not the first time i have loved a product that has been discontinued!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best body lotion I have found.  </li>
            <li>And even though it was &amp;#34;Vaseline&amp;#34; it absorbed very nicely into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and absorbs without any greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It had a very light scent.  </li>
            <li>Often in that case, I slather with lotion and it burns and itches and stings but eventually feels better.  </li>
            <li>I get a lot of complements, my daughter also now loves this lotion too, I can only find it now online and amazon and sellers have the best prices anywhere</li>
            <li>and i feel the difference with just one week of usage, will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I use this on my face and love the way it keeps my dry skin hydrated - great product!!</li>
            <li>Probably full of bacteria!</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent which does not fade</li>
            <li>decent product, good price.</li>
            <li>Since I had the free sample, I decided to use it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and no longer hurts from the roughness and cracking.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion I&#x27;ve ever owned, my skin feels great and never sticky like some other brands.</li>
            <li>The formulation must have changed from the time I got the free sample a year or two ago,  which I loved, and when I actually bought the product now which I do not care for.  </li>
            <li>I really suggest this lotion if you have extreme dry skin and need a quick fix, this works, and I am very happy, my skin is happy too.</li>
            <li>so much so, I am going to buy more and keep this in my pantry.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quick and with not problems.</li>
            <li>(Edited: First review was 4 stars based on the free sample)</li>
            <li>I honestly liked it more than any other body/hand lotion I had tried.   </li>
            <li>Their price was very reasonable and delivery was fast!!</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this stuff and loved it so much I bought what is apparently some of the last of it.  </li>
            <li>The free sample  formulation was clear.  </li>
            <li>I actually got this lotion as a free sample with another product and didn&#x27;t think anything of it.  </li>
            <li>No burning, itching or stinging and the next morning, my hands were still comfortable.  </li>
            <li>If they still have this available when I run out, I would definitely purchase again!!!</li>
            <li>it really moisturizes your skin &amp; leaves</li>
            <li>Now i am stuck with a product that is different from the free sample.  </li>
            <li>My sister in law works in health care and her hands would crack and bleed from washing them so much.  </li>
            <li>I have been using other product, so far this probably the one I like the most.</li>
            <li>This is better than any other products they sell out there!!</li>
            <li>Soft and silky...love it!</li>
            <li>Instead it puts a &amp;#34;layer&amp;#34; of lotion on me which I can actually feel and it does not go away with the first shower.  </li>
            <li>Extremely old product.</li>
            <li>I am totally dry skin relieved and very moisturized,</li>
            <li>The mild scent is pleasing and does not irritate my sinuses like some heavy scent do.</li>

            <li> I actually got this lotion as a free sample with another product and didn&#x27;t think anything of it.  This winter, it was so cold and dry that my hands were cracked and bleeding.  Often in that case, I slather with lotion and it burns and itches and stings but eventually feels better.  Since I had the free sample, I decided to use it.  IT WAS WONDERFUL!  No burning, itching or stinging and the next morning, my hands were still comfortable.  I looked in stores for it everywhere, but couldn&#x27;t find it.  Found it online and have loved it since!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, just what I thought it would be.  My skin is softer than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> Soft and silky...love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion I&#x27;ve ever owned, my skin feels great and never sticky like some other brands. I get a lot of complements, my daughter also now loves this lotion too, I can only find it now online and amazon and sellers have the best prices anywhere</li>
            <li> It was delivered quick and with not problems.</li>
            <li> This product is great. You put it on and it stays with you for hours, without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have finally found an all-over lotion that does not make my skin feel oily. This is it! The mild scent is pleasing and does not irritate my sinuses like some heavy scent do.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! Vaseline discontinued it, and I don&#x27;t know why!! This is better than any other products they sell out there!! It moisturizes perfectly, smells great, and lasts through hand washes,etc. It makes my skin silky smooth. I purchased from DMS Melange on Amazon.com. Their price was very reasonable and delivery was fast!! If they still have this available when I run out, I would definitely purchase again!!! Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> i love this product! my friend gave me her sample one day when i was in need of lotion &amp; after that, i was hooked! i kept looking everywhere for it until i was told that it was discontinued, which led me to buying it from amazon. it really moisturizes your skin &amp; leaves it feeling silky. it smells really good too&#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion!  My skin is smooth and no longer hurts from the roughness and cracking.</li>
            <li> Extremely old product. Had to ditch after finding out it was manufactured  in Jan. 2005!!! Probably full of bacteria!</li>
            <li> I just bought this a week or so ago as I have had the worst dry skin ever this season, nothing seemed to work. That is, until I lucked up on this lotion and gave it a try, woweeee, did this work, you betcha, it did. I am totally dry skin relieved and very moisturized, so much so, I am going to buy more and keep this in my pantry. I really suggest this lotion if you have extreme dry skin and need a quick fix, this works, and I am very happy, my skin is happy too. Also the price Amazon and the sellers charge for this cannot be beat,this is a best buy, have at it!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body lotion I have found.  It is very light and absorbs without any greasy feeling.  Use it every day.</li>
            <li> (Edited: First review was 4 stars based on the free sample) I got a free sample of this stuff and loved it so much I bought what is apparently some of the last of it.  Ugh.  This is  not the first time i have loved a product that has been discontinued!  Smells good without being *smelly.*  Feels thick enough not to be greasy yet absorbs well.  It will get me thru the summer and then will need to find another product...  Edit review:  I am lowering to 2 stars.  The formulation must have changed from the time I got the free sample a year or two ago,  which I loved, and when I actually bought the product now which I do not care for.  The free sample  formulation was clear.  It had a very light scent.  And even though it was &amp;#34;Vaseline&amp;#34; it absorbed very nicely into the skin.  I honestly liked it more than any other body/hand lotion I had tried.   The product I bought pictured here is a white- colored lotion.  It has a strong scent which does not fade and therefore I cannot wear it to  yoga where scented lotions are not permitted. Not everyone who has smelled it on me likes the scent.  Worst of all, it does not absorb in to the skin.  Instead it puts a &amp;#34;layer&amp;#34; of lotion on me which I can actually feel and it does not go away with the first shower.  Yecchh.    l bought a package of 3 of these because from the reviews it looked like it was being discontinued. Now i am stuck with a product that is different from the free sample.  No wonder it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe they sell this in retail stores anymore in the US.  I use this on my face and love the way it keeps my dry skin hydrated - great product!!</li>
            <li> After spending a fortune on all kinds of lotions I found this this to be the best  lotion ever.  Don&#x27;t know why this was discontinued.  I now have 6 bottles of the lotion, which should last me awhile. Hope tne company will bring this product back.</li>
            <li> decent product, good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using other product, so far this probably the one I like the most. It keeps my skin moist all the time.</li>
            <li> The best lotion ever!</li>
            <li> my skin was really really dry and i had used this product years ago and i feel the difference with just one week of usage, will be ordering more</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion we have ever used.  My sister in law works in health care and her hands would crack and bleed from washing them so much.  She tried everything.  We got her this after I used it on my elbows that NOTHING worked on till this lotion.  With in a couple of days her hands were healed!!  I can not find it in stores anymore!!  Thankful to find it here.</li>
