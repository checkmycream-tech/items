            <li>the scent is amazing</li>
            <li>The body wash is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This smells almost floral-y on me, based on my own body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Best of all, no harsh chemicals!!!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and leaves slub soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It works wonders and I also love the lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent was a bit overwhelming</li>
            <li>But, I LOVE the bar</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite body wash ever.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this-</li>
            <li>I bought this just because I love the matching body lotion.</li>
            <li>but I tried it because of the smell more than anything.</li>
            <li>Safe for the environment.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>I have ordered two more bottles to keep stocked because I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these products.</li>
            <li>I have used A LOT of body washes at various price points, as well as levels of esoteric alignment over the years, and I have to say that I&#x27;m most impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and also use the body lotion.</li>
            <li>At the rate of product usage, I would be amazed if this 13 oz bottle lasts me for more than 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, even if you want to stay organic, there are better choices with more prominent scents and better product consumption rates.</li>
            <li>The Indian Hemp and Haitian Vetiver fragrance in the Nubian Heritage brand are my favorite scents of all the products I have purchased from Nubian.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon after my Whole Foods stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>I love the product and will be ordering again .</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance without being too strong, too fruity, too sweet.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin feeling supple and alive.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural body wash.  </li>
            <li>Rich, creamy lather, and a lovely light scent.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Nubian Heritage bar soaps-</li>
            <li>I purchased the Hemp and Vetiver because the scent I wanted wasn&#x27;t available from any seller.</li>
            <li>The smell lingers for hours after your shower and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>It;s quite easy to get clean with unscented $8 Aveeno Body Wash, so</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves you smelling good for a few hours after showering.</li>
            <li>All its natural ingredients does good to the skin.</li>
            <li>Let me preface my remarks by saying I&#x27;m a male, and I like my body wash to have a strong pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and unisex, the formula is highly concentrated and moisturizing, and it&#x27;s far better for the plant than many other body care products out there.  </li>
            <li>Just a small dab is more than enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product and quality.</li>
            <li>It suds up nicely and leaves the skin smoothe and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the beauty bar, and though not cheap, it does indeed give the user a noticeable vetiver smell when applied, which is always a good thing when buying a vetiver named product!</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild folliculitis and this kept things in check.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the really mild non-especially vetiverish scent</li>
            <li>Highly recommended I am glad Amazon carries this item.</li>
            <li>The hemp / vetiver combo smells pleasant in a mild sort of way, but this is not what I expected at the price point and given the product name.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s actually economical.</li>
            <li>Lather may or may not be to your liking, but having to reload the loofah halfway through your shower is no one&#x27;s idea of fun.</li>
            <li>Was sent right out .</li>
            <li>when I pay more than that amount for a product with the same purpose, I want a bit of olfactory sparkle</li>
            <li>I love vetiver but even with a generous dollop on the loofah, I get only the faintest scent of that fragrance here.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite semi-organic products are from Every Man Jack.</li>
            <li>Their cedar and sandalwood (two separate types there) body wash have great smells and give adequate lather and cleaning duration with roughly half the product needed to get similar effects from NH IH&amp;V wash.</li>
            <li>I bought a few bottles of this body wash and it&#x27;s pretty much amazing.</li>
            <li>It is quite moisturizing and gentle - it&#x27;s just fine on my dry skin - and the scent works well for both men and women without being in the fruity or &#x27;fresh&#x27; category.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I discovered Nubian Indian Hemp and Haitian Vetiver at Whole Foods about 2 years ago and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>, NH IH&amp;V body wash also needs a lot of soap to generate any lather, and even needs a lot just to get through a whole body wash.</li>
            <li>Both of these product lines are much cheaper than Nubian</li>
            <li>Seriously, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>I have tried the beauty bar, and though not cheap, it does indeed give the user a noticeable vetiver smell when applied, which is always a good thing when buying a vetiver named product!an Heritage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For vetiver lovers who want that scent in their bath ritual, Provence Sante makes a good vetiver beauty bar soap, and also a rather expensive vetiver body wash.</li>
            <li>particularly this scent; Indian Hemp and Haitian Vetiver.</li>
            <li>The only downside to Nubian body wash is that not all of the ingredients are fair trade certified organic, but quite a few are.</li>
            <li>Whether you are male or female you will enjoy this!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Skin is left soft, not &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; and does indeed feel &#x27;healed&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to the Neutrogena Rainbath I&#x27;ve tolerated for years that left me dry and itchy (even though less dry and itchy than most, it was far from ideal).</li>
            <li>I sometimes get flaky dry spots on my arms and since using this soap they are pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>The local Whole Foods no longer carries this particular Nubian product</li>
            <li>This help to make my skin soft</li>
            <li>, Provence Sante makes a good vetiver beauty bar soap, and also a rather expensive vetiver body wash.</li>
            <li>The shea butter/hemp lotion is super thick and very healing.</li>
            <li>Leaves no soap scum in the shower like the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>These products are natural and luxurious at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Plus, you know you&#x27;re not putting something on your skin that is a harsh, damaging chemical that will be absorbed in your bloodstream.  </li>
            <li>As many other reviewers have mentioned, a little does go a long way with this product.</li>
            <li>It does not dry the skin at all.</li>
            <li>I was drawn to the scent and delightfully surprised with its rich, foamy lather, even in very hard water.  </li>
            <li>Recently I purchased some of the lavender and wildflower body wash, so I can say by comparison that this is very moisturizing (I like the other too, but it is just a different body wash).</li>
            <li>which I have not tried due to its high cost.</li>
            <li>which I have not tried due to its high cost.</li>
            <li>all too many organic soaps, this example ends up being a bit too subtle and bland in scent and power to justify its price point.</li>

            <li> This body wash is the only soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry, the oils inside leave the skin moisturized and radiant.</li>
            <li> I live in a city that has extremely hard water</li>
            <li> It was weak and did not lather up much at all.  </li>
            <li> The upside is that it has a very lasting lather, a little bit goes a really long way, so the 13 ounce bottle lasts a lot longer than 13 ounces of Bronners or any other competing brand that I&#x27;ve tried for that matter.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely finicky combination skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want use other brands of body wash since using this.  </li>
            <li> A little dollop on a poof will literally wash you from head to toe.  </li>
            <li> so I was taken aback by the suds the small amount created.  </li>

            <li> This is an excellent, moisturizing body wash. Recently I purchased some of the lavender and wildflower body wash, so I can say by comparison that this is very moisturizing (I like the other too, but it is just a different body wash).</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hemp and Vetiver because the scent I wanted wasn&#x27;t available from any seller. I am not at all sorry that I chose this. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling supple and alive.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it on my kids for the balancing effect of vetiver.</li>
            <li> I bought a few bottles of this body wash and it&#x27;s pretty much amazing. My sister keeps stealing it because she also loves it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM! It works wonders and I also love the lotion. Great for the skin. Highly recommended I am glad Amazon carries this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Nubian Heritage soaps and body washes and this one has become one of my faves. It is quite moisturizing and gentle - it&#x27;s just fine on my dry skin - and the scent works well for both men and women without being in the fruity or &#x27;fresh&#x27; category. Love it!</li>
            <li> In addition to the lotion, I purchase this body wash.  I kid you not, I used about a teaspoon amount and the amount of suds was just out of this world.  I live in a city that has extremely hard water so I was taken aback by the suds the small amount created.  The scent was a bit overwhelming but eventually I got used to it and also learned not to layer scents.  I recommend this line, but choose the scents accordingly.  This smells almost floral-y on me, based on my own body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Nubian Heritage bar soaps- particularly this scent; Indian Hemp and Haitian Vetiver. So I figured I would try the body wash- I was not that impressed. It was weak and did not lather up much at all.  But, I LOVE the bar soap- so went back to using that.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite body wash ever. I have arthritis, and I always look for anything to relieve the stress. I feel a restful release of tension across my body when I wash with this.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  Smells great and works great!  Nice fragrance without being too strong, too fruity, too sweet.  For me, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Scent is not quite as good as the soap bars but it is a good body moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this- the scent is amazing</li>
            <li> These products are natural and luxurious at the same time.  I suffer from mild folliculitis and this kept things in check.</li>
            <li> This help to make my skin soft and I loved the way it smelled.</li>
            <li> very good smell.  Easier to use than the bar soap.  I recommend it for anyone who needs to use a moisturizing soap that produces good sudsy foam with a great finish.</li>
            <li> I bought this just because I love the matching body lotion. The shea butter/hemp lotion is super thick and very healing. The body wash seems a bit too expensive but I tried it because of the smell more than anything. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother in the future but do check out this company&#x27;s lotion selections.</li>
            <li> This is on my spine every night, sleep like a baby.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good for your skin. Safe for the environment.  Leaves no soap scum in the shower like the cheap stuff. Try them all!</li>
            <li> Deliciously scented and safe, non-irritating ingredients clean your skin without stripping moisture. Lovely!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent seller!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have been using Dr Bronners for a while now and I decided to try a less expensive alternative. The only downside to Nubian body wash is that not all of the ingredients are fair trade certified organic, but quite a few are. The upside is that it has a very lasting lather, a little bit goes a really long way, so the 13 ounce bottle lasts a lot longer than 13 ounces of Bronners or any other competing brand that I&#x27;ve tried for that matter. Another benefit would be the scent. It smells good and leaves you smelling good for a few hours after showering. That&#x27;s always a plus. It also doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry, the oils inside leave the skin moisturized and radiant. It&#x27;s good stuff. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this brand. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great natural body wash.  It suds up nicely and leaves the skin smoothe and soft.  Plus, you know you&#x27;re not putting something on your skin that is a harsh, damaging chemical that will be absorbed in your bloodstream.  The scent is not overwhelming to me at all but it is very different to the norm.  I could see someone else feeling differently as everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is not the same.  One thing though....I guess because the neem is so moisturizing, if you use a cotton rag to shower with, it will give the rag a slippery, almost slimy feel after a while because the fibers of the rag will just soak up all that moisture.  I would recommend using the wash with a shower sponge or luffa or something.</li>
            <li> I have extremely finicky combination skin. My body *loves* this soap. A little goes a long way. Rich, creamy lather, and a lovely light scent. I&#x27;ll never go back to the Neutrogena Rainbath I&#x27;ve tolerated for years that left me dry and itchy (even though less dry and itchy than most, it was far from ideal). This stuff is heaven. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Everything was great about the order! No problems at all!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling body wash. Whether you are male or female you will enjoy this! The smell lingers for hours after your shower and leaves skin feeling smooth. Best of all, no harsh chemicals!!! Makes a great gift was well.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two more bottles to keep stocked because I don&#x27;t want to run out. I absolutely love these products.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit expensive but its awesomeness demands it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. GREAT smell! Its like aromatherapy for your shower. The smell also stays on you well after your shower/bath is over.&lt;br /&gt;2. HEALING! All its natural ingredients does good to the skin. I sometimes get flaky dry spots on my arms and since using this soap they are pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;3. BUBBLES! As many other reviewers have mentioned, a little does go a long way with this product. Just a small dab is more than enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product and quality. Give it a try</li>
            <li> I have used A LOT of body washes at various price points, as well as levels of esoteric alignment over the years, and I have to say that I&#x27;m most impressed with this product.  The scent is wonderful and unisex, the formula is highly concentrated and moisturizing, and it&#x27;s far better for the plant than many other body care products out there.  I was drawn to the scent and delightfully surprised with its rich, foamy lather, even in very hard water.  Skin is left soft, not &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; and does indeed feel &#x27;healed&#x27;.  I don&#x27;t want use other brands of body wash since using this.  Seriously, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I discovered Nubian Indian Hemp and Haitian Vetiver at Whole Foods about 2 years ago and have been using it ever since. I love the smell of it and also use the body lotion. My skin feels so good! People often ask me what fragrance I am wearing. The local Whole Foods no longer carries this particular Nubian product so I am grateful to find it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this stuff! For cleaning and retaining moisture in the skin a little goes a long way so it&#x27;s actually economical.</li>
            <li> Body wash was great. Smells wonderful and leaves slub soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Let me preface my remarks by saying I&#x27;m a male, and I like my body wash to have a strong pleasant scent to it. To me, the smell is 75% of the value of the product. It;s quite easy to get clean with unscented $8 Aveeno Body Wash, so when I pay more than that amount for a product with the same purpose, I want a bit of olfactory sparkle added!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all too many organic soaps, this example ends up being a bit too subtle and bland in scent and power to justify its price point. I love vetiver but even with a generous dollop on the loofah, I get only the faintest scent of that fragrance here. The hemp / vetiver combo smells pleasant in a mild sort of way, but this is not what I expected at the price point and given the product name. If I wanted \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;, I&#x27;d buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the really mild non-especially vetiverish scent, NH IH&amp;V body wash also needs a lot of soap to generate any lather, and even needs a lot just to get through a whole body wash. Lather may or may not be to your liking, but having to reload the loofah halfway through your shower is no one&#x27;s idea of fun. At the rate of product usage, I would be amazed if this 13 oz bottle lasts me for more than 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, even if you want to stay organic, there are better choices with more prominent scents and better product consumption rates. EOs Cedar &amp; Mint for Men works well enough and can even be used as a shampoo and shave cream for the undemanding. My personal favorite semi-organic products are from Every Man Jack. Their cedar and sandalwood (two separate types there) body wash have great smells and give adequate lather and cleaning duration with roughly half the product needed to get similar effects from NH IH&amp;V wash. (I call Every Man Jack semi-organic as I haven&#x27;t bothered to assess all the ingredients on their label, but they have no parabens or SLS derivatives, so they pass my personal screening standard.) Both of these product lines are much cheaper than Nubian Heritage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For vetiver lovers who want that scent in their bath ritual, Provence Sante makes a good vetiver beauty bar soap, and also a rather expensive vetiver body wash. which I have not tried due to its high cost. I have tried the beauty bar, and though not cheap, it does indeed give the user a noticeable vetiver smell when applied, which is always a good thing when buying a vetiver named product!an Heritage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For vetiver lovers who want that scent in their bath ritual, Provence Sante makes a good vetiver beauty bar soap, and also a rather expensive vetiver body wash. which I have not tried due to its high cost.

            <li> The Indian Hemp and Haitian Vetiver fragrance in the Nubian Heritage brand are my favorite scents of all the products I have purchased from Nubian.  The body wash is amazing.  A little goes a long way.  A little dollop on a poof will literally wash you from head to toe.  It does not dry the skin at all.</li>
            <li> This body wash is the only soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin. I was happy to find it on Amazon after my Whole Foods stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> Was sent right out . I love the product and will be ordering again . Thank you Cara</li>
            <li> Very pleasant showering experience!</li>
