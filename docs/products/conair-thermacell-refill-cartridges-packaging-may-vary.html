            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying all the hard-to-find stuff, like these cartridges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast reasonable and arrives in a day or two.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s one more thing that needs to be squeezed into a quart size bag with other liquids.  </li>
            <li>I have an older model butane curling iron and couldn&#x27;t find replacement cartridges anywhere.  </li>
            <li>cost of shipping is more than the cost of the product but for the last ten years this has been my favourite appliance and I won&#x27;t give it up without a fight.</li>
            <li>&amp; have not had any problems at all, would highly recommend them</li>

            <li>I have an old Conair curling iron that uses these refill cartridges.  </li>
            <li>My container was low; therefore, I put an extra cartridge in my makeup bag and was ready for a possible problem.  </li>
            <li>The cost was equal to or less than what I had paid when I could find them locally, especially when you consider I bundled them with several other items and got free shipping, and a whole lot easier than the hunt I&#x27;ve been on for weeks.</li>

            <li> I have an older model butane curling iron and couldn&#x27;t find replacement cartridges anywhere.  Here they were at Amazon for a reasonable price and free shipping.  They fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> best deal any where now I have enough of these to last me for a while when I need more I will be back.</li>
            <li> Enough to last my lifetime. New box in excellent condition.  What can you say about a proven utilitarian product like this.  It&#x27;s not something I would say &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; about, though.</li>
            <li> Love It, I&#x27;ve been using these ThermaCell Cartridges for about 2 years now and never had any problems.  I use my ThermaCell Curling Iron daily and I get about 2 months of usage out of each cartridge!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about being able to use the Thermacell refills for my curling iron. One, it&#x27;s really fast, Two, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it also takes all the struggle, out of curl your hair. You simply screw it into the iron, and in seconds, it&#x27;s there for you. I don&#x27;t primp, and play with my hair, I want it curled, and be done with it, and this refill cartridge helps me do just that. I would Never use anything else, and if I had to use the electric model, I would quit using anything else at all. It&#x27;s really that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many, many years it has never let me down, try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are not labelled with ounces, which can pose an issue when flying if a TSA agent questions it.  Plus it&#x27;s one more thing that needs to be squeezed into a quart size bag with other liquids.  NOTE:  TSA guidelines allow for 1 cartridge per person, but the ultimate authority lies with the airport screener, who can seize it if he/she feels like it.  I packed my regular corded curling iron just in case, but ultimately had no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this item. This cartridge does last a lot of uses. It gets pretty hot pretty quick. It really doesn&#x27;t have an objectional scent as it heats up. It is very easy to use. All you do is uncap the top of the cartridge and push or click the cartridge onto the curling iron, but please make sure that the curling iron is off first and that is it. I have been using this product for years and it is very useful when you need a quick fix. It is a bit pricey for my taste, but it is still a most for any working woman or mother.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find this item in stores and was happy to finally find it online and at a reasonable price.  Have been using these refills for approximately 15 years.</li>
            <li> Use  them very often very happy with conair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Conair Refill Cartridges for quite sometime and wouldn&#x27;t do without them.  Recently returned from a trip in which I carried my curling iron that uses this product.  My container was low; therefore, I put an extra cartridge in my makeup bag and was ready for a possible problem.  So handy and the last time I ordered, I purchased three packages of two each.  They are reasonably priced and great to have on hand for a quick hair fix.</li>
            <li> As described -perfect</li>
            <li> I bought my cordless curling iron YEARS ago so was pleasantly surprised to be able to buy these on amazon and they fit - I have too many now though...  didn&#x27;t read the packaging correctly, so didn&#x27;t need to order 2 but will have it when I need it!</li>
            <li> I have a curling iron that I use these for. I&#x27;ve had it for about 20 years but I still love the darn thing and won&#x27;t get rid of it until it dies. They used to carry these in drug stores but I haven&#x27;t seen them in years, so thank goodness and Amazon they&#x27;re still available on the &#x27;net.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find these in the stores.  After finally purchasing the cordless curling iron, I want to make sure I got some cartridges. So glad I was able to find them here.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue these!!  :-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my travel curler and I cannot buy replacement cartridges in Australia&lt;br /&gt;I have to do a lot of fiddling around to have them shipped to me&lt;br /&gt;The cost of shipping is more than the cost of the product but for the last ten years this has been my favourite appliance and I won&#x27;t give it up without a fight.</li>
            <li> Best thing to use with my hair curler when I travel....lasts a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> Using it daily and love it for the speedy heat up and convenence</li>
            <li> these are so hard to find..but i love it that i have no problem now.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these anywhere so we love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad these cartridges are still on the market. I have a soldering iron that requires these cartridges. They fit and work exactly as they should.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> These cartridges were bought for my Conair travel curling iron.  The culler uses these butane cartridges to heat the culling iron. Great for camping.</li>
            <li> I love my Thermacell curling iron. I use it when traveling, and it&#x27;s perfect for taking with me when we&#x27;ve been on the boat, and then stopping on the way home for dinner. The perfect cure for \\&quot;boat hair\\&quot;. I was panicked when I couldn&#x27;t find replacement cartridges, which have become impossible to find in any store. I was thrilled when I discovered Amazon has the cartridges available. They last a long time, but I went ahead and ordered four, in two twin packs. The cost was equal to or less than what I had paid when I could find them locally, especially when you consider I bundled them with several other items and got free shipping, and a whole lot easier than the hunt I&#x27;ve been on for weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used TermaCell by Conair refill cartridges for 30 years. They go with me everywhere I go. Wouldn&#x27;t be with out it and I have never had a problem of any kind.</li>
            <li> WORKS FINE WITH CURLING IRONS</li>
            <li> would be nice but my travel iron broke</li>
            <li> These work in the ThermaCell mosquito repellant products and are the exact same dimensions and liquid quantity as the mosquito cartridges.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in good order and as described.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great!  So happy that these are still being sold as they are not available in most if not all stores.</li>
            <li> Have to have these, as I use my curling iron just a few minutes every day. They work fine and I don&#x27;t have to wind a cord.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT AS ADVERTISED.  ARRIVED ON TIME.  LOVE THE CONVENIENCE OF CORDLESS PRODUCTS.  PRICE GOOD FOR TWO.  SHIPPED QUICKLY. NO PROBLEMS</li>
            <li> I had a really old Conair curling iron with really old Conair cartridges that were dried out.  I was surprised to find I could still buy some and they fit and worked.  They worked instantly.  Happy me.  Thank you Conair.</li>
            <li> I have two portable conair&#x27;s, a curling iron and a straightening iron, couldn&#x27;t work either without the replacement butane gas.</li>
            <li> I have been using Butaine curling irons for over 20 years. They are great to travel with, and heat up quickly and hot! The cartidges Arrived ahead of schedule and in great packing. Will reorder from here in the future.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and the one I used works  without a problem- what else can one say.. They are good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using thermal cell curling irons for years. But recently it has become next to impossible to find the replacement cells. Amazon was a life saver to me by having these available to buy. They are inexpensive &amp; light weight so shipping is fairly cheap. I will buy them from Amazon again when these run out.</li>
            <li> They work Great!! use it for my curling iron. &amp; have not had any problems at all, would highly recommend them</li>
            <li> These butane cartridges are great for travel where electric power is spotty, like on a boat. I use them in my curling iron. They&#x27;ve become difficult to find in stores. In fact, the only place I can find them is on Amazon. Thanks for carrying all the hard-to-find stuff, like these cartridges.</li>
            <li> Love this appliance and the refills make it easy to transport.  The iron has a spiked covering so I don&#x27;t burn myself and the gas keep me from having to deal with cords.</li>
            <li> I love these refill cartridges!! It&#x27;s always nice to have extras in my car so that I can fix my hair in a pinch after a workout when I need to go somewhere..</li>
            <li> This product was what I ordered, received, and was received, Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was what I needed for the hair curler that I have!!!!</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly in my old Conair curler. I&#x27;ve had it for quite some years and was unable to find refills in stores.</li>
            <li> Love my travel curling iron that uses these cartridges and these were  a good deal</li>
            <li> Bought this so I can have a refill for my brush and I love my heated brush</li>
            <li> great product for curling iron travel this is needed to operate the curling iron that heats up quickly and is light for packing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Revlon travel curling iron.  I was unable to find it in any drug or retail store which ws disappointing and I thought that was the end of it....but, Amazon  came to the rescue!.  I&#x27;m sure it will perform well on any appliance that requires this size butane cartridge.  I&#x27;m about to reorder now!</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I bought extras so I didn&#x27;t run out cause around me these are hard to find. Still on the first one and have used it several time!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I bought my Conair Cordless Curling Iron years ago, but then the stores stopped selling the thermacell cartridges and eventually the curling iron itself.  I was happy to be able to find the thermacell cartridges on Amazon.  The curling iron comes in very handy when we lose power during a storm.  The packaging was great and the delivery time excellent.</li>
            <li> I needed them for the cordless curling iron which I love</li>
            <li> I have an old Conair curling iron that uses these refill cartridges.  The stores in my area no longer carry the product so I order from Amazon.  It&#x27;s fast reasonable and arrives in a day or two.  I love the convenience of this product and the convenience of ordering on line.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my Conair curling iron while on the canals in Scotland--no electricity, as we know it, aboard narrowboats on the canals in England, Wales and Scotland--this is the clear answer to keeping the head of hair at its best appearance.</li>
            <li> I bought on line to use in my RV when I am dry camping...the only way you can curl your hair.</li>
