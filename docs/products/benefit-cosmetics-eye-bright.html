    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was initially very happy with this pencil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this has very good staying power even with a primer.</li>
            <li>Great product,</li>
            <li>&quot; happy with \\&quot;EYECON\\&quot; by Benefit.  </li>
            <li>In spite of the price, it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost tempted to take away one star from this great product because of the price.</li>
            <li>This product makes your eyes look naturally beautiful and bright.</li>
            <li>I think it would be brilliant if it came in a more liquid form!</li>
            <li>I am not planning to spend my bucks on eye bright until I win the lottery.</li>
            <li>After seeing Eye Bright at Sephora</li>
            <li>Eye bright does just that.</li>
            <li>, however, my eye bright has lasted a year</li>
            <li>I told myself if i come across the Benefit Eye Bright product, then I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>People notice a difference when I wear Eye Bright, but can&#x27;t tell what the difference is.  </li>
            <li>Since I am plagued by allergies and sinus problems, using Eye Bright is sort of like fixing that dullness in Photoshop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, ladies, loosen up the purse strings and treat yourself to Eye Bright, because it will, well... make your eyes look</li>
            <li>This concealer also has good staying power - I haven&#x27;t had to do any touch-ups during the day.</li>
            <li>I have \\&quot;very\\&quot; fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I love my Eye Bright pencil!  </li>
            <li>I use moisturizer under it and it was very smooth and looked great.      </li>
            <li>Another consumer suggested trying Eye Bright along with Eyecon &amp; the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>just nice and bright look it gives under my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I love this product!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Eye Bright is really great for those of us who want a no-fuss, quick eye makeup routine.</li>
            <li>bright seems to be a bit more creamy in texture.</li>
            <li>However, Benefit Cosmetics Eye Bright is an amazing cosmetic that does just what the name indicates -- it enhances the appearance of your eyes, making them seem brighter, more youthful and well-rested.</li>
            <li>Honestly...</li>
            <li>I dont like to wear foundation or anything on my face, I been blessed with nice skin and just dont like to wear it.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>I found this absolutely wonderful product while searching for a decent eye cream.  </li>
            <li>She also tried the light bright</li>
            <li>Benefit has erased years off my eyes and I&#x27;m thrilled :)</li>
            <li>I used it with Bare Minerals foundation and it lasted all day, and did an excellent job of covering the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It has a nice creamy blendable texture, and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It so simple and easy to apply, I am glad I decided to give this a try! :D</li>
            <li>It glides on under the eyes and on the inside corner of the eyes to make you look rested and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Like most Benefit products, this makeup isn&#x27;t too \\&quot;makeup\\&quot;-y.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>All you need is a light stroke on each eye corner and then blend with your finger and viola!</li>
            <li>; however it is more of a matte effect.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product and at the price</li>
            <li>I like the product but am undecided if I&#x27;ll purchase more considering the price.</li>
            <li>but it lasts \\&quot;all day\\&quot; and is so light that you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there!  </li>
            <li>I know some folks use this more as a concealer.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments on my eyes</li>
            <li>I also own the Beneift high brow pencil, which is nice too</li>
            <li>However, some of their products are really overpriced like Eye Bright.</li>
            <li>I purchased the eye bright, and in the beginning, it worked very well at hiding some of the darkness under the eyes.</li>
            <li>This eye pencil has the right color, right texture, gives you a healthy look and bright eye.</li>
            <li>Oh my wow - this pencil is great to highlight your eyes on your not so fabulous mornings.</li>
            <li>I just recently bought the Eye Bright and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>That is, when you wear Eye Bright, you most likely won&#x27;t receive compliments on your eye makeup, but rather on how well-rested you look.     </li>
            <li>Since then I have been a huge fan of Benefit cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>When it came time to resharpen the pencil after a couple of applications I used the appropriate Benefit sharpener; however, the eye bright stick pencil started to splinter and only sharpen on one side.</li>
            <li>, I believe they are creative and fun.</li>
            <li>But the color itself is a very soft, bright pinkish white that probably looks nice on most skin tones.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, and also looks good used as an overall highlighter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have horrendous undereye circles, but this product is the best i&#x27;ve ever found to really brighten up that area and left me looking really refreshed.</li>
            <li>It certainly does the job, but I had really hoped it would have some kind of shimmer to it</li>
            <li>I ordered this about a month ago, it is a very pale shimmery pink color which looks great on me because I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>The difference is the eye bright pencil has a bit more pink than the high brow one and the eye</li>
            <li>Until I tried Eye Bright, I never really bothered with eye makeup.</li>
            <li>However, the overall brightening effect of the product makes one look amazingly alert even on the earliest of mornings.    </li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>If you do decide to try it, I recommend sharpening it frequently; it may have worked better for me</li>
            <li>on those who have medium or darker complexions it may not be the right choice for you.    </li>
            <li>the dark circles had made me look until I saw myself with Eye Bright.  </li>
            <li>I think with a little more practice, I will get better at application.</li>
            <li>Then I read a review here recommending that you put a nice dot at the inside and outside corners of your eyes and avoid trying to blend too much.</li>
            <li>You do have to blend, but it comes across very natural without looking too light.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I do like the natural, not too light,</li>
            <li>you blend the product in enough, it adds a lift to your eyes and people won&#x27;t even be able to tell you are wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant at first considering it is a cosmetic pencil and decided to hold off.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with dryness under my eyes, so I make sure I moisture well with an eye cream (I use Ole Henriksen \\&quot;Visual Truth Eye</li>
            <li>Did it this morning, and the first person I saw in the elevator lobby at work told me how well-rested I looked.  </li>
            <li>But it was funny because she was trying to sell me and tell me what I needed me being a certified master makeup artist and experience on televison and film</li>
            <li>It really does brighten your eyes!  </li>
            <li>In my opinion,this product does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>If the white seems like too much at first, it should calm down/blend as you blink, and should be fine before you leave the house.</li>
            <li>The pencil applies very smoothly and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>As a very fair skinned girl I&#x27;ve struggled to find a product to minimize my dark under eye circles that was light enough without being white.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but I had to let those interested know that it really does work, AND it works on darker skin tones too, like mine.</li>
            <li>Extra points for the light formulation - the first that I&#x27;ve found to do the job without looking like spackle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also dab it on any little red areas around my nose or mouth and it works great there too.</li>
            <li>Lightly trace eyeliner along your waterline (lower rim of eyelid above lower lashes).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply too much though, otherwise you will look like you are straight out of the 80s.  </li>
            <li>Actually I really like Benefit&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>It stays on forever and really brightens up your eyes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely could not remove these splintery pieces of wood, even after trying to chip or carve them off with a knife.</li>
            <li>This is ok, I have pretty oily skin and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>A year ago I visited the Benefit counter at a local department store the makeup girl recommended Eye Bright to me because of the dark circles under my eyes caused by allergies.  </li>
            <li>I found this product was very easy to apply and it did noticeably brighten the dark areas under my eyes although it didn&#x27;t conceal them completely.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about my \\&quot;never being able to look tired\\&quot;, but this product is my secret!</li>
            <li>As I get older when I wear alot think it makes me look older.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and wear brown colors in eye makeup, and this color brightens my eyes without being too heavy or obvious.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Benefit is notorious for high prices and I&#x27;m taking one star off for that</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews (and noting that most were written by people with light or pale skin), I had to write to let others know that I have olive skin tones</li>
            <li>This gives you the exact same effect.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks later, I made my first ever trip to a Sephora store &amp; it was like Heaven.</li>
            <li>My first attempt at getting it correctly sharpened ended with me going through half of the pencil and still not having it right.</li>
            <li>...Try buying Rimmel London&#x27;s Soft Kohl Kajal Eye Pencil in Pure White</li>
            <li>(I paid about $3.00 for mine, and Rimmel can be found at nearly any drugstore.</li>
            <li>Next I shall try the Benefit High brown!</li>
            <li>It is quite soft and as others have said, does not pull on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was not looking for something dramatic; I was looking for a subtle brightener, and this is perfect!  </li>
            <li>This product really \\&quot;opens\\&quot; the eye as it claims, but there are several pencils in the market (including drugstore brands) which does the highlighting and brightening job in the eye area equally well.</li>
            <li>I generally just wear a wash of color on my lid, lip gloss, and mascara, and blush.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really wanting to try out the effect without paying the price, try this in Pink 507 [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t go a day without at least a bit of the eye-bright in the corners even when I don&#x27;t do a full make-up day</li>
            <li>I blend a small amount right under my eyebrows, and on the inside and outside corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>This instantly perks up tired looking eyes and conceals dark circles making you look more awake and alive.</li>
            <li>Not only does Eyebright completely cover the dark spots under my eyes from age &amp; sleep deprivation :O</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is ok, I have pretty oily skin and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> A year ago I visited the Benefit counter at a local department store the makeup girl recommended Eye Bright to me because of the dark circles under my eyes caused by allergies.  </li>
            <li> I found this product was very easy to apply and it did noticeably brighten the dark areas under my eyes although it didn&#x27;t conceal them completely.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments about my \\&quot;never being able to look tired\\&quot;, but this product is my secret!</li>
            <li> As I get older when I wear alot think it makes me look older.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and wear brown colors in eye makeup, and this color brightens my eyes without being too heavy or obvious.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Benefit is notorious for high prices and I&#x27;m taking one star off for that</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews (and noting that most were written by people with light or pale skin), I had to write to let others know that I have olive skin tones</li>
            <li> This gives you the exact same effect.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks later, I made my first ever trip to a Sephora store &amp; it was like Heaven.</li>
            <li> My first attempt at getting it correctly sharpened ended with me going through half of the pencil and still not having it right.</li>

            <li> Next I shall try the Benefit High brown!</li>
            <li> It is quite soft and as others have said, does not pull on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was not looking for something dramatic; I was looking for a subtle brightener, and this is perfect!  </li>
            <li> This product really \\&quot;opens\\&quot; the eye as it claims, but there are several pencils in the market (including drugstore brands) which does the highlighting and brightening job in the eye area equally well.</li>
            <li> I generally just wear a wash of color on my lid, lip gloss, and mascara, and blush.  </li>

            <li> Now I don&#x27;t go a day without at least a bit of the eye-bright in the corners even when I don&#x27;t do a full make-up day</li>
            <li> I blend a small amount right under my eyebrows, and on the inside and outside corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> This instantly perks up tired looking eyes and conceals dark circles making you look more awake and alive.</li>
            <li> Not only does Eyebright completely cover the dark spots under my eyes from age &amp; sleep deprivation :O</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product fanatic who has absolutely no problem spending way too much money on beauty products (I can&#x27;t live without SKYN Iceland, Smashbox, Philosophy, MAC eyeliners, DiorShow, NARS Orgasm, BareMinerals).</li>

            <li> It is priced a bit high - there are other similar products on the market that do the same thing for less.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In essence, I don&#x27;t regret the expense because buying this Benefit cosmetic is cheaper than trying several other discount brands, only to come back to this one.</li>
            <li> At first I was resistant to the idea being as I have previously stated not a huge fan of makeup, but I let her put it on.  </li>
            <li> And I did, and i was pleasently surprised at how well this little pencil could work wonders.</li>
            <li> While I do like the final result of this product, the pencil makes it a little more difficult to use and blend.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time too.  </li>
            <li> and I expect it to be made with premiun materials, which clearly is not the case.</li>
            <li> I am getting several uses before I have to sharp it.</li>
            <li> Obviously, don&#x27;t use a heavy hand or it will look super fake.</li>
            <li> however my friend tried mine and it looked as if she had put pink eyeshadow under her eyes.      </li>
            <li> For some reason you can not tell it is pink on me, I am assuming it is because I have a pinkness to my skin but</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.  </li>
            <li> I literally spent hours in there.</li>
            <li> It was too pink to cover or even camoflauge my undereye circles and the shadows in the inside corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I use it everyday in the inner corner of my eyes and under my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how much older and tired</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first bought this.  </li>
            <li> I just make a few dots just below my eyebrow, then a little in the corner of my eye and blend for that extra OOmph.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Benefit Jumbo Sharpener that is recommended for this pencil, but the minute I tried to sharpen it, the wood splintered off, leaving very hard, pointy-sharp pieces on one side of the pencil, that I would never put near my eye.</li>
            <li> I have always fought dark undereye circles.  </li>
            <li> She put it in the corners of my eyes, then along the dark shadows/circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> She did the eye-bright over the dark spots, then used a bit of the bo-ing to go over that and blend it all in.  </li>
            <li> this stuff stays on all day - and works wonders on the dark patches around my eyes.</li>
            <li> In short, it does work well; however, if you only get a handful of uses out of it before you cannot use it, then what purpose does it serve other than that of being an expensive investment?</li>
            <li> So, for a few days, I used a little makeup brush to try to dig the pink stuff out of the pencil</li>
            <li> I could never find anything that looked subtle enough.</li>
            <li> So if you want to get rid of dark circles, and save some $ then get this elsewhere!</li>
            <li> Sounds impossible, right?</li>
            <li> My makeup regime usually includes a little cover up to cover dark circles, my benetint and maybe some eyeliner if I&#x27;m feeling fancy.  </li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of makeup or heavily made up looks, but I discovered Benetint about 6 year.  </li>
            <li> But she was admit on me trying a tinted moisturizer if I wear anything that is it, but their tinted moisturizer was too heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> For only $5, it does the trick (plus has a bit of shimmer to it) and if you decide it&#x27;s not the right look for you, you won&#x27;t terribly regret spending the money.</li>
            <li> This also ruined the expensive sharpener, which is now all gummed up with the pink concealer and has little chips of wood wedged under the blade.</li>
            <li> I found this rather odd as I never experienced this problem before.</li>
            <li> The size, I had a hard time finding a sharpener for it             2.  </li>
            <li> had I not let it get so dull.</li>
            <li> at least until I find something less expensive that works as well.</li>
            <li> This made it next to impossible to use.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on Amazon &amp; my previous bad luck with \\&quot;dark circle\\&quot; creams, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> (others have complained) and the very small amt I use, this is definately a bargain!</li>
            <li> The effect is subtle, yet dramatic...</li>
            <li> I was not terribly impressed.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin, so I find it extremely difficult to find products with performance like this one!!</li>
            <li> The bottom line is, this is a very expensive product</li>
            <li> We both ended up getting a make-over (which I usually HATE to do but did it anyway) and when the girl put the eye-bright on, I was shocked!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this about a month ago, it is a very pale shimmery pink color which looks great on me because I have very fair skin however my friend tried mine and it looked as if she had put pink eyeshadow under her eyes.      For some reason you can not tell it is pink on me, I am assuming it is because I have a pinkness to my skin but on those who have medium or darker complexions it may not be the right choice for you.    It glides on under the eyes and on the inside corner of the eyes to make you look rested and healthy.  I use moisturizer under it and it was very smooth and looked great.      Two Cons:  1.  The size, I had a hard time finding a sharpener for it             2.  Probably not for those who have medium or darker skin</li>
            <li> This is ok, I have pretty oily skin and dark circles under my eyes. I don&#x27;t think this has very good staying power even with a primer. Additionally, I don&#x27;t find it creamy enough.</li>
            <li> This is my daily go to product even on the weekends when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup. This instantly perks up tired looking eyes and conceals dark circles making you look more awake and alive. This concealer also has good staying power - I haven&#x27;t had to do any touch-ups during the day. I recommend this product because even though it essentially serves only one purpose, that one thing does make a big difference overall. I only gave it 4 stars because it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> ...Try buying Rimmel London&#x27;s Soft Kohl Kajal Eye Pencil in Pure White (I paid about $3.00 for mine, and Rimmel can be found at nearly any drugstore. You can also get it on Amazon.com). Or use any white eyeliner. Lightly trace eyeliner along your waterline (lower rim of eyelid above lower lashes). Obviously, don&#x27;t use a heavy hand or it will look super fake. If the white seems like too much at first, it should calm down/blend as you blink, and should be fine before you leave the house. I am a beauty product fanatic who has absolutely no problem spending way too much money on beauty products (I can&#x27;t live without SKYN Iceland, Smashbox, Philosophy, MAC eyeliners, DiorShow, NARS Orgasm, BareMinerals). After seeing Eye Bright at Sephora I wondered if I could get the same effect with something cheaper. Guess what? This gives you the exact same effect. Use the money you save to buy a tube of Benefit Ooh La Lift because that stuff WORKS: [[ASIN:B00021ABD8 Benefit Cosmetics Ooh La Lift]]</li>
            <li> While I do like the final result of this product, the pencil makes it a little more difficult to use and blend. I think it would be brilliant if it came in a more liquid form! I think with a little more practice, I will get better at application. All in all, I do like the natural, not too light, just nice and bright look it gives under my eyes.</li>
            <li> for almost twenty bucks, this pencil wound up being a letdown.  A miracle worker?  Absolutely not.  It did open up my inner eye, but cheapie shadow does that too, and stays put longer.  Unless you&#x27;re just looking for somewhere to throw your money away, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews (and noting that most were written by people with light or pale skin), I had to write to let others know that I have olive skin tones and I love this product!  I have always fought dark undereye circles.  I saw this product while searching the web about the makeup artisit, Carmindy (who recommends using this), and decided to look into it.  I just recently bought the Eye Bright and absolutely love it.  You do have to blend, but it comes across very natural without looking too light.  I recommend this product highly. I never write reviews, but I had to let those interested know that it really does work, AND it works on darker skin tones too, like mine.</li>
            <li> Until I tried Eye Bright, I never really bothered with eye makeup. I could never find anything that looked subtle enough. I just wanted something to give my eyes a bit of a pop, that&#x27;s all.    Eye Bright is really great for those of us who want a no-fuss, quick eye makeup routine. The effect is subtle, yet dramatic... Sounds impossible, right? But the color itself is a very soft, bright pinkish white that probably looks nice on most skin tones. However, the overall brightening effect of the product makes one look amazingly alert even on the earliest of mornings.    Like most Benefit products, this makeup isn&#x27;t too \\&quot;makeup\\&quot;-y. That is, when you wear Eye Bright, you most likely won&#x27;t receive compliments on your eye makeup, but rather on how well-rested you look.     Highly recommended. This one will stay in my makeup bag for use every morning.</li>
            <li> I often work 16 hours shifts, and I couldn&#x27;t get through my day without this product. Just a swipe on my inner waterlines and I look refreshed, revived, and awake. I get so many compliments about my \\&quot;never being able to look tired\\&quot;, but this product is my secret! If I could only use one make-up product for the rest of my life, this would be it. I recommend this to everyone. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, and also looks good used as an overall highlighter. Worth every cent. I&#x27;ve used 4 sticks already and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I blend a small amount right under my eyebrows, and on the inside and outside corners of my eyes. This product makes your eyes look naturally beautiful and bright. Don&#x27;t apply too much though, otherwise you will look like you are straight out of the 80s.  &lt;br /&gt;If you blend the product in enough, it adds a lift to your eyes and people won&#x27;t even be able to tell you are wearing makeup.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> As a very fair skinned girl I&#x27;ve struggled to find a product to minimize my dark under eye circles that was light enough without being white. Eye bright does just that. Extra points for the light formulation - the first that I&#x27;ve found to do the job without looking like spackle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefit is notorious for high prices and I&#x27;m taking one star off for that, however, my eye bright has lasted a year and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it... at least until I find something less expensive that works as well.</li>
            <li> Great product, but I got it for $9 on Ebay. So if you want to get rid of dark circles, and save some $ then get this elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have horrendous undereye circles, but this product is the best i&#x27;ve ever found to really brighten up that area and left me looking really refreshed. I also dab it on any little red areas around my nose or mouth and it works great there too.</li>
            <li> Actually I really like Benefit&#x27;s products, I believe they are creative and fun. However, some of their products are really overpriced like Eye Bright. This product really \\&quot;opens\\&quot; the eye as it claims, but there are several pencils in the market (including drugstore brands) which does the highlighting and brightening job in the eye area equally well. I am not planning to spend my bucks on eye bright until I win the lottery. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on Amazon &amp; my previous bad luck with \\&quot;dark circle\\&quot; creams, I decided to give this a try. I was a bit hesitant at first considering it is a cosmetic pencil and decided to hold off. A couple weeks later, I made my first ever trip to a Sephora store &amp; it was like Heaven. I literally spent hours in there. I told myself if i come across the Benefit Eye Bright product, then I would give it a try. And I did, and i was pleasently surprised at how well this little pencil could work wonders. I have a problem with dryness under my eyes, so I make sure I moisture well with an eye cream (I use Ole Henriksen \\&quot;Visual Truth Eye Cream\\&quot;) prior to applying the penicl. All you need is a light stroke on each eye corner and then blend with your finger and viola! It so simple and easy to apply, I am glad I decided to give this a try! :D Next I shall try the Benefit High brown!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dreaming about this product forever, and I finally went to Sephora to give it a whirl.  Honestly...I was not terribly impressed.  It certainly does the job, but I had really hoped it would have some kind of shimmer to it; however it is more of a matte effect.  It is quite soft and as others have said, does not pull on the skin.  If you&#x27;re really wanting to try out the effect without paying the price, try this in Pink 507 [[ASIN:B00021E1EI Sephora Brand Jumbo Pencil - Eye]].  For only $5, it does the trick (plus has a bit of shimmer to it) and if you decide it&#x27;s not the right look for you, you won&#x27;t terribly regret spending the money.</li>
            <li> I went to the Benefit counter at my local department store.  I had no intentions of buying anything, I was just there with a friend.  We both ended up getting a make-over (which I usually HATE to do but did it anyway) and when the girl put the eye-bright on, I was shocked!  She put it in the corners of my eyes, then along the dark shadows/circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been sleep-deprived for about nine months now and this is the first time I didn&#x27;t look like the walking dead!  She did the eye-bright over the dark spots, then used a bit of the bo-ing to go over that and blend it all in.  I&#x27;ve always been brand-loyal to another company, but I ended up being a Benefit convert that day.  Now I don&#x27;t go a day without at least a bit of the eye-bright in the corners even when I don&#x27;t do a full make-up day and I look like I belong in the land of the living! I am so glad I found this product and at the price (others have complained) and the very small amt I use, this is definately a bargain!</li>
            <li> Oh my wow - this pencil is great to highlight your eyes on your not so fabulous mornings. It has a nice creamy blendable texture, and is so easy to use.  I just make a few dots just below my eyebrow, then a little in the corner of my eye and blend for that extra OOmph.  Definitely recommend this as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of makeup or heavily made up looks, but I discovered Benetint about 6 year.  Since then I have been a huge fan of Benefit cosmetics.  My makeup regime usually includes a little cover up to cover dark circles, my benetint and maybe some eyeliner if I&#x27;m feeling fancy.  A year ago I visited the Benefit counter at a local department store the makeup girl recommended Eye Bright to me because of the dark circles under my eyes caused by allergies.  At first I was resistant to the idea being as I have previously stated not a huge fan of makeup, but I let her put it on.  After looking in the mirror I was sold!  My eyes looked bigger and brighter.  I hadn&#x27;t realized how much older and tired the dark circles had made me look until I saw myself with Eye Bright.  This is a definite reccomend</li>
            <li> this stuff stays on all day - and works wonders on the dark patches around my eyes. I have very pale skin, so I find it extremely difficult to find products with performance like this one!! &lt;br /&gt;Thank you Benefit!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first bought this.  It was too pink to cover or even camoflauge my undereye circles and the shadows in the inside corners of my eyes.  Then I read a review here recommending that you put a nice dot at the inside and outside corners of your eyes and avoid trying to blend too much. Did it this morning, and the first person I saw in the elevator lobby at work told me how well-rested I looked.  And I just got back from a business trip, so the reality is quite the opposite.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I found this product was very easy to apply and it did noticeably brighten the dark areas under my eyes although it didn&#x27;t conceal them completely.  I like the product but am undecided if I&#x27;ll purchase more considering the price.</li>
            <li> I was interviewing to work at a Benefit counter and I dont like to wear alot of makeup.  But it was funny because she was trying to sell me and tell me what I needed me being a certified master makeup artist and experience on televison and film, I know how to do makeup.  I generally just wear a wash of color on my lid, lip gloss, and mascara, and blush.  I dont like to wear foundation or anything on my face, I been blessed with nice skin and just dont like to wear it.  As I get older when I wear alot think it makes me look older.  But she was admit on me trying a tinted moisturizer if I wear anything that is it, but their tinted moisturizer was too heavy for me.  She also tried the light bright and I liked it, I would add to my kit to use as a highlighter to the inner rim of the eye, so I would suggest it.  View my web site at [...]</li>
            <li> I found this absolutely wonderful product while searching for a decent eye cream.  I ordered and am \\&quot;so\\&quot; happy with \\&quot;EYECON\\&quot; by Benefit.  Another consumer suggested trying Eye Bright along with Eyecon &amp; the results are amazing.  I have \\&quot;very\\&quot; fair skin.  Not only does Eyebright completely cover the dark spots under my eyes from age &amp; sleep deprivation :O but it lasts \\&quot;all day\\&quot; and is so light that you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there!  I abhor under-eye concealers as they put emphasis on the growing lines under and around my eyes.  This product is a must-have and a keeper.  Benefit has erased years off my eyes and I&#x27;m thrilled :)</li>
            <li> I know some folks use this more as a concealer.  Instead, I use it everyday in the inner corner of my eyes and under my eyebrows.  It really does brighten your eyes!  It stays on for a long time too.  I also own the Beneift high brow pencil, which is nice too but I prefer this one.  The difference is the eye bright pencil has a bit more pink than the high brow one and the eye bright seems to be a bit more creamy in texture.</li>
            <li> This eye pencil has the right color, right texture, gives you a healthy look and bright eye.</li>
            <li> I love my Eye Bright pencil!  I have fair skin and wear brown colors in eye makeup, and this color brightens my eyes without being too heavy or obvious.  I was not looking for something dramatic; I was looking for a subtle brightener, and this is perfect!  People notice a difference when I wear Eye Bright, but can&#x27;t tell what the difference is.  The pencil applies very smoothly and lasts a long time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product does as it claims.  I love it.  It is priced a bit high - there are other similar products on the market that do the same thing for less.  I have not had to sharpen it yet (I read this was a problem).  But overall I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments on my eyes I am definitely going to need another one when this one is over. It stays on forever and really brightens up your eyes. In spite of the price, it is a great buy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the eye bright, and in the beginning, it worked very well at hiding some of the darkness under the eyes. When it came time to resharpen the pencil after a couple of applications I used the appropriate Benefit sharpener; however, the eye bright stick pencil started to splinter and only sharpen on one side. I found this rather odd as I never experienced this problem before. This made it next to impossible to use. My first attempt at getting it correctly sharpened ended with me going through half of the pencil and still not having it right. I have thrown it aside in disgust. In short, it does work well; however, if you only get a handful of uses out of it before you cannot use it, then what purpose does it serve other than that of being an expensive investment?</li>
            <li> In my opinion,this product does exactly what it says it will. It blends well and this one pencil has lasted me almost a year. I am getting several uses before I have to sharp it. I am definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I was initially very happy with this pencil. The pink tint is soft and creamy, and doesn&#x27;t pull at your skin when you apply it. I used it with Bare Minerals foundation and it lasted all day, and did an excellent job of covering the circles under my eyes. It also lasted at least three weeks before I had to sharpen it for the first time. But that is where my satisfaction ended. I bought the Benefit Jumbo Sharpener that is recommended for this pencil, but the minute I tried to sharpen it, the wood splintered off, leaving very hard, pointy-sharp pieces on one side of the pencil, that I would never put near my eye. I absolutely could not remove these splintery pieces of wood, even after trying to chip or carve them off with a knife. So, for a few days, I used a little makeup brush to try to dig the pink stuff out of the pencil but I finally gave up and threw the remains of the pencil away. This also ruined the expensive sharpener, which is now all gummed up with the pink concealer and has little chips of wood wedged under the blade. The bottom line is, this is a very expensive product and I expect it to be made with premiun materials, which clearly is not the case. If you do decide to try it, I recommend sharpening it frequently; it may have worked better for me had I not let it get so dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost tempted to take away one star from this great product because of the price. (Ouch!) However, Benefit Cosmetics Eye Bright is an amazing cosmetic that does just what the name indicates -- it enhances the appearance of your eyes, making them seem brighter, more youthful and well-rested. Since I am plagued by allergies and sinus problems, using Eye Bright is sort of like fixing that dullness in Photoshop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, I don&#x27;t regret the expense because buying this Benefit cosmetic is cheaper than trying several other discount brands, only to come back to this one. Therefore, ladies, loosen up the purse strings and treat yourself to Eye Bright, because it will, well... make your eyes look bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
