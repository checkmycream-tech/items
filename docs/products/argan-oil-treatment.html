            <li>Although, I didn&#x27;t loose a lot, this product is so great that the lose of a drop is still too much.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and am often seeking good moisturizers.  </li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>But having said that, it makes my hair feel soft and look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I am a regular user of Argan Oil, it gives my hair the body and a nice silky finish without making the hair greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the effort...</li>
            <li>which kind of serves the same purpose.</li>
            <li>I have found this product to be superior to other Argan oils.  </li>
            <li>Just like the title says I never used it since I have another hair product that I&#x27;m using right now</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and leaves hair glossy and very soft.  </li>
            <li>its smooth and leaves hair soft unknotted and shiny !</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It has such a light fresh scent!  </li>
            <li>My hair came out so smooth, shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives our hair the moisture it needs for pretty curls and no frizz.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched and searched for different shampoos to use to try and make my health look healthy and shiny, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a cheaper alternative to Moroccan Oil, which I love</li>
            <li>first night using it I woke up and my hair felt like silk.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I put a little on in the morning too to calm down the ends of my hair - - great product!!!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t stop DEMANDING a certain number of words, and refusing my submission until I provide the required number, I will NEVER rate anything again.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different oils as an alternative to lotion but most are super greasy (obviously) and take a very long time to absorb.  </li>
            <li>Oil treatment not only keeps the frizzys away, it smells great and does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>but I think it was a bit over rated, however it was shipped fast and was what I ordered.</li>
            <li>My looks so much healthier and shiny without being greasy, and it feels softer.</li>
            <li>I tried this at the suggestion of my stylist but found the formula to be much greasier than it is oily.</li>
            <li>I thought I could do without this product, but the difference in my hair was very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Try to avoid the roots if you have straight hair, so it won&#x27;t look oily.</li>
            <li>would absolutely reccommend this to anyone who is looking for an oil product.  </li>
            <li>I like this product but you need to use it very sparingly so you do not get your hair too greasy.  </li>
            <li>The price here on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat and the product works very well on our hair.  </li>
            <li>my skin is  smoother and i am not breaking out as much.</li>
            <li>and this oil has helped keep the pimples from popping up as much as they once did.</li>
            <li>It does not take much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product; I have been using it for about a year now.  </li>
            <li>, I have a lot of hair and $64 bucks for a 6.8 oz bottle really hurts.</li>
            <li>She decided to try this since the cost was unbelievably reasonable when compared with the Morrocan Oil she was using.  </li>
            <li>i found it at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have only used a little of this because I wanted to finish using another product first, but it is great for natural hair!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it and prefer the other brand better...</li>
            <li>Since using this I have been able to give up all of the other products (mousse, gel &amp; hairspray).  </li>
            <li>Since using this I have been able to give up all of the other products (mousse, gel &amp; hairspray).  </li>
            <li>This item has a wonderful smell, but left my hair extremely greasy feeling unlike other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend who has similar hair told me about this product which I was excited to try.</li>
            <li>I originally got a tiny bottle free with my flat iron purchase.</li>
            <li>I have really thin frizzy and wavy hair and live in a really humid place so most of the times my hair is more like my nightmare</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this, my hair was soft, shiny and in control.  </li>
            <li>I have put my other oils to the side and will be using this from now on! :)</li>
            <li>If I can get over the smell of this thing, then I&#x27;ll be able to use it long enough to see whether it really works.</li>
            <li>I tried it first because when I bought my new flat iron I had a really small sample and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>It feels like a highly decorated frizz-ease though.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and you just need a tiny little bit (will last forever)!  </li>
            <li>not last long enough in the warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It makes frizzy fried hair slick-out like new hair.</li>
            <li>Your hair will look like new hair.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product with the purchase of a new curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for years and couldn&#x27;t live without anymore.</li>
            <li>When I use this product, it softens my hair, helps the general friz we curly headed people have and glosses it up nicely without weighing down my hair or making me look generally greasy and unwashed.  </li>
            <li>Bought it online because it was cheaper, was surprised when I received it so soon!</li>
            <li>so i looked at amazon to find the exact same product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only takes a small amount in your hair to give a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>And the smell alone is worth the price... delicate and fragrant, without being too overpowering, sweet or with a hint of alcohol.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast, I got it within a few days.</li>
            <li>1/4 of a bottle is a large portion when you only use a dime size</li>
            <li>This also dulls light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>a must have for all family members to maintain hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>You just rub it into your hands and they are so soft.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;ve been looking for something to use on my 4 year old grandaughter&#x27;s hair after I wash it to remove the tangles the conditioner doesn&#x27;t always get out.  </li>
            <li>Using this product makes my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>Purchased this size because I think I used too much when I had a smaller jar.  </li>
            <li>But when I use a blow dryer it looks natural.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color, as well as the color I use to cover</li>
            <li>However, I am sensitive to smells, so my eyes burn and itch.  </li>
            <li>We use this on my 4 year old son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been natural all my life.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go near my roots.</li>
            <li>colour my hair frequently and</li>
            <li>I fell in love instantly after seeing that it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling all greasy like other oils, it literally soaks into my hair instead of laying on the outside and spreading oil all over my hands, sheets, and pillows.</li>
            <li>I usually buy this at Sallys but found it for half the price right here!!!!  </li>
            <li>Really great price for a usually expensive product!</li>
            <li>The product works very well, leaves dry hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>so i have a hard time finding the right products at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and soft, with my curls becoming somewhat manageable and delicate (vs. curling every way possible and looking like haywire).</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this argan oil with a flat iron I bought at Target a few days before ordering it online.</li>
            <li>(She is 9 and obviously isn&#x27;t subject to the damaging effects of styling), her hair is a golden blonde, straight as a stick and is very long.  </li>
            <li>This stuff doesnt smell bad and feels good on your skin.</li>

            <li> I really liked how it took the frizz away and made my hair soft and not oily.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it &#x3D;).</li>

            <li> Although, I didn&#x27;t loose a lot, this product is so great that the lose of a drop is still too much.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and am often seeking good moisturizers.  </li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> But having said that, it makes my hair feel soft and look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Argan Oil, it gives my hair the body and a nice silky finish without making the hair greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the effort...</li>
            <li> which kind of serves the same purpose.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be superior to other Argan oils.  </li>
            <li> Just like the title says I never used it since I have another hair product that I&#x27;m using right now</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and leaves hair glossy and very soft.  </li>
            <li> its smooth and leaves hair soft unknotted and shiny !</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It has such a light fresh scent!  </li>
            <li> My hair came out so smooth, shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives our hair the moisture it needs for pretty curls and no frizz.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched and searched for different shampoos to use to try and make my health look healthy and shiny, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a cheaper alternative to Moroccan Oil, which I love</li>
            <li> first night using it I woke up and my hair felt like silk.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I put a little on in the morning too to calm down the ends of my hair - - great product!!!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t stop DEMANDING a certain number of words, and refusing my submission until I provide the required number, I will NEVER rate anything again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different oils as an alternative to lotion but most are super greasy (obviously) and take a very long time to absorb.  </li>
            <li> Oil treatment not only keeps the frizzys away, it smells great and does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> but I think it was a bit over rated, however it was shipped fast and was what I ordered.</li>
            <li> My looks so much healthier and shiny without being greasy, and it feels softer.</li>
            <li> I tried this at the suggestion of my stylist but found the formula to be much greasier than it is oily.</li>
            <li> I thought I could do without this product, but the difference in my hair was very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Try to avoid the roots if you have straight hair, so it won&#x27;t look oily.</li>
            <li> would absolutely reccommend this to anyone who is looking for an oil product.  </li>
            <li> I like this product but you need to use it very sparingly so you do not get your hair too greasy.  </li>
            <li> The price here on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat and the product works very well on our hair.  </li>
            <li> my skin is  smoother and i am not breaking out as much.</li>
            <li> and this oil has helped keep the pimples from popping up as much as they once did.</li>
            <li> It does not take much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product; I have been using it for about a year now.  </li>
            <li> , I have a lot of hair and $64 bucks for a 6.8 oz bottle really hurts.</li>
            <li> She decided to try this since the cost was unbelievably reasonable when compared with the Morrocan Oil she was using.  </li>
            <li> i found it at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have only used a little of this because I wanted to finish using another product first, but it is great for natural hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it and prefer the other brand better...</li>
            <li> Since using this I have been able to give up all of the other products (mousse, gel &amp; hairspray).  </li>
            <li> Since using this I have been able to give up all of the other products (mousse, gel &amp; hairspray).  </li>
            <li> This item has a wonderful smell, but left my hair extremely greasy feeling unlike other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend who has similar hair told me about this product which I was excited to try.</li>
            <li> I originally got a tiny bottle free with my flat iron purchase.</li>
            <li> I have really thin frizzy and wavy hair and live in a really humid place so most of the times my hair is more like my nightmare</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, my hair was soft, shiny and in control.  </li>
            <li> I have put my other oils to the side and will be using this from now on! :)</li>
            <li> If I can get over the smell of this thing, then I&#x27;ll be able to use it long enough to see whether it really works.</li>
            <li> I tried it first because when I bought my new flat iron I had a really small sample and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> It feels like a highly decorated frizz-ease though.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and you just need a tiny little bit (will last forever)!  </li>
            <li> not last long enough in the warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It makes frizzy fried hair slick-out like new hair.</li>
            <li> Your hair will look like new hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product with the purchase of a new curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for years and couldn&#x27;t live without anymore.</li>
            <li> When I use this product, it softens my hair, helps the general friz we curly headed people have and glosses it up nicely without weighing down my hair or making me look generally greasy and unwashed.  </li>
            <li> Bought it online because it was cheaper, was surprised when I received it so soon!</li>
            <li> so i looked at amazon to find the exact same product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes a small amount in your hair to give a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> And the smell alone is worth the price... delicate and fragrant, without being too overpowering, sweet or with a hint of alcohol.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast, I got it within a few days.</li>
            <li> 1/4 of a bottle is a large portion when you only use a dime size</li>
            <li> This also dulls light blonde hair.</li>
            <li> a must have for all family members to maintain hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> You just rub it into your hands and they are so soft.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve been looking for something to use on my 4 year old grandaughter&#x27;s hair after I wash it to remove the tangles the conditioner doesn&#x27;t always get out.  </li>
            <li> Using this product makes my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> Purchased this size because I think I used too much when I had a smaller jar.  </li>
            <li> But when I use a blow dryer it looks natural.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color, as well as the color I use to cover</li>
            <li> However, I am sensitive to smells, so my eyes burn and itch.  </li>
            <li> We use this on my 4 year old son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been natural all my life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go near my roots.</li>
            <li> colour my hair frequently and</li>
            <li> I fell in love instantly after seeing that it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling all greasy like other oils, it literally soaks into my hair instead of laying on the outside and spreading oil all over my hands, sheets, and pillows.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at Sallys but found it for half the price right here!!!!  </li>
            <li> Really great price for a usually expensive product!</li>
            <li> The product works very well, leaves dry hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li> so i have a hard time finding the right products at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and soft, with my curls becoming somewhat manageable and delicate (vs. curling every way possible and looking like haywire).</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this argan oil with a flat iron I bought at Target a few days before ordering it online.</li>
            <li> (She is 9 and obviously isn&#x27;t subject to the damaging effects of styling), her hair is a golden blonde, straight as a stick and is very long.  </li>
            <li> This stuff doesnt smell bad and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of half wigs because that natural life  in my opinion is hard to deal with specially in the summer.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit goes a long way and whatever is left on your hands is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> The small hole  allows you to determine how much you use.</li>
            <li> then I gently pat and finger comb, separating small chunks of hair as I go along.</li>
            <li> Works well with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The only oil that works to make my biracial daughters hair not so dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and I notice less problems with frizz, although I don&#x27;t know if anything will cure the &#x27;dreaded frizz&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Just use a tiny amound on dry areas.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry coarse hair, and this product leaves</li>
            <li> This has replaced my need for conditioner and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, wavy, rebellious, weather-dependent, defiant, dry locks, but I use it on damp hair and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid condition which causes my hair to look dry, frizzy and straw-like.  </li>
            <li> Hair is dry and frizzy again within hours.</li>
            <li> In only a few weeks the frizz is finally being tamed!</li>
            <li> I, literally, have the amount of hair three average women do, plus it goes down to the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> I, literally, have the amount of hair three average women do, plus it goes down to the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> I have loose curls and it gets frizzy sometimes</li>
            <li> am getting a little grey and because of that I color my hair regularly.  </li>
            <li> After using this product my hair is no longer dry and frizzy!</li>
            <li> I try to put it in while my hair is damp not soaking wet or bone dry</li>
            <li> Rub it between your palms and then wotk it through your hair, wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is just what I need for my very dry hair.</li>
            <li> Now that I am getting older, I&#x27;m getting a lot of those grey crazy old lady corkscrew hairs popping up all over.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> the grey is a dark brown</li>
            <li> With this oil, a little does go a long way, I use less than a dime sized drop to oil my entire head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and have tried other brands but always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune on various hair products and depending on your budget, this can seem a bit pricey for the amount</li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune on various hair products and depending on your budget, this can seem a bit pricey for the amount</li>

            <li> A little bit goes a long way, leaving your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need conditioner, I don&#x27;t use much other product, sometimes i use a wax or sculpting putty, never use hairspray.</li>
            <li> But other than that  </li>
            <li> i even make leave ins with shea butter amongst other oils, but this is prob my fav to put in.  </li>
            <li> I only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> but i have used other Argan oils and</li>
            <li> She tried a small sample of this at a beauty saloon and now uses it on her hair regularly.</li>
            <li> and I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount too</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I am looking for, but comes half-way.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh your hair down like other oils.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there is build up on the scalp but much less than other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one and only for at least 5-7yrs now.</li>
            <li> I have a weird kinky and straight hair mix</li>
            <li> Between using it at least twice a day on my hands and arms plus a generous amount on my hair each morning, a bottle will last me about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> is the only on that works correctly for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very poor in comparision to pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> Afghan Oil does not make your hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> so how could you turn it down?</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount to apply on your hair , which saves you a lot of money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even half gone, and I have had it almost a year.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of oil before and this time purchased from Amazon when my previous stock finished.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AS A SENIOR I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO MESS AROUND WITH COSMETICS</li>
            <li> My mom has very thin hair and uses a very small amount to calm frizzies and provide shine.  </li>
            <li> All i need for my very long and thick hair is a quarter size drop that i put on the ends and my frizzies.</li>
            <li> I also use a little as moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t make my partly oily skin break out</li>
            <li> This oil treatment gives my hair shine but a little greasy look .</li>
            <li> Put a little on before blow dry/flat iron</li>
            <li> I like to put a little bit on my daughters hair from time to time for added moisture.  </li>
            <li> , it is also curly and very very thick and coarse.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get wasted</li>
            <li> it feel moisturized and silky, without feeling heavy and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I use this with lotion everyday on my hands and a bit of it with my hair gel</li>
            <li> I have wavy/frizzy hair and have searched for a product for years to help tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about using this product because it seemed thick and greasy, but decided to give it a try after a friend of mine raved about it.  </li>
            <li> This version is too small unless using as a trial or for travel and overpriced.</li>
            <li> A small quarter sized amount has all but cured my severe scalp eczema.</li>
            <li> Way too heavily perfumed!  </li>
            <li> My wife usually uses Morrocan Oil.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I would not get the same results at home, but I did.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was unable to find this in my local pharmacy stores like cvs, rite aid, and target</li>
            <li> but my hair is also thin.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of alcohol, especially in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as I said before, she has thin hair.  </li>
            <li> as I said before, she has thin hair.  </li>
            <li> the result will depress you &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> The organic oil, at least for me, hydrates my hair and tames the frizz without making it look dirty.</li>
            <li> A lot of the other oils I have tried do this and the ones with the alcohol base stink.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY thin hair</li>
            <li> The shipping on the other hand was terrible, when I received the product the bottle was busted and 1/4 of the bottle spilled during shipping.  </li>
            <li> but it was so expensive!</li>
            <li> I get congested and feel bad for a while when I use it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not what I expected but I think it was a bit over rated, however it was shipped fast and was what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice&lt;br /&gt;Expected to give me better result, especially since i use it for more than a month..&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will bought it again</li>
            <li> The only oil that works to make my biracial daughters hair not so dry and tangled. i will buy again</li>
            <li> The price is great and its smell good. Works wonder on all types of hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this item. It makes my hair nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying this item again and again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  Great value as well.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product was used on my hair recently at a salon.  My hair came out so smooth, shiny and soft.  I was afraid I would not get the same results at home, but I did.  Just love this Argan oil!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I bought it to prevent dryness  and skin problems on my Schnoodle &amp; Labradoodle, BUT it smells so good and works so well I&#x27;ve started using it on my own hair &amp; scalp! Non-greasy, it leaves hair/fur fragrant, glossy &amp; full.</li>
            <li> Happy scalp. Hair silky smooth. Life is good.</li>
            <li> The product works very well, leaves dry hair soft and managable.  The shipping on the other hand was terrible, when I received the product the bottle was busted and 1/4 of the bottle spilled during shipping.  1/4 of a bottle is a large portion when you only use a dime size everytime you use it.  I could have returned the product, but it was more hassle to return it than to keep the busted bottle.</li>
            <li> Absolutely FABULOUS hair nourishment! I&#x27;ve been using one and only for at least 5-7yrs now. i recommend it to ALL my clients. The price you pay  in stores is worth every dime, but at THIS PRICE!?? It&#x27;s a dream come true! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> i liked this product , it makes my hair soft and i see that it helps my hair from brokes and it has i naice smell too</li>
            <li> Get 3.4 oz version...more cost effective. This version is too small unless using as a trial or for travel and overpriced.</li>
            <li> Smells Great and protects hair leaving it frizz free and silky smooth. Bought it online because it was cheaper, was surprised when I received it so soon! Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this argan oil with a flat iron I bought at Target a few days before ordering it online. I fell in love instantly after seeing that it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling all greasy like other oils, it literally soaks into my hair instead of laying on the outside and spreading oil all over my hands, sheets, and pillows. With this oil, a little does go a long way, I use less than a dime sized drop to oil my entire head. Unfortunately I was unable to find this in my local pharmacy stores like cvs, rite aid, and target so I ordered it online. I have tried so many products in my life and this is by far the best, it keeps my ends from drying out and I can go to work feeling confident that I won&#x27;t have grease spots on my blouse after oiling my ends. I also purchased the argan oil polisher because after my sample ran out that was the only thing I could find in the stores that said argan oil. lol. It works great also, both make your hair very shiny and by the way.. LIGHT WEIGHT. I have VERY thin hair so I am so happy to find this.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using this product, I have stopped using hair spray for managing my hair.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair about every two or three days. A small quarter sized amount has all but cured my severe scalp eczema.</li>
            <li> With super curly hair, I&#x27;m a huge fan of Argan oil and when I can get this at a good price I&#x27;m always happy!  I also use a little as moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t make my partly oily skin break out which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! All i need for my very long and thick hair is a quarter size drop that i put on the ends and my frizzies. I have a weird kinky and straight hair mix so i have a hard time finding the right products at a reasonable cost. This has replaced my need for conditioner and it lasts a long time. I have had this bottle for more than 1/2 year and it is still more than 1/2 full. I wash my hair every other day and I use this every time. I try to put it in while my hair is damp not soaking wet or bone dry so it doesn&#x27;t get wasted and so it gets distributed evenly.&lt;br /&gt;So even though it has a larger price up front it has actually saved me money. I don&#x27;t need conditioner, I don&#x27;t use much other product, sometimes i use a wax or sculpting putty, never use hairspray. My looks so much healthier and shiny without being greasy, and it feels softer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it and prefer the other brand better... but it&#x27;s not bad for the price and it does the job still. Just the smell I am not too fond of.</li>
            <li> Excelent product no complains&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is working exelent it was what i wanted and my hair its getting longer every day.</li>
            <li> I was using Moroccan oil in the blue box which was recommended by my hair stylist it was okay but it was so expensive! This oil is better alternative and it holds better in my hair. I will be using this oil from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used this faithfully for years!! One of the best oils to have in your stash!</li>
            <li> Great price, and great product from this brand a must have for all family members to maintain hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Something not only to condition my hair but to make it shine and smell so good.  Just a tiny bit goes a long way and whatever is left on your hands is a bonus.  You just rub it into your hands and they are so soft.  Wow.  Also I&#x27;ve been looking for something to use on my 4 year old grandaughter&#x27;s hair after I wash it to remove the tangles the conditioner doesn&#x27;t always get out.  I was just amazed at how just about a dime size rubbed between the palms of my hands, then pulled through her hair and the comb just glided through.  Her hair was so shiny and smelled so good.   I tell everone I know about this product.  It is just wonderful.  I just love love love it!</li>
            <li> I prefer organic argon oil for my hair. I tried this at the suggestion of my stylist but found the formula to be much greasier than it is oily. The organic oil, at least for me, hydrates my hair and tames the frizz without making it look dirty. This also dulls light blonde hair.</li>
            <li> great products; I love it</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I thought I could do without this product, but the difference in my hair was very noticeable.  Using this product makes my hair soft and shinny. Always satisfied with this seller. My product is always shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff. Very light oil.</li>
            <li> Purchased this size because I think I used too much when I had a smaller jar.  This is a wonder oil and feels like silk once put on your hair.  It blends in with the hair like magic.  My hair is soft and I notice less problems with frizz, although I don&#x27;t know if anything will cure the &#x27;dreaded frizz&#x27;.  This is a really good oil to add to your hair care regimen. I sometime mix it with jojoba and olive oil and it works as a good seal after a shampoo as well as a good oil rinse before a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Helps provides more curve control, volume and livens up the hair making the face more lively and bright.  Jet wish it was not so pricy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used this before. It does not seem to oily for my hair. I am using this on my hair for  perm damage.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works like very lite-weight oil.&lt;br /&gt;Does not last long enough in the warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;But does work a good bit.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, your hair may not be like mine.</li>
            <li> AS A SENIOR I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO MESS AROUND WITH COSMETICS ANY MORE, HOWEVER, I DO NEED OT MOISTURIZE  MY FACT, AND ARGAN OIL DOES THE TRICK AND A A VERY NICE PRICE.</li>
            <li> This oil treatment gives my hair shine but a little greasy look . But when I use a blow dryer it looks natural. I noticed that my hair stopped falling after using Argan treatment , that&#x27;s why I took a chance on this product . You only need a very small amount to apply on your hair , which saves you a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Hello I love this for my hair and it smells so good. I have long hair but my hair is also thin. so I put this in a recipe for a detangling spray. It works great to keep my hair tangle free without loosing a bunch of hair. I will definately order again. Thank you for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Makes your hair look and feel like you have just come home from a saloon! I recommend for anyone, including those with short hair!</li>
            <li> Very nice product help my dry hair&lt;br /&gt;And make my hair grow faster&lt;br /&gt;And I need to buy the mask</li>
            <li> I love this! I tried it first because when I bought my new flat iron I had a really small sample and absolutely loved it. I bought it and it makes my hair so much better. I have really thin frizzy and wavy hair and live in a really humid place so most of the times my hair is more like my nightmare this controls the frizz like nothing else I have ever used. Definitely loved it.</li>
            <li> I like this  product  its  amazing my hair smooth and grow up and its nice aroma  its perfect  Argan oil</li>
            <li> Afghan Oil does not make your hair feel weighed down. It has a great smell. A little goes a long way. The small hole  allows you to determine how much you use. I would recommend this product for women who use hair spray. Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and you just need a tiny little bit (will last forever)!  My hair gets frizzy with rain/humidity and this stuff works great.  Put a little on before blow dry/flat iron and it smooths everything out.  I put a little on in the morning too to calm down the ends of my hair - - great product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this. absorbs quickly in hair. can be used as heat protector and it smells nice. its smooth and leaves hair soft unknotted and shiny !</li>
            <li> A excellent quality product.  I&#x27;ve used Argan for many years and it works great.  Always pleased with the quality and consistency of this oil.  Works just as in product description.</li>
            <li> I use it as a body moisturizer too.  Keeps me feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great bargain at that price!! Have ordered this product before &amp; just loved it.  It has such a light fresh scent!  My husband does not like perfume, but loves this product on my skin!</li>
            <li> Finally I found the perfect product for my luscious hair. After using this product my hair is no longer dry and frizzy! A+++++!</li>
            <li> My wife and nice have been using it for sometime and it have meet her needs . Will buy again .</li>
            <li> Really great price for a usually expensive product! The shipping was super fast, I got it within a few days. I really do love this stuff !</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.  ALWAYS KEEP A SUPPLY</li>
            <li> The price was great and it arrived in a timely fashion.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 4 star is because it leaves this sticky feeling in your hair.  But other than that  it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on my hair for about 6 months now. I love it. I cant go without it now. I put it in my hair almost everyday and it has changed my texture greatly. I have medium wavy hair and it works great, however I would recommend it for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> Shine, shine, and more shine. It makes frizzy fried hair slick-out like new hair. LOVE this stuff. I will not ever run out of it. I am Caucasian and have had board-straight hair all my life. Now that I am getting older, I&#x27;m getting a lot of those grey crazy old lady corkscrew hairs popping up all over. It&#x27;s nuts. This stuff helps a lot. It smells fantastic. It is VERY rich and potent.... doesn&#x27;t take but a smidge. Rub it between your palms and then wotk it through your hair, wet or dry hair. Try to avoid the roots if you have straight hair, so it won&#x27;t look oily. Work it into the ends well. Your hair will look like new hair.</li>
            <li> great stuff.. but it needs to stop going up in price</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this oil.  I have found this product to be superior to other Argan oils.  It absorbs very quickly and leaves hair glossy and very soft.  I also like to use this on my arms.  I have very dry skin and am often seeking good moisturizers.  I have tried many different oils as an alternative to lotion but most are super greasy (obviously) and take a very long time to absorb.  This one absorbs well and does not leave me feeling like a greased pig afterward.  It also smells fantastic which is another draw to using it as a skin treatment.  It does not leave my skin shiny, which I appreciate as well.  Also, it is alcohol free which is great for a number of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small amount in your hair to give a nice shine.  I like to put a little bit on my daughters hair from time to time for added moisture.  My daughters hair is very healthy (She is 9 and obviously isn&#x27;t subject to the damaging effects of styling), her hair is a golden blonde, straight as a stick and is very long.  When I use this on her hair and she walks out into the sunlight, it looks as if she has, quite literally, spun gold highlights.  This definitely enhances already beautiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting a little grey and because of that I color my hair regularly.  My natural hair color, as well as the color I use to cover the grey is a dark brown, it is also curly and very very thick and coarse.  Because of the curls and consistant coloring, I am prone to dryness and dullness.  When I use this product, it softens my hair, helps the general friz we curly headed people have and glosses it up nicely without weighing down my hair or making me look generally greasy and unwashed.  A lot of the other oils I have tried do this and the ones with the alcohol base stink.  I hate the smell of alcohol, especially in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely reccommend this to anyone who is looking for an oil product.  My mom has very thin hair and uses a very small amount to calm frizzies and provide shine.  She likes it a lot as well.  Since using this I have been able to give up all of the other products (mousse, gel &amp; hairspray).  It gives nice curl definition and again, doesn&#x27;t disturb the bounce of my curls or the volume.  Again, the smell is incredible.  It&#x27;s a warm, exotic smell but not flowery.  If I could get it in a perfume, I&#x27;d wear it every day!  I have spent a small fortune on various hair products and depending on your budget, this can seem a bit pricey for the amount but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  It lasts a long time.  My mom has been using the same 3.4oz bottle for over a year though as I said before, she has thin hair.  I, literally, have the amount of hair three average women do, plus it goes down to the middle of my back.  Between using it at least twice a day on my hands and arms plus a generous amount on my hair each morning, a bottle will last me about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can also be purchased at Sally Beauty supply, however, they charge $10.00 for the 3.4oz bottle.  I purchased the 8oz bottle for $13.00 here on Amazon.She likes it a lot as well.  Since using this I have been able to give up all of the other products (mousse, gel &amp; hairspray).

            <li> I love how this oil makes my hair feel and look.  However, I am sensitive to smells, so my eyes burn and itch.  I get congested and feel bad for a while when I use it.  I wish the product was made without scent.  But having said that, it makes my hair feel soft and look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I like this product but you need to use it very sparingly so you do not get your hair too greasy.  It does give my hair great shine.</li>
            <li> If I can get over the smell of this thing, then I&#x27;ll be able to use it long enough to see whether it really works. It feels like a highly decorated frizz-ease though. Eh</li>
            <li> very good,, woulld buy again at the right price. they should consider selling the spray. arrived very quickly. nice job.</li>
            <li> Good deal, cheaper than the Moroccan oil product and it works well. Sometimes there is build up on the scalp but much less than other oils I have tried. It&#x27;s light, moisturizing and smells good too!</li>
            <li> I have now ordered One &#x27;n Only Argan oil twice.  My daughters and I are very happy with it.  The price here on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat and the product works very well on our hair.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Nice and light only used once but overall its good stuff. Took some time to receive but I like it</li>
            <li> I noticed that the bottle had leaked a bit in transit. It would be great if the shipper would start taping the tops down. Although, I didn&#x27;t loose a lot, this product is so great that the lose of a drop is still too much.</li>
            <li> worth more to buy this brand</li>
            <li> This product is great for keeping your hair silky and it is a good heat protectant. It does not weigh your hair down like other oils.</li>
            <li> Great product for those of you that have very curly hair as I do! It gives our hair the moisture it needs for pretty curls and no frizz.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair non frizzy, shiny, and smelling great. Not as strong smelling as the CVS stocked brand. Just use a tiny amound on dry areas. I don&#x27;t use it around my face or top of my hair because it can make it look greasy. Works well with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> We use this on my 4 year old son&#x27;s hair.  It smells great and is light enough to just brush and go.</li>
            <li> I have only used a little of this because I wanted to finish using another product first, but it is great for natural hair! I have put my other oils to the side and will be using this from now on! :)</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t stop DEMANDING a certain number of words, and refusing my submission until I provide the required number, I will NEVER rate anything again.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m totally in love with argan oil....the scent is amazing.  i use oil in the shower for my hair and also mist it with oil for moisture as well.  i even make leave ins with shea butter amongst other oils, but this is prob my fav to put in.  the scent alone is a must have, and it makes you hair feel great so how could you turn it down?</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as advertised. I am a regular user of Argan Oil, it gives my hair the body and a nice silky finish without making the hair greasy.</li>
            <li> It was really good the performance of thos item in my salon, i hope the shipment fee will be lessen because the shipment fee is 3 times cost to the actual product price.</li>
            <li> I used this along with my pre-poo in cleaning my hair and it has been wonderful! My hair feels great and smells wonderful! I only have to use a small amount. A little goes a long way. Great must have in hair and skin care</li>
            <li> Great value for money, and the smell is delightful.  I have very dry coarse hair, and this product leaves it feel moisturized and silky, without feeling heavy and sticky.  I love the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> it worked for my daughters hair</li>
            <li> The best. I have been natural all my life. I love it because it&#x27;s light and not heavy like most greases I used before. I wear a lot of half wigs because that natural life  in my opinion is hard to deal with specially in the summer. I always have a leave out of my hair in the front and when i use this product my hair blend 100% with the wigs. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have a nice grade of hair anyways but i have used other Argan oils and none work. ONE N ONLY Brand  is the only on that works correctly for my thick hair. PS in the stores here in VA it&#x27;s $20 for the smallest size. Amazon got me the biggest for the same price.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about using this product because it seemed thick and greasy, but decided to give it a try after a friend of mine raved about it.  I use a dime-size amount in my medium-length type 4a relaxed hair every morning. I absorbs well and leaves a healthy, non-greasy shine to my hair.  The price here is the best on the internet.</li>
            <li> Simply irresistible!!, I really love how it works on my hair, it leaves it shinny and silky. I tried a lot of different products but nothing compare to this. It worked with my pocket too... I highly recommend it &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> awesome for the price and work beautifully on my hair...</li>
            <li> Great Value &amp; Optimum Supply Time</li>
            <li> Go ahead and touch it. You know you want to. If you&#x27;re nice to me, I&#x27;ll rub my beard across your shoulders, marking you as my territory.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair looks beautiful and smells so good. She tried a small sample of this at a beauty saloon and now uses it on her hair regularly. Great product and reasonably priced. Buy it!</li>
            <li> i love this oil. it smells great. i use it in my hair and on my face. i have definitely noticed a difference in my skin since using this product. my skin is  smoother and i am not breaking out as much. i have very bad acne prone skin and this oil has helped keep the pimples from popping up as much as they once did.</li>
            <li> This item has a wonderful smell, but left my hair extremely greasy feeling unlike other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product! However, I would not recommend using this if you are in a hurry. It takes time and patience, and if you cut yourself short...the result will depress you &#x3D;( I only use a couple of drops warmed in my hands...then I gently pat and finger comb, separating small chunks of hair as I go along. It&#x27;s so important to focus on the ends and work up lightly. I don&#x27;t go near my roots. I use more as needed to achieve my amazing curls. It does not take much. I have the 8 oz bottle...it&#x27;s not even half gone, and I have had it almost a year. It&#x27;s worth the effort...my hair goes from frizzy carrot top to soft, bouncy, and has a healthy appearance  within minutes.</li>
            <li> Oil treatment not only keeps the frizzys away, it smells great and does not feel heavy or greasy. I use it daily for styling after washing with One N Only Argan Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just like the title says I never used it since I have another hair product that I&#x27;m using right now which kind of serves the same purpose.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and am pleased with it.  I have always had dry, coarse hair.  It helps my gray hair that is coming in.</li>
            <li> I have used this or product before and I am still pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product with the purchase of a new curling iron.  I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I have a thyroid condition which causes my hair to look dry, frizzy and straw-like.  I&#x27;ve searched and searched for different shampoos to use to try and make my health look healthy and shiny, but to no avail.  The first time I tried this, my hair was soft, shiny and in control.  So I found it online and bought it.  I will be using this product for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and have tried other brands but always come back to this one.  I love the smell and feel of my hair on this.  So glad I found it on Amazon cheaper!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. Leaves hair shiny but not greasy. It&#x27;s a lovely oil. Will buy again and again. Fully satisfactied with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product; I have been using it for about a year now.  It makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have super curly hair and I love it. I don&#x27;t use it by itself, I use it along with Finesse mousse. But it works great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Have been using it for years and couldn&#x27;t live without anymore. I have very long, wavy, rebellious, weather-dependent, defiant, dry locks, but I use it on damp hair and it works wonders. It leaves my hair shiny and soft, with my curls becoming somewhat manageable and delicate (vs. curling every way possible and looking like haywire). And the smell alone is worth the price... delicate and fragrant, without being too overpowering, sweet or with a hint of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Way too heavily perfumed!  No refund once opened - ad should state whether it is scented/unscented.  Will not order again.  Smelled like really cheap perfume!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/frizzy hair and have searched for a product for years to help tame the frizz. My boyfriend who has similar hair told me about this product which I was excited to try. In only a few weeks the frizz is finally being tamed! I have added this oil to my favorites list of hair products.</li>
            <li> well my hair is nice and soft since i being using this product easy too comb my hair and feels good yes i buy this again</li>
            <li> I love this product with my hair dryer and straightener.  I purchased this item over a year ago, and I&#x27;m still using the same bottle and I use it every other day.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a cheaper alternative to Moroccan Oil, which I love but I must face it, I have a lot of hair and $64 bucks for a 6.8 oz bottle really hurts. This smells the same -and it works. I like to use it as a sealer</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel. No frizz and it helps it grow. You only need a small amount too</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of oil before and this time purchased from Amazon when my previous stock finished.&lt;br /&gt;I colour my hair frequently and this Argan Oil Treatment puts the shine back in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it !!</li>
            <li> My wife usually uses Morrocan Oil.  She decided to try this since the cost was unbelievably reasonable when compared with the Morrocan Oil she was using.  She is quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, leaving your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I use this with lotion everyday on my hands and a bit of it with my hair gel and I love how my hair feels so much softer then before. I love it. This stuff doesnt smell bad and feels good on your skin. It&#x27;s not all greasy. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This product is soooooo  great!! first night using it I woke up and my hair felt like silk.  I have loose curls and it gets frizzy sometimes but this works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came within 4 days regular mail!</li>
            <li> This is just what I need for my very dry hair. It makes it manageable without being too oily. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I originally got a tiny bottle free with my flat iron purchase. I really liked how it took the frizz away and made my hair soft and not oily. so i looked at amazon to find the exact same product. i found it at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product, leave my hair in a really good shape. Super happy!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and delivery was handled well so in all good experience.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my hair , make it shiny and look very healthy, I always use it, I always get compliments!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve bought this one for years. Doesn&#x27;t have a rancid smell and gives a nice sheen to the hair.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at Sallys but found it for half the price right here!!!!  And I received it within 2-3 days!  I hope they keep it bc I&#x27;m a repeat customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia Parker</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this item. I absolutely love this Argan Oil. I use it after every shower on my damp hair. It helps to detangle it and it smells awesome. I also use it before bed so that I am adding that extra moisture to my hair overnight so when I wake up, my hair is easier to brush.</li>
            <li> EXELLENTE, LA ENTREGA FUE EN TIEMPO RECORD</li>
            <li> Yuck. Very poor in comparision to pure argan oil. (Guess who DIDN&#x27;T read the ingredient list first!)&lt;br /&gt;Coats the outside of the hair shaft instead of penetrating like argan oil. Hair is dry and frizzy again within hours.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I still like Morroccan oil brand better but it&#x27;s 3X the price. This is wayyyyy more oily but if you don&#x27;t use too much it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so wonderful. It is silky and smooth.  Whats not to like?  I keep a bottle handy all the time.</li>
            <li> Love love this oil i use it as an after shower body oil keeps my skin warm and soft. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d reccomend this to anyone. The smell is beautigul and it leave a light sheen to the hair. I like it! I love it!</li>
            <li> Oil is silky and it does have a pleasant smell.  Not exactly what I am looking for, but comes half-way.</li>
