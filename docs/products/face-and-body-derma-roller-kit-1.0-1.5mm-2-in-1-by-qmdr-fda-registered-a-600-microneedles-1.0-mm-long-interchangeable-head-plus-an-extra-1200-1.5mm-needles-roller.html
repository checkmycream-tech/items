            <li>Ok but squeaks.&lt;br /&gt;I had this one week and did as instructions statedvabout disinfecting it after use.&lt;br /&gt;Started squeezing when rolling</li>
            <li>Pleased with product and seller 110%</li>
            <li>This is what they use in the doctors offices and charge $$$$&#x27;s for it, just make sure you follow the instructions provided.</li>
            <li>The more I use this the more I like it.</li>
            <li>It gets easier the more you use it.</li>

            <li>I decided though that if I thoroughly read through the instructions, as well as some of the reviews, it would be ok</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t test this on my face first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually bought this for my daughter as I already have the face one for myself and was impressed with the quality of the QMD roller.</li>
            <li>So when the company offered for me to try their newest product free of charge in exchange for my honest opinion, I wholeheartedly agreed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This roller is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and my skin was so much better for it.</li>
            <li>The one used for the body is wider to cover more surface area.  </li>
            <li>I love that it works...</li>
            <li>I love that this one is FDA registered</li>
            <li>I was glad I got the chance to test this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I ordered the QMD Derma Roller Kit.</li>
            <li>This is much more convenient doing at home myself and not spending money on peels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m feeling better again and will start using it again.  </li>
            <li>I am highly pleased with this product and bloodletting is not manatory to achieving results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to receive this for free, and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Still, I am going to try it once a week for 3  more times.  </li>
            <li>very useful, it is amazing</li>
            <li>Learning how to use this, but so far great results</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you use it and it is kind of fun.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, QMD will send you an email that has instructions that are easy to read and understand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>process was easy once I started.  </li>
            <li>The roller is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice quality and came in fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I didnt think it would actuallyy help fine lines</li>
            <li>I use organic, paraben free products on my skin and my husband couldn&#x27;t stop complementing me on how my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would make a nice gift, as the packaging on this is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This got me excited.</li>
            <li>I love this item I didnt understand what it was for at first</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this Derma Roller is that it is FDA registered, witch makes me feel confident to use it.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>i noticed significant improvement  </li>
            <li>This one has more needles and looked nicer, but they don&#x27;t seem to roll as smoothly or penetrate as much, so I think the 600 needle titanium one is preferred.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is not painful unless you want the pain.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted this product to work like it seems to for so many</li>
            <li>So far loving the product.  </li>
            <li>already and this is the first one that ships with another roller head that can be easily swapped.  </li>
            <li>This is what happens when you laugh and smile a lot!</li>
            <li>Consider me a life-long loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much!</li>
            <li>After my first use, the whole texture of my face looked so much better after the redness went away overnight.  </li>
            <li>I love this item, but the draw back is I thought there would be more intense, almost like a massage with heat</li>
            <li>Very simple to use and handy.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the wait, though.</li>
            <li>also comes with a clear case to protect the needles from touching any surface.  </li>
            <li>we started using this for the scaring right away...</li>
            <li>It’s easily one of my favorite beauty products, highly recommended for anyone who needs an extra boost in their appearance – be it large pores, scars, stretch marks, or even balding.</li>
            <li>Qualizzi Night&amp;Day followed up with me about my satisfaction with this product which I appreciate very much.</li>
            <li>Great roller , you can&#x27;t press too hard or you will bleed or leave marks like scrapes on your face .</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am pretty amazed.</li>
            <li>however I have used it a couple of times and it really works!  </li>
            <li>Too many reviews and not enough proof.</li>
            <li>I love that this comes with two heads so that I don&#x27;t have to buy 2 different rollers for my body and face.</li>
            <li>have had stretch marks for years and am hopeful that I will see a lot of improvement after using this consistently, once a month.  </li>
            <li>While I have only been able to use this once, it does seem like I have already seen some improvement in the noticeability of the marks.  </li>
            <li>The company’s products are always high-quality and work exactly as described.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>These lengths are not for first time users.  </li>
            <li>I suggest getting a 0.5 mm first before trying the longer ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first thought I was like ummm no</li>
            <li>This product scared me at first.  </li>
            <li>This roller is Ok, but it doesn&#x27;t roll as fluidly as the cheaper Derma Roller I bought.</li>
            <li>The lines have definitely become much shallower around my eyes, and the marionette lines have evened out and are not too prominent at all.</li>
            <li>The large roller doesn&#x27;t roll well.</li>
            <li>The large one cut up my thighs , tried to use for cellulite ...</li>
            <li>There is only slight discomfort (mostly on my forehead where the skin is most taut) and in face</li>
            <li>I am using the large roller for my stomach stretch marks, and it really works.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even get to complete my first treatment and this product is already malfunctioning!</li>
            <li>this very day, I am mortified ..</li>
            <li>The body attachment does not roll very well and it scrapes.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely wonderful.......especially for the price...remember your derma roller must be stainless steel .... hospital grade</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit in the case but the smaller roller for the face does.</li>
            <li>It takes time for the real benefits to become noticeable because rebuilding collagen takes a while.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days it really didn&#x27;t seem as though I&#x27;ve done anything to my skin.</li>
            <li>Like there&#x27;s too much friction.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you follow the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li>Please be sure to read the directions carefully before you start.  </li>
            <li>The derma roller arrive very timely.</li>
            <li>The roller is very well made and I&#x27;m getting quicker at using it.</li>
            <li>I did have problems with the larger roller not rolling freely but upon contacting the vendor my problem was immediately resolved.  </li>
            <li>I think my pain level is a little higher than most.</li>
            <li>The pain did not last more than a day or two, but enough to be aware of it</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I are fans of the roller needle things and were excited to find a wider tool to expedite the discomfort but this thing doesn&#x27;t roll properly.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older I have seen the effects that age has taken on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see the results over the long term.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>After using it a few times, I did notice that the morning afterwards, my skin looked more moisturized and clearer.</li>
            <li>We normally used this together with Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I highly recommend you test it on the back of your hand first to see how your skin reacts.</li>
            <li>It is a little painful but not bad at all, no pain, no gain and you can do this on your own applying what is tolerable for you in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li>I nearly scrapped off a layer of my skin when I realized the roller was no longer moving!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure on it when using it your first time, not until you know how your skin will react and then you can adjust the pressure to what you like, Your face will be red after using it</li>
            <li>, however, it was not painful in the initial use, the pain and burning came later and itching when the creams were applied.</li>
            <li>Small head has a better (smoother) rolling action.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the large one on my body.  </li>
            <li>I think everyone who uses a derma roller system will like the variety that this one offers.</li>
            <li>It allowed my facial products to absorb much deeper</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>o WOW--</li>
            <li>I did this also when I was getting professional peels.</li>
            <li>It does sting ad burn for a few hours after you use it... totally worth it!</li>
            <li>derma roller is definitely doing something because a few weeks later, things are already looking better.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because of the minor skin discomfort but after my 1st use, I was totally amazed!!!!!</li>
            <li>I use on a night when I don&#x27;t have to go anywhere the next day because my fair skin gets a little red and raw</li>
            <li>This little amount of pain is so worth it</li>
            <li>Using it regularly helps to keep my facial pores tight, my under eye bags in check, and my skin glowing and smooth.</li>
            <li>If my face looks worse, well, that&#x27;ll sure suck.  </li>
            <li>( I only use at night makes face too red) put Vitamin C serum to cool down ..</li>
            <li>due to my skin damage, I will have to see a licensed dermatologist for much needed help.</li>
            <li>My 20 year old daughter had really back back acne..</li>
            <li>but I tested it out on my hand first and got these little hives that were itchy.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, I was a little hesitant at first to even agree to review this product because of the needles.  </li>
            <li>You can use a small bottle spray filled with concentrated alcohol and then dry it with a hair dryer before using the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>After an unfortunate accident broke my original derma roller, I knew I had to get a new one!</li>
            <li>I particularly like this roller system because it has a larger head for use on other parts of my body.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you use it and it is kind of fun.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, QMD will send you an email that has instructions that are easy to read and understand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> process was easy once I started.  </li>
            <li> The roller is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and came in fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I didnt think it would actuallyy help fine lines</li>
            <li> I use organic, paraben free products on my skin and my husband couldn&#x27;t stop complementing me on how my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would make a nice gift, as the packaging on this is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li> But so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This got me excited.</li>
            <li> I love this item I didnt understand what it was for at first</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this Derma Roller is that it is FDA registered, witch makes me feel confident to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> i noticed significant improvement  </li>
            <li> This one has more needles and looked nicer, but they don&#x27;t seem to roll as smoothly or penetrate as much, so I think the 600 needle titanium one is preferred.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is not painful unless you want the pain.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted this product to work like it seems to for so many</li>
            <li> So far loving the product.  </li>
            <li> already and this is the first one that ships with another roller head that can be easily swapped.  </li>
            <li> This is what happens when you laugh and smile a lot!</li>
            <li> Consider me a life-long loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much!</li>
            <li> After my first use, the whole texture of my face looked so much better after the redness went away overnight.  </li>
            <li> I love this item, but the draw back is I thought there would be more intense, almost like a massage with heat</li>
            <li> Very simple to use and handy.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the wait, though.</li>
            <li> also comes with a clear case to protect the needles from touching any surface.  </li>
            <li> we started using this for the scaring right away...</li>
            <li> It’s easily one of my favorite beauty products, highly recommended for anyone who needs an extra boost in their appearance – be it large pores, scars, stretch marks, or even balding.</li>
            <li> Qualizzi Night&amp;Day followed up with me about my satisfaction with this product which I appreciate very much.</li>
            <li> Great roller , you can&#x27;t press too hard or you will bleed or leave marks like scrapes on your face .</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pretty amazed.</li>
            <li> however I have used it a couple of times and it really works!  </li>
            <li> Too many reviews and not enough proof.</li>
            <li> I love that this comes with two heads so that I don&#x27;t have to buy 2 different rollers for my body and face.</li>
            <li> have had stretch marks for years and am hopeful that I will see a lot of improvement after using this consistently, once a month.  </li>
            <li> While I have only been able to use this once, it does seem like I have already seen some improvement in the noticeability of the marks.  </li>
            <li> The company’s products are always high-quality and work exactly as described.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> These lengths are not for first time users.  </li>
            <li> I suggest getting a 0.5 mm first before trying the longer ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first thought I was like ummm no</li>
            <li> This product scared me at first.  </li>
            <li> This roller is Ok, but it doesn&#x27;t roll as fluidly as the cheaper Derma Roller I bought.</li>
            <li> The lines have definitely become much shallower around my eyes, and the marionette lines have evened out and are not too prominent at all.</li>
            <li> The large roller doesn&#x27;t roll well.</li>
            <li> The large one cut up my thighs , tried to use for cellulite ...</li>
            <li> There is only slight discomfort (mostly on my forehead where the skin is most taut) and in face</li>
            <li> I am using the large roller for my stomach stretch marks, and it really works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to complete my first treatment and this product is already malfunctioning!</li>
            <li> this very day, I am mortified ..</li>
            <li> The body attachment does not roll very well and it scrapes.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful.......especially for the price...remember your derma roller must be stainless steel .... hospital grade</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fit in the case but the smaller roller for the face does.</li>
            <li> It takes time for the real benefits to become noticeable because rebuilding collagen takes a while.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days it really didn&#x27;t seem as though I&#x27;ve done anything to my skin.</li>
            <li> Like there&#x27;s too much friction.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you follow the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> Please be sure to read the directions carefully before you start.  </li>
            <li> The derma roller arrive very timely.</li>
            <li> The roller is very well made and I&#x27;m getting quicker at using it.</li>
            <li> I did have problems with the larger roller not rolling freely but upon contacting the vendor my problem was immediately resolved.  </li>
            <li> I think my pain level is a little higher than most.</li>
            <li> The pain did not last more than a day or two, but enough to be aware of it</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are fans of the roller needle things and were excited to find a wider tool to expedite the discomfort but this thing doesn&#x27;t roll properly.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older I have seen the effects that age has taken on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to see the results over the long term.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I did notice that the morning afterwards, my skin looked more moisturized and clearer.</li>
            <li> We normally used this together with Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I highly recommend you test it on the back of your hand first to see how your skin reacts.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful but not bad at all, no pain, no gain and you can do this on your own applying what is tolerable for you in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> I nearly scrapped off a layer of my skin when I realized the roller was no longer moving!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure on it when using it your first time, not until you know how your skin will react and then you can adjust the pressure to what you like, Your face will be red after using it</li>
            <li> , however, it was not painful in the initial use, the pain and burning came later and itching when the creams were applied.</li>
            <li> Small head has a better (smoother) rolling action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the large one on my body.  </li>
            <li> I think everyone who uses a derma roller system will like the variety that this one offers.</li>
            <li> It allowed my facial products to absorb much deeper</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> o WOW--</li>
            <li> I did this also when I was getting professional peels.</li>
            <li> It does sting ad burn for a few hours after you use it... totally worth it!</li>
            <li> derma roller is definitely doing something because a few weeks later, things are already looking better.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because of the minor skin discomfort but after my 1st use, I was totally amazed!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use on a night when I don&#x27;t have to go anywhere the next day because my fair skin gets a little red and raw</li>
            <li> This little amount of pain is so worth it</li>
            <li> Using it regularly helps to keep my facial pores tight, my under eye bags in check, and my skin glowing and smooth.</li>
            <li> If my face looks worse, well, that&#x27;ll sure suck.  </li>
            <li> ( I only use at night makes face too red) put Vitamin C serum to cool down ..</li>
            <li> due to my skin damage, I will have to see a licensed dermatologist for much needed help.</li>
            <li> My 20 year old daughter had really back back acne..</li>
            <li> but I tested it out on my hand first and got these little hives that were itchy.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, I was a little hesitant at first to even agree to review this product because of the needles.  </li>
            <li> You can use a small bottle spray filled with concentrated alcohol and then dry it with a hair dryer before using the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> After an unfortunate accident broke my original derma roller, I knew I had to get a new one!</li>
            <li> I particularly like this roller system because it has a larger head for use on other parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> In the past I tried Botox to reduce some wrinkles, but I have found that even with this treatment a few fine lines have been appearing.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that will conquer and destroy the stretch marks by stimulating new growth.</li>
            <li> But I really like the small roller.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough - the instructions say to use it every six weeks</li>
            <li> There are  no noticeable effects as of yet, as I stated previously- its too early for results.  </li>
            <li> One roller is for the face (the smaller one) and the other larger roller is for your body.</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t press it into my skin it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> look forward to the long term results of using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also researched after using the product that one time and there were a couple articles saying that using it frequently long term could result in premature aging/wrinkling.  </li>
            <li> It did cause some small bleeding the first few times.  </li>
            <li> Would like to know before and after pics of others who actually got &amp;#34;rid&amp;#34; of their dark spots from using this.</li>
            <li> I am not happy about this and very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> These are slower to respond, but after 7 daily treatments they already seem shallower, and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My skin does not easily puncture, so I would have to press pretty darn hard.</li>
            <li> It does leave the skins little red and the directions say you may want to stay out of the sun.  </li>
            <li> However the one for the body seems jammed and does roll soothly.</li>
            <li> I specifically refer to the wide attachment.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first that this would work.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a case of &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27;, but this roller doesn&#x27;t function properly.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the key to a painless procedure, I think, not to press hard.</li>
            <li> It never worked to help diminish the dark spot, not at all.</li>
            <li> Not good, it took 2 weeks for those to go away, it seems a bit cheap, in the way it was made, sorry guys, maybe cheep China made?</li>
            <li> I had rough areas on my cheeks and even a few spots of milia  </li>
            <li> I rolled up and down my leg vertically 10 times and then switched to horizontally 10 times.  </li>
            <li> It looks horrible.&lt;br /&gt;After desperately trying to bathe the affected areas with vitamin e, and various natural oils ..</li>
            <li> I have had horrible large pores my whole life, and this product has almost erased them!</li>
            <li> and there was redness and a little puffiness.</li>
            <li> I am hoping this little gadget will give me results soon.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results yet but that will take a little time.</li>
            <li> I never used a derma roller before and was a little worried, however after just a few times using the roller followed by vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> I used the narrow roller over it though it did not puncture skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with product but so far not seeing any results from using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using derma rollers for a few months now</li>
            <li> I have a few scars and for this I use the 1.5mm Body Roller Head.</li>
            <li> again,,,it&#x27;s burns your face for a few hours maybe overnight</li>
            <li> We had a few derma rollers (skin treatment for removing blemishes, scars, stretch marks, etc.)</li>
            <li> $18 bucks wasted.</li>
            <li> I feel the few times I used it</li>
            <li> The next day, if you were not too rough, your face should be a little pink but nothing too bad and it should go away as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s defective</li>
            <li> not sure I did not ck</li>
            <li> This product was received for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.were not too rough, your face should be a little pink but nothing too bad and it should go away as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> I tried it without puncturing the skin, though I did press hard and felt like it did go through a layer or two of skin, just not to draw blood.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t hardly feel them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the cover that comes with the body roller head, so I can at least have it protected when I store it away.</li>
            <li> At least that is what happened with me.</li>
            <li> At least that is what happened with me.</li>
            <li> The instructions that are included in the box are very small and hard to read but there are some instructions for using it on your face that are on the box, which is easier to read.</li>
            <li> I got this to help resurface an area on my cheek that has a large dark sun spot I HATE!.</li>
            <li> While I could feel the pokes, it wasn&#x27;t really painful; more of an annoying feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the little needles that they would hurt, but I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> my skin reacted terribly to the one time use of derma roller and left track marks, which caused my skin to ..blister .. burn, and whelped so badly  and became bruised and actually turned an unsightly black on an 8-10 inch area on my body.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> The 1.5 mm roller is very hard to roll...</li>
            <li> in that it made my skin condition is 10x&#x27;s worse than before..</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, it takes approximately 8 months to notice any difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> It looks a lot worse than what it is.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin looked worse that afternoon/evening.  </li>
            <li> I managed to make those ugly scars by using the derma roller less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m desperate</li>
            <li> I´m so afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> It is slowly taking away my bad acne bumps and making my skin skoother and its lowering my stretch marks as well!!</li>
            <li> If you do react badly then soak it in alcohol, like the instructions say and then try it again.</li>
            <li> Hurt real bad won&#x27;t do that area</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I could see results after 2 session! It is amazing!</li>
            <li> Learning how to use this, but so far great results</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first that this would work. But so far so good. I had deep wrinkles in my forehead and they are starting to diminish</li>
            <li> Nice quality and came in fast!</li>
            <li> I have just recently used your derma roller and cautiously followed your company&#x27;s directions.&lt;br /&gt;After using it .. my skin reacted terribly to the one time use of derma roller and left track marks, which caused my skin to ..blister .. burn, and whelped so badly  and became bruised and actually turned an unsightly black on an 8-10 inch area on my body.&lt;br /&gt;To this very day, I am mortified .. in that it made my skin condition is 10x&#x27;s worse than before.. and I soooo regret ever using that device.  It looks horrible.&lt;br /&gt;After desperately trying to bathe the affected areas with vitamin e, and various natural oils .. for 2 weeks... all to no avail ..due to my skin damage, I will have to see a licensed dermatologist for much needed help.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pretty amazed. I have had horrible large pores my whole life, and this product has almost erased them!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I never used a derma roller before and was a little worried, however after just a few times using the roller followed by vitamin C serum I began to see results. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this item, but the draw back is I thought there would be more intense, almost like a massage with heat but I have had microcurrent treatments done, so I think my pain level is a little higher than most. My face did stay red for a couple of days after. I would recommend this item the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star is because I have not used the body roller yet.</li>
            <li> I particularly like this roller system because it has a larger head for use on other parts of my body.  The derma roller when applied correctly will help your skin absorb moisture and look more youthful.  This was sold to me at a discount for my honest review.  I think everyone who uses a derma roller system will like the variety that this one offers.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using this roller.  Very simple to use and handy.</li>
            <li> I liked this a lot I tried diferent ones and this one doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, plus it comes with the extra size which is excellent for my tights</li>
            <li> I just received this derma roller yesterday afternoon. I started using the 1.5mm derma roller last night and only got to use it on one spot on my body before it stopped spinning or rolling. I nearly scrapped off a layer of my skin when I realized the roller was no longer moving! Ouch!!!!! I am not happy about this and very dissatisfied! I didn&#x27;t even get to complete my first treatment and this product is already malfunctioning! I will be contacting the seller regarding this product and asking for a refund! Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this!</li>
            <li> Ok but squeaks.&lt;br /&gt;I had this one week and did as instructions statedvabout disinfecting it after use.&lt;br /&gt;Started squeezing when rolling it.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The large roller doesn&#x27;t roll well. But I really like the small roller.</li>
            <li> The face roller is great, it does not hurt at all. The body attachment does not roll very well and it scrapes. Looks like a cat scratched me. Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough - the instructions say to use it every six weeks so I have about  4 weeks to go, however, it was not painful in the initial use, the pain and burning came later and itching when the creams were applied. The pain did not last more than a day or two, but enough to be aware of it and there was redness and a little puffiness. There are  no noticeable effects as of yet, as I stated previously- its too early for results.  The next time I use it, I will check back with your survey.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful.......especially for the price...remember your derma roller must be stainless steel .... hospital grade and this one is it!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much! My skin is smoother and healthier looking already!</li>
            <li> I didnt think it would actuallyy help fine lines however I have used it a couple of times and it really works!  It does sting ad burn for a few hours after you use it... totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I got this to help resurface an area on my cheek that has a large dark sun spot I HATE!. I used the narrow roller over it though it did not puncture skin. I tried it without puncturing the skin, though I did press hard and felt like it did go through a layer or two of skin, just not to draw blood. It never worked to help diminish the dark spot, not at all. I guess I would have to actually puncture the skin over it enough to draw blood in order for it to work, I don&#x27;t know, and I don&#x27;t even know if I want to do that since it&#x27;s on my face. My skin does not easily puncture, so I would have to press pretty darn hard. Ouch!!! Would like to know before and after pics of others who actually got &amp;#34;rid&amp;#34; of their dark spots from using this. Too many reviews and not enough proof. People don&#x27;t even keep up with updates as they say they would and makes me believe they gave up, that it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I am hoping this little gadget will give me results soon.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with product but so far not seeing any results from using it</li>
            <li> Arrived so soon. Great quality, great price, derma roller love it. Pleased with product and seller 110%</li>
            <li> I am using the large roller for my stomach stretch marks, and it really works. This is what they use in the doctors offices and charge $$$$&#x27;s for it, just make sure you follow the instructions provided. I finally found something that will conquer and destroy the stretch marks by stimulating new growth. It is a little painful but not bad at all, no pain, no gain and you can do this on your own applying what is tolerable for you in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> I love that this comes with two heads so that I don&#x27;t have to buy 2 different rollers for my body and face. This has both conveniently together. One roller is for the face (the smaller one) and the other larger roller is for your body. The instructions that are included in the box are very small and hard to read but there are some instructions for using it on your face that are on the box, which is easier to read. Furthermore, QMD will send you an email that has instructions that are easy to read and understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cover that comes with the body roller head, so I can at least have it protected when I store it away. It won&#x27;t fit in the case but the smaller roller for the face does. The more I use this the more I like it. You do need to have a very good vitamin C or E serum to use immediately afterwards, though. ALWAYS, soak in alcohol before using it on your face. I know that the product is supposed to come already sterile but I tested it out on my hand first and got these little hives that were itchy. Well, I did not want that to happen to my face so I soaked the Derma Roller in alcohol and then rinsed it well. Tried it again on my hand and this time I had no irritation at all. Therefore, I highly recommend you test it on the back of your hand first to see how your skin reacts. If you do react badly then soak it in alcohol, like the instructions say and then try it again. It made a great difference. Even if you do not have a reaction, you should still soak it in alcohol. After using it a few times, I did notice that the morning afterwards, my skin looked more moisturized and clearer. This got me excited. It helps that I am using a good serum as well. It gets easier the more you use it. Don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure on it when using it your first time, not until you know how your skin will react and then you can adjust the pressure to what you like, Your face will be red after using it so it is recommended that you only use it at night. The next day, if you were not too rough, your face should be a little pink but nothing too bad and it should go away as the day goes on. At least that is what happened with me. I have noticed that I seem to have more even skin color and my face seems to look more hydrated than before. I plan to continue to use this product and cannot wait to see if there are any more improvements, as I use this Derma Roller.

            <li> No way I&#x27;ll use titanium needles again. This just tore my skin and made no difference whatsoever.Sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using derma rollers for a few months now and I find myself recommending them all the time. It takes time for the real benefits to become noticeable because rebuilding collagen takes a while. Totally worth the wait, though. I use the 1.00 mm on my face and neck. I don&#x27;t use any numbing creams. As long as I don&#x27;t press it into my skin it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. That&#x27;s the key to a painless procedure, I think, not to press hard. And it still works. I have a few scars and for this I use the 1.5mm Body Roller Head. I managed to make those ugly scars by using the derma roller less noticeable. My pores have shrunk and my overall skin quality has improved.  In additional to derma roller I use a vitamin C and E, vitamin E, and and hyaluronic acid.  This product was provided to me in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, I was a little hesitant at first to even agree to review this product because of the needles.  I decided though that if I thoroughly read through the instructions, as well as some of the reviews, it would be ok and it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the larger head as I am working on stretch marks on my upper legs.  The larger head came in a sealed bag with a plastic cover that I can store it with it on so it keeps clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had stretch marks for years and am hopeful that I will see a lot of improvement after using this consistently, once a month.  While I have only been able to use this once, it does seem like I have already seen some improvement in the noticeability of the marks.  I have my fingers crossed that they will get lighter and lighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process was easy once I started.  I rolled up and down my leg vertically 10 times and then switched to horizontally 10 times.  While I could feel the pokes, it wasn&#x27;t really painful; more of an annoying feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This derma roller is definitely doing something because a few weeks later, things are already looking better.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what my legs look like come summer!</li>
            <li> I got this item to review off of s group...I love this item I didnt understand what it was for at first but not I do. It is slowly taking away my bad acne bumps and making my skin skoother and its lowering my stretch marks as well!!</li>
            <li> Not sure yet. I&#x27;ve only used once. After a couple of days it really didn&#x27;t seem as though I&#x27;ve done anything to my skin. I have acne prone skin that is quite scarred from years of acne. I&#x27;m desperate so I will keep at it. From what I&#x27;ve read, it takes approximately 8 months to notice any difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> The roller for the face works great. However the one for the body seems jammed and does roll soothly.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it she has no issues or pain unless she is working the forehead area.  I don&#x27;t know if this device works however it sounds like a touchier device LOL.</li>
            <li> Great roller , you can&#x27;t press too hard or you will bleed or leave marks like scrapes on your face . I do 14 xs ea direction on each area .. The large one cut up my thighs , tried to use for cellulite ...Hurt real bad won&#x27;t do that area again,,,it&#x27;s burns your face for a few hours maybe overnight ( I only use at night makes face too red) put Vitamin C serum to cool down .. I see a difference in my skin w/ crows feet especially w/ my facial scars from car accident ....Hope this helps 😀</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a case of &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27;, but this roller doesn&#x27;t function properly.  The barrel gets stuck and you end of dragging the needles across your skin, leaving scratches.  I&#x27;ve only tried the large one on my body.  Glad I didn&#x27;t test this on my face first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.B. Read the reviews on products, ignore the stars.</li>
            <li> Actually bought this for my daughter as I already have the face one for myself and was impressed with the quality of the QMD roller.</li>
            <li> this thing hurts - but it works! just be patient, I am smoother and smoother as the weeks go by...</li>
            <li> The 1.5 mm roller is very hard to roll... Like there&#x27;s too much friction. It scratches my skin when I try to roll it across. Not sure if it&#x27;s defective</li>
            <li> After an unfortunate accident broke my original derma roller, I knew I had to get a new one! So when the company offered for me to try their newest product free of charge in exchange for my honest opinion, I wholeheartedly agreed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I’m so glad I did! This roller is fantastic! It comes with two convenient heads, a smaller one for use on the face, and a larger one to help with cellulite on the body. Using it regularly helps to keep my facial pores tight, my under eye bags in check, and my skin glowing and smooth. It’s easily one of my favorite beauty products, highly recommended for anyone who needs an extra boost in their appearance – be it large pores, scars, stretch marks, or even balding. Consider me a life-long loyal customer. The company’s products are always high-quality and work exactly as described. Just be sure to read the instructions fully before use!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Derma Roller after it was recommended by my friend.  In the past I tried Botox to reduce some wrinkles, but I have found that even with this treatment a few fine lines have been appearing. This is what happens when you laugh and smile a lot! ;) I must say that after using 1,0 needle size 3 times per week, for two weeks my skin looks incredible. The lines have definitely become much shallower around my eyes, and the marionette lines have evened out and are not too prominent at all. The reason I purchased this derma roller is that this one has 1.5mm Body Roller Head. I have stretchmarks and I use 1.5mm head for it. These are slower to respond, but after 7 daily treatments they already seem shallower, and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw a demonstration about this on YouTube. I did some research about this procedure and went ahead and purchased this dermaroller. I was hesitant at first because of the minor skin discomfort but after my 1st use, I was totally amazed!!!!! My skin looked so good and was so smooth after just the 1st use. It allowed my facial products to absorb much deeper and my skin was so much better for it. I use organic, paraben free products on my skin and my husband couldn&#x27;t stop complementing me on how my skin looked and felt. This little amount of pain is so worth it so take the risk!</li>
            <li> We had a few derma rollers (skin treatment for removing blemishes, scars, stretch marks, etc.) already and this is the first one that ships with another roller head that can be easily swapped.  These are 1.0 mm (for face) and 1.5 mm (for body) length needles. The one used for the body is wider to cover more surface area.  These lengths are not for first time users.  I suggest getting a 0.5 mm first before trying the longer ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually you get to notice results around 2 weeks (doing it 2 to 3 session days a week).  We normally used this together with Vitamin C serum.  Derma-rollers are also used by men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not forget to disinfect the needles before and after each use. You can use a small bottle spray filled with concentrated alcohol and then dry it with a hair dryer before using the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a clear case to protect the needles from touching any surface.  I rate the overall construction as 8 out 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was provided for this review.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised and the vendor provides excellent follow up with the instructions.  Just be sure you follow the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> My 20 year old daughter had really back back acne.. we started using this for the scaring right away... WOW o WOW-- I loved that I was given the opportunity to try it for my review because I would have never thought to try one.. I love that it works... At first thought I was like ummm no but then I read up on them and said heck yea... I see a noticeable difference in the last 2 days doing it once a day... I love that this one is FDA registered makes me feel safer... Great product for those with scaring you want to work on...</li>
            <li> This product scared me at first.  It looks a lot worse than what it is.  Please be sure to read the directions carefully before you start.  I was glad I got the chance to test this product.  The roller is easy to use. It did cause some small bleeding the first few times.  It is similar to the same procedure you get at the dermatologist.  I would use it in a night when you are not going anywhere the next day.  It does leave the skins little red and the directions say you may want to stay out of the sun.  I am very pleased with the results and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> very useful, it is amazing</li>
            <li> The derma roller arrive very timely. I have used this for two weeks now. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you use it and it is kind of fun. I have not seen any results yet but that will take a little time. I will write again in a month to report results.</li>
            <li> Scratched my skin! I may have gotten a dud, but I will be trying a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> Ok this product was not so good. I used the attachment for the legs and it left scratches. Not good, it took 2 weeks for those to go away, it seems a bit cheap, in the way it was made, sorry guys, maybe cheep China made? not sure I did not ck</li>
            <li> After you buy it they tell you to see a doctor to use it.  I&#x27;m scared to even use it.  $18 bucks wasted.</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered the QMD Derma Roller Kit. I have used the 1.0mm three times and believe I&#x27;m seeing results as pores look smaller and skin looks healthier on my late-50s face. I use on a night when I don&#x27;t have to go anywhere the next day because my fair skin gets a little red and raw so I prefer not to be in the sun the next day. I did this also when I was getting professional peels. This is much more convenient doing at home myself and not spending money on peels. Also using on my hands and arms and believe I am seeing results in collagen formation. I will keep using this product. The roller is very well made and I&#x27;m getting quicker at using it. Qualizzi Night&amp;Day followed up with me about my satisfaction with this product which I appreciate very much. I would order from them again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome seller! Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Highly recommend. Visible changes to texture of face after a week.</li>
            <li> I have used it three times since receiving it then I got the flu and haven&#x27;t used it since.  I&#x27;m feeling better again and will start using it again.  I feel the few times I used it I could see a difference.  I didn&#x27;t draw any blood but it reddened my face and tummy.  I use with a collagen cream and switch off and on with a vitamin c, retanol formula.  I did have problems with the larger roller not rolling freely but upon contacting the vendor my problem was immediately resolved.  I am highly pleased with this product and bloodletting is not manatory to achieving results.  It is not painful unless you want the pain.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and had to try it out immediately.  As I have gotten older I have seen the effects that age has taken on my skin.  The first thing I noticed about this Derma Roller is that it is FDA registered, witch makes me feel confident to use it.  I was a little worried about the little needles that they would hurt, but I was wrong!  You can&#x27;t hardly feel them.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this particular model is that it comes with TWO separate heads for the roller.  I personally love that feature! look forward to the long term results of using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a nice gift, as the packaging on this is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to receive this for free, and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are fans of the roller needle things and were excited to find a wider tool to expedite the discomfort but this thing doesn&#x27;t roll properly. It feels like it is dragging on skin. I specifically refer to the wide attachment. We didn&#x27;t use the smaller one, as we both already have that size...</li>
            <li> This roller is Ok, but it doesn&#x27;t roll as fluidly as the cheaper Derma Roller I bought. This one has more needles and looked nicer, but they don&#x27;t seem to roll as smoothly or penetrate as much, so I think the 600 needle titanium one is preferred.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this after reading the reviews.  After my first use, the whole texture of my face looked so much better after the redness went away overnight.  However, my skin looked worse that afternoon/evening.  I was planning on using it up to 3 times per week, but from what I&#x27;ve read you should only use it once per month!  Still, I am going to try it once a week for 3  more times.  If my face looks worse, well, that&#x27;ll sure suck.  I also researched after using the product that one time and there were a couple articles saying that using it frequently long term could result in premature aging/wrinkling.  I&#x27;m bummed because I don&#x27;t want to take that risk and I really wanted this product to work like it seems to for so many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I used the roller for a second time just 2 days ago  I&#x27;m impressed!  I had rough areas on my cheeks and even a few spots of milia  I used the roller and before the redness was even gone i noticed significant improvement  it also has diminished some acne scarring!  There is only slight discomfort (mostly on my forehead where the skin is most taut) and in face it&#x27;s a kind of \\&quot;hurts so good\\&quot; sensation lol.  I actually like the feel of it rolling, knowing it is actually improving my skin with each stroke.  I intend to get one from my son who has a lot of acne scarring.</li>
            <li> Great product. As advertised</li>
            <li> Small head has a better (smoother) rolling action.</li>
            <li> I´m so afraid to use it. It has a lot of warnings they dont say in the product description or in the reviews.</li>
            <li> So far loving the product.  I am excited to see the results over the long term.</li>
