            <li>Everything was great!!!</li>
            <li>great product if you have tattoo are going to be in the sun  </li>
            <li>I use this for my tattoo and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Size isn&#x27;t huge but this stuff goes on great.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;t truly recommend the product unless the pricing was more fair for the size of the container.</li>
            <li>Really liked it.</li>
            <li>The best sunscreen I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t wash or sweat right off.  </li>
            <li>I burn very easily</li>
            <li>The product is fine, H2Ocean makes good products.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time that I ever used this product I am really happy with it</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen to use for your tattoos, although you can you just plain zinc oxide and that works just as good.</li>
            <li>this is a great sunscreen will save your tattoos from getting dark and save them from uv rays that ruin them.</li>
            <li>so I think its worth it.</li>
            <li>and I will &amp;#34;ditto&amp;#34;, a must for every beach bag or put it in your cooler before you head off to your sun and fun destination.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to risk my kids getting sunburn when it didn&#x27;t look right</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s of average quality with nothing truly amazing just more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>However, it only had two more months of shelf life when I recieved the product, this should have been checked by Amazon.</li>
            <li>kept my tattoos safe in the key west sun for a week</li>
            <li>the blues and aqua greens have for the most part stayed the same color once the healing process was completed.  </li>
            <li>Invest your money in a more generic sunscreen that can perform the same task just because a bottle label says for tattoos ( which is known as advertising) don&#x27;t let that trick you into thinking your spoiling your tattoo with fancy stuff</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, a little dab will do you.  </li>
            <li>like every other H2Ocean product, this works fine, I used it during summer this year</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I always had trouble finding a sun screen that wouldn&#x27;t come off easily</li>
            <li>I am glad that I bought the kit plus one extra moisturizer I have quite a few tattoos</li>
            <li>Having a 1/2 sleeve, 1/2 leg and various other places - it&#x27;s important to protect your investment but alway protect what your living with the rest of your life.  </li>
            <li>Really dug this stuff, application can be a bit messy as it&#x27;s from a jar and the lotion doesn&#x27;t have much volume.</li>
            <li>I apply this first and let it set a few minutes before apply the mass amounts of sunscreen to the rest of me.  </li>

            <li> Size isn&#x27;t huge but this stuff goes on great. A lil dab of this stuff goes a bit further then the run of the mill sun screen.</li>
            <li> I love this product but hate how small it is and that it&#x27;s not in a squeeze tube. I always made a mess of my hands and nails.</li>
            <li> Product is small and rather expensive, your truly paying for the name more than anything else it&#x27;s of average quality with nothing truly amazing just more natural ingredients. I would&#x27;t truly recommend the product unless the pricing was more fair for the size of the container. Invest your money in a more generic sunscreen that can perform the same task just because a bottle label says for tattoos ( which is known as advertising) don&#x27;t let that trick you into thinking your spoiling your tattoo with fancy stuff this is overpriced and just another sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, H2Ocean makes good products.  However, it only had two more months of shelf life when I recieved the product, this should have been checked by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really dug this stuff, application can be a bit messy as it&#x27;s from a jar and the lotion doesn&#x27;t have much volume. When it dries, though, it doesn&#x27;t look like I have glue on my arms like the tattoo renew from Tattoo Goo. Really liked it.</li>
            <li> kept my tattoos safe in the key west sun for a week</li>
            <li> great product if you have tattoo are going to be in the sun  this is a great sunscreen will save your tattoos from getting dark and save them from uv rays that ruin them.</li>
            <li> I use this for my tattoo and it works great.  It is a small container but you get a lot for the price.  People have said its overpriced but it is especially made for tattoos so I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I use this on my face everyday for sun protection without any problems at all</li>
            <li> like every other H2Ocean product, this works fine, I used it during summer this year and i don&#x27;t have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> I received this product and the styrofoam sealed lid was broken. The product itself was separated and wouldn&#x27;t mix. I didn&#x27;t want to risk my kids getting sunburn when it didn&#x27;t look right so I didn&#x27;t use it. Maybe I received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Everything was great!!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time that I ever used this product I am really happy with it I am glad that I bought the kit plus one extra moisturizer I have quite a few tattoos so therefore I use it on all of them</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t wash or sweat right off.  Order 2.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, a little dab will do you.  I apply this first and let it set a few minutes before apply the mass amounts of sunscreen to the rest of me.  I&#x27;ve been tanning since may and the blues and aqua greens have for the most part stayed the same color once the healing process was completed.  Having a 1/2 sleeve, 1/2 leg and various other places - it&#x27;s important to protect your investment but alway protect what your living with the rest of your life.  My hats off to the stuff, I was recommended by the local shop and I will &amp;#34;ditto&amp;#34;, a must for every beach bag or put it in your cooler before you head off to your sun and fun destination.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars due to its tiny size.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I use less than the size of a penny for both of y medium sized tattoos.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen to use for your tattoos, although you can you just plain zinc oxide and that works just as good. But the sea life stays on longer. I burn very easily and I always had trouble finding a sun screen that wouldn&#x27;t come off easily and I wouldn&#x27;t have to re apply every 30 minutes. With this you can use it all over and it works fantastically. Bottom line, I would recommend this to anyone, tattooed or not!</li>
            <li> I can only give it one star</li>
