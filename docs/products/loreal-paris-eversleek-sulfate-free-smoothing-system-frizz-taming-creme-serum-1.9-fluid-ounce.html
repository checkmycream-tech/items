    <ol>
            <li>Your curls deserve the best and this EverSleek product is it!</li>
            <li>Product is great!</li>
            <li>Excellent seller &amp; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but L&#x27;oreal is the best.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great though.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for humid climates.</li>
            <li>It is great for curly hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly well for me, no freeze ,good volume and nice shine.highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It said it was good.  </li>
            <li>Also, it gave my hair good shine.  </li>
            <li>Now on weekdays when Im just running around with the kids and errands, I just put two squirts in my hair and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and curly hair, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for great frizz-tamer products.  </li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t see myself changing products ever again!  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that the mainstream popular drugstore companies have listened to us screaming for some silicone free products</li>
            <li>Good ingredients that get the job done even in the most humid conditions.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found for controlling my very frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>this is good if you want something to finish your style, or smooth hair that slides out of a ponytail.</li>
            <li>and my curls are frizz free and for two days!  </li>
            <li>Nothing grand.</li>
            <li>What more needs to be said?  </li>
            <li>This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free too!</li>
            <li>so I almost never have to do that, unless I want a more \\&quot;done\\&quot; look for parties and events.</li>
            <li>but it feels more like gel</li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first use, i used all three products (shampoo, conditioner, serum) and I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have got such great results!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and serums have always been too greasy for my hair.  </li>
            <li>These products are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I can really use this as a leave in conditioner and styling product just on its own.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>i was expecting it to be non sticky and smooth but isnt...</li>
            <li>This line is really great for my daughter with Blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I use this though I have really noticed that my hair looks better and more in control.  </li>
            <li>The shampoos and conditioners of this line are great but stick to the professional styling products that really perform!</li>
            <li>the Garnier Pure Clean Cr&amp;egrave;me much better, but</li>
            <li>and I had to apply more than usual but who cares if you have to use more product when you have amazing results???</li>
            <li>A lot less fly aways.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe the results, my hair is soooooo shiny, soft, manageable, not greasy at all, not weighted down, just amazing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I quickly gloss over the top of my head trying not to get it near my part.  </li>
            <li>It make my hair smooth and stay curly for whole day.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Smooth Frizz-Free Serum, Rosemary Mint 1.7 oz (50 ml) and L&#x27;oreal Precious Oil Treatment with Argan Oil, 3.9 Fluid Ounce.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li>Its not terrible, and I usually flat iron it quickly and its gone, but I worry about the damage the heat styling is doing.</li>
            <li>I have found better products to control my \\&quot;white girl\\&quot; frizz.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and tried it for the first time yesterday and my hair was noticeably smoother and easier to style.</li>
            <li>The cream aspect makes hair feel crunchy until brushed, but does brush out OK.  </li>
            <li>It REALLY helps!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27; t think it&#x27;s phenomenal enough to buy again.</li>
            <li>I have been using this daily for a week now and my hair is softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair feels soft and frizz free for 2 days.</li>
            <li>all together,  the first time I used the defying leaving cream</li>
            <li>I could tell immediately that this product was like many others I have tried that have ended up in the same place--the rubbish bin.</li>
            <li>Some people have mentioned a strong odor, I personally didn&#x27;t find it to be that strong, but if you are sensitive to perfumes in your hair products you might want to see if you can try this from a friend before you buy it.</li>
            <li>I have tried other Keratin products, but this is far superior.</li>
            <li>I have tried every product under the sun cheap and expensive but EverSleek products are amazing!  </li>
            <li>I bought this to help with dry, winter, static hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this product, works like a dream, but it&#x27;s getting hard to find it in stores.</li>
            <li>No silicones and very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I had to write a review since this product really works</li>
            <li>This product really does what it promises - it tames your hair.  </li>
            <li>This product really did the trick on my wavy, frizzy, bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>Very sticky in the hair.</li>
            <li>BUT it is FAR better than the last 2 serums L&#x27;Oreal has come out with ...</li>
            <li>good news is that L&#x27;Oreal makes two other products I really DO like, each of which leave the hair feeling soft and silky, and which keep curls soft and sleek:</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it is a standalone product, without any other useful properties, such as being a mousse or gel, so to use it is just to add one more step to beauty routines.</li>
            <li>It is still slightly frizzy but looks way better than it did before.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and humidity is high so these products are a must here.</li>
            <li>For what they are worth, these products are a good value and get the job done, without leaving hair messy, stiff, or sticky.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference from using no product at all, maybe that&#x27;s just my hair and because I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I get the Brazilian blowout and this keeps my hair very similar to when I first get the Brazilian.  </li>
            <li>Actually from what I&#x27;ve read, washing your hair daily isn&#x27;t healthy for it anyways, that might be different if you use a lot of product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this after buying a redken heat protectant spray that was too heavy for my fine locks.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly and freeze prone hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do much, felt like a cross between lotion and conditioner and can be a bit crunchy when it drys</li>
            <li>The manufacturer of this product, L&#x27;Oreal claims that, as it is formulated without heavy silicones, it will weightlessly smooth hair for 48-hr frizz control.  </li>
            <li>It leaves it soft and not fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many anti-frizz products over the years and have been disappointed with most products that I have used</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and works really well on my long curly hair to control frizz.</li>
            <li>We use this all year long to help protect her hair from her love of swimming.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this product to everyone who needs a little extra attention to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping some day I will come across a magic serum that will make my wild, frizzy hair tame down.</li>
            <li>This is better than the gloss serum, but still not great (for me).  </li>
            <li>product, if it works at all, certainly doesn&#x27;t hold for 48 hours, as it claims, at least not in the long hot humid summers of North Carolina.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t wash my hair daily because generally I don&#x27;t use any styling products,</li>
            <li>Once you brush or otherwise manipulate the hair after it is dried with this product, a sticky frizz occurs, and it ain&#x27;t pretty at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am not sure how much heat protection it has.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little hesitant to try anything from the new Eversleek line.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy and wavy hair and usually get the brazilian blowout but had to stop because I didn&#x27;t want harsh chemicals while I am pregnant.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft, but not weighed down AT ALL!  </li>
            <li> They have a tutorial on L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s website saying to put this from about the middle of your hair down.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that the product seems a bit watered down</li>
            <li> I did not particularly care for it.  </li>
            <li> I use it either with my hair wet or dry</li>
            <li> So my hair has been out of control the last few months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not much product for the price.</li>
            <li> I put it from about my ears down because my hair is down to my waist, then whatever is left on my hands</li>
            <li> If I do it&#x27;s a very small amount of wax the same day I wash it, but only to help keep fly-aways from dancing on my head</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Hair does not feed sticky or heavy and can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I do still tend to put other products in with it though if I am blow drying my hair b/c</li>
            <li> I tried other product</li>
            <li> I use it on my towel dried hair and let it air dry then use a blow dryer to style my hair.</li>
            <li> No matter what shampoo and conditioner combination I used, they always seemed to leave my hair overly dry and fluffy.</li>
            <li> It does not absorb into the strands so if you use enough to tame frizz, it makes hair feel not clean and matted down.  </li>
            <li> They also say the product can be used on dry hair to tame it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product contains Agon, sunflower, and olive oils instead, which, L&#x27;Oreal claims, will control frizz while helping to protect hair from humidity, leaving the hair sleek and shiny, without its feeling weighed down or coated.  </li>
            <li> And it costs so much less than fancier hair care products.</li>
            <li> Any improvement lasts for less than a day.  </li>
            <li> hair is thick and a couple inches long.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the L&#x27;Oreal Everpure line</li>
            <li> Was disappointing, especially for the price for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a heat protectant and help tame frizz.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t tame my hair from frizz and humidity.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommends dispensing 1-2 pumps of the serum after a shampoo/conditioning, working the product evenly into the hair, focusing on the ends, then styling as usual.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this left my hair feeling stiff, chalky, and dull.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly frizzy hair and this product loosens the curls and controls the frizz.</li>
            <li> It made worse than before.</li>
            <li> so i was a bit confused but</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this creme did not do the trick.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out the trick to using this, but keep this away from your scalp; it&#x27;ll make you feel like your hair is dirty.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is not in stores</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have very fine and curly hair, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for great frizz-tamer products.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products over the years and nothing comes close to Loreal EverSleek.  It keeps my curls bouncy and frizz-free ALL DAY without leaving a sticky or gummy residue.  Plus it&#x27;s silicone-free.  Your curls deserve the best and this EverSleek product is it!</li>
            <li> I saw this being reviewed in a magazine. It said it was good.  I did not particularly care for it.  I have found better products to control my \\&quot;white girl\\&quot; frizz. Was disappointing, especially for the price for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> These products are fabulous.  I get the Brazilian blowout and this keeps my hair very similar to when I first get the Brazilian.  I have tried other Keratin products, but this is far superior.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the L&#x27;Oreal Everpure line so I was a little hesitant to try anything from the new Eversleek line.  This stuff is great though.  No silicones and very lightweight.  I can really use this as a leave in conditioner and styling product just on its own.  I do still tend to put other products in with it though if I am blow drying my hair b/c I am not sure how much heat protection it has.  Everytime I use this though I have really noticed that my hair looks better and more in control.  It feels soft, but not weighed down AT ALL!  This is great stuff especially for the price.  I am so happy that the mainstream popular drugstore companies have listened to us screaming for some silicone free products - Yeah!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly and freeze prone hair.I use it on my towel dried hair and let it air dry then use a blow dryer to style my hair. It works perfectly well for me, no freeze ,good volume and nice shine.highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product is great! Arrived on time and works really well on my long curly hair to control frizz.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much, felt like a cross between lotion and conditioner and can be a bit crunchy when it drys</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first use, i used all three products (shampoo, conditioner, serum) and I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product under the sun cheap and expensive but EverSleek products are amazing!  I use EverSleek Shampoo and Conditioner and Frizz Serum together and my curls are frizz free and for two days!  I love it and can&#x27;t see myself changing products ever again!  This is the first time I have got such great results!</li>
            <li> I had to write a review since this product really works and I&#x27;ve tried it all!  I have frizzy and wavy hair and usually get the brazilian blowout but had to stop because I didn&#x27;t want harsh chemicals while I am pregnant.  So my hair has been out of control the last few months.  I bought this product and tried it for the first time yesterday and my hair was noticeably smoother and easier to style. Also, it gave my hair good shine.  A lot less fly aways.  I&#x27;ve tried so many anti-frizz products over the years and have been disappointed with most products that I have used but this one is a winner.  And it costs so much less than fancier hair care products. I am a fan!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller &amp; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right. For silicone-free styling I like the Garnier Pure Clean Cr&amp;egrave;me much better, but this is good if you want something to finish your style, or smooth hair that slides out of a ponytail. Nothing grand. I&#x27;ll use it up, but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t call it a taming frizz cream. its a gel that will not even hold hair together. my hair are frizzy, curly. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. No shine, softness and frizz control. It made worse than before. Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a heat protectant and help tame frizz.  My hair is fine and serums have always been too greasy for my hair.  This product does not make my hair feel greasy at all and, I think, the oils in it help to protect my hair from heat damage.  I purchased this after buying a redken heat protectant spray that was too heavy for my fine locks.</li>
            <li> What more needs to be said?  This works as advertised.  Does what it claims with no fuss. Even daughter uses it.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it promises - it tames your hair.  I have very thick curly frizzy hair and this product loosens the curls and controls the frizz.</li>
            <li> i was expecting it to be non sticky and smooth but isnt...</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t tame my hair from frizz and humidity. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference from using no product at all, maybe that&#x27;s just my hair and because I live in Florida but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is better than the gloss serum, but still not great (for me).  The cream aspect makes hair feel crunchy until brushed, but does brush out OK.  It does not absorb into the strands so if you use enough to tame frizz, it makes hair feel not clean and matted down.  BUT it is FAR better than the last 2 serums L&#x27;Oreal has come out with ...</li>
            <li> This product really did the trick on my wavy, frizzy, bleached hair.  They have a tutorial on L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s website saying to put this from about the middle of your hair down.  I put it from about my ears down because my hair is down to my waist, then whatever is left on my hands I quickly gloss over the top of my head trying not to get it near my part.  No greasiness and no frizz.  Some people have mentioned a strong odor, I personally didn&#x27;t find it to be that strong, but if you are sensitive to perfumes in your hair products you might want to see if you can try this from a friend before you buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping some day I will come across a magic serum that will make my wild, frizzy hair tame down. Unfortunately this creme did not do the trick.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Ever-Sleek Frizz Taming Cr&amp;egrave;me Serum.  The manufacturer of this product, L&#x27;Oreal claims that, as it is formulated without heavy silicones, it will weightlessly smooth hair for 48-hr frizz control.  The product contains Agon, sunflower, and olive oils instead, which, L&#x27;Oreal claims, will control frizz while helping to protect hair from humidity, leaving the hair sleek and shiny, without its feeling weighed down or coated.  The manufacturer recommends dispensing 1-2 pumps of the serum after a shampoo/conditioning, working the product evenly into the hair, focusing on the ends, then styling as usual.  They also say the product can be used on dry hair to tame it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product, if it works at all, certainly doesn&#x27;t hold for 48 hours, as it claims, at least not in the long hot humid summers of North Carolina.  Any improvement lasts for less than a day.  It&#x27;s also not much product for the price. Furthermore, it is a standalone product, without any other useful properties, such as being a mousse or gel, so to use it is just to add one more step to beauty routines. Frankly, I can&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay. It tames my hair....to a degree. You get a sleek look for a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t last. And it can make your hair a bit crunchy.</li>
            <li> Salon quality product.  I live in Florida and humidity is high so these products are a must here. This one works well.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. Good ingredients that get the job done even in the most humid conditions. Hair does not feed sticky or heavy and can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I like this anti-frizz serum. It helps me a lot to keep my permed hair from frizzing. It&#x27;s sulfate free too! Too bad it is not in stores so I will have to keep ordering from Amazon. Also, it&#x27;s small. I wish this stuff came in bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> I have frizz on the upper layer of my hair. Its not terrible, and I usually flat iron it quickly and its gone, but I worry about the damage the heat styling is doing. But this serum makes it so I almost never have to do that, unless I want a more \\&quot;done\\&quot; look for parties and events. Now on weekdays when Im just running around with the kids and errands, I just put two squirts in my hair and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a serum but it feels more like gel so i was a bit confused but its ok</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with dry, winter, static hair... It REALLY helps! Makes my hair shiny too!</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out the trick to using this, but keep this away from your scalp; it&#x27;ll make you feel like your hair is dirty. Don&#x27; t think it&#x27;s phenomenal enough to buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried other product but L&#x27;oreal is the best. It make my hair smooth and stay curly for whole day.</li>
            <li> No matter what shampoo and conditioner combination I used, they always seemed to leave my hair overly dry and fluffy. I knew there had to be something out there, after reading Amazon reviews, I purchased this one and I don&#x27;t regret it–It works! It leaves it soft and not fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily because generally I don&#x27;t use any styling products, If I do it&#x27;s a very small amount of wax the same day I wash it, but only to help keep fly-aways from dancing on my head like it&#x27;s the host of a micro inflatable noodle convention. Actually from what I&#x27;ve read, washing your hair daily isn&#x27;t healthy for it anyways, that might be different if you use a lot of product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and a couple inches long.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for controlling my very frizzy hair.  I have been using this daily for a week now and my hair is softer and more manageable.  It is still slightly frizzy but looks way better than it did before.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for humid climates. It tames the frizz!!  I wash and condition my hair and then use L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sulfate-free. After blow drying my hair feels soft and frizz free for 2 days.</li>
            <li> It is great for curly hair like mine. I use it either with my hair wet or dry and it Works perfeclty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product, works like a dream, but it&#x27;s getting hard to find it in stores. I was so happy to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought the smoothing deep conditioner, the humidity defying leavin cream and this serum  all together,  the first time I used the defying leaving cream I thought nothing could beat it but today when I washed my hair I had to try this because I bought it dahhh... so I did and I can&#x27;t believe the results, my hair is soooooo shiny, soft, manageable, not greasy at all, not weighted down, just amazing!!!!!!! The only thing I noticed is that the product seems a bit watered down and I had to apply more than usual but who cares if you have to use more product when you have amazing results???</li>
            <li> Very sticky in the hair. Did not sleek and defrrizz. I threw it in the trash after using it one time. The shampoos and conditioners of this line are great but stick to the professional styling products that really perform!</li>
            <li> I could tell immediately that this product was like many others I have tried that have ended up in the same place--the rubbish bin. Unfortunately, this left my hair feeling stiff, chalky, and dull. Once you brush or otherwise manipulate the hair after it is dried with this product, a sticky frizz occurs, and it ain&#x27;t pretty at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that L&#x27;Oreal makes two other products I really DO like, each of which leave the hair feeling soft and silky, and which keep curls soft and sleek: L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Smooth Frizz-Free Serum, Rosemary Mint 1.7 oz (50 ml) and L&#x27;oreal Precious Oil Treatment with Argan Oil, 3.9 Fluid Ounce. For what they are worth, these products are a good value and get the job done, without leaving hair messy, stiff, or sticky.</li>
            <li> This line is really great for my daughter with Blonde hair. We use this all year long to help protect her hair from her love of swimming.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this product to everyone who needs a little extra attention to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.</li>
