            <li> I use this product one year ago it&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;makes your hair has more shine.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use only half of the vial.</li>
            <li> This is my fav to use about every 3 days, I love the smell and how it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this product on my hair once before for $5 and I loved it. It leaves my hair w/ so much shine &amp; with a great smell for days. I was so excited to find it on Amazon for such a great price. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be so dry and damanged due to highlights and other dyes.  Since I started using this essential oil, it brighten more my highlights and my hair feels silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with Amazon service and prices.  Amazon has everything from A to Z, which gives me less time shopping outside and more money saved. This product gives instant shine and beauty to the hair, plus the price is much less than in beauty stores or at hair salons. I use one after washing my hair. I only hope this company can make the container safe for customers. Every time I&#x27;m opening one I&#x27;m taking precautions that pieces of glass won&#x27;t go on the hair, or on the floor, or around any object nearby, or in my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful when opening this product and enjoy it! I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I have thought Alfaparf is the best rated line that nobody has ever heard  of! A few products in beauty strike me that way. It&#x27;s so nice to have paid half the price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are little tubes of heaven for my hair. I have blonde highlighted hair which takes a lot of maintenance in the dryness department. I always do conditioning treatments just to make sure the highlights do not strip my hair of it&#x27;s natural oils. After using this product my hair feels almost just like it felt before I started treating it with highlights. It leaves your hair nice and soft as well as shiny. I highly recommend it and the smell in my opinion is not bad at all like other reviews have stated. It almost smells like a baby cologne. Once you blow-dry your hair after applying it, the smell is not strong and will be pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> Love it my hair smells so good its like a perfume for the hair.  I going to the gym and still the smells last!</li>
            <li> Great product!! It makes my hair look shiny and smooth it helps with the frizzes. I use it once a week</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Makes blow drying easier and leaves hair looking shiny and full of body.  Love it!  Can&#x27;t blow dry my hair without it.</li>
            <li> This product smells strong of rubbing alcohol and perfume mix.  I was actually scared to put it in my hair because of the smell so I applied a small amount.  My hair was fuller after I blowed dried but that&#x27;s what alcohol does, it expands the hair strands so that it appears thicker but alcohol also dries hair out.  I will not buy again because of the smell and high alcohol content.</li>
            <li> I like it and it makes my hair smell awesome. Only thing though is it makes my hair a bit hard and stiff after application.Im guessing it has alcohol in it which is not good for hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and this helps a lot with that.  When I use it my hair is shiny and soft.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great for adding instant shine to dull hair. This product makes your hair reflect light from all angles.  Leave in after shampooing and then style!</li>
            <li> I blached my hair ( the worst thing i could of ever done ) i had long black wavy hair and after doing this my hair began to feel lifeless and it would feel stringy and nasty I went to my hair dresser and she told me if i wanted to try some and i agreeed the first thing that strikes you from this product is the amazing smell i dont understand why anyone would think it smells bad it smells like baby , ive been using it for about 2 weeks now and my hair feels amazing its soft again super shiny im so glad i was intuorduced to this product i will continue to buy it&lt;br /&gt;i bought 2 boxes of 12 and the shampoo and conditioner for $60 it was really $125 but she felt so bad for me cause she saw how sad i was with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo and conditioner also make your hair feel awesome and smell great too.</li>
            <li> I love it; conditions and shines baby-fine hair without weighing it down. And it makes your hair smell great too.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, color treated hair and it doesnt shine the way very straight (younger) hair does but using this lotion makes the difference. I found that the little vial is more than enough for my shoulder length hair so I put it in a travel size spray bottle and each vial lasts 2-3 applications. After I wash my hair I always use it last, after I have put 2 hair products in my hair (a detangler and a frizz cream). I&#x27;ll spray and style. it smells nice and when my hair is dry it looks so shiny and healthy. I get alot of compliments!</li>
            <li> Came really fast, I love alfaparf products really works leaves my hair soft, nourish and shiny</li>
            <li> Gives hair the best smell.  Awesome product .  Have used it before.  Shampoos are the best. Will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> Always use this before the night out for shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. Really works to treat hair and make it look so shiny</li>
            <li> I used the blue one for years.  When ordering on AMazon realized there was a leave in lotion.  I actually think this one is my favorite over the blue.  But, I use them both.  They make my hair look healthy.  I have thin, ugly hair.  So that&#x27;s actually a miracle.</li>
            <li> this product works great for  my hair it makes it really soft and shiny and it also helps with split ends</li>
            <li> To start off, I must say I really fell in love with the smell. It&#x27;s a nice soft smell, that lingers in my hair after blow drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For awhile now, I had been completely mistreating my hair. I had dyed it too much, and on top of that, I was flat ironing it every day. Worst decision I could&#x27;ve ever made because the consequences were truly showing. My hair had been resilient enough, but after awhile, the split ends were endless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started going to the salon again (I had stopped because I had developed fear after countless bad haircuts) and my stylist used one of these on me. I left the salon with a great haircut, and a shine that I hadn&#x27;t seen in awhile. I washed it three days later, and my hair still had an incredible, healthy looking shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to the salon again, and they used it again on me and at 5 bucks a pop, they then offered to sell my a whole boc of them for $40. I agreed, even though I felt the price was unreasonable, and then began using them at home. My hair definitely started showing a difference. This thing saved my hair and brought life back to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out, and searched them up on Amazon, and was relieved they were much cheaper on here. I need to order some more now too. These things are great, and one bottle can leave your hair shiny for days, even after washing it. I truly recommend them, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Smooths the hair shaft without weighing it down.  I have very fine hair...you would think that you shouldn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t benefit by using this product.  Wrong!  It works on all hair types.  I gave a vial to a friend with thick curly hair.  She&#x27;s hooked...it smoothed her hair out so that it doesn&#x27;t look as kinky.  The good thing about using this product on thin hair is that one (1) vial lasts me 3 hair washings.  In other words, I only use 1/3 of the vial at a time.</li>
            <li> use this after every shampoo and your hair will be silky and shiny. got this done at salon with corey from cloud 9. he&#x27;s moved to a different salon and i can no longer get it from him but will order online!</li>
            <li> They are so good for your hair. With just 3 of the tubs my hair has changed drastically. I think its one of the best treatments for hair available.</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> I love how this product leaves your hair. This is one of my favorites which I have been using from long time. Leaves my hair shiny and I only use it when I use regular conditioner, so I don&#x27;t have to wait to get good results when I am in a rush</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I lived in NY all my life and my hair dresser used it. Moved to the south and I&#x27;m so glad for Amazon people always compliment on my hair, I shared it with my hair dresser here and he loves the way it works with my hair texture..</li>
