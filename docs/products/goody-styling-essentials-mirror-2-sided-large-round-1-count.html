            <li>Fits nicely in my drawer, not taking up a ton of space.</li>
            <li>mirror is good and ok for what I need it for</li>
            <li>This effectively ruined one side of the mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice mirror, but the magnifying side is good-for-nothing.  </li>

            <li>What more can I say about a mirror?</li>

            <li>Thanks again to L. Mann for the great</li>
            <li>Still satisfied with the mirror.br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still satisfied with the mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK and does the job.</li>
            <li>Shipping and vendor OK.</li>
            <li>It will not make you more fetching nor will it match your shower curtain.</li>
            <li>Yes, you take a chance on the color, as the headline says at the top of the web page: &amp;#34;Colors May Vary&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The mirror is ok, but there are couple of issues.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK for my use.</li>
            <li>I still cannot get all of the sticker off the side of the mirror that I use most.  </li>
            <li>But I do love the size of the mirror and the handle.  </li>
            <li>I paid more, I would have returned it because of the chips.</li>
            <li>This mirror is the perfect size I needed to check out the back of my neck after a haircut.  </li>
            <li>Balance is OK.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is warm the sticker up with your hair dryer and it comes off clean and easy.&lt;br /&gt;people</li>
            <li>Wished it was oval but pretty good</li>
            <li>quick ship and nice product</li>
            <li>you get an easily stored, inexpensive way to fine tune your face, hair, or whatever and more money for that anti-aging cream you&#x27;ve been wanting to buy.</li>
            <li>The glass itself wasn&#x27;t great, seems marked inside on both sides.  </li>
            <li>It gets 4 Stars because of the lack of choice on colors and the sticky goo issue but that is easily  resolved with Goo B Gone.</li>
            <li>Also can easily be moved.</li>
            <li>I had to go out and get a strong solvent to get it off.</li>
            <li>(I surprised her with it) but very useful lol.</li>
            <li>The goody styling mirror is fine itself.</li>
            <li>Still working fine as should be no surprise.</li>
            <li>Still doing it&#x27;s job just fine.</li>
            <li>Still doing it&#x27;s job just fine.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is fine; however, mine was shipped with an impossible-to-remove sticker on one side.</li>
            <li>The mirror is just fine, I got purple -</li>
            <li>Great magnifying and regular, 2 sided mirror.</li>
            <li>Goody still makes good products as far as combs and this mirror are concerned.</li>
            <li>The mirror is great but the mfg put an old-timey sticker on the magnified side that will not completely come off so you&#x27;ll always have a sticky residue on one side.</li>
            <li>Price is right!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what a 2 sided mirror is supposed to do, light weight and not too bulky as well.</li>
            <li>The goofy side had a big sticker on it which is why it lost a star, wasn&#x27;t anything some WD-40 and a razor blade couldn&#x27;t take off easily though</li>
            <li>did not have any trouble with the stickers as others experienced.</li>
            <li>Good mirror, what I expected.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy duty, clear and working hand mirror, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth it .</li>
            <li>nice, exactly what I expected, fit right where I needed it.</li>
            <li>For me the size is right and it appears well made.</li>
            <li>Why is that kind of label and adhesive deemed necessary in the first place?</li>
            <li>Good size; larger than normal I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>They taunt you by putting a non-residue sticker on one side that peels off easily and leaves no mess.</li>
            <li>The overall feel of the mirror is very cheap.</li>
            <li>Acetone nail polish remover might work too, but I think it much more likely to mar or damage the plastic</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>I am now soaking in a hot dish pan full of soapy water, but I do not expect this to ever be completely removed.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The mirrors did not look new or fresh and not from the damaged box.</li>
            <li>Why would you put such a strong adhesive sticker on my mirror.  </li>
            <li>I would have selected 5 Star if product did not have that strong adhesive 2 by 2 (or larger) sticker on it.</li>
            <li>The company calls it a &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; mirror and that is not my idea of &#x27;large&#x27; so I have posted the specifications below</li>
            <li>The mirror would be fine, except the manufacturer puts a large sticker on one side of the mirror which does not peel off without leaving a big amount of residue.</li>
            <li>For that reason I would not recommend purchasing this product as you have no way of knowing what you&#x27;ll really get.</li>
            <li>it is very duriable</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do windows, it doesn&#x27;t text and it doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>I expected a better product from Goody, but it seems like a generic cheap import with Goody name slapped on it.</li>
            <li>I spent about 30 minutes just picking the rear sticker off and more time trying to remove the remaining glue from the mirror.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it is on the side that I don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>The magnifier side really works.</li>
            <li>Very durable and high quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;The magnifying side has a paper label that mostly peeled off clean, but left a few spots on the mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirror that was sent to me is a less than appealing bluish-greeny aqua-ish color, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>Decent product, everything I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Like others here I tried cleaning these off with soapy water, cleansers (formula 409), and classic &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; glass cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have seen better mirrors for the same price at local pharmacies.</li>
            <li>They stuck the price label (a large one) to the magnified side right in the MIDDLE of the mirror and it won&#x27;t come off</li>
            <li>Well just use a Hand held Blow dryer on high heat and melt the glue on the bottom of the label.</li>
            <li>High quality?</li>
            <li>UGLY purple color, but great mirror!  </li>
            <li>One sticker peeled off just fine and was just a cling on plastic sticker, the other side was plastered with a NON Removable sticker that took forever to get off with windex and my fingernail</li>
            <li>It is probably cheaper in a store, but I couldn&#x27;t find one, and the hand mirrors I did find in most stores were poor quality and not the right size.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, but not heavy!</li>
            <li>wow what a surprise!  </li>
            <li>Ok except for the sticker is hard to remove.</li>
            <li>Looked old.</li>
            <li>This is one ten dollar purchase that really has me aggravated.</li>
            <li>I have tried every glass cleaning product from soap and water to professional glass cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I think the only reason for this is to let you know that they are perfectly capable of doing this.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t count on them having fixed the sticker issue, though.)</li>
            <li>The manufacturer should really consider whether this type of sticker is necessary.</li>
            <li>Pretty small, but with two sides, well worth the price</li>
            <li>At first I though it would be too small, but its just right.</li>
            <li>Totally acceptable mirror, regular on one side and goofy on the other.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it when I cut my hair in the back</li>
            <li>The only way I can really tell the difference is if I&#x27;m using it to check the back of my hair, then the magnified side is blurry in the reflection.</li>
            <li>But for approximately ten bucks, and given that it has a standard and 2x magnified mirror, it&#x27;s still a decent value.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I had been looking for, and was having such a hard time in finding the exact hand mirror I had in mind.</li>
            <li>Based on L. Mann&#x27;s description and reviews on the product it seems very effective at getting rid of that label &amp;quot;goo&amp;quot; and a lot of other difficult things too.</li>
            <li>Box of 30 mirrors arrived damanged despite the clear labels of fragile.</li>
            <li>Not too big, not too small, with a handle that has rounded edges that make it comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking about the clear goody brand label on the flat mirror that peels off</li>
            <li>It even survived a drop, which I mostly attribute to dumb luck!</li>
            <li>who gave this mirror poor reviews because of the sticker are not aware of the easy way to remove it!</li>

            <li> nice, exactly what I expected, fit right where I needed it.</li>
            <li> For me the size is right and it appears well made.</li>
            <li> Why is that kind of label and adhesive deemed necessary in the first place?</li>
            <li> Good size; larger than normal I&#x27;d say.</li>

            <li> The overall feel of the mirror is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Acetone nail polish remover might work too, but I think it much more likely to mar or damage the plastic</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> I am now soaking in a hot dish pan full of soapy water, but I do not expect this to ever be completely removed.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The mirrors did not look new or fresh and not from the damaged box.</li>
            <li> Why would you put such a strong adhesive sticker on my mirror.  </li>
            <li> I would have selected 5 Star if product did not have that strong adhesive 2 by 2 (or larger) sticker on it.</li>
            <li> The company calls it a &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; mirror and that is not my idea of &#x27;large&#x27; so I have posted the specifications below</li>
            <li> The mirror would be fine, except the manufacturer puts a large sticker on one side of the mirror which does not peel off without leaving a big amount of residue.</li>
            <li> For that reason I would not recommend purchasing this product as you have no way of knowing what you&#x27;ll really get.</li>
            <li> it is very duriable</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do windows, it doesn&#x27;t text and it doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> I expected a better product from Goody, but it seems like a generic cheap import with Goody name slapped on it.</li>
            <li> I spent about 30 minutes just picking the rear sticker off and more time trying to remove the remaining glue from the mirror.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it is on the side that I don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> The magnifier side really works.</li>
            <li> Very durable and high quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;The magnifying side has a paper label that mostly peeled off clean, but left a few spots on the mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror that was sent to me is a less than appealing bluish-greeny aqua-ish color, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Decent product, everything I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Like others here I tried cleaning these off with soapy water, cleansers (formula 409), and classic &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; glass cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have seen better mirrors for the same price at local pharmacies.</li>
            <li> They stuck the price label (a large one) to the magnified side right in the MIDDLE of the mirror and it won&#x27;t come off</li>
            <li> Well just use a Hand held Blow dryer on high heat and melt the glue on the bottom of the label.</li>
            <li> High quality?</li>
            <li> UGLY purple color, but great mirror!  </li>
            <li> One sticker peeled off just fine and was just a cling on plastic sticker, the other side was plastered with a NON Removable sticker that took forever to get off with windex and my fingernail</li>
            <li> It is probably cheaper in a store, but I couldn&#x27;t find one, and the hand mirrors I did find in most stores were poor quality and not the right size.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, but not heavy!</li>
            <li> wow what a surprise!  </li>
            <li> Ok except for the sticker is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Looked old.</li>
            <li> This is one ten dollar purchase that really has me aggravated.</li>
            <li> I have tried every glass cleaning product from soap and water to professional glass cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I think the only reason for this is to let you know that they are perfectly capable of doing this.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t count on them having fixed the sticker issue, though.)</li>
            <li> The manufacturer should really consider whether this type of sticker is necessary.</li>
            <li> Pretty small, but with two sides, well worth the price</li>
            <li> At first I though it would be too small, but its just right.</li>
            <li> Totally acceptable mirror, regular on one side and goofy on the other.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it when I cut my hair in the back</li>
            <li> The only way I can really tell the difference is if I&#x27;m using it to check the back of my hair, then the magnified side is blurry in the reflection.</li>
            <li> But for approximately ten bucks, and given that it has a standard and 2x magnified mirror, it&#x27;s still a decent value.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I had been looking for, and was having such a hard time in finding the exact hand mirror I had in mind.</li>
            <li> Based on L. Mann&#x27;s description and reviews on the product it seems very effective at getting rid of that label &amp;quot;goo&amp;quot; and a lot of other difficult things too.</li>
            <li> Box of 30 mirrors arrived damanged despite the clear labels of fragile.</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small, with a handle that has rounded edges that make it comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about the clear goody brand label on the flat mirror that peels off</li>
            <li> It even survived a drop, which I mostly attribute to dumb luck!</li>
            <li> who gave this mirror poor reviews because of the sticker are not aware of the easy way to remove it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the same kind of dumb stuff that gets mailing labels placed firmly over important text on magazines, and glued down hard enough to prevent removal at all.</li>
            <li> Mine came with one of the mirrors chipped on the reverse side (on the mounting side, two chips across from each other both about 18&amp;#34; inch, and both chips were clearly visible).</li>
            <li> This problem has been noted by other purchasers and you would think they would have fixed this problem by now.</li>
            <li> I have used Goof Off and a teflon scrapper and still have a big sticky mess in the middle of this mirror.</li>
            <li> One side is just a regular mirror while the other side is a magnifying view.</li>
            <li> One side is 1.5x or 2x magnification, the other is just regular.</li>
            <li> true, one sticker is difficult to remove and leaves residue, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Vision not clear on either side - the &amp;#34;magnified&amp;#34; side is a joke - looks just like the other side.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that there was a sticker on one side that was a giant pain in the butt to get off.</li>
            <li> than I expected however works when I need a handheld mirror.</li>
            <li> One was a little harder to pull off than the other, but it left no residue.</li>
            <li> My major complaint is that the Manufacture put two stickers on it, one on each side.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy, easy to store, and very practical...just get rid of the awful sticker!</li>
            <li> This is not tortoise shell but amber, and I noticed that other sellers used the tortoise shell description.</li>
            <li> When I look into one side of the mirror, I can see the future; when I look into the other side of the mirror I can see the past.  </li>
            <li> It is X1 on one side and X2 on the other side, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I understand it was the one with the barcode, but I do not get why they couldn&#x27;t just make it an easy-off sticker like the other one.</li>
            <li> My other plastic mirror broke</li>
            <li> 1X magnification on one side and 3X magnification on the other side.</li>
            <li> It ruins the mirror.  </li>
            <li> When I turn it around, I see half of myself.</li>
            <li> Could also use a slightly longer handle for my use.  </li>
            <li> Less chance it will be stolen too.  </li>
            <li> So bottom line is, that for about six and a half bucks</li>
            <li> It looks black on display.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to crack the mirror by excessive heat.</li>
            <li> Then they put a large, impossible to remove sticker on the other side and make you stare at the magnified reflection of your surroundings as you futilely attempt to remove the glue residue from this side of the mirror.    </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes and a few applications but all the glue was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> The label was not easy to remove, but a little bit of rubbing alcohol took care of the residue.</li>
            <li> One label came right off, the other used that annoying adhesive that needs to be removed with Goo-Gone or Dissolve-</li>
            <li> Super annoying.</li>
            <li> Even then there was very little goo upon removal of the  2 stickers.</li>
            <li> To small of a mirror</li>
            <li> Yes, the sticker is glued to one side of the mirror, and that is not a very good idea...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hard on mirrors.  </li>
            <li> It came with an easy-peel sticker on the front surface, and a hard glued sticker on the rear surface.</li>
            <li> But the label was placed on the mirror and it is hard to be removed.</li>
            <li> They at least have since added &#x27;Colors</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Heat &amp; Peel off&amp;#34;&amp;#34;  slowly.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not receive the item I thought I was purchasing (the tortoise shell brown color shown), but I received a boring, plain white one instead.  </li>
            <li> Are these people serious?</li>
            <li> I am serious.</li>
            <li> Only issue is that the sticker put on the mirror has been impossible to take off.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad but the shipping did double the investment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you get this mirror and the label leaves gluey goo behind get out the rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Thickness: 3/8 inch &amp;#62;  Usable Handle Length: 4-1/2 inches, approximate &amp;#62;  Hanging Hole: 5/16 inch diameter  </li>
            <li> It always amazes me how frustrating the mirror set up in surroundings I am not used to can be.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a ugly purple color.</li>
            <li> Stupid.  </li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect size for my make-up drawer.</li>
            <li> Good mirror, what I expected.</li>
            <li> Decent product, everything I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Box of 30 mirrors arrived damanged despite the clear labels of fragile. The mirrors did not look new or fresh and not from the damaged box. Looked old.</li>
            <li> Works well. Plastic seems thinner and a bit more brittle than I expected however works when I need a handheld mirror.</li>
            <li> Good-quality mirror - good service.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not receive the item I thought I was purchasing (the tortoise shell brown color shown), but I received a boring, plain white one instead.  The mirror itself is ok but I would definitely not have opted for the color I received and would have purchased something else instead.  For that reason I would not recommend purchasing this product as you have no way of knowing what you&#x27;ll really get.</li>
            <li> Great magnifying and regular, 2 sided mirror. Not really big but not tiny either. Good deal at this price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy duty, clear and working hand mirror, this is perfect for you. I mainly use it when I cut my hair in the back and I have no problems at all. At first I though it would be too small, but its just right. I can see everything I need to see with it. This mirror comes with two side. One side is just a regular mirror while the other side is a magnifying view. Great price for this kind of quality.</li>
            <li> Helps my husband see better when he combing his hair.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about the mirror being ruined by a paper sticker attached to one side of the mirror. Are these people serious? Yes, the sticker is glued to one side of the mirror, and that is not a very good idea... but, it doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to remove the sticker. I recommend this mirror, without any qualifications.</li>
            <li> Seller provided excellent service and good price. This is not tortoise shell but amber, and I noticed that other sellers used the tortoise shell description. Goody still makes good products as far as combs and this mirror are concerned. Perhaps they provided the seller with the color characterization.</li>
            <li> We used these mirrors at a trade show and they were great!  Very durable and high quality</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! Perfect! It was exactly what I had been looking for, and was having such a hard time in finding the exact hand mirror I had in mind. Well this one is it. Fits nicely in my drawer, not taking up a ton of space. Fits real nice in my hand when using it, and the mirror itself is great! Sturdy, but not heavy! Plus it has a magnifying side to it, comes in handy at times! :)</li>
            <li> When I look into one side of the mirror, I can see the future; when I look into the other side of the mirror I can see the past.  Well, no.  But Amazon won&#x27;t let me just check the five star box, so I have to write something here.  It&#x27;s a mirror.  It is X1 on one side and X2 on the other side, as advertised.  It arrived uncracked.  What more can I say about a mirror?</li>
            <li> good value for the money  i like the maginiying feature and the size of the mirror. it is very duriable</li>
            <li> Received in 2-days Amazon Prime from NY Discounts North Las Vegas NV.  Lot of reviews stated problem removing the sticker on the X side Mirror. Well just use a Hand held Blow dryer on high heat and melt the glue on the bottom of the label. &amp;#34;Heat &amp; Peel off&amp;#34;&amp;#34;  slowly. Just be careful not to crack the mirror by excessive heat. Use Windex and wipe off the residue and Give a 5-Star for this product. Save the Bubble wrap to protect mirror when storing away. Don&#x27;t use a razor or knife on the Mirror surface.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions and you wont have any problems. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase an thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> This mirror comes with a big sticker that is NOT removable. I have used Goof Off and a teflon scrapper and still have a big sticky mess in the middle of this mirror. I am now soaking in a hot dish pan full of soapy water, but I do not expect this to ever be completely removed. This problem has been noted by other purchasers and you would think they would have fixed this problem by now. It ruins the mirror.  I have Prime shipping, so I did not pay extra for shipping this mirror. Would I order it again? Heck no! It is a waste of money. I ordered this for convenience of delivery, but I could have bought it for one dollar at my local Dollar Store *without this sticker). I am serious. They have it there for one dollar. This is one ten dollar purchase that really has me aggravated.</li>
            <li> The goody styling mirror is fine itself. For me the size is right and it appears well made. It would be 5 stars if not for the the warning label! I&#x27;m not talking about the clear goody brand label on the flat mirror that peels off cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnifying side has a paper label that mostly peeled off clean, but left a few spots on the mirror. Like others here I tried cleaning these off with soapy water, cleansers (formula 409), and classic &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; glass cleaner. These cleaned the residual paper but the darn glue still fowled the mirror. This was getting frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved from the kitchen to the bathroom. If detergent and ammonia based cleaning solutions would not work, perhaps alcohol would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a paper towel dampened in rubbing alcohol I went after the residual glue on the mirror. It took a few minutes and a few applications but all the glue was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried not to get alcohol on the plastic frame as some plastics can be damaged. I&#x27;m sure some spots were exposed but without damage I could see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you get this mirror and the label leaves gluey goo behind get out the rubbing alcohol. Acetone nail polish remover might work too, but I think it much more likely to mar or damage the plastic frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope someone finds this helpful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated Aug 16, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to L. Mann who posted a comment bringing [[ASIN:B001R4XHRQ Goo Gone]] to my attention. I&#x27;m ordering a bottle this weekend and it sounds great. Based on L. Mann&#x27;s description and reviews on the product it seems very effective at getting rid of that label &amp;quot;goo&amp;quot; and a lot of other difficult things too. Thanks again to L. Mann for the great suggestion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated May 3, 2016:&lt;br /&gt;Just over 2 years of using my Goody mirror on a regular basis. It even survived a drop, which I mostly attribute to dumb luck! Still working fine as should be no surprise. It&#x27;s outlasted its predecessor from the local dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated Aug 3, 2017:&lt;br /&gt;Well over 3 years now and my mirror has survived another fall (or two). Still doing it&#x27;s job just fine. Still satisfied with the mirror.br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated Aug 3, 2017:&lt;br /&gt;Well over 3 years now and my mirror has survived another fall (or two). Still doing it&#x27;s job just fine. Still satisfied with the mirror.</li>
            <li> When I look into it, I see myself. When I turn it around, I see half of myself.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is fine; however, mine was shipped with an impossible-to-remove sticker on one side. I understand it was the one with the barcode, but I do not get why they couldn&#x27;t just make it an easy-off sticker like the other one. I used copious amounts of WD-40, allowed it to soak, and it still left residue! If it weren&#x27;t for that, this product would get 5-stars. It is a great mirror for a good price. It is sturdy, easy to store, and very practical...just get rid of the awful sticker!</li>
            <li> All you have to do is warm the sticker up with your hair dryer and it comes off clean and easy.&lt;br /&gt;people who gave this mirror poor reviews because of the sticker are not aware of the easy way to remove it!</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small, with a handle that has rounded edges that make it comfortable to hold. Well-made.</li>
            <li> I like these.  They hold up well and that is a good thing.  I&#x27;ve hard on mirrors.  I wish they were just a tad tougher still.  Could also use a slightly longer handle for my use.  Otherwise, good to go!</li>
            <li> Ok except for the sticker is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> mirror is good and ok for what I need it for</li>
            <li> This mirror works great. My only complaint was that there was a sticker on one side that was a giant pain in the butt to get off. It left residue on one side of the mirror making it unusable. I had to go out and get a strong solvent to get it off. Annoying.</li>
            <li> This mirror is everything I wanted--easy to hold, two magnifications. Not fancy, but functional.</li>
            <li> The mirror would be fine, except the manufacturer puts a large sticker on one side of the mirror which does not peel off without leaving a big amount of residue. This effectively ruined one side of the mirror.</li>
            <li> My other plastic mirror broke so I chose this one. It&#x27;s OK and does the job. High quality? Nada. Shipping and vendor OK. Go to the dollar store next time...</li>
            <li> Good, I am using it a lot</li>
            <li> The label adhesive once finally removed with rubbing alcohol seems to etched (?) the surface of the glass and has left a shadow of the label.  I have tried every glass cleaning product from soap and water to professional glass cleaner.  Why is that kind of label and adhesive deemed necessary in the first place?</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the scoop. It&#x27;s a simple inexpensive utility mirror. It will not make you more fetching nor will it match your shower curtain. The mirror that was sent to me is a less than appealing bluish-greeny aqua-ish color, but it does the job. That is all I ask of a hand mirror. I will not be embarrassed if any one sees my mirror. Less chance it will be stolen too.  1X magnification on one side and 3X magnification on the other side. It doesn&#x27;t do windows, it doesn&#x27;t text and it doesn&#x27;t cost much. Yes, you take a chance on the color, as the headline says at the top of the web page: &amp;#34;Colors May Vary&amp;#34;. Boy, do they.  The company calls it a &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; mirror and that is not my idea of &#x27;large&#x27; so I have posted the specifications below and you decide if it is the correct size for you.  -- Specs --------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#62;  Total Length: 10-1/2 inches &amp;#62;  Total Width:  5-3/4 inches &amp;#62;  Mirror Size: 4-7/8 inch diameter &amp;#62;  Thickness: 3/8 inch &amp;#62;  Usable Handle Length: 4-1/2 inches, approximate &amp;#62;  Hanging Hole: 5/16 inch diameter  So bottom line is, that for about six and a half bucks you get an easily stored, inexpensive way to fine tune your face, hair, or whatever and more money for that anti-aging cream you&#x27;ve been wanting to buy. If you don&#x27;t care about what color you will receive, go for it.  It gets 4 Stars because of the lack of choice on colors and the sticky goo issue but that is easily  resolved with Goo B Gone. Even then there was very little goo upon removal of the  2 stickers. Good price point for what you are getting.</li>
            <li> The mirror is ok, but there are couple of issues. 1. This is not a tortoiseshell colored plastic, as given to believe from the picture, but the mirror I received was Purple.  2. The overall feel of the mirror is very cheap. I have seen better mirrors for the same price at local pharmacies. I expected a better product from Goody, but it seems like a generic cheap import with Goody name slapped on it. The label was not easy to remove, but a little bit of rubbing alcohol took care of the residue.</li>
            <li> UGLY purple color, but great mirror!  Wish you could choose the color!</li>
            <li> They taunt you by putting a non-residue sticker on one side that peels off easily and leaves no mess. I think the only reason for this is to let you know that they are perfectly capable of doing this. Then they put a large, impossible to remove sticker on the other side and make you stare at the magnified reflection of your surroundings as you futilely attempt to remove the glue residue from this side of the mirror.    Oh, also, mine was purple, not brown as pictured, if that matters to you.    (Update: They at least have since added &#x27;Colors May Vary&#x27; to the product name. I wouldn&#x27;t count on them having fixed the sticker issue, though.)</li>
            <li> Pretty small, but with two sides, well worth the price</li>
            <li> Be prepared to work to get the stick on label off.  Otherwise, it fits my bill.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what was needed. I&#x27;m very pleased with the item. Great product for the intended use and price.</li>
            <li> Wished it was oval but pretty good</li>
            <li> It came with an easy-peel sticker on the front surface, and a hard glued sticker on the rear surface. I spent about 30 minutes just picking the rear sticker off and more time trying to remove the remaining glue from the mirror. It is still not all off and still affects the clarity of the reflected image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the same kind of dumb stuff that gets mailing labels placed firmly over important text on magazines, and glued down hard enough to prevent removal at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice mirror, but the magnifying side is good-for-nothing.  The only way I can really tell the difference is if I&#x27;m using it to check the back of my hair, then the magnified side is blurry in the reflection.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what a 2 sided mirror is supposed to do, light weight and not too bulky as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a two-sided mirror. One side is 1.5x or 2x magnification, the other is just regular. Good size; larger than normal I&#x27;d say. My wife and daughter use it a lot, considering they were always using the bathroom mirror only before we bought this.</li>
            <li> quick ship and nice product</li>
            <li> The glass itself wasn&#x27;t great, seems marked inside on both sides.  But it&#x27;s OK for my use.</li>
            <li> Great hand mirror.  It is probably cheaper in a store, but I couldn&#x27;t find one, and the hand mirrors I did find in most stores were poor quality and not the right size.</li>
            <li> I still cannot get all of the sticker off the side of the mirror that I use most.  Now it has scratches from my trying to get the stubbornly still remaining glue off the mirror.  Why would you put such a strong adhesive sticker on my mirror.  Stupid.  But I do love the size of the mirror and the handle.  I would have selected 5 Star if product did not have that strong adhesive 2 by 2 (or larger) sticker on it.</li>
            <li> Basic two-sided mirror. Only issue is that the sticker put on the mirror has been impossible to take off. Super annoying. Thankfully it is on the side that I don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> The mirror is great - but how do the mirror manufacturers not realize what a mirror is for?  The paper label years and leaves an adhesive and paper residue in the mirror.  I bought two and it happened on both.  Very annoying.</li>
            <li> A great mirror. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> one of the stickies that are applied by you all, will not come off.&lt;br /&gt;Tried razor blade, water and anything else you can think of. It is forutnate&lt;br /&gt;that this stickie is on the magified side.</li>
            <li> The mirror is great but the mfg put an old-timey sticker on the magnified side that will not completely come off so you&#x27;ll always have a sticky residue on one side.</li>
            <li> The mirror is just fine, I got purple - wow what a surprise!  My major complaint is that the Manufacture put two stickers on it, one on each side.  One sticker peeled off just fine and was just a cling on plastic sticker, the other side was plastered with a NON Removable sticker that took forever to get off with windex and my fingernail and then it left a residue on it that I can&#x27;t get off.</li>
            <li> Mine came with one of the mirrors chipped on the reverse side (on the mounting side, two chips across from each other both about 18&amp;#34; inch, and both chips were clearly visible). Mine also came with two labels/stickers attached, one on each side. One label came right off, the other used that annoying adhesive that needs to be removed with Goo-Gone or Dissolve-It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I paid more, I would have returned it because of the chips. But for approximately ten bucks, and given that it has a standard and 2x magnified mirror, it&#x27;s still a decent value.</li>
            <li> another good decision.  best available, I&#x27;m sure.  true, one sticker is difficult to remove and leaves residue, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Vision not clear on either side - the &amp;#34;magnified&amp;#34; side is a joke - looks just like the other side. They stuck the price label (a large one) to the magnified side right in the MIDDLE of the mirror and it won&#x27;t come off</li>
            <li> nice, exactly what I expected, fit right where I needed it. Also can easily be moved. Would definetly reccommend to anyone .</li>
            <li> Nice mirror and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> USED BY A LADY FRIEND . SHE LIKES</li>
            <li> To small of a mirror and it&#x27;s a ugly purple color. It looks black on display. I return it.</li>
            <li> This is a great travel mirror for the price--I don&#x27;t travel often so it is kept in my suitcase for when I do.  It always amazes me how frustrating the mirror set up in surroundings I am not used to can be.  My vision is not what it used to be nor is what I am looking at!  I was glad to find it at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is a good products.  It seems durable. It does come with two stickers.  One is almost impossble to get off without leaving a sticky residue.  I had to use &amp;#34;Goo Gone&amp;#34; to get the residue off.  The manufacturer should really consider whether this type of sticker is necessary.</li>
            <li> Totally acceptable mirror, regular on one side and goofy on the other. The goofy side had a big sticker on it which is why it lost a star, wasn&#x27;t anything some WD-40 and a razor blade couldn&#x27;t take off easily though so not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Convenient. Great quality. Worth it . Price is right!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this mirror to have a tortoiseshell edge as pictured, but I received a bright purple one. I had read in the reviews that someone else received purple, so I searched the description for any indication that the color may vary. But there was none, so I was expecting to receive the tortoiseshell version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description also says that the mirror comes with a stand, but there was no stand included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any trouble with the stickers as others experienced. One was a little harder to pull off than the other, but it left no residue.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  She says it does not match the bathroom colors (I surprised her with it) but very useful lol.</li>
            <li> I never contacted the seller. I wanted to make that correction.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in perfect condition. But the label was placed on the mirror and it is hard to be removed. I had to use a nail polish remover to take the stain off.</li>
            <li> This was to replace one that I had had for over 20 years.  They are great to have around and don&#x27;t crush them , they hold up.</li>
            <li> This mirror is the perfect size I needed to check out the back of my neck after a haircut.  It&#x27;s 2 sided so you can zoom in while trimming your beard or mustache too!  A necessity for all home barbers.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad but the shipping did double the investment. I&#x27;m in the middle of the Pacific and Amazon is one of our retail lifelines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle fits my hand nicely. Balance is OK. The magnifier side really works. No flaws in the mirroring.</li>
