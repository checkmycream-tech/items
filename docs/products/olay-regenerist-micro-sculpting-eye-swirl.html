            <li>this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li>Olay makes a very nice line of products in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and the smell is pleasant and not over-powering.  </li>
            <li>Frankly that&#x27;s all I needed to convince me that this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a darn good filler.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable to the quality and good price.</li>
            <li>They have something quite good packed into this baby.</li>
            <li>Good quality,  If used as directed, it works.  </li>
            <li>Web MD suggested the Olay Regenerist line of products were good.</li>
            <li>Since I have had good service from Amazon, I made my choice.  </li>
            <li>I heard so many great things on this products</li>
            <li>Works great and we love it.</li>
            <li>I love it works greay and gives hourr make up a very good look when iu apply on before your foundation :)</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>but I buy many Olay products so my savings add up by volume!</li>
            <li>This product had a very nice feel and went on easily.</li>
            <li>Well, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it...</li>
            <li>GREAT Product!!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone, who is looking for a flawless look.</li>
            <li>Ok, but not as good as Merle Norman.</li>
            <li>It is a nice temporary fix to fill in wrinkles.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;be effective.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>Kind of like stuffing your pores with wax</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li>However, for fine lines around the mouth or eyes, it&#x27;s a pretty impressive solution.  </li>
            <li>The product is a nice lightweight texture but it seems I would need something thicker to cover most of the lines.</li>
            <li>The cream is light and smooth, and feels great on.</li>
            <li>I find the best foundation for the most natural, youthful, moist-looking skin is Olay CC cream.</li>
            <li>It sounds too good to be true and</li>
            <li>Have used this a couple times and it seems as though it is accentuating my fine line and wrinkles rather than eliminating them !</li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>
            <li>I love all their products and it arrived so quickly with no issues!!</li>
            <li>It covers fine wrinkles nicely.</li>
            <li>Have not found a better product in 5 years.</li>
            <li>I love this product -- another reviewer mentioned that it takes away the shine...</li>
            <li>Great, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But I love the way this stuff seemed to smoothand soften my skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it gets rid of them by magic, but the added moisture in the skin helps with elasticity.</li>
            <li>Love this product .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything better -</li>
            <li>it - you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But since there&#x27;s nothing better in the market, you can give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day; however, I do use more potent treatment products devoutly.</li>
            <li>this is more like a filler.  </li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with this product and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li>but there are many products which do it so much better.</li>
            <li>I used it for over a year because I didn&#x27;t know there was anything better, and saw no improvement in skin surface or lines...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years or more.</li>
            <li>product does not work in anyway, I love Olay products, NOT THIS ONE.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I love the Olay line of products.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and will buy again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>In love, love, love.</li>
            <li>So smooth!</li>
            <li>Guess I need to become a movie star and get a pro to do my face, or surgery, or just learn to accept the wrinkles more graciously....</li>
            <li>They claim with more use, more results...</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Olay treatment seem more like a primer, I have oily skin and the areas were</li>
            <li>This cream fills pores to make your make-up look smoother &amp; give it a more finished look--it doesn&#x27;t repair skin pores.  </li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit on your finger fills in wrinkle lines and makes your face look flawless.</li>
            <li>I thought this product might work well for me, and I was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li>and my makeup applies smooth and easy!</li>
            <li>I found that Olay filling and sealing wrinkle treatment works wonders on fine lines and wrinkles,,...wish it did more for deeper lines.</li>
            <li>Works on fine lines I love it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I picked this up last night having never heard of it, yet figuring I&#x27;d try it at an excellent price in comparison to its full price.</li>
            <li>Best for filling in and hiding big pores, acne scars, some wrinkles and discoloration without any added shine - nice matte finish for those with oily skin and good refresher during those long days out.</li>
            <li>Not even the tiniest wrinkle was filled, and it looked too cakey to add more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to use if instructions are followed.</li>
            <li>First I kind of smeared in in with my fingers.</li>
            <li>I finally started smoothing it on over my foundation and found that it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>I used it on the fine lines around my mouth and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Save your money, after using this product I saw no difference in my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>did not like couldn&#x27;t see any difference even on fine lines</li>
            <li>It does not change the appearance of the fine lines at all.  </li>
            <li>it in my fine lines-</li>
            <li>I use this for fine lines on my forehead...</li>
            <li>It does help mask my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I see a huge difference when I use it.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth</li>
            <li>Makes it feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>Now the concept is great if it actually worked...</li>
            <li>Fantastic for price.</li>
            <li>Makes foundation go on so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems applying a light tinted moisturizer over it</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does not smell.</li>
            <li>it is effecive and smooth</li>
            <li>This product really does a pretty good job of filling in wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>but I found it to be a nice quick fix that reduces the look of my large pores and frown lines and serves as a makeup primer as well.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick delivery, I will be ordering regularly!</li>
            <li>There was a quite notable improvement in the wrinkles, even from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I went to see if the store I bought originally still carried this product, it did not.  </li>
            <li>The finer the lines the more invisible they were, with ones a little deeper being GREATLY reduced almost to nothing.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to a lot of products, but this one never bothers me  I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to use and blends in easily.</li>
            <li>so I was super excited to try it when I received it..</li>
            <li>Checked after an hour - crow&#x27;s feet still in full feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s supposed to sit on top of the skin - if you try to really rub it in, it will get flaky and not-so-great looking).</li>
            <li>I recently gave some to a friend and she called me thrilled over the way it hid her wrinkles and it has  a light color - it helped  even her skin tone .</li>
            <li>Sometimes I don&#x27;t even use a foundation at all because this leaves such a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It seems to function in the same way as a foundation primer, however, it works better for me than the many primers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions - first apply one&#x27;s moisterizer and then lightly rub this one around your eyes so that it acts like filler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It reminds me of spackle you would use on a wall, although it is gentle, non-irritating, and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, and has lessened the appearance of the smile lines.</li>
            <li>Its softens my fine lines and it fills my large pores like nothing else..</li>
            <li>It also works perfect when you apply a OLAY facial daily moisturizer first.</li>
            <li>I like the way this product feels on skin - really does smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I apply it more heavily on my deep wrinkles and smooth it on everywhere else.</li>
            <li>I have laugh lines on either side of my mouth and a squint line between my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>My sister said wow your face looks so smooth!</li>
            <li>I broke out immediately around the area where I used it which is around my mouth to conceal one laugh line  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny you would pay for it.</li>
            <li>It actually dries around those fine forehead lines and accentuates those fine lines into full blown wrinkles</li>
            <li>It seems to be a version of the &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; creams that are on the market right now but marketed to a more mature age group.</li>
            <li>Certainly for special occasions or going out at night you can bet I&#x27;ll have it on.</li>
            <li>If they had more at that price I would go stock up lol, though with how little you have to use and the size of the tube, it will last awhile.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product as long as you understand what you&#x27;re ordering.</li>
            <li>Product makes my skin feel extremely soft, and evens out skin tone giving my face a fresh, smooth look.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product of many that has worked right before my eyes.  </li>
            <li>(I use the Regenerist and like it very much, but have used the Night Cream which did nothing for me.)  </li>
            <li>Then I dispensed it directly into the lines, waited about 30 seconds &amp; used my fingers to lightly press it in.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>The OLAY wrinkle treatment does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>This works ok the moment I put it on but by the time I&#x27;m at work, I&#x27;m back to where I started.</li>
            <li>but it gets pretty close.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, nothing will have us looking 21 again, but this product dries funny and doesn&#x27;t look well under make-up.  </li>
            <li>This is my second tube of Regenerist Filling and Sealing Wrinkle Treatment and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It just did not do anything, I used exactly as the instructions suggest.  </li>
            <li>On many facial or beauty products, they work as intended - nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>One tube lasts me a good few months.</li>
            <li>But it looked good for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I found that this does seem to erase my very fine lines (eyes) but the ones on upper lip not so much and the ones between the eyes not at all.  </li>
            <li>Okay, it&#x27;s not a miracle and it won&#x27;t do much for deep lines.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkle fix benefits, but as a base, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried, better than MAC.</li>
            <li>too what seemed like a long look at me and then asked \\&quot;Okay</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not going to make wrinkles and pores look better long term</li>
            <li>Olay stayed dry looking and wrinkles were more visible.</li>
            <li>Does not fill and certainly does not seal.  </li>
            <li>I applied it with a light touch and was amazed at how those little fine lines just disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I am only in my 20s, but i already have fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years and seen huge improvements in my skin, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Rolls off skin if too much is used.</li>
            <li>works really well just as promised...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really dissappointed and won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This product really fills in the lines and creases under your eyes, around mouth,  and on forehead.  </li>
            <li>and the very lines I bought this for were almost GONE.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Really helps to diminish some of the lines on your face.</li>
            <li>i didnt see results too much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also gentle.  </li>
            <li>Each morning, I wash my face and then apply a SPF moisturizer, then when I am ready to put on makeup I apply this treatment around my eyes, mouth, chin and t-zone.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels on my skin, very silky</li>
            <li>Works really well and arrived when they said it would.</li>
            <li>this product really works</li>
            <li>I think this may happen when too much product is applied.</li>
            <li>But it absolutely makes lines disappear.</li>
            <li>Really works well around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I do really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fair and delicate skin.</li>
            <li>In natural light right next to a window as I dabbed</li>
            <li>Like so many other products that make claims like Regenerist does</li>
            <li>It does work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If you are older and really have some set in wrinkles, it will not do anything at all.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful to apply it immediately after applying a good moisturizer or it will be dry and flake on your face.</li>
            <li>I did noticed instantly, that my face felt soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>My sister and I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I said nope &amp; don&#x27;t need it any more.. a little moisturizer and Olay Regenerist Filling &amp; Sealing..</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little more fill.  </li>
            <li>This might be good for a 20-something, but for the more mature woman with few to moderate wrinkles, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but when I do, it works great can&#x27;t see the lines so much</li>
            <li>I give it a good not great</li>
            <li>Saw hardly no difference no matter how I used it, with or without moisturizer, foundation, etc.</li>
            <li>If you move or touch it, say to apply makeup over it, it&#x27;s likely to roll right off just as spackle falls away from an unpainted wall.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to call it a miracle product, but it truly filled the deep wrinkles and made things smooth enough to then apply base and coverup, etc., and worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>New in pkg as pictured.</li>
            <li>although I&#x27;m not sure to which to give more credit...</li>
            <li>But, WOW!</li>
            <li>Actually seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>It does smooth lines *slightly</li>
            <li>I asked an online Olay consultant to recommend a product that would diminish the appearance of fine lines, if only for 8 hours...something like leaving on a facial peel (i.e. Swiss Peel), only it would not flake/peel off until washed off.    </li>
            <li>Just wish it had a bit more tint...a little chalky on the upper lip...</li>
            <li>Hard to find in most drugstores.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars due to the peeling look if not applied quickly.</li>
            <li>It fills in my wrinkles and smooths out my skin by filling in all the pores and textures that my 48 year old skin has.</li>
            <li>It may not fill in the deep wrinkles completely, but it does fill them and everything else on your face enough to make it worth using.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough.</li>
            <li>People ask how I can look so young at 59</li>
            <li>Wow, was I surprised at the fact that this truly does blend away some of the finer lines.</li>
            <li>Since I have added this, I am receiving compliments like &amp;#34;you look so young, what are you doing?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>it the old college try, but ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much cheaper than some department store products that claim to do the same thing for 3x the price.</li>
            <li>This product works awesome as a makeup base.</li>
            <li>Good to mix with base makeup for smooth coverage.</li>
            <li>I have one major crease at the top of my nose, and while it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it entirely, it definitely makes it less visible.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and be sure not to overwork it</li>
            <li>It has a subtle tint, it definitely fills-in/softens those little lines under the eye and over the top lip and makeup goes smoothly over it without caking or smearing.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really enjoying the silky feel of the product as it sinks into the trouble lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this for the very early stages of wrinkles only.</li>
            <li>They work for me as I have sensitive skin and the high dollar big name brands only irritate my skin and cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it actually helps reduce fine lines or just cover them up.</li>
            <li>Very good to use as a base under liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I generally like Olay products, so</li>
            <li>Lastly, I applied it directly to the lines again, let it sit &amp; used a makeup sponge to barely tap it in place.</li>
            <li>This completely softens deep wrinkles around my eyes and lips.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell this is essentially face spackle.</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed as I had purchased based on other reviews and cannot believe anyone with a wrinkle would recommend this stuff....</li>
            <li>Only teeny slight crinkles and a few slightly more noticeable forehead creases.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well aware the effects are gone when it&#x27;s washed off, yet couldn&#x27;t care less outside of that wishful thinking.</li>
            <li>It will fill in your slightly enlarged pores - not wrinkles nor large pores.</li>
            <li>I use it on my eyes, outer edges of my mouth, my neck and chest - all the fine and delicate skinned areas!  </li>
            <li>I thought it would act like a filler, or support to the skin that one wants to help to look less saggy.  </li>

            <li> this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li> Olay makes a very nice line of products in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and the smell is pleasant and not over-powering.  </li>
            <li> Frankly that&#x27;s all I needed to convince me that this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a darn good filler.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable to the quality and good price.</li>
            <li> They have something quite good packed into this baby.</li>
            <li> Good quality,  If used as directed, it works.  </li>
            <li> Web MD suggested the Olay Regenerist line of products were good.</li>
            <li> Since I have had good service from Amazon, I made my choice.  </li>
            <li> I heard so many great things on this products</li>
            <li> Works great and we love it.</li>
            <li> I love it works greay and gives hourr make up a very good look when iu apply on before your foundation :)</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> but I buy many Olay products so my savings add up by volume!</li>
            <li> This product had a very nice feel and went on easily.</li>
            <li> Well, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it...</li>
            <li> GREAT Product!!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone, who is looking for a flawless look.</li>
            <li> Ok, but not as good as Merle Norman.</li>
            <li> It is a nice temporary fix to fill in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;be effective.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> Kind of like stuffing your pores with wax</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> However, for fine lines around the mouth or eyes, it&#x27;s a pretty impressive solution.  </li>
            <li> The product is a nice lightweight texture but it seems I would need something thicker to cover most of the lines.</li>
            <li> The cream is light and smooth, and feels great on.</li>
            <li> I find the best foundation for the most natural, youthful, moist-looking skin is Olay CC cream.</li>
            <li> It sounds too good to be true and</li>
            <li> Have used this a couple times and it seems as though it is accentuating my fine line and wrinkles rather than eliminating them !</li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love all their products and it arrived so quickly with no issues!!</li>
            <li> It covers fine wrinkles nicely.</li>
            <li> Have not found a better product in 5 years.</li>
            <li> I love this product -- another reviewer mentioned that it takes away the shine...</li>
            <li> Great, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> But I love the way this stuff seemed to smoothand soften my skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it gets rid of them by magic, but the added moisture in the skin helps with elasticity.</li>
            <li> Love this product .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything better -</li>
            <li> it - you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But since there&#x27;s nothing better in the market, you can give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day; however, I do use more potent treatment products devoutly.</li>
            <li> this is more like a filler.  </li>
            <li> its ok.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with this product and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> but there are many products which do it so much better.</li>
            <li> I used it for over a year because I didn&#x27;t know there was anything better, and saw no improvement in skin surface or lines...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years or more.</li>
            <li> product does not work in anyway, I love Olay products, NOT THIS ONE.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I love the Olay line of products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> In love, love, love.</li>
            <li> So smooth!</li>
            <li> Guess I need to become a movie star and get a pro to do my face, or surgery, or just learn to accept the wrinkles more graciously....</li>
            <li> They claim with more use, more results...</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Olay treatment seem more like a primer, I have oily skin and the areas were</li>
            <li> This cream fills pores to make your make-up look smoother &amp; give it a more finished look--it doesn&#x27;t repair skin pores.  </li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit on your finger fills in wrinkle lines and makes your face look flawless.</li>
            <li> I thought this product might work well for me, and I was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li> and my makeup applies smooth and easy!</li>
            <li> I found that Olay filling and sealing wrinkle treatment works wonders on fine lines and wrinkles,,...wish it did more for deeper lines.</li>
            <li> Works on fine lines I love it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I picked this up last night having never heard of it, yet figuring I&#x27;d try it at an excellent price in comparison to its full price.</li>
            <li> Best for filling in and hiding big pores, acne scars, some wrinkles and discoloration without any added shine - nice matte finish for those with oily skin and good refresher during those long days out.</li>
            <li> Not even the tiniest wrinkle was filled, and it looked too cakey to add more.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to use if instructions are followed.</li>
            <li> First I kind of smeared in in with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I finally started smoothing it on over my foundation and found that it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> I used it on the fine lines around my mouth and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Save your money, after using this product I saw no difference in my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> did not like couldn&#x27;t see any difference even on fine lines</li>
            <li> It does not change the appearance of the fine lines at all.  </li>
            <li> it in my fine lines-</li>
            <li> I use this for fine lines on my forehead...</li>
            <li> It does help mask my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I see a huge difference when I use it.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth</li>
            <li> Makes it feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> Now the concept is great if it actually worked...</li>
            <li> Fantastic for price.</li>
            <li> Makes foundation go on so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems applying a light tinted moisturizer over it</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and does not smell.</li>
            <li> it is effecive and smooth</li>
            <li> This product really does a pretty good job of filling in wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> but I found it to be a nice quick fix that reduces the look of my large pores and frown lines and serves as a makeup primer as well.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick delivery, I will be ordering regularly!</li>
            <li> There was a quite notable improvement in the wrinkles, even from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I went to see if the store I bought originally still carried this product, it did not.  </li>
            <li> The finer the lines the more invisible they were, with ones a little deeper being GREATLY reduced almost to nothing.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of products, but this one never bothers me  I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to use and blends in easily.</li>
            <li> so I was super excited to try it when I received it..</li>
            <li> Checked after an hour - crow&#x27;s feet still in full feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s supposed to sit on top of the skin - if you try to really rub it in, it will get flaky and not-so-great looking).</li>
            <li> I recently gave some to a friend and she called me thrilled over the way it hid her wrinkles and it has  a light color - it helped  even her skin tone .</li>
            <li> Sometimes I don&#x27;t even use a foundation at all because this leaves such a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It seems to function in the same way as a foundation primer, however, it works better for me than the many primers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions - first apply one&#x27;s moisterizer and then lightly rub this one around your eyes so that it acts like filler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It reminds me of spackle you would use on a wall, although it is gentle, non-irritating, and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, and has lessened the appearance of the smile lines.</li>
            <li> Its softens my fine lines and it fills my large pores like nothing else..</li>
            <li> It also works perfect when you apply a OLAY facial daily moisturizer first.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product feels on skin - really does smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I apply it more heavily on my deep wrinkles and smooth it on everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have laugh lines on either side of my mouth and a squint line between my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> My sister said wow your face looks so smooth!</li>
            <li> I broke out immediately around the area where I used it which is around my mouth to conceal one laugh line  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny you would pay for it.</li>
            <li> It actually dries around those fine forehead lines and accentuates those fine lines into full blown wrinkles</li>
            <li> It seems to be a version of the &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; creams that are on the market right now but marketed to a more mature age group.</li>
            <li> Certainly for special occasions or going out at night you can bet I&#x27;ll have it on.</li>
            <li> If they had more at that price I would go stock up lol, though with how little you have to use and the size of the tube, it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product as long as you understand what you&#x27;re ordering.</li>
            <li> Product makes my skin feel extremely soft, and evens out skin tone giving my face a fresh, smooth look.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product of many that has worked right before my eyes.  </li>
            <li> (I use the Regenerist and like it very much, but have used the Night Cream which did nothing for me.)  </li>
            <li> Then I dispensed it directly into the lines, waited about 30 seconds &amp; used my fingers to lightly press it in.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> The OLAY wrinkle treatment does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li> This works ok the moment I put it on but by the time I&#x27;m at work, I&#x27;m back to where I started.</li>
            <li> but it gets pretty close.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, nothing will have us looking 21 again, but this product dries funny and doesn&#x27;t look well under make-up.  </li>
            <li> This is my second tube of Regenerist Filling and Sealing Wrinkle Treatment and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It just did not do anything, I used exactly as the instructions suggest.  </li>
            <li> On many facial or beauty products, they work as intended - nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> One tube lasts me a good few months.</li>
            <li> But it looked good for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I found that this does seem to erase my very fine lines (eyes) but the ones on upper lip not so much and the ones between the eyes not at all.  </li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s not a miracle and it won&#x27;t do much for deep lines.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkle fix benefits, but as a base, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried, better than MAC.</li>
            <li> too what seemed like a long look at me and then asked \\&quot;Okay</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not going to make wrinkles and pores look better long term</li>
            <li> Olay stayed dry looking and wrinkles were more visible.</li>
            <li> Does not fill and certainly does not seal.  </li>
            <li> I applied it with a light touch and was amazed at how those little fine lines just disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I am only in my 20s, but i already have fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years and seen huge improvements in my skin, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Rolls off skin if too much is used.</li>
            <li> works really well just as promised...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really dissappointed and won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> This product really fills in the lines and creases under your eyes, around mouth,  and on forehead.  </li>
            <li> and the very lines I bought this for were almost GONE.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Really helps to diminish some of the lines on your face.</li>
            <li> i didnt see results too much</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also gentle.  </li>
            <li> Each morning, I wash my face and then apply a SPF moisturizer, then when I am ready to put on makeup I apply this treatment around my eyes, mouth, chin and t-zone.</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my skin, very silky</li>
            <li> Works really well and arrived when they said it would.</li>
            <li> this product really works</li>
            <li> I think this may happen when too much product is applied.</li>
            <li> But it absolutely makes lines disappear.</li>
            <li> Really works well around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I do really like this cream.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fair and delicate skin.</li>
            <li> In natural light right next to a window as I dabbed</li>
            <li> Like so many other products that make claims like Regenerist does</li>
            <li> It does work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If you are older and really have some set in wrinkles, it will not do anything at all.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful to apply it immediately after applying a good moisturizer or it will be dry and flake on your face.</li>
            <li> I did noticed instantly, that my face felt soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> My sister and I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I said nope &amp; don&#x27;t need it any more.. a little moisturizer and Olay Regenerist Filling &amp; Sealing..</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little more fill.  </li>
            <li> This might be good for a 20-something, but for the more mature woman with few to moderate wrinkles, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but when I do, it works great can&#x27;t see the lines so much</li>
            <li> I give it a good not great</li>
            <li> Saw hardly no difference no matter how I used it, with or without moisturizer, foundation, etc.</li>
            <li> If you move or touch it, say to apply makeup over it, it&#x27;s likely to roll right off just as spackle falls away from an unpainted wall.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to call it a miracle product, but it truly filled the deep wrinkles and made things smooth enough to then apply base and coverup, etc., and worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> New in pkg as pictured.</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m not sure to which to give more credit...</li>
            <li> But, WOW!</li>
            <li> Actually seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> It does smooth lines *slightly</li>
            <li> I asked an online Olay consultant to recommend a product that would diminish the appearance of fine lines, if only for 8 hours...something like leaving on a facial peel (i.e. Swiss Peel), only it would not flake/peel off until washed off.    </li>
            <li> Just wish it had a bit more tint...a little chalky on the upper lip...</li>
            <li> Hard to find in most drugstores.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars due to the peeling look if not applied quickly.</li>
            <li> It fills in my wrinkles and smooths out my skin by filling in all the pores and textures that my 48 year old skin has.</li>
            <li> It may not fill in the deep wrinkles completely, but it does fill them and everything else on your face enough to make it worth using.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough.</li>
            <li> People ask how I can look so young at 59</li>
            <li> Wow, was I surprised at the fact that this truly does blend away some of the finer lines.</li>
            <li> Since I have added this, I am receiving compliments like &amp;#34;you look so young, what are you doing?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> it the old college try, but ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much cheaper than some department store products that claim to do the same thing for 3x the price.</li>
            <li> This product works awesome as a makeup base.</li>
            <li> Good to mix with base makeup for smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> I have one major crease at the top of my nose, and while it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it entirely, it definitely makes it less visible.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and be sure not to overwork it</li>
            <li> It has a subtle tint, it definitely fills-in/softens those little lines under the eye and over the top lip and makeup goes smoothly over it without caking or smearing.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really enjoying the silky feel of the product as it sinks into the trouble lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this for the very early stages of wrinkles only.</li>
            <li> They work for me as I have sensitive skin and the high dollar big name brands only irritate my skin and cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually helps reduce fine lines or just cover them up.</li>
            <li> Very good to use as a base under liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I generally like Olay products, so</li>
            <li> Lastly, I applied it directly to the lines again, let it sit &amp; used a makeup sponge to barely tap it in place.</li>
            <li> This completely softens deep wrinkles around my eyes and lips.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell this is essentially face spackle.</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed as I had purchased based on other reviews and cannot believe anyone with a wrinkle would recommend this stuff....</li>
            <li> Only teeny slight crinkles and a few slightly more noticeable forehead creases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well aware the effects are gone when it&#x27;s washed off, yet couldn&#x27;t care less outside of that wishful thinking.</li>
            <li> It will fill in your slightly enlarged pores - not wrinkles nor large pores.</li>
            <li> I use it on my eyes, outer edges of my mouth, my neck and chest - all the fine and delicate skinned areas!  </li>
            <li> I thought it would act like a filler, or support to the skin that one wants to help to look less saggy.  </li>
            <li> But I am proof this product really helps hiding those small wrinkles, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I use several Regenerist moisturizing products and like them very much but this &#x27;filling &amp; sealing wrinkle treatment&#x27; did nothing for me except emphasize the small area where I used it - gave the area a matte finish but didn&#x27;t seem to &#x27;fill&#x27; even a bit - most disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled with the product when I first used it under my foundation because it seemed like any effect was muted.</li>
            <li> It really works for those small wrinkles around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell</li>
            <li> This product did not work and left my skin looking very dry.</li>
            <li> That never hurts us middle aged folk.</li>
            <li> So, lasts a long time for the price paid.</li>
            <li> It doesnt say it will make them disappear long</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so I will keep using it as long as I can.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive items work much better.  </li>
            <li> Powdering over the product helps a little, but again, it just doesn&#x27;t last well enough throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Allows the skin to remain moist and pliable all day long!</li>
            <li> If you wear foundation apply it immediately after putting on this filler, otherwise it will dry and cake.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the formula contained some active treatment benefit versus just &#x27;filling and sealing.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I could have used the $$ to simply pay someone to tell me how young I looked - at least that would have provided temprary solace.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will make the wrinkle go away, but it definitely makes it much less noticeable</li>
            <li> I think the reviewers who gave this 2 or less stars expected this product to \\&quot;turn back the clock,\\&quot; which it does not...</li>
            <li> a little powder using a big brush &amp;</li>
            <li> I went back to IS Clinical Youth Complex - a product where I could actually tell a difference from using.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was a total waste of money and my time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to women who have minimal wrinkle concerns.  </li>
            <li> Works well as primer, does not really fill wrinkles though.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have such uneven skin tone I wouldn&#x27;t even be putting make-up (cover-up) on over this.</li>
            <li> I applied it around my eyes, and after it dried, they looked about the same.  </li>
            <li> I only need a few words.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money personally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other products on the market that claim to do the same, but there is little result.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, DOES NOT work!</li>
            <li> It does NOT cake up like other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Regenerist Filling and Sealing Wrinkle Treatment due to the recommendations made for skin care on the olay.com website.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works on deep wrinkles or not, but it does wonders for small wrinkles/lines.</li>
            <li> I also use it a night with other night creams I am trying.</li>
            <li> And price is small reduction from big box or pharmacy</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT WORTH A PENNY.  </li>
            <li> i mean tiny) of this product and</li>
            <li> While it comes in a small one ounce tube, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wear it over moisturizer (Cetaphil) and then dab foundation -- need a lot less foundation when using this product.  </li>
            <li> Well, this product made the wrinkles much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have tiny lines around my eyes and lips--nothing serious.  </li>
            <li> I even put it on half my face to compare the difference.</li>
            <li> How they got away with calling this a \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; (much less a \\&quot;filler\\&quot;) is beyond my understanding.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a month and a half</li>
            <li> I see a slight difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> ; it, plumps it up, and makes it look less visible.  </li>
            <li> So, I figured every little bit helps.  </li>
            <li> It basically works like a filler, but after 5-6 hours, it begins to get bally and rolls off in little pieces.</li>
            <li> While it does smooth your skin a bit, it&#x27;s too liquidy for that poreless look, doesn&#x27;t last, and worst of all, made me break out--and I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> it was waste of money to me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, even if it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> bad, because the price is right.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I see the other reviews are negative</li>
            <li> Then I used my small concealer makeup brush to try to spackle it in.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what the difference may be</li>
            <li> I also read somewhere that it has a small amount of skin care treatment in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> It smooths on the skin, fills in the finer wrinkles/lines and leaves behind a matte finish making them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a $20 miracle, but at least something to lessen the appearance not bring attention to them.  </li>
            <li> I planned to be a sucker and grant this miracle product a try.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it promises (at least for me).  </li>
            <li> It truly fills small wrinkles so they are not noticable all day!</li>
            <li> But seriously, my husband jokes about my imaginary wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me this product was difficult to apply properly &amp; did not work.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it was less expensive to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money!!!</li>
            <li> I was not happy about that</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost like a thin putty, leaving you wishing it was a permanent fix</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed -- difficult to use regardless of how small amount it still balls up when attempting to put anything on over it.  </li>
            <li> ok...did not have dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Now she has very few, very faint lines, so I can&#x27;t say how this stuff would work on deeper lines.</li>
            <li> Have even tried the expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> MY SECRET!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, kids.</li>
            <li> I have a vertical line between my eyebrows that makes me look angry.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that it is awful and not worth any money at all.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed as it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I cannot see how anyone could be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hate it, But don&#x27;t use it either.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very bad wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I purchase a lot of Olay products and this is the worst purchase I have ever made.  </li>
            <li> --it looks awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This completely softens deep wrinkles around my eyes and lips. Have not found a better product in 5 years. Have even tried the expensive department store brands. This works the best. MY SECRET!  It does NOT cake up like other reviewers have said. Hard to find in most drugstores. I just order from amazon!</li>
            <li> Super disappointed. Rolls off skin if too much is used. Don&#x27;t use enough? No results. Saw hardly no difference no matter how I used it, with or without moisturizer, foundation, etc. For the price, it was a total waste of money and my time.</li>
            <li> I love this product -- another reviewer mentioned that it takes away the shine...I hadn&#x27;t realized it but it&#x27;s true!  Product makes my skin feel extremely soft, and evens out skin tone giving my face a fresh, smooth look.  I wear it over moisturizer (Cetaphil) and then dab foundation -- need a lot less foundation when using this product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This might be good for a 20-something, but for the more mature woman with few to moderate wrinkles, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Sometimes wear it without makeup. My skin looks smooth but I don&#x27;t have to worry about make up getting on my shirt</li>
            <li> I use several Regenerist moisturizing products and like them very much but this &#x27;filling &amp; sealing wrinkle treatment&#x27; did nothing for me except emphasize the small area where I used it - gave the area a matte finish but didn&#x27;t seem to &#x27;fill&#x27; even a bit - most disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great product to soften and cover wrinkles. It&#x27;s fast and easy to use and blends in easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very bad wrinkles. Only teeny slight crinkles and a few slightly more noticeable forehead creases. But seriously, my husband jokes about my imaginary wrinkles. They still bother me, so I thought I would give the Olay Wrinkle Filler a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried applying this several different ways to try to get it to work. First I kind of smeared in in with my fingers. Nope. Then I dispensed it directly into the lines, waited about 30 seconds &amp; used my fingers to lightly press it in. Nope. Then I used my small concealer makeup brush to try to spackle it in. Nope. Lastly, I applied it directly to the lines again, let it sit &amp; used a makeup sponge to barely tap it in place. Nope. If this product can&#x27;t fill in my imaginary wrinkles, they aren&#x27;t going help yours.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today.  I used it on the fine lines around my mouth and around my eyes.  I applied it with a light touch and was amazed at how those little fine lines just disappeared.  When I walked into work one of my coworkers too what seemed like a long look at me and then asked \\&quot;Okay, what did you do differently because your skin looks awesome!\\&quot;  Frankly that&#x27;s all I needed to convince me that this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this over my moisturizer. It fills in my wrinkles and smooths out my skin by filling in all the pores and textures that my 48 year old skin has. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can say this does nothing. It may not fill in the deep wrinkles completely, but it does fill them and everything else on your face enough to make it worth using. I apply it more heavily on my deep wrinkles and smooth it on everywhere else. I don&#x27;t rub it in and I don&#x27;t overwork the product because that seems to make it flake. I put it on and let it set up. I don&#x27;t use it to repair my skin. I use it to cover my flaws. I give it 5 stars because I think it does what It claims.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT WORTH A PENNY.  If you are older and really have some set in wrinkles, it will not do anything at all.  I was very dissappointed as I had purchased based on other reviews and cannot believe anyone with a wrinkle would recommend this stuff....Olay should be ashamed.  I purchase a lot of Olay products and this is the worst purchase I have ever made.  I ended up throwing it away as it doesn&#x27;t work and you can&#x27;t even use it as a moisterizer because it doesn&#x27;t spread like a cream.  All I can say is that it is awful and not worth any money at all. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Great, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the only product of many that has worked right before my eyes.  I am 50 and have deep set wrinkles around my eyes.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it...I see the other reviews are negative so I&#x27;m not sure what the difference may be and I don&#x27;t want to call it a miracle product, but it truly filled the deep wrinkles and made things smooth enough to then apply base and coverup, etc., and worked beautifully.  I really can&#x27;t say enough. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Save your money, after using this product I saw no difference in my fine lines.  I am sticking with ROC</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell if it work or not</li>
            <li> This is a darn good filler. It smooths on the skin, fills in the finer wrinkles/lines and leaves behind a matte finish making them less noticeable. I was not thrilled with the product when I first used it under my foundation because it seemed like any effect was muted. I finally started smoothing it on over my foundation and found that it worked beautifully. I use a mineral foundation, let it set while I do my eyes and then put this on last. Works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This product had a very nice feel and went on easily. It made my forehead wrinkles seem to vanish. Might buy it again. Not sure if it actually helps reduce fine lines or just cover them up. Worked well for a temporary fix!</li>
            <li> works really well just as promised...no reason we guys shouldn&#x27;t use it...and i do, regularly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go out of the house with out it! My wrinkles disappear. My deepest wrinkles soften.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Regenerist Filling and Sealing Wrinkle Treatment due to the recommendations made for skin care on the olay.com website.  I would recommend this product to women who have minimal wrinkle concerns.  I found that this product provides some visible results for my wrinkle concerns.  I intend to look at the Pro-X line for a product that can address my moderate wrinkle concerns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dedicated to Olay products from their moisturizers, facial wash (both facial towels &amp; cleansing cream in a tube.)  I&#x27;ve used the regenerist products &amp; decided to try this.  I don&#x27;t have any deep lines, wrinkles or \\&quot;ridges\\&quot;.  So, I figured every little bit helps.  In my opinion, this does nothing it touts.  I&#x27;m really dissappointed and won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li> I am 58 and did not expect a miracle. But I love the way this stuff seemed to smoothand soften my skin. It also helped my makeup to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I give it a good not great</li>
            <li> did not like couldn&#x27;t see any difference even on fine lines</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it gets rid of them by magic, but the added moisture in the skin helps with elasticity.</li>
            <li> Love this product . Works well . People ask how I can look so young at 59</li>
            <li> The OLAY wrinkle treatment does exactly what it says...it fills in and seals. I don&#x27;t know if it works on deep wrinkles or not, but it does wonders for small wrinkles/lines. It also works perfect when you apply a OLAY facial daily moisturizer first. I did noticed instantly, that my face felt soft and smooth afterwards. GREAT Product!!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone, who is looking for a flawless look.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  This works ok the moment I put it on but by the time I&#x27;m at work, I&#x27;m back to where I started. I get longer lasting results from a basic makeup primer that contains dimethicone. And that&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I think the reviewers who gave this 2 or less stars expected this product to \\&quot;turn back the clock,\\&quot; which it does not... but it gets pretty close.  I am only in my 20s, but i already have fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth.  Just a tiny bit (and i mean tiny) of this product and the lines are instantly reduced in appearance. Works great!</li>
            <li> Bought this on the recommendation from a coworker.  I have laugh lines on either side of my mouth and a squint line between my eyebrows.  No difference with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this along with my Elizabeth Arden face cream and my forehead looks years younger...although I&#x27;m not sure to which to give more credit...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 6 months. It works very well. I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable to the quality and good price. Just be careful to apply it immediately after applying a good moisturizer or it will be dry and flake on your face. Then you&#x27;ll have to wash your face and start over. I&#x27;m sold on this product. It covers fine wrinkles nicely.I recently gave some to a friend and she called me thrilled over the way it hid her wrinkles and it has  a light color - it helped  even her skin tone . I gave it 4 stars due to the peeling look if not applied quickly. Amazon does a very good job with all my shipping.  MKS</li>
            <li> I have lines on my upper lip.  That&#x27;s what I use this for.  I just put a dab on a couple of times a day.  Makes it feel smooth.  Great seller, shipment arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I heard so many great things on this products so I was super excited to try it when I received it..I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed with the results...Its softens my fine lines and it fills my large pores like nothing else..This will definitely be one of my holy grail products..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything better - you can watch the wrinkles disappear!&lt;br /&gt;Try it - you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;I do!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for Filling + Sealing Wrinkle product, this one is only \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  But since there&#x27;s nothing better in the market, you can give it a try.  When initially putting it on, it seems to be doing the job.  But the problem is, it doesn&#x27;t have staying power.  If your upper lip becomes moist or sweats, it just melts away.  Powdering over the product helps a little, but again, it just doesn&#x27;t last well enough throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product.  (I use the Regenerist and like it very much, but have used the Night Cream which did nothing for me.)  Well, this product made the wrinkles much less noticeable.  It does it by taking the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; out of your skin and \\&quot;fills\\&quot; in the lines.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Need to get a refund. No improvement on my skin. Try a different product. This was a no go product.</li>
            <li> Ok, but not as good as Merle Norman.</li>
            <li> Have used this a couple times and it seems as though it is accentuating my fine line and wrinkles rather than eliminating them ! Not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years and seen huge improvements in my skin, especially around my eyes.  The cream is light and smooth, and feels great on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out some cheapy versions of the excellent Velvet Skin Coat. This isn&#x27;t the one. While it does smooth your skin a bit, it&#x27;s too liquidy for that poreless look, doesn&#x27;t last, and worst of all, made me break out--and I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, because the price is right.</li>
            <li> I have tiny lines around my eyes and lips--nothing serious.  I asked an online Olay consultant to recommend a product that would diminish the appearance of fine lines, if only for 8 hours...something like leaving on a facial peel (i.e. Swiss Peel), only it would not flake/peel off until washed off.    The consultant recommended the Regenerist filler. I generally like Olay products, so I thought this product might work well for me, and I was very excited to try it. IT DOES NOTHING FOR ME!      I am so disappointed as it is very expensive.  It does not change the appearance of the fine lines at all.  Plus you cannot leave it on because it is flaky--it looks awful.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hate it, But don&#x27;t use it either.  Let&#x27;s face it, nothing will have us looking 21 again, but this product dries funny and doesn&#x27;t look well under make-up.  It actually dries around those fine forehead lines and accentuates those fine lines into full blown wrinkles LOL  I wasn&#x27;t looking for a $20 miracle, but at least something to lessen the appearance not bring attention to them.  Now the concept is great if it actually worked...</li>
            <li> New in pkg as pictured. Works well as primer, does not really fill wrinkles though.</li>
            <li> I love it works greay and gives hourr make up a very good look when iu apply on before your foundation :)</li>
            <li> Not impressed -- difficult to use regardless of how small amount it still balls up when attempting to put anything on over it.  Wasted my money!!!</li>
            <li> It is the best thing I have found in my price range that I feel helps my face not to look so &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I do NOT work for this company and have no reason to try to sell this product.)&lt;br /&gt;  I planned to be a sucker and grant this miracle product a try. I&#x27;ve seen other products on the market that claim to do the same, but there is little result. But, WOW! It really works. I even put it on half my face to compare the difference. There was a quite notable improvement in the wrinkles, even from the first time I used it. A friend even said something. Now, it is not a magic product it can only fill in so much, but it&#x27;s worth the small investment to look younger - even if it is temporary.) I also read somewhere that it has a small amount of skin care treatment in the ingredients. That never hurts us middle aged folk. I must say, &amp;#34;I recommend it highly.&amp;#34; THIS IS NOT A GIMMICK used to sell another product. It works. My friend asked me what was in it and jokingly I said, &amp;#34;Pladough and plastic.&amp;#34; (I have no idea what is in it.) BUT WOW!&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t use it every day; however, I do use more potent treatment products devoutly. Certainly for special occasions or going out at night you can bet I&#x27;ll have it on. It sounds too good to be true and not all of my wrinkles are gone of course. But hey, try it. They have something quite good packed into this baby.</li>
            <li> it was waste of money to me.  It may work for somebody, but it did not work on my face anyway.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, no difference seen here.</li>
            <li> This is my go to finishing my face for the day product. It truly fills small wrinkles so they are not noticable all day! Won&#x27;t leave home without putting this on!</li>
            <li> I have used Regenerist for years. It is a nice temporary fix to fill in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Good quality,  If used as directed, it works.  You do not need a lot to have it&lt;br /&gt;be effective.  So, lasts a long time for the price paid.</li>
            <li> i figured there was no product for erasing wrinkles.  this is more like a filler.  its ok.</li>
            <li> Web MD suggested the Olay Regenerist line of products were good. Unfortunately for me this product was difficult to apply properly &amp; did not work. It also leaves white on your skin. Not invisible.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it but one time but like it</li>
            <li> I found that Olay filling and sealing wrinkle treatment works wonders on fine lines and wrinkles,,...wish it did more for deeper lines. Overall, very happy with this product and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, DOES NOT work!</li>
            <li> I found that this does seem to erase my very fine lines (eyes) but the ones on upper lip not so much and the ones between the eyes not at all.  The product is a nice lightweight texture but it seems I would need something thicker to cover most of the lines. I recommend this for the very early stages of wrinkles only. I will look for another product next time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fulfill it&#x27;s claim. In addition this was ordered through Amazon but not received from Amazon. It was supplied through another supplier which meant a separate shipiing charge. I was not happy about that</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s not a miracle and it won&#x27;t do much for deep lines.  However, for fine lines around the mouth or eyes, it&#x27;s a pretty impressive solution.  I see a huge difference when I use it.  Wholeheartedly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product really fills in the lines and creases under your eyes, around mouth,  and on forehead.  Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> No restuls! Disspaointed</li>
            <li> It does smooth lines *slightly*, but there are many products which do it so much better. How they got away with calling this a \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; (much less a \\&quot;filler\\&quot;) is beyond my understanding. I used it for over a year because I didn&#x27;t know there was anything better, and saw no improvement in skin surface or lines...in all of that time! Two weeks of ROC Deep Wrinkle Serum (which was CHEAPER than this!) and the very lines I bought this for were almost GONE. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, even if it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It really works for those small wrinkles around your eyes.  I went to see if the store I bought originally still carried this product, it did not.  So, I went to Olay&#x27;s website to see about purchasing the product.  I was given choices of places to buy this product.  Since I have had good service from Amazon, I made my choice.  But I am proof this product really helps hiding those small wrinkles, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> For the price great product.  Improves the appearance of deep wrinkles expecially around the mouth.  I us it almost daily.  Fantastic for price.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick delivery, I will be ordering regularly!</li>
            <li> works great on wrinkles</li>
            <li> This product works awesome as a makeup base. I use it all over my face and on eyelids. Makes foundation go on so silky smooth. Haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkle fix benefits, but as a base, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried, better than MAC.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but when I do, it works great can&#x27;t see the lines so much and my makeup applies smooth and easy!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me.  I went back to IS Clinical Youth Complex - a product where I could actually tell a difference from using.</li>
            <li> Works great and we love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years or more. It really works.</li>
            <li> Does not fill and certainly does not seal.  Less expensive items work much better.  I wish I had saved my money.</li>
            <li> Really helps to diminish some of the lines on your face. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> You might as well throw your money away.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not work in anyway, I love Olay products, NOT THIS ONE.&lt;br /&gt;It cakes if you use the amount of product they recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Olay, just not the Sealing Wrinkle Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck,&lt;br /&gt;Georgia</li>
            <li> i didnt see results too much</li>
            <li> ok...did not have dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money. This product did not work and left my skin looking very dry.</li>
            <li> This is a \\&quot;Filling + sealing\\&quot; wrinkle treatment used to help conceal wrinkles, . It doesnt say it will make them disappear long term.&lt;br /&gt;It is great as a concealor under makeup. I use liquid makeup which can sometimes settle in lines but when I use the Olay product under my makeup wherever I have lines, my makeup glides on and doesn&#x27;t seem to settle in those wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;It is also gentle.  I am sensitive to a lot of products, but this one never bothers me  I love it!</li>
            <li> I used this product every day for about 8 weeks. I could see no discernible difference. Not as pricey as some others.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love it! In fact, I panic when I&#x27;m getting low! It noticeably the wrinkles around my eyes and lips and also &amp;#34;fills in&amp;#34; my pores. It reminds me of spackle you would use on a wall, although it is gentle, non-irritating, and washes off easily. Each morning, I wash my face and then apply a SPF moisturizer, then when I am ready to put on makeup I apply this treatment around my eyes, mouth, chin and t-zone. If you wear foundation apply it immediately after putting on this filler, otherwise it will dry and cake. One tube lasts me a good few months. I have recommended this product to my friends and family. Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Olay line of products. They work for me as I have sensitive skin and the high dollar big name brands only irritate my skin and cause me to break out. I will always use the Olay products.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product feels on skin - really does smooth it out.</li>
            <li> Very good to use as a base under liquid foundation. Fills in tiny lines</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of Regenerist Filling and Sealing Wrinkle Treatment and absolutely love it.  I use it on my eyes, outer edges of my mouth, my neck and chest - all the fine and delicate skinned areas!  Allows the skin to remain moist and pliable all day long!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Great for pores, helps with wrinkles, and under eye circles.  Good to mix with base makeup for smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this filler for two years in combination with some different foundations, always under the foundation but over Regenerist serum, which i give time to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; before applying the filler. I have extremely fair and delicate skin. I find the best foundation for the most natural, youthful, moist-looking skin is Olay CC cream. Using these three products together gets me rave reviews from my dermatologist who, even though she has my records, cannot believe I will soon be 65! Try it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  makes my pores disapear</li>
            <li> Love this product and will buy again</li>
            <li> I picked this up last night having never heard of it, yet figuring I&#x27;d try it at an excellent price in comparison to its full price. After washing my face with my olay, then using my olay regenerist serum and letting it soak in I figured I&#x27;d try this. In natural light right next to a window as I dabbed**** it in my fine lines- it was literally like magic!!!! I am astonished. The finer the lines the more invisible they were, with ones a little deeper being GREATLY reduced almost to nothing. I&#x27;m IN LOVE. it&#x27;s almost like a thin putty, leaving you wishing it was a permanent fix hahaha ;) I&#x27;m well aware the effects are gone when it&#x27;s washed off, yet couldn&#x27;t care less outside of that wishful thinking. I do wear make-up so this review is a bit premature as I&#x27;ve yet to put it on, but I&#x27;ll definitely update as the day goes on. I recommend without hesitation.  If they had more at that price I would go stock up lol, though with how little you have to use and the size of the tube, it will last awhile. If I didn&#x27;t have such uneven skin tone I wouldn&#x27;t even be putting make-up (cover-up) on over this. Try it- I cannot see how anyone could be disappointed.  In love, love, love.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my skin, very silky - however I cannot tell if it decreases the amount of wrinkles I have..</li>
            <li> Best for filling in and hiding big pores, acne scars, some wrinkles and discoloration without any added shine - nice matte finish for those with oily skin and good refresher during those long days out.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it was less expensive to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, and has lessened the appearance of the smile lines.</li>
            <li> Works really well and arrived when they said it would. I will probably purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Works well. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a month and a half and I&#x27;m really enjoying the silky feel of the product as it sinks into the trouble lines on my face.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and the smell is pleasant and not over-powering.  I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I lov Olay Regenerist filling.  I use this everyday.  Can&#x27;t be without it.  works great.  I will continue to use and recommend this product to all women.</li>
            <li> This product really does a pretty good job of filling in wrinkles.  It is also easy to use if instructions are followed.</li>
            <li> Wow, was I surprised at the fact that this truly does blend away some of the finer lines. I have one major crease at the top of my nose, and while it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it entirely, it definitely makes it less visible. Very impressed with this.</li>
            <li> This is a must for your daily a.m. and p.m. routine.  Since I have added this, I am receiving compliments like &amp;#34;you look so young, what are you doing?&amp;#34;  I use this along with their micro-sculpting and I am in heaven!!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Wrinkles disappear and it feels great on the skin. So smooth!</li>
            <li> Sorry, kids. This spackle doesn&#x27;t work once you put any makeup on over it.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it the old college try, but ... Guess I need to become a movie star and get a pro to do my face, or surgery, or just learn to accept the wrinkles more graciously....</li>
            <li> Looks great on wrinkles for about 5 minutes.  I tried several times.  Even tried several applications over a 20 minute time period.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t do miracles as I thought it would, but it is a very good lotion.  Packaged well, arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell this is essentially face spackle. It will fill in your slightly enlarged pores - not wrinkles nor large pores. If you move or touch it, say to apply makeup over it, it&#x27;s likely to roll right off just as spackle falls away from an unpainted wall. Does nothing to improve skin at all.</li>
            <li> this product really works</li>
            <li> This product definitely helps soften the vertical lines between my brows and also conceals enlarged pores without clogging them. While it comes in a small one ounce tube, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using the same tube for several months. There is no perfumy scent (I do not detect any scent at all) and it leaves a nice matte finish.I&#x27;ve had no problems applying a light tinted moisturizer over it (none of the flaking that others have mentioned). I think this may happen when too much product is applied. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even use a foundation at all because this leaves such a nice smooth finish. It seems to function in the same way as a foundation primer, however, it works better for me than the many primers I&#x27;ve tried. My only wish is that the formula contained some active treatment benefit versus just &#x27;filling and sealing.&#x27; Despite this, I do appreciate the temporary concealing properties of this product and I will re-purchase it to serve as my primer.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and does not smell. I have tried putting it on under and over makeup. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. I see a slight difference around my eyes. But nothing around my mouth.. Do not use with the youth code protector as it balls up like rubber cement. I also use it a night with other night creams I am trying. They claim with more use, more results...I&#x27;ll update later .</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions - first apply one&#x27;s moisterizer and then lightly rub this one around your eyes so that it acts like filler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I figured this was sort of like Spackle, but for people&#x27;s faces instead of walls.  I thought it would act like a filler, or support to the skin that one wants to help to look less saggy.  I applied it around my eyes, and after it dried, they looked about the same.  Checked after an hour - crow&#x27;s feet still in full feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my thinking, this stuff does not make a bit of difference regarding the severity of look of skin that could use some help.  I could have used the $$ to simply pay someone to tell me how young I looked - at least that would have provided temprary solace.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my upper lip, and I think it helps &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; the lines that I have. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It basically works like a filler, but after 5-6 hours, it begins to get bally and rolls off in little pieces. Maybe I was using the incorrect amount. But it looked good for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I use this for fine lines on my forehead...I have a vertical line between my eyebrows that makes me look angry.  This temporarily &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; it, plumps it up, and makes it look less visible.  I don&#x27;t think it will make the wrinkle go away, but it definitely makes it much less noticeable so I will keep using it as long as I can.  It&#x27;s also much cheaper than some department store products that claim to do the same thing for 3x the price.</li>
            <li> I only need a few words.  It doesn&#x27;t do what it promises (at least for me).  Like so many other products that make claims like Regenerist does, I have not found one that delivers!</li>
            <li> it is effecive and smooth</li>
            <li> This product worked as described. Of course it is not going to erase all imperfections, but it does provide a smoother look to my skin. It does help mask my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! My sister said wow your face looks so smooth! She thought do you have make-up on which I always wear.. I said nope &amp; don&#x27;t need it any more.. a little moisturizer and Olay Regenerist Filling &amp; Sealing.. a little powder using a big brush &amp; that&#x27;s it! I luv the feeling of no make-up anymore!! woo hoo!!</li>
            <li> I tried this on above the lip wrinkles.  It just did not do anything, I used exactly as the instructions suggest.  Not even the tiniest wrinkle was filled, and it looked too cakey to add more.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had a bit more tint...a little chalky on the upper lip...</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to fill and reduce the appearance of  the wrinkles between the eyebrows referred to as the elevens.  I was hoping for a little more fill.  It does work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Well, this stuff is amazing. I bought it for my sister, because a friend of mine at work recommended it, and after my sister tried it out she called me to rave about it. During a recent visit she showed me how it covers up the lines on her forehead, and it&#x27;s freaky. Now she has very few, very faint lines, so I can&#x27;t say how this stuff would work on deeper lines. But it absolutely makes lines disappear. No joke. It goes on as a sort of matte finish and lines vanish! My sister and I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I broke out immediately around the area where I used it which is around my mouth to conceal one laugh line  , I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet , I may have been under the impression tho it was to correct on the spot which it doesn&#x27;t , but it also hasn&#x27;t done anything now in 3 weeks .</li>
            <li> What can I say...its Olay!! Nuff said. I love all their products and it arrived so quickly with no issues!! And price is small reduction from big box or pharmacy but I buy many Olay products so my savings add up by volume!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product as long as you understand what you&#x27;re ordering. It&#x27;s not a corrective cream so it&#x27;s not going to make wrinkles and pores look better long term but I found it to be a nice quick fix that reduces the look of my large pores and frown lines and serves as a makeup primer as well. It seems to be a version of the &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; creams that are on the market right now but marketed to a more mature age group. A little goes a long way and be sure not to overwork it (it&#x27;s supposed to sit on top of the skin - if you try to really rub it in, it will get flaky and not-so-great looking).</li>
            <li> Olay treatment seem more like a primer, I have oily skin and the areas were I applied Olay stayed dry looking and wrinkles were more visible. I used  it once and tried to return it but seller said could&#x27;nt return open product. What a waste. this product is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I like the results of the product as it fills the tiny wrinkles around my eyes BUT it does appear lighter than  my skin tone in photos!</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with it. Cakes up under my eyes after having on for awhile and does nothing to fill in even the tiniest wrinkle lines. Causes my eyeliner to smear also. Waste of my money personally.</li>
            <li> Works on fine lines I love it and will purchase again. Recommend</li>
            <li> This cream fills pores to make your make-up look smoother &amp; give it a more finished look--it doesn&#x27;t repair skin pores.  Kind of like stuffing your pores with wax--it works!</li>
            <li> Really works well around my eyes. Very smooth.</li>
            <li> I do really like this cream.  It has a subtle tint, it definitely fills-in/softens those little lines under the eye and over the top lip and makeup goes smoothly over it without caking or smearing.  In addition, the price and availability are a bonus.  Olay makes a very nice line of products in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it works.&lt;br /&gt;2.  On many facial or beauty products, they work as intended - nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;3.  You want something that is unattainable</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Actually seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for you. Just a tiny bit on your finger fills in wrinkle lines and makes your face look flawless. It&#x27;s worth every penny you would pay for it.</li>
