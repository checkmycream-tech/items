            <li>so it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but unique.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a wonderful soft fragrance that is unisex.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon as it is much more cost effective.</li>
            <li>but so far I am very happy with this product.  </li>

            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser and won;t use anything else on my face now.  </li>

            <li>My husband seems to like it, and the soap does seem to have a smooth texture and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>Lovely product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>There are ok soaps that do many things like this:</li>
            <li>This soap does have some redeeming qualities.</li>
            <li>This is a make or break place for many soaps.</li>
            <li>Go to wipe it off, and most soaps give up.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t be buying any more of this soap</li>

            <li>Love the product.</li>

            <li>I like it, dont love i.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Love Olivella..</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I love it!</li>
            <li>excellent - in this dry Arizona climate, it keeps your skin feeling healthy</li>
            <li>I do not feel any tightness on my skin, but my skin is very clean.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, pleasant smelling and affordable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean smell, I suppose, but very strong.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using a product that is safe to use on the face as well as on the body.  </li>
            <li>This soap is simply put incredible</li>
            <li>My face is soft and looks great</li>
            <li>I love how clean this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>The scent is way too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh and has a nice pump</li>
            <li>Te scent is too strong, I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and very gentle on your hands.</li>
            <li>Great in Winter, keeps skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It smells fine</li>
            <li>The dispenser top is perfect for dispensing the small amount desired for washing.  </li>
            <li>then this is your lucky day!</li>
            <li>This is a very light fresh soap.  </li>
            <li>Product great, but top of bottle got loose in shipping and 3/4 of contents leaked out.</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM IS SO FABULOUS</li>
            <li>MADE WITH THEIR FABULOUS OLIVE OIL</li>
            <li>That great soap up above doesn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li>Always appreciated and liked by those receiving as a gift.</li>
            <li>I found it a effective and gentle cleaner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SLS free, though it does contain fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and is lightly fragranced.</li>
            <li>I thought it was scent free like te soap, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I also use the soap for my face and so far so good, you don&#x27;t even need moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, it smells nice, rinses clean and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>One pump goes along way making this a very economical product as well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and clean,  </li>
            <li>When you leave it out at room temp it will turn back to the beautiful golden color and it will not be harmed.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it at Disney world in the Italy section of Epcot.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product on sale while out of town.  </li>
            <li>We buy the bar soap from his manufacturer and was excited to see the liquid.  </li>
            <li>It is great in the winter time to combat dry skin.</li>
            <li>It rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in the shower.  </li>
            <li>after-- clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on my somewhat dry skin.  </li>
            <li>And clean.</li>
            <li>SAYING THAT IT LEAVES HER SKIN CLEAN AND MOPIST BUT NOT GREASY</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling so squeaky clean and the scent is spa-wonderful.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t smell as good, but it definitely removed makeup and made my face feel moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li>Full of chemicals and preservatives.  </li>
            <li>The pump dispenses a modest amount, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It is so much nicer than most of the pump soaps on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and leaving me feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that it does not irritate my rather sensitive skin, which is a huge bonus, since so many other liquid soaps (even SLS free ones) do.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this set expecting a mild soap that could be used on face and body.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I&#x27;m five months pregnant and wanted to try something besides covering myself in oil.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product very much.  </li>
            <li>It does the job for half the cost, and smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my somewher sensitive skin, but it actually feels really clean.</li>
            <li>It does clean but doesn&#x27;t feel as good as other body wash I have used before.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant smell...not heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this soap for a few years now and it is the perfect solution for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>The pumps that dispense too much make me feel as though their product is cheap</li>
            <li>If your looking for light, clean and natural..</li>
            <li>This soap does not have a very satisfying cleaning action or sudsing action.</li>
            <li>I can only testify as to the scent, which is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Mild soap, light scent, far easier to get through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dry me out and leave a fresh, clean scent that I love.</li>
            <li>This is the best answer I&#x27;ve found for keeping your skin soft and smooth looking while cleaning deep down.  </li>
            <li>love this item, creamy, soft, gentle..</li>
            <li>However there  is is a fine line between clean and medicinal; this soap is not as moisture rich as the other soaps.</li>
            <li>Light and natural - oil based but doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin like some.</li>
            <li>Straight from Italia!</li>
            <li>Love that it has Italian Olive Oil.....</li>
            <li>I use it to do the first wash of my face.</li>
            <li>Wish it sold in bigger bottles with better pump.</li>
            <li>They have a line of products you can&#x27;t go wrong, and it makes a wonderful gift ( if u can part with it )</li>
            <li>I guess it would be ok next to the sink to wash your hands.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be very moisturizing (yay olive oil!)</li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend shaves his head and it makes his skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t dry out and was very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Next, I do not feel clean right now as I write this review (immediately after using the product).</li>
            <li>such a strong, or,  ANY PERFUME.</li>
            <li>If you want pure, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to use this on my face.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, a little pricy, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce an excessive amount of suds, it smells nice but not perfumed, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle to the skin, never leaves my face feeling drawn.</li>
            <li>and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle on my skin and really cleans well.</li>
            <li>IT IS A REAL TREAT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Not for a lack of scrubbing, but because of a soap that didn&#x27;t penetrate very well.</li>
            <li>This wash absorbs into the skin without a whole lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>My whole family enjoys using it.</li>
            <li>The soap works well and gentle on your hands.</li>
            <li>Very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic soap for all over-I sent this to my girlfriend that is a big fan of the bar soap</li>
            <li>You can feel the silky smoothing properties right away, and it feels very luxurious at a modest price.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell that&#x27;s not strong</li>
            <li>Am in love with the line of other products.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is great, only 3 stars because I can&#x27;t get past the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Does not strip the skin - leaves it clean but not dry, which is important for me as I have 60ish very dry and sensitive skin - Would recommend to pretty much anyone from teens to much older adults</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle is nice and stout where it&#x27;s difficult to imagine it falling over easily in the tub or</li>
            <li>Good for anyone who tends to have dry skin after using other soaps.</li>
            <li>This soap does not dry out your skin, leaves it soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I is it often, even on face which is left so smooth and soft..</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So far, this is it!!</li>
            <li>This soap does not generate a good lather, to the extent that it&#x27;s rather thin and dissatisfactory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the very strongly scented soap, akin to Irish Spring or other bar soaps.</li>
            <li>Love this especially in the winter when my skin get s dry.</li>
            <li>Felt the same as if I had used regular bar soap with strong lingering smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little different, not the greatest, but it works the same on my skin and does not cause me to break out like other face washes.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida, we are in the sun quite-a-bit.  </li>
            <li>Before this I used things like Cetaphil, which never really felt like it got my face clean.</li>
            <li>When I was pregnant, I had some dry skin issues on my body and face.</li>
            <li>and my hands get rough, but Olivella keeps them smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This is normal as it is an all natural product.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin in the winter and this at least makes it feel good.</li>
            <li>and it does burn the eyes a little but overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes it helps clear up pimples on my face</li>
            <li>It keeps his skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B0031KN8UA Clearly Natural Body Wash, Unscented]].</li>
            <li>I like natural products, which is why I got this.</li>
            <li>Does not cause drying and leaves hands soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>All natural?</li>
            <li>If you like a body soap that smells like old lady perfume....</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product from the Olivella directly.</li>
            <li>The soap fragrance is similar to talcum powder, with too much flower aromas.</li>
            <li>Only positive is that it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I discovered this maybe about 6-7 years ago and have used it steady for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and only Olivella, no substitutes.</li>
            <li>It cleans the whole body very well without harsh deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, so the olive oil certainly helps.</li>
            <li>This consistency of this soap is a bit thin, but other than that I have nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li>Even if you want to occasionally use this to clear something up, it will probably work in that regard too.</li>
            <li>I use it to wash my face, and occasionally as a body soap for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>We have soft water and only need one pump of this soap to lather up.</li>
            <li>It was thick and rich.</li>
            <li>I use it to wash my hands, especially during the winter, because this soap does not dry out my hands.</li>

            <li> Amazing product!  </li>
            <li> Needed something to replace the St. Ives olive wash that I loved but can&#x27;t seem to find anymore, and this is a great replacement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasantly fragranced, and the pump is stowed for shipping so that it doesn&#x27;t break in transit.</li>
            <li> I have given it as gifts in the bar form and this form and people have loved it.</li>
            <li> It smells good on him though.</li>

            <li> and they seem to have good products.</li>
            <li> This stuff I bought to put on a scrubber sponge, it dont lather up good.  </li>
            <li> My mom loved the gift.</li>
            <li> Good value for what you get</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rated an 8 (fair) on</li>
            <li> but I sure can make them look good!  </li>
            <li> Have been very satisfied with this liquid soap.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Olivella, and I am very satisfied with how it performs.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and suds up nicely.</li>

            <li> We once used this at an airbnb and have fallen in love!</li>
            <li> It does the job and has a very clean and pleasant fragrance....  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing .</li>
            <li> It lathers and cleans effectively.  </li>
            <li> I like buying nice smelling soaps, but my husband hates it.  </li>
            <li> Just nice.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product.</li>
            <li> I use this product because of the end result, nice skin care.  </li>
            <li> and I liked them both.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.....  JimP</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth - especially great for this winter weather.</li>
            <li> I love this liquid soap, the lather is good, rinses well &amp; the smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but unique.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a wonderful soft fragrance that is unisex.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon as it is much more cost effective.</li>
            <li> but so far I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best soap my face has ever been exposed to.</li>
            <li> It is very reasonably priced and does a great job cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and won;t use anything else on my face now.  </li>
            <li> The smell is overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t suds up well in the shower.</li>
            <li> My husband seems to like it, and the soap does seem to have a smooth texture and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> There are ok soaps that do many things like this:</li>
            <li> This soap does have some redeeming qualities.</li>
            <li> This is a make or break place for many soaps.</li>
            <li> Go to wipe it off, and most soaps give up.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be buying any more of this soap</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love they way my face feels</li>
            <li> Love this liquid soap.  </li>
            <li> Would like some that suds better.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it would produce more suds.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I buy the bar soap its much better.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my sister&#x27;s favorite soap.</li>
            <li> They are all outstanding.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Super squeaky clean, smells great.</li>
            <li> She said she love love loves this liquid soap and will definitely order it again- very happy</li>
            <li> I like it, dont love i.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> Love Olivella..</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I love it!</li>
            <li> excellent - in this dry Arizona climate, it keeps your skin feeling healthy</li>
            <li> I do not feel any tightness on my skin, but my skin is very clean.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, pleasant smelling and affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean smell, I suppose, but very strong.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using a product that is safe to use on the face as well as on the body.  </li>
            <li> This soap is simply put incredible</li>
            <li> My face is soft and looks great</li>
            <li> I love how clean this makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> The scent is way too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, fresh and has a nice pump</li>
            <li> Te scent is too strong, I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and very gentle on your hands.</li>
            <li> Great in Winter, keeps skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It smells fine</li>
            <li> The dispenser top is perfect for dispensing the small amount desired for washing.  </li>
            <li> then this is your lucky day!</li>
            <li> This is a very light fresh soap.  </li>
            <li> Product great, but top of bottle got loose in shipping and 3/4 of contents leaked out.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS SO FABULOUS</li>
            <li> MADE WITH THEIR FABULOUS OLIVE OIL</li>
            <li> That great soap up above doesn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> Always appreciated and liked by those receiving as a gift.</li>
            <li> I found it a effective and gentle cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SLS free, though it does contain fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and is lightly fragranced.</li>
            <li> I thought it was scent free like te soap, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I also use the soap for my face and so far so good, you don&#x27;t even need moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, it smells nice, rinses clean and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> One pump goes along way making this a very economical product as well.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face smooth and clean,  </li>
            <li> When you leave it out at room temp it will turn back to the beautiful golden color and it will not be harmed.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it at Disney world in the Italy section of Epcot.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product on sale while out of town.  </li>
            <li> We buy the bar soap from his manufacturer and was excited to see the liquid.  </li>
            <li> It is great in the winter time to combat dry skin.</li>
            <li> It rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in the shower.  </li>
            <li> after-- clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Feels great on my somewhat dry skin.  </li>
            <li> And clean.</li>
            <li> SAYING THAT IT LEAVES HER SKIN CLEAN AND MOPIST BUT NOT GREASY</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling so squeaky clean and the scent is spa-wonderful.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t smell as good, but it definitely removed makeup and made my face feel moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li> Full of chemicals and preservatives.  </li>
            <li> The pump dispenses a modest amount, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It is so much nicer than most of the pump soaps on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and leaving me feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that it does not irritate my rather sensitive skin, which is a huge bonus, since so many other liquid soaps (even SLS free ones) do.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this set expecting a mild soap that could be used on face and body.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I&#x27;m five months pregnant and wanted to try something besides covering myself in oil.</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product very much.  </li>
            <li> It does the job for half the cost, and smells great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my somewher sensitive skin, but it actually feels really clean.</li>
            <li> It does clean but doesn&#x27;t feel as good as other body wash I have used before.</li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasant smell...not heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a few years now and it is the perfect solution for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> The pumps that dispense too much make me feel as though their product is cheap</li>
            <li> If your looking for light, clean and natural..</li>
            <li> This soap does not have a very satisfying cleaning action or sudsing action.</li>
            <li> I can only testify as to the scent, which is very strong.  </li>
            <li> Mild soap, light scent, far easier to get through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry me out and leave a fresh, clean scent that I love.</li>
            <li> This is the best answer I&#x27;ve found for keeping your skin soft and smooth looking while cleaning deep down.  </li>
            <li> love this item, creamy, soft, gentle..</li>
            <li> However there  is is a fine line between clean and medicinal; this soap is not as moisture rich as the other soaps.</li>
            <li> Light and natural - oil based but doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin like some.</li>
            <li> Straight from Italia!</li>
            <li> Love that it has Italian Olive Oil.....</li>
            <li> I use it to do the first wash of my face.</li>
            <li> Wish it sold in bigger bottles with better pump.</li>
            <li> They have a line of products you can&#x27;t go wrong, and it makes a wonderful gift ( if u can part with it )</li>
            <li> I guess it would be ok next to the sink to wash your hands.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be very moisturizing (yay olive oil!)</li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend shaves his head and it makes his skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clean &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t dry out and was very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Next, I do not feel clean right now as I write this review (immediately after using the product).</li>
            <li> such a strong, or,  ANY PERFUME.</li>
            <li> If you want pure, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to use this on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, a little pricy, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce an excessive amount of suds, it smells nice but not perfumed, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle to the skin, never leaves my face feeling drawn.</li>
            <li> and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle on my skin and really cleans well.</li>
            <li> IT IS A REAL TREAT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Not for a lack of scrubbing, but because of a soap that didn&#x27;t penetrate very well.</li>
            <li> This wash absorbs into the skin without a whole lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> My whole family enjoys using it.</li>
            <li> The soap works well and gentle on your hands.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap for all over-I sent this to my girlfriend that is a big fan of the bar soap</li>
            <li> You can feel the silky smoothing properties right away, and it feels very luxurious at a modest price.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell that&#x27;s not strong</li>
            <li> Am in love with the line of other products.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is great, only 3 stars because I can&#x27;t get past the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Does not strip the skin - leaves it clean but not dry, which is important for me as I have 60ish very dry and sensitive skin - Would recommend to pretty much anyone from teens to much older adults</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is nice and stout where it&#x27;s difficult to imagine it falling over easily in the tub or</li>
            <li> Good for anyone who tends to have dry skin after using other soaps.</li>
            <li> This soap does not dry out your skin, leaves it soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I is it often, even on face which is left so smooth and soft..</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far, this is it!!</li>
            <li> This soap does not generate a good lather, to the extent that it&#x27;s rather thin and dissatisfactory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the very strongly scented soap, akin to Irish Spring or other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> Love this especially in the winter when my skin get s dry.</li>
            <li> Felt the same as if I had used regular bar soap with strong lingering smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different, not the greatest, but it works the same on my skin and does not cause me to break out like other face washes.</li>
            <li> We live in Florida, we are in the sun quite-a-bit.  </li>
            <li> Before this I used things like Cetaphil, which never really felt like it got my face clean.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant, I had some dry skin issues on my body and face.</li>
            <li> and my hands get rough, but Olivella keeps them smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This is normal as it is an all natural product.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter and this at least makes it feel good.</li>
            <li> and it does burn the eyes a little but overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes it helps clear up pimples on my face</li>
            <li> It keeps his skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0031KN8UA Clearly Natural Body Wash, Unscented]].</li>
            <li> I like natural products, which is why I got this.</li>
            <li> Does not cause drying and leaves hands soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> All natural?</li>
            <li> If you like a body soap that smells like old lady perfume....</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from the Olivella directly.</li>
            <li> The soap fragrance is similar to talcum powder, with too much flower aromas.</li>
            <li> Only positive is that it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered this maybe about 6-7 years ago and have used it steady for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and only Olivella, no substitutes.</li>
            <li> It cleans the whole body very well without harsh deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so the olive oil certainly helps.</li>
            <li> This consistency of this soap is a bit thin, but other than that I have nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li> Even if you want to occasionally use this to clear something up, it will probably work in that regard too.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face, and occasionally as a body soap for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> We have soft water and only need one pump of this soap to lather up.</li>
            <li> It was thick and rich.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my hands, especially during the winter, because this soap does not dry out my hands.</li>
            <li> But the bathroom smells of this for a long time afterwards.</li>
            <li> Has a bit of strange scent to it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as I can.</li>
            <li> And because of the size, it lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The smell does dissipate after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this soap to all who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> , IT KEEPS MY SKIN FROM BEING ITCHY DURING THE WINTER, AND MY FACE IS NOT PEELING FROM THE DRY WINTER AIR.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had expected to avoid that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days</li>
            <li> I HATE IT, BECAUSE WHEN I OPEN THE BOX, MORE THAT THE HALF OF THE BOTTLE WAS LOSE.</li>
            <li> GOT THIS FOR MY AUNT AFTER TRYING SOME OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS IN THIS LINE.</li>
            <li> (The other contents were in plastic, thank goodness.)  </li>

            <li> Within a few days of using this my dry skin went away.</li>
            <li> I squeeze a small amount on a wet terry-cloth cleansing pad, rub it to create a bit of lather and then apply to face (either wet or dry) in little circles.  </li>

            <li> This batch was watered down.</li>
            <li> This was too watered down, and the scent was overpowering.</li>
            <li> THE EXTREME PERFUME FRAGRANCE!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not nice and not natural to have</li>
            <li> but whenever I received the package half of the contents are spilled.</li>
            <li> I like the results on my skin and wish it didn&#x27;t smell slightly of astringent while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li> But until I got around to cleaning up the mess our kitchen reeked.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try this liquid soap because it&#x27;s less messy.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF THOSE OBSCURE LITTLE JEWEL THAT</li>
            <li> Its a little drying and according to [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few years now</li>
            <li> Pumps leak out some product and messy in box.</li>
            <li> I like the olive oil soap, but I am not happy with the low sudsing.  </li>
            <li> The package was delivered by the PO in a plastic bag since the soap had either come open or broken and soaked through the cardboard box.  </li>
            <li> Any blemish problems I had  disappeared within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tingly, too, which I think is a plus!</li>
            <li> AND FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY</li>
            <li> I called the company last year thinking I had the wrong product.</li>
            <li> But still like it; not love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a critical person of soaps, because I regularly get filthy and smelly.</li>
            <li> and I had a hard time finding a replacement.</li>
            <li> not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Admittedly not a fair trial, but there it is.  </li>

            <li> Have not used it for a body soap, but Olivella does sell  a shower gel, so perhaps those who are unhappy with this should try that product.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad asthma</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed with it.</li>

            <li> It is not overly scented (I hate perfumes).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning.  Full of chemicals and preservatives.  Should have read the ingredients before I ordered.</li>
            <li> This soap does not dry out your skin, leaves it soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product.  You do not need a toner!  A little goes a long way, so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant, I had some dry skin issues on my body and face. Within a few days of using this my dry skin went away. I wont use anything else. I have 3 back up bottles</li>
            <li> I used to use a St.Ives cleanser. They discontinued it and I had a hard time finding a replacement. This one didn&#x27;t smell as good, but it definitely removed makeup and made my face feel moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li> great product.  makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Light and natural - oil based but doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin like some.</li>
            <li> I discovered this maybe about 6-7 years ago and have used it steady for the last 5 years. It is so gentle to the skin, never leaves my face feeling drawn. It cleans the whole body very well without harsh deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful soft fragrance that is unisex. I have really bad asthma and it doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give you a heads up when you have it delivered in the Winter it turns almost cloudy like milk. This is normal as it is an all natural product. When you leave it out at room temp it will turn back to the beautiful golden color and it will not be harmed. I called the company last year thinking I had the wrong product. So don&#x27;t worry if that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed with it. I have given it as gifts in the bar form and this form and people have loved it.</li>
            <li> This soap is creamy and smells great.  Everyone likes to use it.  It lathers and cleans effectively.  It arrived quickly and I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few years now and I absolutely love it. I originally bought it at Disney world in the Italy section of Epcot. Since then I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon as it is much more cost effective. It has a nice smell that&#x27;s not strong and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle on my skin and really cleans well. I use it to wash my hands, especially during the winter, because this soap does not dry out my hands.</li>
            <li> Just couldn&#x27;t stand the scent of this soap or its texture. It went into the trash.</li>
            <li> I like buying nice smelling soaps, but my husband hates it.  He LOVES this soap.  And so do I.  It&#x27;s a win win.</li>
            <li> I have used olive oil bar soap for years. I wanted to try this liquid soap because it&#x27;s less messy. Unfortunately, \\&quot;You can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it too.\\&quot; Olive oil bar soap is nothing but olive oil and a bit of fragrance. This liquid is full of chemicals including heavy, artificial fragrance. If you want pure, this isn&#x27;t it. Stick with the bars.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Works and smells great!! I will be ordering this soap for the rest of my life.. Great price, great quality. Straight from Italia!</li>
            <li> I HATE IT, BECAUSE WHEN I OPEN THE BOX, MORE THAT THE HALF OF THE BOTTLE WAS LOSE.</li>
            <li> This consistency of this soap is a bit thin, but other than that I have nothing but good things to say. It doesn&#x27;t produce an excessive amount of suds, it smells nice but not perfumed, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. I use it to wash my face, and occasionally as a body soap for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve used something similar when I was in France so I gave Olivella a try when I returned home.  It is very reasonably priced and does a great job cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SELLER! GREAT PRICE! THIS ITEM IS SO FABULOUS FOR YOUR SKIN WITH OLIVE OIL IN IT! DON&#x27;T MISS OUT BUY IT AND THIS IS BEST PRICE YOU&#x27;LL GET IT FOR!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after a recent trip to Italy where there were a lot of olive oil facial products offered.  I love this cleanser and won;t use anything else on my face now.  It is great in the winter time to combat dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a replacement for my soap in the shower. The smell is overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t suds up well in the shower. I did not notice a difference after the shower with my skin. Felt the same as if I had used regular bar soap with strong lingering smell.</li>
            <li> I love this liquid soap, the lather is good, rinses well &amp; the smell is fantastic! I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive...Therefore its put inbetween my soaps making it my Wednesday/Thursday soap in the shower!\\&quot;THANK$\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I ordered this set expecting a mild soap that could be used on face and body. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the very strongly scented soap, akin to Irish Spring or other bar soaps. I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to use this on my face. So I put the bottles in the shower. My husband seems to like it, and the soap does seem to have a smooth texture and lathers nicely. But the bathroom smells of this for a long time afterwards. It&#x27;s a clean smell, I suppose, but very strong.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of gardening and my hands get rough, but Olivella keeps them smooth and soft. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Great olive oil hand soap....  It does the job and has a very clean and pleasant fragrance....  I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love how clean this makes my skin feel.  I have to wash twice to get mascara off and it does burn the eyes a little but overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is very good!! but whenever I received the package half of the contents are spilled. Who can I speak to about this?</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF THOSE OBSCURE LITTLE JEWEL THAT WE ALL NEED AND AMAZON HAS GOT IT!!!!!  THIS LIQUID SOAP FROM ITALY MADE WITH THEIR FABULOUS OLIVE OIL DOES MORE THAN JUST CLEANSE!!!  IT JUST SOFTENS YOUR SKIN AND THE QUIET FRAGRANCE. ( NOT THE SMELL OF OLIVE OIL, MAYBE SOME ITALIAN TREE IN BLOOM ). SORT OF PERMEATES THROUGHOUT YOUR ROOM!!  IT IS A REAL TREAT AND FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY.... I JUST DO NOT KNOW HOW THEY CAN SELL IT SO CHEAP!!!  GIVE A TRY AND LET US ALL HEAR YOUR OPINION!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product lives up to its description.  It has a pleasing smell and is a joy to use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this soap. It keeps his skin hydrated and soft. I don&#x27;t care for the smell so don&#x27;t use it. It smells good on him though.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.  Beautiful fragrance and great on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Leaves skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Have been very satisfied with this liquid soap.  It&#x27;s so reasonably priced I wondered how it would perform.  Have not been disappointed.  It leaves my skin clean &amp; soft.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It smells fine and it&#x27;s almost good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the same feeling from this as I do from bar soap.  I had expected to avoid that.  I will not be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this hand soap for some time.  Mild soap, light scent, far easier to get through Amazon.  Just nice.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product very much.  It leaves my face smooth and clean,  I would recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Have been using it for some time. Very nice for skin and keeps sink area neat!  My only critique would be in packaging when sent. Pumps leak out some product and messy in box.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on skin, which feels wonderful after use.  Great in Winter, keeps skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> The soap arrive promptly and in good condition. My husband enjoys this soap in the shower.  It has a light, pleasant smell...not heavy or oily.  It rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in the shower.  I would recommend this product, and, in fact, I would buy it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Love that it has Italian Olive Oil.....HATE THE EXTREME PERFUME FRAGRANCE!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not nice and not natural to have such a strong, or,  ANY PERFUME.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, a little pricy, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This soap does not have a very satisfying cleaning action or sudsing action. I&#x27;m a critical person of soaps, because I regularly get filthy and smelly. There are ok soaps that do many things like this: [[ASIN:B0063I3R9O EO Everyone Soap Coconut and Lemon]]. There are great soaps like this one: [[ASIN:B0031KN8UA Clearly Natural Body Wash, Unscented]]. This one doesn&#x27;t quite cut it, and I&#x27;ll explain why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, though. This soap does have some redeeming qualities. It&#x27;s pleasantly fragranced, and the pump is stowed for shipping so that it doesn&#x27;t break in transit. The pump dispenses a modest amount, which is nice. The pumps that dispense too much make me feel as though their product is cheap or I&#x27;m wasting something. The size of the bottle is nice and stout where it&#x27;s difficult to imagine it falling over easily in the tub or shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the criticism. Starting with underarm deodorant. This is a make or break place for many soaps. At the end of the day, there&#x27;s a bit of deodorant left on your arm. Go to wipe it off, and most soaps give up. You end up having to use a lot of soap and elbow grease to get that stuff off. That great soap up above doesn&#x27;t have this problem. Next, I do not feel clean right now as I write this review (immediately after using the product). Not for a lack of scrubbing, but because of a soap that didn&#x27;t penetrate very well. This soap does not generate a good lather, to the extent that it&#x27;s rather thin and dissatisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying any more of this soap</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Order continually.</li>
            <li> Product great, but top of bottle got loose in shipping and 3/4 of contents leaked out.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product. Has a bit of strange scent to it. I use it to do the first wash of my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good.  I really enjoy using a product that is safe to use on the face as well as on the body.  Left my skin moisturized without feeling greasy.  This wash absorbs into the skin without a whole lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Will never use another soap!</li>
            <li> I have been using Olivella Face and Body soap for several years, but just as a facial soap.  I love they way my face feels after-- clean and refreshed.  Have not used it for a body soap, but Olivella does sell  a shower gel, so perhaps those who are unhappy with this should try that product.  I am going to on the next order.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this. It makes my skin feel wonderful. I have very dry skin, so the olive oil certainly helps.</li>
            <li> I like the results on my skin and wish it didn&#x27;t smell slightly of astringent while I&#x27;m using it.  The smell does dissipate after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Needed something to replace the St. Ives olive wash that I loved but can&#x27;t seem to find anymore, and this is a great replacement. The smell is a little different, not the greatest, but it works the same on my skin and does not cause me to break out like other face washes. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this especially in the winter when my skin get s dry.</li>
            <li> I like natural products, which is why I got this. It has vitamins and from what I can see, good quality olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it helps clear up pimples on my face so I know it works. I have a couple of facial cleansers, so I don&#x27;t always use this. Even if you want to occasionally use this to clear something up, it will probably work in that regard too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a few years now and it is the perfect solution for anyone with sensitive skin! It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Love this liquid soap.  Feels great on my somewhat dry skin.  Buy this and have it sent as gifts to friends/family.  Always appreciated and liked by those receiving as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle of this soap.  It is so much nicer than most of the pump soaps on the market.</li>
            <li> Love this hand wash! Nice scent and very gentle on your hands. Does not cause drying and leaves hands soft and moisturized. Good value also.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this at a friend&#x27;s home a couple of years ago, now we have it at every sink in the house.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product.  I really like it. I will be buying it again. I bought the soap too.</li>
            <li> I use the soap to wash my face. I found it a effective and gentle cleaner.</li>
            <li> I like the olive oil soap, but I am not happy with the low sudsing.  Would like some that suds better.  Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Wish it sold in bigger bottles with better pump.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.Beutiful smell. My whole family enjoys using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I have very dry skin in the winter and this at least makes it feel good. And clean.</li>
            <li> The soap works well and gentle on your hands. I like the brand and they seem to have good products.</li>
            <li> GOT THIS FOR MY AUNT AFTER TRYING SOME OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS IN THIS LINE. SHE RAVES ABOUT THIS FACE &amp; BODY SOAP SAYING THAT IT LEAVES HER SKIN CLEAN AND MOPIST BUT NOT GREASY AT ALL. SHE&#x27;S GETTING COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME NOW ON HER SKIN &amp; HOW BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKS.</li>
            <li> Excellent face and body soap!  Not greasy at all!  Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth - especially great for this winter weather. I definitely recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I used some Olivella soap at a friend&#x27;s house and I was immediately hooked.  You can feel the silky smoothing properties right away, and it feels very luxurious at a modest price.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells good and suds up nicely. I love that it&#x27;s made in Italy too!!</li>
            <li> All natural? No, it contains toxin ingredients. How very disappointed I was to find this out. They can modify it to remove those, I hope they do.</li>
            <li> This soap is simply put incredible</li>
            <li> This is a very light fresh soap.  We have soft water and only need one pump of this soap to lather up. I&#x27;ve only used it a few days but so far I am very happy with this product.  One pump goes along way making this a very economical product as well.</li>
            <li> This soap does not foam up well. It does clean but doesn&#x27;t feel as good as other body wash I have used before. The scent is pleasant but unique. I just wish it would produce more suds. I will not order again.</li>
            <li> I use this product because of the end result, nice skin care.  My husband uses it for shaving while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Only issue, was out of 5 bottles this one spilled out a couple of ounces into the protective bag.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this I won&#x27;t even try anything else. It&#x27;s great for my somewher sensitive skin, but it actually feels really clean. Before this I used things like Cetaphil, which never really felt like it got my face clean. It&#x27;s a little tingly, too, which I think is a plus!</li>
            <li> love this item, creamy, soft, gentle.. I is it often, even on face which is left so smooth and soft.. They have a line of products you can&#x27;t go wrong, and it makes a wonderful gift ( if u can part with it )</li>
            <li> This is by far the best soap my face has ever been exposed to. I highly recommend this and only Olivella, no substitutes.</li>
            <li> I buy the bar soap its much better.  This stuff I bought to put on a scrubber sponge, it dont lather up good.  I guess it would be ok next to the sink to wash your hands.  Bought it for travel.  not a good idea.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It&#x27;s not greasy and leaving me feeling super clean. Good for anyone who tends to have dry skin after using other soaps.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat of a skin care aficionado.  I try different products in the hope of finding the ONE.  I had been using a cleansing olive oil that was very nice indeed.  However, the price just kept going up and up.  I switched to Olivella, and I am very satisfied with how it performs.  I squeeze a small amount on a wet terry-cloth cleansing pad, rub it to create a bit of lather and then apply to face (either wet or dry) in little circles.  All the grime and makeup comes off!  I rinse thoroughly, and I&#x27;m done.  I do not feel any tightness on my skin, but my skin is very clean.  Of course, I also moisturize afterward.  It does the job for half the cost, and smells great.</li>
            <li> If you like a body soap that smells like old lady perfume....then this is your lucky day!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from the Olivella directly. It was thick and rich. This batch was watered down. I was attracted by the Amazon price but now know why it was cheaper than the Olivella website.</li>
            <li> Does not strip the skin - leaves it clean but not dry, which is important for me as I have 60ish very dry and sensitive skin - Would recommend to pretty much anyone from teens to much older adults</li>
            <li> Received the product on time and it was packed well.  Love this soap, it smells nice, rinses clean and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> This was too watered down, and the scent was overpowering. Only positive is that it does not dry my skin. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle but won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> My mom loved the gift. She uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a week now and I love it. I ordered it because I&#x27;m five months pregnant and wanted to try something besides covering myself in oil. So far, this is it!! I use it with the lotion and it keeps my skin moisturized all day. I also use the soap for my face and so far so good, you don&#x27;t even need moisturizer. I will continue to use this product as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Gentle, pleasant smelling and affordable.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Good value for what you get</li>
            <li> This is my sister&#x27;s favorite soap. I was happy to find it on line and then send it to her as a hostess gift. Perfect.</li>
            <li> excellent - in this dry Arizona climate, it keeps your skin feeling healthy</li>
            <li> this was the gift I gave to everyone this year. Am in love with the line of other products. They are all outstanding. However there  is is a fine line between clean and medicinal; this soap is not as moisture rich as the other soaps. If your looking for light, clean and natural.. this is it. But still like it; not love it</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product on sale while out of town.  When I reached the bottom of the bottle, it was time to order one from Amazon.  While I have never used it as a body soap, it is a wonderful product for the face.  The dispenser top is perfect for dispensing the small amount desired for washing.  It rinses off beautifully.  And because of the size, it lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It&#x27;s SLS free, though it does contain fragrance.  I have used it as body wash and as hand soap.  I&#x27;m happy to report that it does not irritate my rather sensitive skin, which is a huge bonus, since so many other liquid soaps (even SLS free ones) do.  Seems to be very moisturizing (yay olive oil!) and is lightly fragranced.</li>
            <li> I love these soaps! I&#x27;ve tried two of them and I liked them both. They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth. They don&#x27;t dry me out and leave a fresh, clean scent that I love.</li>
            <li> The product says &amp;#34;olive oil&amp;#34; yet there is no olive oil in the ingredients list. The soap fragrance is similar to talcum powder, with too much flower aromas. I do not like at all.</li>
            <li> I can only testify as to the scent, which is very strong.  The package was delivered by the PO in a plastic bag since the soap had either come open or broken and soaked through the cardboard box.  (The other contents were in plastic, thank goodness.)  But until I got around to cleaning up the mess our kitchen reeked.  Admittedly not a fair trial, but there it is.  I&#x27;m going to try a different liquid olive oil soap I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Awesome</li>
            <li> Soap was what I wanted. Very soothing to the skin. I would recommend this soap to all who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Delish! Super squeaky clean, smells great. We once used this at an airbnb and have fallen in love!</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap for all over-I sent this to my girlfriend that is a big fan of the bar soap and I saw this and sent it to her as a gift.  She said she love love loves this liquid soap and will definitely order it again- very happy and I will also order it again!!</li>
            <li> We live in Florida, we are in the sun quite-a-bit.  This is the best answer I&#x27;ve found for keeping your skin soft and smooth looking while cleaning deep down.  At 72 I can&#x27;t get rid of the wrinkles but I sure can make them look good!  Smells nice too.....  JimP</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years now, it is wonderful., I have not used use bar soap in years...</li>
            <li> I like it, dont love i. Its a little drying and according to [...] it&#x27;s rated an 8 (fair) on it&#x27;s fragerance due to \\&quot;Ecotoxicology, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Miscellaneous, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive)\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using their face &amp; body wash for years. It leaves me feeling so squeaky clean and the scent is spa-wonderful.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is great, only 3 stars because I can&#x27;t get past the fragrance. My face didn&#x27;t dry out and was very smooth feeling. I now have it at my kitchen sink and I must admit, my hands are softer this winter!</li>
            <li> I have been using Olivella for a year now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for my skin . Any blemish problems I had  disappeared within a few weeks. This product is amazing .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it. The scent is way too strong.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it. It is not overly scented (I hate perfumes). It leaves my skin soft and clean. No allergy bumps.</li>
            <li> wonderful. My face is soft and looks great</li>
            <li> the smell is very nice !!!</li>
            <li> We use it for shaving, washing and cleaning for all ages. It&#x27;s light, fresh and has a nice pump so it&#x27;s very easy to use. My boyfriend shaves his head and it makes his skin so smooth and soft. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else! Best product out there!</li>
            <li> We buy the bar soap from his manufacturer and was excited to see the liquid.  I thought it was scent free like te soap, but it isn&#x27;t.  Te scent is too strong, I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PRODUCT ON AMAZON, IT KEEPS MY SKIN FROM BEING ITCHY DURING THE WINTER, AND MY FACE IS NOT PEELING FROM THE DRY WINTER AIR.</li>
            <li> Love Olivella.. Received quickly.</li>
