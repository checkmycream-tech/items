            <li>Best liquid eyeliner I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>This is the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used and have been using it for awhile now.</li>
            <li>it was the best eyeliner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This product is awesome......</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE!!!</li>
            <li>I like the length of the wand, but the product itself stings my eyelids, making me tear up, thus running liquid eyeliner all over my face... very attractive :p</li>
            <li>...looks great</li>
            <li>Great eyeliner for the &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Cleopatra&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Has great staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Even though the applier is great and stuff, I&#x27;m going to stick with my Mega Liner eyeliner...</li>
            <li>and i loved it however, upon purchasing this again now that im 21,ehhhh...</li>
            <li>In the evenings, out to dinner or in the club I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps someone who is looking for a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It stings a fair amount.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake, great liner :)</li>
            <li>Good quality and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Glad to get it here!</li>
            <li>My favorite liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this liquid eyeliner for about 3 years now and it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>It stays on fairly well (better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.)</li>
            <li>Smooth and rich, perfect for the cat eye look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 15 with sensitive skin, but this eyeliner is perfect &amp;</li>
            <li>It dries quickly which can be good for the top eyelid</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>MAybe i should find a better one though before i do.</li>
            <li>Just restocking, I love Palladio.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors this brand has too.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but it just doesn&#x27;t go on that great for me.</li>
            <li>Goes on like silk and doesn&#x27;t smudge easy.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is easy to apply because of the tip.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply finely, goes on well.</li>
            <li>Precise and easy to use felt tip brush.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re among the lucky ones who aren&#x27;t bothered by it, then you&#x27;ll be glad you tried it.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon and bought a couple of extra bottles to have on hand.</li>
            <li>Lower lids only and it works great.</li>
            <li>so it goes on quick and easy..</li>
            <li>Sometimes takes to layers to be opaque, but still not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because it has a stiff tip, so if you know what you&#x27;re doing, that&#x27;s a tremendous help.</li>
            <li>Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used and, while the bottle is tiny , it lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li>The firm nib is great for beginners.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice opaque black, and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I think it would be better if it was a little longer and the liquid a better consistency.</li>
            <li>I would recommend just because it stays on well and looks pretty</li>
            <li>My favorite only one I use</li>
            <li>I just got a bit into my eyes on accident for the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty done even trying to make this work.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>Easy to fix, too - I use a slightly-moistened clean popsicle stick to carefully wipe/scrap and excess away.</li>
            <li>This is the eyeliner I always use, goes on very opaque and gives a crisp line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It won&#x27;t smudge unless you rub your eyes, but does come off easily in water; however, if you make a mistake during application that malleability allows a simple fix.</li>
            <li>The felt tip is extra stiff and creates really amazing fine lines and has no problems getting to the lash line.</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>Stings if you get it in your eyes, but stays VERY well (both on the lid and on the waterline).</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s worth trying if there&#x27;s a color you like, but don&#x27;t be surprised if it burns.  </li>
            <li>I tried this brand thinking it would be great, but wow the eyeliner was all over my eyes within 20 minutes, Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li>Its so dark and perfect for people with shaky hands</li>
            <li>I have a steady hand</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not even easy to put on compared to some of the other</li>
            <li>Much smaller than expected, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>If I use a eyeliner, and take the time to get it right, I want it to stay until I am ready to take it off, I will be staying with my wet n wild H20 eyeliner, it STAYS</li>
            <li>One bottle has lasted me two years so far.</li>
            <li>Se lo recomiendo a cualquier persona que quiera tener una apariencia natural sin que se vea que tiene muco maquillaje en los ojos.</li>
            <li>As far as how often it needs to be applied; that depends on the weather.</li>
            <li>With this kind the thin brush is dipped into an ink well.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner, I usually pick it up locally</li>
            <li>I bought one back in high school</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked around and tried many other eyeliners and this one beats them all, hands down.</li>
            <li>If your hand shakes, though, you can really tell with a liquid liner, so be careful and rest your pinky finger/edge of your hand on your face as you work.</li>
            <li>but probably would be messy for beginners as would any liquid ;)</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to people with dry or sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I would rather the tip had been a thin brush like my cheap little E.L.F. liquid liner but the Palladio is a higher quality, you can tell.</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t budge proof but it generally isn&#x27;t going anywhere unless you deliberately rub or wet your eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see her again for a long time</li>
            <li> I have used eyeliner that feels dry and crusty on my eyes.</li>
            <li> after u put it on let it dry</li>
            <li> It takes a coat or two to actually get the liquid to become an opaque black, though.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t last /all/ day without a little fading on the lids, but it&#x27;ll still remain pristine on the outer edges of eyes.</li>
            <li> Also you need several applications in order to make this very dark.</li>
            <li> Can last you 2 years even wearing it everyday.</li>
            <li> so I expected that.</li>
            <li> but bad if u make mistakes easily.</li>
            <li> Yea, it goes on dark</li>
            <li> the get a dark line.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the stinging and burning problem like a few other reviewers claim.</li>
            <li> and then I work over the eyeliner with a black eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Smudges a little like a pencil liner might, but its not water proof</li>
            <li> Just wish the tip was a brush and perhaps a little thinner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the lids.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I prefer a brush - but it does get the job done after a few swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so know I have this eyeliner that I will never use again, waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> felt tip brush is also ultra stiff</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I apply a base coat of black eye shadow first and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I mean, if you get anything in your eyes it hurts, but I can NOT get this into my eyes at all it&#x27;ll burn a little.</li>
            <li> so badly couldn&#x27;t open them at all until I flushed them water for a couple minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about the applicator</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the felt tip pens where it&#x27;s nearly impossible</li>
            <li> Prestige isn&#x27;t bad, either.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I love, love, love this eyeliner. Can last you 2 years even wearing it everyday. Good quality and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected, but that&#x27;s okay. It lasts most of the day. It isn&#x27;t budge proof but it generally isn&#x27;t going anywhere unless you deliberately rub or wet your eyes. The firm nib is great for beginners. Or, if you prefer a brush you can use that with it too. Sometimes takes to layers to be opaque, but still not bad. I would buy again for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought one back in high school and i loved it however, upon purchasing this again now that im 21,ehhhh...not so much. Yea, it goes on dark but that&#x27;s after a couple swatches. It dries quickly which can be good for the top eyelid but bad if u make mistakes easily. I would recommend just because it stays on well and looks pretty precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I remember why i didnt buy it again. It gives almost a stinging sensation on my eyelids. Also you need several applications in order to make this very dark. I would buy again though, because i like liquid eyeliners. MAybe i should find a better one though before i do.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used and, while the bottle is tiny , it lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> I do cateye almost every day and this liquid eyeliner has always been one of my favorites. I just wish it came in larger amounts.</li>
            <li> My favorite only one I use</li>
            <li> I would rather the tip had been a thin brush like my cheap little E.L.F. liquid liner but the Palladio is a higher quality, you can tell. Smooth and rich, perfect for the cat eye look. Smudges a little like a pencil liner might, but its not water proof so I expected that. I haven&#x27;t had the stinging and burning problem like a few other reviewers claim. Just wish the tip was a brush and perhaps a little thinner. Ah, well. It works.</li>
            <li> I like the length of the wand, but the product itself stings my eyelids, making me tear up, thus running liquid eyeliner all over my face... very attractive :p</li>
            <li> Just restocking, I love Palladio. It&#x27;s great because it has a stiff tip, so if you know what you&#x27;re doing, that&#x27;s a tremendous help. It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake, great liner :)</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eyeliners. This is my FAVORITE!!! I can&#x27;t even feel it on my eyes. I have used eyeliner that feels dry and crusty on my eyes. I love all the colors this brand has too.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only eyeliner I use now.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I apply a base coat of black eye shadow first and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Best.liquid.eyeliner.ever.</li>
            <li> Best liquid eyeliner I have ever used!  I have been using it for 10 years, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or migrate and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used and have been using it for awhile now. I couldn&#x27;t find it any longer at my local drug store or beauty supply store. I was happy to find it on Amazon and bought a couple of extra bottles to have on hand.</li>
            <li> One bottle has lasted me two years so far.</li>
            <li> I actually came across this brand by accident when a friend of mine left it in my car.  I didn&#x27;t see her again for a long time so I ended up trying it out.... it was the best eyeliner I have ever used.  Essentially NO SMUDGING!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner, I usually pick it up locally but I moved to the middle of nowhere. Glad to get it here!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but it just doesn&#x27;t go on that great for me. I think it would be better if it was a little longer and the liquid a better consistency.</li>
            <li> With this kind the thin brush is dipped into an ink well. It&#x27;s not like the felt tip pens where it&#x27;s nearly impossible the get a dark line. Quick and easy and lasts a really long time. It&#x27;s also sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply stores.</li>
            <li> My go-to eyeliner! Goes on opaque, especially with a second application. Precise and easy to use felt tip brush. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the lids.&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t smudge unless you rub your eyes, but does come off easily in water; however, if you make a mistake during application that malleability allows a simple fix. Won&#x27;t last /all/ day without a little fading on the lids, but it&#x27;ll still remain pristine on the outer edges of eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome......stays on all day......after u put it on let it dry and then I work over the eyeliner with a black eyeshadow ...looks great</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner for the &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Cleopatra&amp;#34; look. Goes on like silk and doesn&#x27;t smudge easy.</li>
            <li> Esta es mi tercera botella de este delineador. No he podido encontrar otro delineador que me permita hacer la linea delgada como lo hace este. Se lo recomiendo a cualquier persona que quiera tener una apariencia natural sin que se vea que tiene muco maquillaje en los ojos.</li>
            <li> My favorite liquid eyeliner! Melts onto your lids! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is the eyeliner I always use, goes on very opaque and gives a crisp line. Stings if you get it in your eyes, but stays VERY well (both on the lid and on the waterline). My mom gave one to me in middle school and I&#x27;ve been using the same brand and color ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for mistakes: use a q-tip with lotion to remove the mistake or around the mistake and just go over it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this liquid eyeliner for about 3 years now and it&#x27;s really nice. As far as how often it needs to be applied; that depends on the weather. Now mind you, I can&#x27;t wear eyeliner in the summer time but I know others who do. In the evenings, out to dinner or in the club I&#x27;m good. But as with any eyeliner, when you start sweating - they&#x27;re going to smudge, etc. In that case - you will probably have to apply again. This eyeliner is easy to apply because of the tip. And it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or discomfort for me. I&#x27;ve looked around and tried many other eyeliners and this one beats them all, hands down. Hope this helps someone who is looking for a good eyeliner.Prestige isn&#x27;t bad, either.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever and applies with precision and ease</li>
            <li> Lower lids only and it works great. It stays on fairly well (better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.) I used to get it at a local store, but since I moved, I came here to buy.</li>
            <li> I mean, if you get anything in your eyes it hurts, but I can NOT get this into my eyes at all it&#x27;ll burn a little. I just got a bit into my eyes on accident for the first time and I hurt so badly couldn&#x27;t open them at all until I flushed them water for a couple minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The felt tip brush is also ultra stiff so it&#x27;s not even easy to put on compared to some of the other felt tips I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m pretty done even trying to make this work. Should have tossed it a while ago but I was determined to make it work.</li>
            <li> I have the Emerald Isle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I really like the shade of green.  Has great staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It stings a fair amount.  Not too crazy about the applicator - I prefer a brush - but it does get the job done after a few swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth trying if there&#x27;s a color you like, but don&#x27;t be surprised if it burns.  If you&#x27;re among the lucky ones who aren&#x27;t bothered by it, then you&#x27;ll be glad you tried it.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply finely, goes on well. Easy to fix, too - I use a slightly-moistened clean popsicle stick to carefully wipe/scrap and excess away.</li>
            <li> I tried this brand thinking it would be great, but wow the eyeliner was all over my eyes within 20 minutes, Huge disappointment. so know I have this eyeliner that I will never use again, waste of money for me. If I use a eyeliner, and take the time to get it right, I want it to stay until I am ready to take it off, I will be staying with my wet n wild H20 eyeliner, it STAYS</li>
            <li> Love it! Its so dark and perfect for people with shaky hands</li>
            <li> I did not buy this off Amazon, I had bought this liner at a local beauty market. The felt tip is extra stiff and creates really amazing fine lines and has no problems getting to the lash line. It takes a coat or two to actually get the liquid to become an opaque black, though. And oh, how it stings. When I had applied it to my upper lid, there was a burning sensation.  My eyes had an allergic reaction and my eyes watered up and turned vainy and red. I would not recommend this to people with dry or sensitive eyes. Even though the applier is great and stuff, I&#x27;m going to stick with my Mega Liner eyeliner...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 15 with sensitive skin, but this eyeliner is perfect &amp;#60;3 I have a steady hand so it goes on quick and easy.. but probably would be messy for beginners as would any liquid ;)</li>
            <li> This is a really nice opaque black, and it goes on smoothly. If your hand shakes, though, you can really tell with a liquid liner, so be careful and rest your pinky finger/edge of your hand on your face as you work.</li>
