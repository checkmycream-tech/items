            <li> This isn&#x27;t the real thing DONT BUY IT!!!  They won&#x27;t accept a return once you have opened it and can only then realize it&#x27;s a knockoff!  The bottle is the same as the original but the product isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I would love it better if I could find it in the store, but this online find made me happy.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same as original but nice.</li>

            <li> My favorite cologne!  And VS has discontinued it, of course!  I&#x27;m very happy I was able to buy it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was so bummed when VS discontinued this product!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 8 years, and just ran out of my last bottle. They used to bring it back for Holiday, but this year, I couldn&#x27;t find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing, and light enough that it is my signature scent at work in the hospital.  Constant compliments. :)</li>
            <li> Great price!  love the smell and it delivered fast!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted &amp; quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite parfum. Victoria Secrets no longer carry it in the store. I get so many compliments when I wear it. That is the proof of a great smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Meets expectations. Love this perfume!</li>
            <li> It is not the original. Could tell it was a knock off almost immediately. However it is close enough to the original. The packaging seemed to be legit, just the smell was off. Overall I like it. I wear it daily and the smell lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> Amazing i received it so quickly.</li>
            <li> Loved this cologne since it first came out. Alluring and sexy scent.</li>
            <li> So exited to get this order. Love this cologne and was afraid I would never find any more. Made me very happy.</li>
            <li> Brand new, never been used! Not old or out of date!! Fast shipment! I am SO very happy with Elegance Scents!!</li>
            <li> On my wife , wow !!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this perfume/mist very much, but it seems to me like it&#x27;s more a mist than a perfume. Could I have been duped???????</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It has always been one of my signature scents and I was so upset when VS discontinued. Well to my delight I found it here and it was a great deal. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
