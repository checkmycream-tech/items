            <li>/&gt;The container being so feminine is perfect, and one of my coworkers mentioned she has a similar product, however she stated it&#x27;s nowhere near as cute or subtle!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this for free in exchange of my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Cheap  feel, the crown on top fell off on the first day, silver is all scratched up too quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I say it leaks too, I meant he whole top twists off within minutes.</li>
            <li>but when i refill it or even bring it with me any where the whole top unscrews and leaks all over me or anything by it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s meant to just sit on your toilet tank and just use good Ole matches when you go out</li>

            <li>and yes, the poo pourri really does work!</li>
            <li>The clear tube lets me know how the level is, which is great for those of us with little patience to pull tubes out every time you need to check the level of supply.</li>
            <li>The canister itself looks good enough that a few have asked what it is and instead of being disgusted, they&#x27;ve been impressed that such a unique spray is in such a cute case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their own favorite aromas, and this refillable sprayer can accommodate any of them!</li>

            <li>yes, i know i could have bought a much cheaper atomizer, but i&#x27;m very fancy.</li>

            <li> Pleasantly surprised that the insert container is glass.  </li>
            <li> I bought the large bottle for home and a small &amp;#34;Glitzy Spray&amp;#34; to cart to the bathroom at work.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to stick your hand too far down.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have minded the broken piece if it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> so I checked the lid was loose</li>
            <li> luckily I did my homework,  second even if this wasn&#x27;t a bad product</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly but was poor quality, (made of plastic) and decorative piece was broken.</li>
            <li> I also always keep this wrapped in a ziploc bag and then in the black sack it comes with.</li>
            <li> always check the connection and keep it tight.</li>
            <li> I just gave it 1 star even though I never tried it LUCKILY after reading all these bad reviews</li>
            <li> It requires a little bit of care-</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no issues with clogging, the spray pattern is small in diameter</li>
            <li> which is unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> It gets loose. :(</li>
            <li> Disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> With one spritz of the name-brand it&#x27;s made for you have ample coverage to do your business without needing to worry about horrifying coworkers or family members, or wasting water with courtesy flushing if it&#x27;s a friend&#x27;s house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the bag, at least not for the sprayer.</li>
            <li> I will not recommend this item because I&#x27;m so frustrated with it.</li>

            <li> Yikes! This leaked all over my brand new Kate Spade purse. Leaky!!!</li>
            <li> This was easy to fill, and I love how compact it is! The clear tube lets me know how the level is, which is great for those of us with little patience to pull tubes out every time you need to check the level of supply. It&#x27;s not an automobile oil tank!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container being so feminine is perfect, and one of my coworkers mentioned she has a similar product, however she stated it&#x27;s nowhere near as cute or subtle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no issues with clogging, the spray pattern is small in diameter so you don&#x27;t have to stick your hand too far down. About 4-6&amp;#34; above the seat and it&#x27;s still going to be inside the bowl. With one spritz of the name-brand it&#x27;s made for you have ample coverage to do your business without needing to worry about horrifying coworkers or family members, or wasting water with courtesy flushing if it&#x27;s a friend&#x27;s house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the bag, at least not for the sprayer. It makes a great travel bag for jewelry though!</li>
            <li> I think the Poo Pourri is so much fun and this Glitzy Spritzer makes it a fun gift.  It works well and looks cute.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t clear whether or not the sprayer came with any product in it.  I had bought one for me and one for my daughter who lives in Maryland.  Since I had a refill bottle on hand it was not a problem for me, but I had to send her a 4 oz bottle to get her started.  Her little granddaughters came over to spend the night and absolutely loved the PooPourri.</li>
            <li> Everyone I gave these to, love them.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised that the insert container is glass.  Very good quality item.</li>
            <li> Did not work. No way to fefill. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just gave it 1 star even though I never tried it LUCKILY after reading all these bad reviews luckily I did my homework,  second even if this wasn&#x27;t a bad product I would never put any liquids in my (designer bag) Just sayin!!!! I think it&#x27;s meant to just sit on your toilet tank and just use good Ole matches when you go out they work just as well and they don&#x27;t leak!!!!</li>
            <li> Received item damaged, rhinestone embellished crown was not on lid nor in package.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this works as it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Everyone I have given this to loves it also.</li>
            <li> Lost my firt one. Had to replace it!</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried this sprayer multiple times and each time I use it, it leaks. When I say it leaks too, I meant he whole top twists off within minutes. I was really excited when I got this because it was the perfect size, great amount of liquid to hold, cute cap, etc. but when i refill it or even bring it with me any where the whole top unscrews and leaks all over me or anything by it. I will not recommend this item because I&#x27;m so frustrated with it.</li>
            <li> yes, i know i could have bought a much cheaper atomizer, but i&#x27;m very fancy. i like to take this with me to the beach club on the off chance i will need to do my business on the premises.</li>
            <li> I really liked it at first. I had it in my purse and noticed my purse had the scent of the Poo-Pourri so I checked the lid was loose and it all leaked in my purse. I refilled it, really tightened it but it happened again. It gets loose. :(</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love,  Poo-Pourri: Love the scents; their brand, the clever &amp; fun marketing, .  The products live up to and exceed expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer is lovely and would make a great gift to yourself and all of your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Poo-Pourri is so much fun to tell people what a great product it is; especially when the conversation gets dull at cocktail parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.S.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Sprayer sits in purse nicely.  Useful when out to eat in restaurant and you don&#x27;t want to be embarrassed.  Stops you from holding it until you get home.....which is unhealthy.  Got for my sister to use in her office surroundings since her co-workers like to advertise who was in restroom before them.  Smells much better than sprays bought in grocery stores.</li>
            <li> Cute, small, discreet.</li>
            <li> great container for my spray. easy to carry discretely in my pocket at work.</li>
            <li> I am floored! When you have IBS, it is no picnic to use a restroom at work that is shared by more than 30 people. This saved me. I bought the large bottle for home and a small &amp;#34;Glitzy Spray&amp;#34; to cart to the bathroom at work. You really only need one or two spays. Awesome! I received this for free in exchange of my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> No one likes to be that one that ruined a restroom, especially if that restroom is public. Poo-Pourri&#x27;s Glitzy Spritz refillable sprayer has been a great way to keep bathroom odors from disturbing those around me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lactose-intolerant, and if any milk or cheese sneaks its way into my food I&#x27;m destined for a trip to the bathroom very shortly thereafter. This sleek silver sprayer comes in its own travel pouch and quickly found a home in my purse. The sprayer is very light and discrete, making it easy to take out and use in public areas. The canister itself looks good enough that a few have asked what it is and instead of being disgusted, they&#x27;ve been impressed that such a unique spray is in such a cute case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their own favorite aromas, and this refillable sprayer can accommodate any of them! The tank pulls out of its metal holster and the spray nozzle twists off for easy refilling. This can be used with any Poo-Pourri scent or customized with your own scents by using rubbing alcohol and essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poo-Pourri&#x27;s Glitzy Spritz sprayer has been a gorgeous, discrete way to keep my toilet smelling like roses, herbs, flowers - anything but waste!! I did receive this sprayer at a discount but price doesn&#x27;t change how handy it is, nor does it effect my review.</li>
            <li> Loved this fancy purse or travel spray bottle. It&#x27;s very cute.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill, use, and hide your poo-pourri discreetly.</li>
            <li> Love that I have a portable one and yes, the poo pourri really does work!</li>
            <li> Who needs the velvet bag. Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried Poo-Pourri then you should as it does work.  I got this to keep in my purse for those just in case moments when you gotta go and your are not at home.  I have not put it in my purse so I am hoping that it does not leak</li>
            <li> Gotta Love this discreet way to carry my most valuable travel accessory!</li>
            <li> I wish this were metal (it&#x27;s plastic). The crown popped off about 3 weeks after I received it. It requires a little bit of care- always check the connection and keep it tight. I also always keep this wrapped in a ziploc bag and then in the black sack it comes with. Don&#x27;t forget to use a ziploc as well because the sprayer does leak from time to time. I read reviews about this leaking and ruining purses so the zippy trick prevents that from happening.</li>
            <li> Daughter likes this gift for on the &amp;#34;go&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Cheap  feel, the crown on top fell off on the first day, silver is all scratched up too quickly.  The spray mechanism is so-so.  It&#x27;s certainly useful to have in my purse but I keep meaning to buy an upgraded version elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking container</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked in my purse, now I cant get the smell out.</li>
            <li> It leaked in my bag. Thought it should be leak proof. Disappointed and frustrated.</li>
