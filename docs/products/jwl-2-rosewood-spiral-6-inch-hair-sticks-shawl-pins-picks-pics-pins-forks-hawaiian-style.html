            <li>the sticks themselves are smooth, just the right length &amp; of nice quality.</li>
            <li>I thought the aluminum stick (they come in a variety of colors) was so cool that I bought a couple more in the silver color.  </li>
            <li>I have fine slippery hair</li>
            <li>Held well, are strong and smooth.</li>

            <li>Great for a partial hair knot (one stick) or full hair knot (both sticks).  </li>
            <li>The enique design looks cool when you wear them.  </li>
            <li>Very well made, nice sharp point to assure good hold.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more... :)</li>
            <li>These all arrived amazingly quickly given that they&#x27;re being shipped from Hawaii.</li>
            <li>They shipped promptly and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The pins arrived quickly and are as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them numerous times and am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>This beautifully crafted hair stick arrived a few days ago and I was thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work wonderfully on my medium length, thick, and fine-stranded hair!</li>
            <li>They are strong, and pretty much don&#x27;t wear at all!</li>
            <li>They are great and don&#x27;t make your head hurt or feel heavy.</li>
            <li>in all, well worth my money.</li>
            <li>These came super fast in the mail, were exactly as pictured, and I got a free gift for my purchase.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the friendly note and gift from the seller.</li>
            <li>They are light weight and sturdy enough to hold my hair securely.  </li>
            <li>The length and weight are good, and the slight undulations along the length help them stay in.</li>
            <li>They are very reasonably priced and came with a handwritten note about their care.  </li>
            <li>My little dog loved it and chewed one up.</li>
            <li>I have used them consistently for months and months.</li>
            <li>I received these incredibly fast (two days)!</li>
            <li>Bought them for a hot friend of mine.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li>Hair sticks are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They do the same job, but are more discreet.</li>
            <li>Love this product--as well as the extra gift from JWL.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more sticks and hair accessories in the future.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Jim Lovell!</li>
            <li>These are very pretty, but just a little shorter than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and hold up my long hair very well.</li>
            <li>They really do the trick and dealing with JWL Hawnkoa has been a pleasure.</li>
            <li>They hold really well, too.</li>
            <li>I really like these hair sticks.  </li>
            <li>These are very well made</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>The wave design on these really help to hold hair in place.</li>
            <li>At first I thought they would be too short, but they are actually the perfect size and the wide top and slightly wavy shape assures the stick does not slide out the bottom, which was an issue I had with some other sticks I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The hairsticks are very well made, hold my hair up nicely, (my hair is curly, medium in thickness, about 4 inches below the shoulder) and were delivered faster than the other items I ordered at the same time from Amazon prime!</li>
            <li>I have normal (not thick, not thin) hair to my butt and weight</li>
            <li>I will most definitely buy from this seller again and, if these break or get lost in the future, I&#x27;ll be getting them again.</li>
            <li>Loved them but with my thick hair I broke them within a month!</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this for any lady looking to accessorize.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone on the move who desires to get away from the plastic clippy look.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this spiral design.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this purchase</li>
            <li>then I expected, with a smooth satin finish.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun that they&#x27;re actually from Hawaii.</li>
            <li>He not only sent me 2 new sticks, but also one of the aluminum sticks he makes and one of another wood design he makes!!!  </li>
            <li>the only aspect of the design that i don&#x27;t love is the bulbous end, though it stops the stick from sliding too far into the bun, it is very visible from the front of my head &amp; changes the look a little bit.</li>
            <li>I ordered a few different styles and different woods and they all have exceptional quality.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to replace a pair that was over 50 years old my grandmother had given me as a teenager.  </li>
            <li>(The package shipped direct from Hawaii, not from Amazon.)</li>
            <li>never too much or too little, but always just the right amount of class.</li>
            <li>Hair stick broke the first time I attempted to place in my thin, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>These hair sticks are nicely designed and fashionable with a casual, classic look.</li>
            <li>The tips are super sharp so they could double for a defense weapon.  </li>
            <li>They are simplistic, yet elegant!</li>
            <li>They are just the right length: long enough to hold up my yards of hair, but not long enough to stick out too far and poke people.</li>
            <li>I have very thick wavy hair and sometimes the more plasticy ones do not hold my hair up well.</li>
            <li>One of the sticks broke early on for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li>I do wish they were a bit more pointy at the thin end, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair down to my waist and regular hair ties would give me headaches and snap frequently.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve already used them and am very pleased and would certainly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> These hairsticks arrived quickly, and I found them to be very light and slender, but they seem strong.</li>
            <li> the sticks themselves are smooth, just the right length &amp; of nice quality.</li>
            <li> I thought the aluminum stick (they come in a variety of colors) was so cool that I bought a couple more in the silver color.  </li>
            <li> I have fine slippery hair</li>
            <li> Held well, are strong and smooth.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful hair sticks and work even for my sister&#x27;s fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> the description is accurate.</li>
            <li> These wooden hair pins are great.</li>
            <li> She loves them and they&#x27;re still in great shape months later.</li>
            <li> These hair sticks fit well with makeup brushes or pens/pencils, and they travel well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the look of the hair pin.</li>
            <li> They do a good job of holding a bun/chignon in my long hair and I would buy more of them from this company.</li>
            <li> These are great for long hair.  </li>
            <li> These hair sticks work great for long hair.</li>
            <li> They are well made, light (so they don&#x27;t cause headaches, and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The wood is smooth (but not slippery), is a beautiful brown, and shimmers slightly when the light hits it right.</li>
            <li> Great for a partial hair knot (one stick) or full hair knot (both sticks).  </li>
            <li> The enique design looks cool when you wear them.  </li>
            <li> Very well made, nice sharp point to assure good hold.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more... :)</li>
            <li> These all arrived amazingly quickly given that they&#x27;re being shipped from Hawaii.</li>
            <li> They shipped promptly and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The pins arrived quickly and are as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them numerous times and am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> This beautifully crafted hair stick arrived a few days ago and I was thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully on my medium length, thick, and fine-stranded hair!</li>
            <li> They are strong, and pretty much don&#x27;t wear at all!</li>
            <li> They are great and don&#x27;t make your head hurt or feel heavy.</li>
            <li> in all, well worth my money.</li>
            <li> These came super fast in the mail, were exactly as pictured, and I got a free gift for my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the friendly note and gift from the seller.</li>
            <li> They are light weight and sturdy enough to hold my hair securely.  </li>
            <li> The length and weight are good, and the slight undulations along the length help them stay in.</li>
            <li> They are very reasonably priced and came with a handwritten note about their care.  </li>
            <li> My little dog loved it and chewed one up.</li>
            <li> I have used them consistently for months and months.</li>
            <li> I received these incredibly fast (two days)!</li>
            <li> Bought them for a hot friend of mine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li> Hair sticks are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They do the same job, but are more discreet.</li>
            <li> Love this product--as well as the extra gift from JWL.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more sticks and hair accessories in the future.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Jim Lovell!</li>
            <li> These are very pretty, but just a little shorter than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and hold up my long hair very well.</li>
            <li> They really do the trick and dealing with JWL Hawnkoa has been a pleasure.</li>
            <li> They hold really well, too.</li>
            <li> I really like these hair sticks.  </li>
            <li> These are very well made</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> The wave design on these really help to hold hair in place.</li>
            <li> At first I thought they would be too short, but they are actually the perfect size and the wide top and slightly wavy shape assures the stick does not slide out the bottom, which was an issue I had with some other sticks I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The hairsticks are very well made, hold my hair up nicely, (my hair is curly, medium in thickness, about 4 inches below the shoulder) and were delivered faster than the other items I ordered at the same time from Amazon prime!</li>
            <li> I have normal (not thick, not thin) hair to my butt and weight</li>
            <li> I will most definitely buy from this seller again and, if these break or get lost in the future, I&#x27;ll be getting them again.</li>
            <li> Loved them but with my thick hair I broke them within a month!</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this for any lady looking to accessorize.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone on the move who desires to get away from the plastic clippy look.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this spiral design.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this purchase</li>
            <li> then I expected, with a smooth satin finish.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun that they&#x27;re actually from Hawaii.</li>
            <li> He not only sent me 2 new sticks, but also one of the aluminum sticks he makes and one of another wood design he makes!!!  </li>
            <li> the only aspect of the design that i don&#x27;t love is the bulbous end, though it stops the stick from sliding too far into the bun, it is very visible from the front of my head &amp; changes the look a little bit.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few different styles and different woods and they all have exceptional quality.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a pair that was over 50 years old my grandmother had given me as a teenager.  </li>
            <li> (The package shipped direct from Hawaii, not from Amazon.)</li>
            <li> never too much or too little, but always just the right amount of class.</li>
            <li> Hair stick broke the first time I attempted to place in my thin, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> These hair sticks are nicely designed and fashionable with a casual, classic look.</li>
            <li> The tips are super sharp so they could double for a defense weapon.  </li>
            <li> They are simplistic, yet elegant!</li>
            <li> They are just the right length: long enough to hold up my yards of hair, but not long enough to stick out too far and poke people.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and sometimes the more plasticy ones do not hold my hair up well.</li>
            <li> One of the sticks broke early on for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> I do wish they were a bit more pointy at the thin end, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair down to my waist and regular hair ties would give me headaches and snap frequently.</li>
            <li> My wife wears them on both formal and casual occasions and the hair pins seem to add something stylish to any occasion....</li>
            <li> If you like using chopsticks or pencils but want something a little nicer that doesn&#x27;t stick out so far, these are the ticket.</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple of other styles of wooden hair sticks from the seller and he included two of his aluminum anodized sticks as well.</li>
            <li> It was just a tiny part that snapped off, less than 1/2 cm, so it&#x27;s still functional.</li>
            <li> They arrived quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Using a hair stick, allowed me to put up a bun with minimal effort and little/</li>
            <li> They stay in place all day without slipping.</li>
            <li> not much to tell you folks about hair sticks.</li>
            <li> These stay tight in my hair all day long.  </li>
            <li> They are shorter than other sticks I have tried, which is what I prefer.  </li>
            <li> I use them at least 3 times week to put my hair in various buns.</li>
            <li> so I sanded it down and</li>
            <li> They differ in color slightly, but hold hair well.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long, thick hair</li>
            <li> If you have long and thick hair, these are the sticks you need.  </li>
            <li> My hair is incredibly long and THICK</li>
            <li> Dress them up or down!</li>
            <li> I have long curly thick hair, and these hair sticks do the trick!</li>
            <li> Even a little personalized note from the vendor!</li>
            <li> Their rounded tips make them a bit difficult to insert</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love mine! I have used them consistently for months and months. The tip of one splintered...so I sanded it down and it&#x27;s great again!</li>
            <li> These hair sticks are easy to use and beautifully created. I love them! Turned to them because my stylist recommended Amazon. Went to this vendor because of the craftsmanship of the sticks. The wood is beautiful and with fine hair that&#x27;s often difficult to keep in an updo, these work marvelously! They arrived quicker than I expected. Excellent product. Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> My first hair sticks and they are BEAUTIFUL! They hold my hair up well and makes me feel better to use these rather than elastics. I received these incredibly fast (two days)! Will definitely be ordering more... :)</li>
            <li> light weight and great the curves at the top really help hold it in your hair, RECOMEND!!</li>
            <li> Loved these, would buy them again. Held well, are strong and smooth. If you are thinking about getting hair sticks, these are great. I have long straight hair down to my waist and regular hair ties would give me headaches and snap frequently. Using a hair stick, allowed me to put up a bun with minimal effort and little/ no pain from wearing my hair back. The stick did a great job holding itself in and was great and distributing the pressure so that my scalp didn&#x27;t hurt from wearing it.</li>
            <li> These are great for long hair.  They would be easier to use though if the tips were rounded to a blunt point instead of the fat cut on the ends. Otherwise very pleased with them</li>
            <li> beautiful and sturdy.</li>
            <li> These wooden hair pins are great. My wife wears them on both formal and casual occasions and the hair pins seem to add something stylish to any occasion.... never too much or too little, but always just the right amount of class.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product that came with a lovely hand written note from the vendor.  My daughter loves these.</li>
            <li> Bought them for a hot friend of mine. They look great and work great! She loves them and they&#x27;re still in great shape months later.</li>
            <li> Really awesome and my fiance loves them. Uses almost every day</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product! They are simplistic, yet elegant! Dress them up or down! I have long curly thick hair, and these hair sticks do the trick! Love them. They hold my hair up all day! They are strong, and pretty much don&#x27;t wear at all! I would strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very well made, nice sharp point to assure good hold.  I bought these to replace a pair that was over 50 years old my grandmother had given me as a teenager.  One broke, so I used only one because I could not find anything of the quality that I had.  Until I found these!!  They are very reasonably priced and came with a handwritten note about their care.  Impressed! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This beautifully crafted hair stick arrived a few days ago and I was thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderfully made and works great.  I have fairly long, thick hair and I could not be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for any lady looking to accessorize.</li>
            <li> These hair sticks work great for long hair. Just twist your hair up, put the stick in and you are set for all day. Just keep them out of sight from dogs. My little dog loved it and chewed one up. I ordered more and now keep one at work, one in the car and one at home. They are great and don&#x27;t make your head hurt or feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Hair sticks are exactly as pictured. They are light weight and sturdy enough to hold my hair securely.  I&#x27;ve used them numerous times and am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these about a month ago and they arrived very quickly. They are beautiful very nice quality wood. Very smooth and hold up my long hair very well. They stay in place all day without slipping. I ordered a couple of other styles of wooden hair sticks from the seller and he included two of his aluminum anodized sticks as well. I love them all!!</li>
            <li> These hair sticks are nicely designed and fashionable with a casual, classic look. Highly recommended for anyone on the move who desires to get away from the plastic clippy look. These hair sticks fit well with makeup brushes or pens/pencils, and they travel well.</li>
            <li> Quality merchandise, well made, and attractive. I&#x27;ve already used them and am very pleased and would certainly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> These hair sticks are lovely, sturdy, and lightweight. The seller included an extra hair stick in aluminum, as well, which was a wonderful surprise. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Hair stick broke the first time I attempted to place in my thin, baby fine hair.  Disapointed with the quality</li>
            <li> These came super fast in the mail, were exactly as pictured, and I got a free gift for my purchase. What a great buying experience. I would recommend them to everyone I know. Thanks!</li>
            <li> item arrived in a timely manner. the sticks themselves are smooth, just the right length &amp; of nice quality. they slide into the hair easily &amp; hold well. the only aspect of the design that i don&#x27;t love is the bulbous end, though it stops the stick from sliding too far into the bun, it is very visible from the front of my head &amp; changes the look a little bit.</li>
            <li> They are beautiful and mostly strong, but the tip of one of the sticks snapped off the first time I tried to put it in my hair. Kind of disappointing. It was just a tiny part that snapped off, less than 1/2 cm, so it&#x27;s still functional.</li>
            <li> These sticks are beautiful and well made and stay in my hair.  One of the sticks broke early on for no apparent reason.  I contacted the seller and he was so great.  He said that sometimes there can be a break that just has to do with a flaw in the grain of the wood.  He not only sent me 2 new sticks, but also one of the aluminum sticks he makes and one of another wood design he makes!!!  I thought the aluminum stick (they come in a variety of colors) was so cool that I bought a couple more in the silver color.  These all arrived amazingly quickly given that they&#x27;re being shipped from Hawaii.</li>
            <li> These are great for holding your hair in a twist.  If you like using chopsticks or pencils but want something a little nicer that doesn&#x27;t stick out so far, these are the ticket. They do the same job, but are more discreet. Suitable for the office.</li>
            <li> Both broke within a month of regular use.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and use one of these to put it up often.  I really enjoy the look of the hair pin. The wood grain is beautiful and it is very functional!  I want to order some more for variety.</li>
            <li> Love these hair sticks!  They really do the trick and dealing with JWL Hawnkoa has been a pleasure.</li>
            <li> These are lovely - well made of nice wood - and are just getting nicer with use. They hold really well, too. (And, the seller shipped them immediately. All around a great experience.)</li>
            <li> These look great, they are light weight and the shape really holds your hair in place.  The tips are super sharp so they could double for a defense weapon.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them for kids hair for that reason.</li>
            <li> These are even more beautiful in person then I expected, with a smooth satin finish.  I ordered a few different styles and different woods and they all have exceptional quality.  The customer service was excellent and very personal, with a hand written note.  I highly recommend ordering from this company for your own personal use or something to be very proud to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful hair sticks and work even for my sister&#x27;s fine, long hair. I highly recommend this spiral design.</li>
            <li> Loved them but with my thick hair I broke them within a month! I will have to order some more I loved them that much!</li>
            <li> These hair sticks (package of two) are very nicely crafted, smoothed, and polished. The length and weight are good, and the slight undulations along the length help them stay in. A very good product, and at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service from this company is also good. (The package shipped direct from Hawaii, not from Amazon.) They shipped promptly and it arrived quickly. The packaging was also done well--protective without being overdone. Even a little personalized note from the vendor! I&#x27;d buy something from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love this product--as well as the extra gift from JWL.</li>
            <li> These hair sticks are very beautifully made, the wood is smooth and glossy, and they hold hair in place really well.  At first I thought they would be too short, but they are actually the perfect size and the wide top and slightly wavy shape assures the stick does not slide out the bottom, which was an issue I had with some other sticks I&#x27;ve used.  I do wish they were a bit more pointy at the thin end, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> not much to tell you folks about hair sticks. the description is accurate. they&#x27;re sticks that go in your hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, smooth appearance.  The wood used for these hair sticks hold better than plastic hair sticks of greater length.  Great for a partial hair knot (one stick) or full hair knot (both sticks).  Great look for causal or business causal wear.  Consider this a gift for a woman with medium-length hair.</li>
            <li> Love them!  I have normal (not thick, not thin) hair to my butt and weight is an issue for me for buns, clips, etc.  These stay tight in my hair all day long.  These rock!!</li>
            <li> I only bought two of the hair sticks in order to give them a try.  They are gorgeous...the wood is smooth and attractive, and the 6&amp;#34; stick is perfect for my shoulder-length hair.  I plan to purchase more sticks and hair accessories in the future.  Customer service exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> These hairsticks arrived quickly, and I found them to be very light and slender, but they seem strong. The wood is smooth (but not slippery), is a beautiful brown, and shimmers slightly when the light hits it right. They are just the right length: long enough to hold up my yards of hair, but not long enough to stick out too far and poke people. They slide in nicely and hold all day.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s fun that they&#x27;re actually from Hawaii. The seller included instructions and a handwritten note, as well as a bonus aluminum hairstick. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, well worth my money.</li>
            <li> If you have long and thick hair, these are the sticks you need.  These are so strong that your hair will stay up all day.  They are shorter than other sticks I have tried, which is what I prefer.  I love these and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> They stay in my hair and keep it up all day.  I plan on ordering more of them!  The wood and shape of the sticks is lovely.</li>
            <li> I really like these hair sticks.  They are easy to use and hold my hair for hours.  They are exactly what I wanted.  Buy them.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these. They hold my thick hair great, and they look beautiful too! I also received a complimentary spiral hair stick along with my order, and those work wonderfully too. Very good buy, and highly recommended. I&#x27;m happy to have bought these for my first ever hair sticks! Thanks Jim Lovell!</li>
            <li> These are terrific. They are well made, light (so they don&#x27;t cause headaches, and they arrived quickly. I will most definitely buy from this seller again and, if these break or get lost in the future, I&#x27;ll be getting them again.</li>
            <li> I bought these about two years ago and they are still holding up perfectly. These hairsticks are the best! I use them at least 3 times week to put my hair in various buns. Buns are so much better than putting hair up with hair ties, and these sticks hold my hair up all day. I have very thick wavy hair and sometimes the more plasticy ones do not hold my hair up well. They are very beautiful too!</li>
            <li> I love these things!  They work wonderfully on my medium length, thick, and fine-stranded hair! The ends don&#x27;t dig baddly into my scalp or pull any hair out when I put them in. The enique design looks cool when you wear them.  When I can, I am definattly getting more items from this seller. :D</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this purchase. The hairsticks are very well made, hold my hair up nicely, (my hair is curly, medium in thickness, about 4 inches below the shoulder) and were delivered faster than the other items I ordered at the same time from Amazon prime! I really appreciated the friendly note and gift from the seller. I would highly recommend this purchase</li>
            <li> They are beautiful and lite. Perfect for my hair. The seller was excellent they even sent me a gift. I will order again.</li>
            <li> LOVE these hairs ticks! My hair is incredibly long and THICK so any hair stick that I try, they snap after about a day or two. These are very well made and I plan on buying lots more!</li>
            <li> These are very pretty, but just a little shorter than I would have liked. They are more for decorating an already pinned bun. I was looking for ones I could use to create the updo.</li>
            <li> I really like these. They do a good job of holding a bun/chignon in my long hair and I would buy more of them from this company.</li>
            <li> The wave design on these really help to hold hair in place. I have fine slippery hair but this works perfectly to keep my hair up.</li>
            <li> I love these! Perfect!</li>
            <li> The pins arrived quickly and are as described. They differ in color slightly, but hold hair well. Their rounded tips make them a bit difficult to insert (but this means you don&#x27;t have to worry about poking someone&#x27;s eye out).</li>
