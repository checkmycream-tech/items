            <li>I also use their shampoo, awesome products!</li>
            <li>I used to wash my hair, it was the best I&#x27;d ever used.  </li>
            <li>And the company is cruelty-free and (almost) vegan, which is another, wonderful plus!</li>
            <li>Earth Science makes the best hair conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the conditioner the company makes and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>Best unscented shampoo I have found.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be re-ordering this - it works great for skin allergy sufferers.</li>

            <li>leaves both our hair and our breath&lt;br /&gt;in good shape</li>

            <li>These are perfect and work fantastic.</li>

            <li>My family is very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>For the rest of the year, it&#x27;s a good amount of conditioning for me, and it leaves my hair nice and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is amazing.  </li>
            <li>As described, great seller, quick shipment.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to fragrances put into most beauty products.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m one of those that quit washing my hair (18 months ago) and my hair looks, feels and smells better than ever (and my hairdresser agrees - she just cuts it now; no wash or product on my hair).</li>
            <li>My hair feels better AFTER shampoo and before conditioner when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>It felt more like a cream rinse rather than a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My dandruff magically disappeared.</li>
            <li>I love earth science products.</li>
            <li>Leaving it in longer before rinsing gives me better results.</li>
            <li>this product has NO smell so in that regard I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it, it cleans my hair very nicely without setting off reactions, and I had high hopes for the conditioner.</li>
            <li>So my hair generally performs beautifully while my scalp and neck throw tantrums with most products.</li>
            <li>This works great - allergies completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li>It is really gentle and does a great job of removing tangles and also rinses out quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is hands down, no contest, the best conditioner I have ever used on my curly hair...</li>
            <li>This conditioner performers well and is fragrance free as advertised, with no \\&quot;masking fragrance\\&quot; as found in some so-called perfume free products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Earth Science Fragrance Free Shampoo for YEARS.</li>
            <li>It is truly fragrance free</li>
            <li>I will probably continue using it because of the fact that I cant find another product that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>My swimming pool does a great job of getting rid of dandruff but only in the summer.</li>
            <li>Great product and very happy to tell others about it, even at the expensive of my own personal embarrassment.</li>
            <li>Since hair frames the face, it is logical that more sinus/headache sufferers and people with sensitivities would want to eliminate perfume there.</li>
            <li>Great price too, lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li>Instead, I got that familiar pressure in my sinuses from this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m chemically sensitive and this product is perfect for me, although the picture is different from the product I use.</li>
            <li>I was hoping against hope that I would have a more positive experience to share about this conditioner, but I just don&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li>However, my hair was tangled, full of static and very fly-away after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The product feels natural and nourishing; and I can honestly say I look forward to my showers now.  </li>
            <li>We cannot have anything with even a mild scent in our home.</li>
            <li>poo\\&quot;) conditioner wash and just order the gallon size every few months, which is surprisingly affordable, considering I would go through 2-3 bottles of the cheap, toxic stuff every week.   </li>
            <li>I tried to use this product as I am on a search to find a decent fragrance free conditioner.</li>
            <li>Awesome, gentle non-irritating conditioner for my thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much of this conditioner....</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I started using this, along with my 3 year old daughter and wife.</li>
            <li>I am still on the search for a fragrance free shampoo that isn&#x27;t so expensive and does a GREAT job....</li>
            <li>Earth Science Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;It didnt leave my hair as soft and manageable as most other conditioners, but I did like the fact that it was fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Conditions well without any fragrance, however does have a hint of pasty scent from the ingredients - nothing unusual.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My sinuses and this product are getting along very well...</li>
            <li>I paid extra for a fragrance free product, but I didn&#x27;t get one.  </li>
            <li>although I&#x27;ve never noticed much difference anytime I&#x27;ve changed products.  </li>
            <li>This year we didn&#x27;t use it because there was too much rain.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t understand why fragrance free products have to come in such small containers and cost so much more than fragranced products.</li>
            <li>My sinuses are high maintenance...</li>
            <li>My wife says this is high quality soap.</li>
            <li>My hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it did when I used other products.</li>
            <li>So hard to find fragrance free conditioners that also leave your hair silky!</li>
            <li>even the natural ones-- made me feel until I switched to fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of years now, since I am sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have seborrheic dermatitis that overlaps most unpleasantly with easily aggravated eczema.</li>
            <li>(fragrance-free doesn&#x27;t mean the ingredients are magically odorless), but it leaves my hair feeling like straw.</li>
            <li>A lot of scent free products fail to clean or work as intended.</li>
            <li>I can find no other explanation than this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mystery to me why fragrance free shampoos and conditioners are so hard to find.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to find an affordable fragrance-free conditioner that was eligible for Prime shipping, to replace my more expensive current brands.    </li>
            <li>This is only one of very few products that I can use with my super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels MORE dry and rough after using it, and that&#x27;s no easy feat with my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of --real-- moisture in it, which plumps up the hair and tames frizz without coating the hair (with oil) and weighing it down.  </li>

            <li> The reason I rated it only four stars is that it does not condition quite enough for dry hair in wintertime.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair soft and healthy without my skin breaking out in a bad rash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To get a little more conditioning in the winter, I I tried leaving a little bit in my hair (not rinsing quite thoroughly), but that left my hair feeling heavy and limp.</li>
            <li> There is very hard water where I live, so a conditioner does need to \\&quot;work\\&quot; a little harder than normal.</li>

            <li> a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It can mean whatever the manufacturer wants it to mean.  </li>
            <li> I hate leaving a review this negative, but there just isn&#x27;t any redeeming this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It still doesn&#x27;t work as well as the fragranced conditioners I have used in the past, but it is the closest that I have found.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is that I decided to at least keep it in the shower to use as shaving cream/lotion for my legs since I&#x27;d already spent the money on it, and it doesn&#x27;t even work well for THAT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is one of the LEAST \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; conditioners I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My scalp, unfortunately, is another story.</li>
            <li> I never realized how miserable</li>

            <li> This conditioner performers well and is fragrance free as advertised, with no \\&quot;masking fragrance\\&quot; as found in some so-called perfume free products. It&#x27;s a mystery to me why fragrance free shampoos and conditioners are so hard to find. Since hair frames the face, it is logical that more sinus/headache sufferers and people with sensitivities would want to eliminate perfume there. I will keep buying this brand now that I have found it.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to fragrances put into most beauty products.  This conditioner leaves my hair soft and healthy without my skin breaking out in a bad rash.  Great price too, lasts me a long time. Highly recommended! I also use their shampoo, awesome products!</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually using this in the shower for moisturizing my skin.  I apply it to my body, wait about 1 minute or so and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used to wash my hair, it was the best I&#x27;d ever used.  However, I&#x27;m one of those that quit washing my hair (18 months ago) and my hair looks, feels and smells better than ever (and my hairdresser agrees - she just cuts it now; no wash or product on my hair).</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance free conditioner for your hair! My sinuses are high maintenance...they hate any kind of perfumes or fragrances. My sinuses and this product are getting along very well...thank God! You don&#x27;t have to use very much of this conditioner....a little bit goes a long way. Will definitely order again. Love it!</li>
            <li> After ordering this product, I learned that \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; is not a protected term.  It can mean whatever the manufacturer wants it to mean.  In this case, \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; includes a scent to mask the chemical ingredients.  I paid extra for a fragrance free product, but I didn&#x27;t get one.  Instead, I got that familiar pressure in my sinuses from this product.  Fellow allergy sufferers will know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Earth Science FF shampoo version after experiencing skin allergies on my neck and chest caused by scented shampoos and conditioners.  This works great - allergies completely cleared up.  No noticeable difference in my hair, either, although I&#x27;ve never noticed much difference anytime I&#x27;ve changed products.  I&#x27;ll be re-ordering this - it works great for skin allergy sufferers.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing.  It is hands down, no contest, the best conditioner I have ever used on my curly hair... PERIOD!  Yes, it smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue, but there are no (nada, zip, zero) chemical fumes to burn my eyes, irritate my skin, puff up my sinuses, or give me a headache.  Heavenly!  I use this as a (lather-free, \\&quot;no poo\\&quot;) conditioner wash and just order the gallon size every few months, which is surprisingly affordable, considering I would go through 2-3 bottles of the cheap, toxic stuff every week.   The one thing is does NOT do is coat your hair with silicone, so many people won&#x27;t get the (pore-clogging) gleam they are used, too, which may account for the few negative reviews.  It has a lot of --real-- moisture in it, which plumps up the hair and tames frizz without coating the hair (with oil) and weighing it down.  The product feels natural and nourishing; and I can honestly say I look forward to my showers now.  I never realized how miserable those fragrances-- even the natural ones-- made me feel until I switched to fragrance-free.  And the company is cruelty-free and (almost) vegan, which is another, wonderful plus!</li>
            <li> I was hoping against hope that I would have a more positive experience to share about this conditioner, but I just don&#x27;t.    Basics to get out of the way: my hair isn&#x27;t finicky. Almost every conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried leaves it feeling silky and looking shiny. My scalp, unfortunately, is another story. I have seborrheic dermatitis that overlaps most unpleasantly with easily aggravated eczema. So my hair generally performs beautifully while my scalp and neck throw tantrums with most products. I&#x27;ve been using Earth Science Fragrance Free Shampoo for YEARS. I love it, it cleans my hair very nicely without setting off reactions, and I had high hopes for the conditioner. I really wanted to find an affordable fragrance-free conditioner that was eligible for Prime shipping, to replace my more expensive current brands.    Unfortunately, this is one of the LEAST \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; conditioners I have ever used. My hair feels MORE dry and rough after using it, and that&#x27;s no easy feat with my hair. I don&#x27;t mind the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; (fragrance-free doesn&#x27;t mean the ingredients are magically odorless), but it leaves my hair feeling like straw. My hair feels better AFTER shampoo and before conditioner when I use this stuff. And that&#x27;s just inexcusable.    What&#x27;s worse is that I decided to at least keep it in the shower to use as shaving cream/lotion for my legs since I&#x27;d already spent the money on it, and it doesn&#x27;t even work well for THAT. My skin gets that \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; feeling like you get from bar soaps when I try to use it for shaving. I hate leaving a review this negative, but there just isn&#x27;t any redeeming this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is only one of very few products that I can use with my super sensitive skin.  I have no itching or reaction whatsoever.  I have used Earth Science for years now, and will continue to do so!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this conditioner&lt;br /&gt;and the associated shampoo for years.&lt;br /&gt;I have asthma, and my wife has a severe&lt;br /&gt;perfume allergy.&lt;br /&gt;This leaves both our hair and our breath&lt;br /&gt;in good shape</li>
            <li> So hard to find fragrance free conditioners that also leave your hair silky! This product is both. I have gotten compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Earth Science makes the best hair conditioner and shampoo.  It is really gentle and does a great job of removing tangles and also rinses out quickly.  It is truly fragrance free and I appreciate that the company does not test on animals!</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance free conditioner that I have found. It still doesn&#x27;t work as well as the fragranced conditioners I have used in the past, but it is the closest that I have found.</li>
            <li> Earth Science Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;It didnt leave my hair as soft and manageable as most other conditioners, but I did like the fact that it was fragrance free.  It felt more like a cream rinse rather than a conditioner.  I will probably continue using it because of the fact that I cant find another product that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product as I am on a search to find a decent fragrance free conditioner. Whereas this conditioner might not have fragrance or masking scent added, it is not without fragrance. In fact, it smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue.    It also did nothing to condition my hair. There is very hard water where I live, so a conditioner does need to \\&quot;work\\&quot; a little harder than normal. However, my hair was tangled, full of static and very fly-away after using this conditioner. I tried it for almost a month before I gave up.</li>
            <li> My family is very pleased with this product.  As described, great seller, quick shipment.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Awesome, gentle non-irritating conditioner for my thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect scent free soap. Look no further. I took a chance and bought 3 of these. We cannot have anything with even a mild scent in our home. These are perfect and work fantastic. My wife says this is high quality soap. A lot of scent free products fail to clean or work as intended. This works fantastically -- without ANY scent to mask what it might have missed. Not only that, and this might be TMI but I have chronic dandruff. I&#x27;ve used Selson to help but it hasn&#x27;t helped. Used it for years. My swimming pool does a great job of getting rid of dandruff but only in the summer. This year we didn&#x27;t use it because there was too much rain. Fortunately, I started using this, along with my 3 year old daughter and wife. My dandruff magically disappeared. I can find no other explanation than this shampoo. Will I buy it again? YES. Absolutely. I also bought the conditioner the company makes and it&#x27;s wonderful. Great product and very happy to tell others about it, even at the expensive of my own personal embarrassment.</li>
            <li> I love earth science products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m chemically sensitive and this product is perfect for me, although the picture is different from the product I use. I hope the formula stays the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now, since I am sensitive to fragrance. It has essentially no scent whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good conditioner, and I intend to keep using it. The reason I rated it only four stars is that it does not condition quite enough for dry hair in wintertime. For the rest of the year, it&#x27;s a good amount of conditioning for me, and it leaves my hair nice and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a little more conditioning in the winter, I I tried leaving a little bit in my hair (not rinsing quite thoroughly), but that left my hair feeling heavy and limp. It&#x27;s not a good &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioner. Leaving it in longer before rinsing gives me better results.</li>
            <li> Best unscented shampoo I have found.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because fragrances kick up my asthma.... this product has NO smell so in that regard I am pleased. My hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it did when I used other products. I also don&#x27;t understand why fragrance free products have to come in such small containers and cost so much more than fragranced products. I am still on the search for a fragrance free shampoo that isn&#x27;t so expensive and does a GREAT job.... perhaps none exist?</li>
