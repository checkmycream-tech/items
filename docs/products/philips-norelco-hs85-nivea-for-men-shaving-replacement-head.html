            <li>replacement head, not as good as original</li>
            <li>For the price it is also very good value and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The first two shaving heads I had were great</li>
            <li>This shaver head is made of very cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Goes very smooth</li>
            <li>I found them the cheapest on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived quickly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>None better than these blades.</li>
            <li>great, fast ship two thumbs up</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>It might also be because now I have more experience in using the shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a much better value item and just snaps into place.</li>
            <li>If I go longer than that, I start to get more irritation with my shaves.</li>
            <li>Love the razor with the lotion ejection system built in.</li>
            <li>The latest model has a better system.</li>
            <li>The price was better than if I got it at the store.</li>
            <li>I used to get replacement heads at Target, but they don&#x27;t carry them or the Nivea lotion any more.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>The shaving head is very flexible and helps him achieve a great shave without</li>
            <li>Amazon.com has more replacements, they are easier to find, and you do not have to go from store to store to find them.</li>
            <li>My husband love it.</li>
            <li>This Philips Norelco Nivea for Men Shaving Replacement Head is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>Had dropped the shaver too many times and had bent the head.  </li>
            <li>That said I tend to get a lot more life out of these than they advertise.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use these for ~1 year.</li>
            <li>Nine more words required in this review here now.</li>
            <li>Doesen&#x27;t matter how many days U chose not to shave in between.</li>
            <li>What more can I say I like the shaver and the blades</li>
            <li>This product works way better.</li>
            <li>and I like it much better than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for many years and this is about the 5th replacement.  </li>
            <li>It is true, if you want to keep your Norelco shaver shaving like new, this is the best way to get your replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Made my dad happy for older people do not like change and with him being 84 and living in a nursing home</li>
            <li>Good price and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I was noticing my Norelco shaver wasn&#x27;t getting as close a shave as I originally got with it, so it was time to replace the blades and what a difference it made!</li>
            <li>Works great and that is why I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>This kit includes a new lotion reservoir, very nice.</li>
            <li>The replacement head is very comfy and smooth cut is better then the original one !!!</li>
            <li>these new blades are very good quality and are so easy to change never had such a great shaver  </li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable and closest shaving electric razor I have ever used and hope they keep making the replacement heads and lotion for awhile.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can wash it directly with water is great.</li>
            <li>Better to buy from Amazon than Norelco if you qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these because I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>Good product and price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Amazing how nice a new head feels and also how close it gets.</li>
            <li>This an improvement over the original head which was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco HS85 Nivea for Men Shaving Replacement Head  Works well - better than original.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and he has been using this product for 3 years.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>They were easy to install and made an automatic improvement in the performance of my razor.</li>
            <li>This product came very quickly, was as advertised.</li>
            <li>installation was easy.</li>
            <li>Works fine, now.</li>
            <li>It worked fine as the replacement head.</li>
            <li>The blades work fine.</li>
            <li>Now It&#x27;s as good as new and smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li>Very good product, as expected .I</li>
            <li>description is accurate, item is as described.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that they will always be available to me.</li>
            <li>I contacted Norelco&#x27;s 800 phone customer support on a Saturday &amp; was given a Reference number to track the replacement they&#x27;d send free.  </li>
            <li>As per manufacturers recommendations, you are advised to replace your shaver head every year for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The razor part works great, but only one side will dispense the lotion.  </li>
            <li>This replacement head will give me another year of close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li>Baby face smooth</li>
            <li>It fit into my electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t fit my face correctly.</li>
            <li>Replacing an old one that worked for longer than advertised, and expect this one will be good also.</li>
            <li>This gives a clean shave cut free...</li>
            <li>This product is the perfect way to bring your shaver back to as new condition and I would recommend an annual service in this manner.</li>
            <li>bought this to replace my worn out blade from my original purchase.  </li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t an exact replacement for my model but the cut was ok.</li>
            <li>But the original blades, for whatever reason, gave me a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>They suggest changing the blades once a year, but my original head lasted for 4 years.</li>
            <li>I get a clean, bump-free shave using this product, and that&#x27;s worth a lot to me!</li>
            <li>Nice to have new blades</li>
            <li>New blades make for nice shave.</li>
            <li>I get clean close shaves with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>then I use the razor for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;must</li>
            <li>thanks good product fast shipping</li>
            <li>I use special after shaves that help reduce razor irritation.</li>
            <li>It is nothing special for the cost</li>
            <li>Fit my razor without a problem and heads work much better than the older (duller unit).</li>
            <li>It works without trouble, and it gives a very good close shave.</li>
            <li>Do yourselves a favor and google how to sharpen these on your own like an old WWII vet would do.</li>
            <li>I really like my Norelco HS85 shaver that extrudes Nivea lotion while shaving, but I don&#x27;t think that they make it any more.</li>
            <li>Glides on easy and smooth, really close shave.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower, completely water resistant, very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Heads worked fine and were much better than the old ones.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp again, and my face is happy again.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better new blades feel after a year of use on the original ones.</li>
            <li>Just what my father needed and I was lucky to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>The razor is an older model and we were sure it would work.</li>
            <li>did not notice much difference in effectiveness that may suggest that my old shaver was still in good condition after a year of use.</li>
            <li>I would very much like to be in the position to review this product!</li>
            <li>Fit exactly on the Phillips shaver.  </li>
            <li>Locally many stores stopped carrying these replacement blades because they want to continue to push the new models and their replacement blades.</li>
            <li>you ed be better off getting a new razor</li>
            <li>Though a new cleaning brush would of made me rate this as a love it</li>
            <li>back to a smooth and easy shave!</li>
            <li>I now get a very close and comfortable shave again.</li>
            <li>Cheap to buy, very costly to maintain.      </li>
            <li>I recieved this product fast and it was accurate.</li>
            <li>(probably worth 4 stars),</li>
            <li>The complete product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Fit my razor perfectly, wasn&#x27;t expecting to get a replacement gel resevoir that apparently comes standard (it doesnt match my razor, thats my only gripe).</li>
            <li>Both times they arrived in time and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Not using the shaver right now</li>
            <li>Easy to replace head, and a new conditioner pump - something I didn&#x27;t expect.  </li>
            <li>Easily changed and works like new again</li>
            <li>clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;Not as close as a razor but still very good.&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li>He says no other razor he has had did a better job.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using the new one for a week and keeps telling me how much he &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; using his favorite razor.</li>
            <li>Sure, these heads provide a decent shave and breathe new life into your aging Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>I like the shaver very much.  </li>
            <li>But when it&#x27;s cheaper to get a brand new Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 Blade Electric Razor Wet/Dry with Flexible Pivoting Head for $54.28 - Then these replacement heads aren&#x27;t something to get excited about.</li>
            <li>That is almost the cost of a new similar razor, with more features in Costco !</li>
            <li>This shaver won me over the first time I used it and continues to provide the closest shave ever.</li>
            <li>This package is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>OK, let&#x27;s get back to the shaving head itself.</li>
            <li>This was the exact replacement that we needed for my husband&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m sure there will be a next time).  </li>
            <li>Exact factory replacement head.  </li>
            <li>Most definitely recommend purchasing the razor and razor head!!</li>
            <li>This unit does exactly what it was constructed to do and does it well.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea why the price should be increased so much!</li>
            <li>I was pleased to learn that I received not only the razor and heads but also a replacement gel compartment.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered and needed.</li>
            <li>Norelco throws in a free case part (the soft rubber can wear out and rip).</li>
            <li>This was the first time for me to order a replacement head for this model of my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to take apart to clean the inner workings of the blades and easy to put back together.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the old original one.</li>
            <li>its a pretty good sign that enough others are having the same problem &amp; if/when yours breaks you&#x27;ll have to make alternative shaving arrangements for ??</li>
            <li>Tried to find it locally but prices were very high, will not find a better deal any where</li>
            <li>The new razor head was shipped quickly and was also affordable.</li>
            <li>but it was really as I stated with my first statement.</li>
            <li>It is easy to snap off the old head and snap on the new one.  </li>
            <li>I left it too long (2 years) to replace the shaver head - the new one is great....</li>
            <li>My well used razor cuts like it did when it was new...!!  </li>
            <li>The first step was switching to Philips Nice a last year and now the next one was to change my blades to HS85.</li>
            <li>but I just have to ask, &amp;#34;Who in their right mind would pay this much for replacement blades when a brand new razor costs less?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>(it snaps in without any kind of locking mechanism &amp; is easily popped off; a drop in the shower is sure to break it on the spot or generate a crack that will fail soon enough).  </li>
            <li>Very nice that it can be used wet  or dry.</li>
            <li>It was always prompt and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have had my Philips Norelco shaver for around two years, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Back to smooth, irritation-free shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d sell them for 10 dollars if anyone wants to buy them.</li>
            <li>So, now I&#x27;m ready for another year.</li>
            <li>now thwe price has really increased dramatically.  </li>
            <li>I can still find the shaving gel and they are much cheaper at drugstore.com</li>
            <li>work very well for him.</li>
            <li>Running the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; system with lotion, it&#x27;s important to replace the heads regularly.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>According to my husband, he gets a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast without any problems.</li>
            <li>Very quite compared to Braun.</li>
            <li>and I tried a gel product in a tube without much satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Shaves much faster and closer.</li>
            <li>But I discovered the real bonus was the blades I had to buy with it.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and the service fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t classic muscle cars worth this high price restoring to new, theyre parts of an electric shaver!</li>
            <li>(I think we just forgot the specific name of it- didn&#x27;t originally buy it on Amazon).</li>
            <li>ON TIME AND WHAT I NEEDED AT THE RIGHT PRICE AND NEW, NOT RECONDITION, NEW RAZOR BLADES NEW CONDITIONERS</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much difference new shaving heads could make.</li>
            <li>There are actually several methods, and as far as the replacement lubes just use your god given paws and throw on your face some cheap shaving cream.</li>
            <li>They are replacement blades for my older Norelco electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>you can buy a new razor for the normal retail proce for these heads!  </li>
            <li>The price was too high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product if you have this type of shaver.</li>
            <li>I personallt highly recommend this product to all men.</li>
            <li>I bought the right shaving head for my razor, but since my black plastic &amp;#34;drive shaft&amp;#34; was a bit worn, the shaver drive shaft frequently spun without engaging the head.  </li>
            <li>My husband has an older model of the Norelco Nivea razor that needed new blades.  </li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement straight away compared to my year old blades.</li>
            <li>However, I was surprised to get the whole head assembly.</li>
            <li>IF yours breaks you&#x27;ll find that replacement costs (direct $ &amp; opportunity) are such that you&#x27;d probably have been better off with something else entirely.      </li>
            <li>Anyways, he tried some cheaper electric razors until I finally found him the right replacement head.</li>
            <li>and I can wash it easy because the head dosen t set down into the body</li>
            <li>It is sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>With these new Norelco heads my shaver is like new again.  </li>
            <li>However, I have never had a problem with the new head.</li>
            <li>Wasteful to throw the 30 dollars and new heads in the trash</li>
            <li>Works like new.  </li>
            <li>It was brand new in box and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference from the one that came with the shaver</li>
            <li>Razor works like a new one.</li>
            <li>It was just what I needed, after going over 3 years without a new head.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone, instead of buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The purchase of new rotor and blades reminded me why I like the razor.</li>
            <li>It has made the razor as new.</li>
            <li>Shaves close and cheaper than the cost of a new razor.</li>
            <li>In addition you get a new gel pack/pump.</li>
            <li>Decent shave, no problems so far.</li>
            <li>Fixed the older blade and cream dispenser.</li>
            <li>The first shaving heads I used were gray, but this new one is white.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t seem as sharp nor glide across skin as easily as original heads or replacement heads that I purchased in a store.</li>
            <li>Wow, it&#x27;s like getting a new shaver all over again.</li>
            <li>Made my old shaver feel like new</li>
            <li>Be forewarned:  the new heads might not work in your old shaver if your drive shaft is worn,</li>
            <li>So I have two new ones, one old one</li>
            <li>no more pulling or cuts and a very close smooth shave now</li>
            <li>did not last nearly as long as the original one.</li>
            <li>Quickly finding replacement heads for other Norelco models when you need them is not a problem.  </li>
            <li>I love my razor but these are hard to find at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>so far they last and cut very well</li>
            <li>In general, I don&#x27;t think the Norelco HS85 gives a close shave in the first place unless you go over your face multiple times.</li>
            <li>it seems like I have trouble getting a smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still not as close or fast as shaving with multiple blade razor, but no nicks either.</li>
            <li>replaced for the old one..... used to be your customer....</li>
            <li>Because it was just very simple and straight forward.</li>
            <li>Of course, the razor was manufactured in 2007, so perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised.</li>
            <li>Years ago, they lasted for years of trouble free service.</li>
            <li>After much searching for this item at our local stores we found this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li>well I put this head on to replace the old head and</li>
            <li>This was a direct replacement for my non-functioning razor head which stopped rotating after a couple years of use.  </li>
            <li>The blades seem to cut OK, but they are unusually noisy from day one and duetting worse after 11 months of use.</li>
            <li>They make equal or better shavers including a head for less today!</li>
            <li>The lotion is very light, not oily at all, and a little goes a long way..  </li>
            <li>and they last a decent amount of time..</li>
            <li>(I recommend using a wet bar of soap rubbed directly to one&#x27;s skin -- much better than the Nivea lube &amp; less prone to get rubbed off, which often doesn&#x27;t become apparent until you&#x27;ve given yourself a \\&quot;razor</li>
            <li>First of all these things are getting harder to find, but I still have the electric razor and it works well.</li>
            <li>I was way overdue to replace these blades and the new blades made a big difference in comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li>I ended up putting the old ones back on and throwing these away.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are somewhat different than the originals with the shaver which I used for nearly three years.</li>
            <li>If you want to keep that old shaver this will definitely make it easier to hang on to.  </li>
            <li>I am using it for regular shave every day for nearly a year.</li>
            <li>love philips warrenty , they stand behind their product.</li>
            <li>Thus, the shortage of replacement Nivea heads, to me, seems like a very telling indicator of a fundamental design shortfall with the Nivea -- most people don&#x27;t experience the breakage, but enough do that spares are hard to find, much less obtain when needed.      </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheaper to be a new &amp; different, model entirely.  </li>
            <li>I replaced the head on my shaver because I thought my original head was getting dull.</li>
            <li>A few more years shaving please for just a little investment.</li>
            <li>Installation is as easy as putting the existing head back on your current one after you bang it too hard on the side of the sink and it flips off.</li>
            <li>That feature is totally unnecessary, more costly, &amp; mucho inferior to a bar of regular hand soap).      </li>
            <li>The new shaving head provides a closer shave than the year old one and takes less time.  </li>
            <li>New in box as expected.  </li>
            <li>I get less razor burns and marks and shave much faster.</li>
            <li>It actually lasts at least 1 year as long as you keep it clean.  </li>

            <li> This Philips Norelco Nivea for Men Shaving Replacement Head is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> Had dropped the shaver too many times and had bent the head.  </li>
            <li> That said I tend to get a lot more life out of these than they advertise.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use these for ~1 year.</li>
            <li> Nine more words required in this review here now.</li>
            <li> Doesen&#x27;t matter how many days U chose not to shave in between.</li>
            <li> What more can I say I like the shaver and the blades</li>
            <li> This product works way better.</li>
            <li> and I like it much better than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for many years and this is about the 5th replacement.  </li>
            <li> It is true, if you want to keep your Norelco shaver shaving like new, this is the best way to get your replacement heads.</li>

            <li> Good price and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I was noticing my Norelco shaver wasn&#x27;t getting as close a shave as I originally got with it, so it was time to replace the blades and what a difference it made!</li>
            <li> Works great and that is why I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> This kit includes a new lotion reservoir, very nice.</li>
            <li> The replacement head is very comfy and smooth cut is better then the original one !!!</li>
            <li> these new blades are very good quality and are so easy to change never had such a great shaver  </li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable and closest shaving electric razor I have ever used and hope they keep making the replacement heads and lotion for awhile.</li>
            <li> The fact that you can wash it directly with water is great.</li>
            <li> Better to buy from Amazon than Norelco if you qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these because I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li> Good product and price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Amazing how nice a new head feels and also how close it gets.</li>
            <li> This an improvement over the original head which was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HS85 Nivea for Men Shaving Replacement Head  Works well - better than original.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and he has been using this product for 3 years.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> They were easy to install and made an automatic improvement in the performance of my razor.</li>
            <li> This product came very quickly, was as advertised.</li>
            <li> installation was easy.</li>
            <li> Works fine, now.</li>
            <li> It worked fine as the replacement head.</li>
            <li> The blades work fine.</li>
            <li> Now It&#x27;s as good as new and smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li> Very good product, as expected .I</li>
            <li> description is accurate, item is as described.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that they will always be available to me.</li>
            <li> I contacted Norelco&#x27;s 800 phone customer support on a Saturday &amp; was given a Reference number to track the replacement they&#x27;d send free.  </li>
            <li> As per manufacturers recommendations, you are advised to replace your shaver head every year for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor part works great, but only one side will dispense the lotion.  </li>
            <li> This replacement head will give me another year of close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> Baby face smooth</li>
            <li> It fit into my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t fit my face correctly.</li>
            <li> Replacing an old one that worked for longer than advertised, and expect this one will be good also.</li>
            <li> This gives a clean shave cut free...</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect way to bring your shaver back to as new condition and I would recommend an annual service in this manner.</li>
            <li> bought this to replace my worn out blade from my original purchase.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t an exact replacement for my model but the cut was ok.</li>
            <li> But the original blades, for whatever reason, gave me a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> They suggest changing the blades once a year, but my original head lasted for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I get a clean, bump-free shave using this product, and that&#x27;s worth a lot to me!</li>
            <li> Nice to have new blades</li>
            <li> New blades make for nice shave.</li>
            <li> I get clean close shaves with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> then I use the razor for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;must</li>
            <li> thanks good product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I use special after shaves that help reduce razor irritation.</li>
            <li> It is nothing special for the cost</li>
            <li> Fit my razor without a problem and heads work much better than the older (duller unit).</li>
            <li> It works without trouble, and it gives a very good close shave.</li>
            <li> Do yourselves a favor and google how to sharpen these on your own like an old WWII vet would do.</li>
            <li> I really like my Norelco HS85 shaver that extrudes Nivea lotion while shaving, but I don&#x27;t think that they make it any more.</li>
            <li> Glides on easy and smooth, really close shave.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower, completely water resistant, very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Heads worked fine and were much better than the old ones.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp again, and my face is happy again.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better new blades feel after a year of use on the original ones.</li>
            <li> Just what my father needed and I was lucky to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> The razor is an older model and we were sure it would work.</li>
            <li> did not notice much difference in effectiveness that may suggest that my old shaver was still in good condition after a year of use.</li>
            <li> I would very much like to be in the position to review this product!</li>
            <li> Fit exactly on the Phillips shaver.  </li>
            <li> Locally many stores stopped carrying these replacement blades because they want to continue to push the new models and their replacement blades.</li>
            <li> you ed be better off getting a new razor</li>
            <li> Though a new cleaning brush would of made me rate this as a love it</li>
            <li> back to a smooth and easy shave!</li>
            <li> I now get a very close and comfortable shave again.</li>
            <li> Cheap to buy, very costly to maintain.      </li>
            <li> I recieved this product fast and it was accurate.</li>
            <li> (probably worth 4 stars),</li>
            <li> The complete product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Fit my razor perfectly, wasn&#x27;t expecting to get a replacement gel resevoir that apparently comes standard (it doesnt match my razor, thats my only gripe).</li>
            <li> Both times they arrived in time and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> Not using the shaver right now</li>
            <li> Easy to replace head, and a new conditioner pump - something I didn&#x27;t expect.  </li>
            <li> Easily changed and works like new again</li>
            <li> clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;Not as close as a razor but still very good.&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li> He says no other razor he has had did a better job.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using the new one for a week and keeps telling me how much he &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; using his favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Sure, these heads provide a decent shave and breathe new life into your aging Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> I like the shaver very much.  </li>
            <li> But when it&#x27;s cheaper to get a brand new Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 Blade Electric Razor Wet/Dry with Flexible Pivoting Head for $54.28 - Then these replacement heads aren&#x27;t something to get excited about.</li>
            <li> That is almost the cost of a new similar razor, with more features in Costco !</li>
            <li> This shaver won me over the first time I used it and continues to provide the closest shave ever.</li>
            <li> This package is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> OK, let&#x27;s get back to the shaving head itself.</li>
            <li> This was the exact replacement that we needed for my husband&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m sure there will be a next time).  </li>
            <li> Exact factory replacement head.  </li>
            <li> Most definitely recommend purchasing the razor and razor head!!</li>
            <li> This unit does exactly what it was constructed to do and does it well.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea why the price should be increased so much!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to learn that I received not only the razor and heads but also a replacement gel compartment.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered and needed.</li>
            <li> Norelco throws in a free case part (the soft rubber can wear out and rip).</li>
            <li> This was the first time for me to order a replacement head for this model of my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to take apart to clean the inner workings of the blades and easy to put back together.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the old original one.</li>
            <li> its a pretty good sign that enough others are having the same problem &amp; if/when yours breaks you&#x27;ll have to make alternative shaving arrangements for ??</li>
            <li> Tried to find it locally but prices were very high, will not find a better deal any where</li>
            <li> The new razor head was shipped quickly and was also affordable.</li>
            <li> but it was really as I stated with my first statement.</li>
            <li> It is easy to snap off the old head and snap on the new one.  </li>
            <li> I left it too long (2 years) to replace the shaver head - the new one is great....</li>
            <li> My well used razor cuts like it did when it was new...!!  </li>
            <li> The first step was switching to Philips Nice a last year and now the next one was to change my blades to HS85.</li>
            <li> but I just have to ask, &amp;#34;Who in their right mind would pay this much for replacement blades when a brand new razor costs less?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (it snaps in without any kind of locking mechanism &amp; is easily popped off; a drop in the shower is sure to break it on the spot or generate a crack that will fail soon enough).  </li>
            <li> Very nice that it can be used wet  or dry.</li>
            <li> It was always prompt and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have had my Philips Norelco shaver for around two years, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Back to smooth, irritation-free shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d sell them for 10 dollars if anyone wants to buy them.</li>
            <li> So, now I&#x27;m ready for another year.</li>
            <li> now thwe price has really increased dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I can still find the shaving gel and they are much cheaper at drugstore.com</li>
            <li> work very well for him.</li>
            <li> Running the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; system with lotion, it&#x27;s important to replace the heads regularly.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> According to my husband, he gets a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast without any problems.</li>
            <li> Very quite compared to Braun.</li>
            <li> and I tried a gel product in a tube without much satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Shaves much faster and closer.</li>
            <li> But I discovered the real bonus was the blades I had to buy with it.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and the service fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t classic muscle cars worth this high price restoring to new, theyre parts of an electric shaver!</li>
            <li> (I think we just forgot the specific name of it- didn&#x27;t originally buy it on Amazon).</li>
            <li> ON TIME AND WHAT I NEEDED AT THE RIGHT PRICE AND NEW, NOT RECONDITION, NEW RAZOR BLADES NEW CONDITIONERS</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much difference new shaving heads could make.</li>
            <li> There are actually several methods, and as far as the replacement lubes just use your god given paws and throw on your face some cheap shaving cream.</li>
            <li> They are replacement blades for my older Norelco electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> you can buy a new razor for the normal retail proce for these heads!  </li>
            <li> The price was too high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product if you have this type of shaver.</li>
            <li> I personallt highly recommend this product to all men.</li>
            <li> I bought the right shaving head for my razor, but since my black plastic &amp;#34;drive shaft&amp;#34; was a bit worn, the shaver drive shaft frequently spun without engaging the head.  </li>
            <li> My husband has an older model of the Norelco Nivea razor that needed new blades.  </li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement straight away compared to my year old blades.</li>
            <li> However, I was surprised to get the whole head assembly.</li>
            <li> IF yours breaks you&#x27;ll find that replacement costs (direct $ &amp; opportunity) are such that you&#x27;d probably have been better off with something else entirely.      </li>
            <li> Anyways, he tried some cheaper electric razors until I finally found him the right replacement head.</li>
            <li> and I can wash it easy because the head dosen t set down into the body</li>
            <li> It is sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> With these new Norelco heads my shaver is like new again.  </li>
            <li> However, I have never had a problem with the new head.</li>
            <li> Wasteful to throw the 30 dollars and new heads in the trash</li>
            <li> Works like new.  </li>
            <li> It was brand new in box and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference from the one that came with the shaver</li>
            <li> Razor works like a new one.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed, after going over 3 years without a new head.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone, instead of buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The purchase of new rotor and blades reminded me why I like the razor.</li>
            <li> It has made the razor as new.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and cheaper than the cost of a new razor.</li>
            <li> In addition you get a new gel pack/pump.</li>
            <li> Decent shave, no problems so far.</li>
            <li> Fixed the older blade and cream dispenser.</li>
            <li> The first shaving heads I used were gray, but this new one is white.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem as sharp nor glide across skin as easily as original heads or replacement heads that I purchased in a store.</li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s like getting a new shaver all over again.</li>
            <li> Made my old shaver feel like new</li>
            <li> Be forewarned:  the new heads might not work in your old shaver if your drive shaft is worn,</li>
            <li> So I have two new ones, one old one</li>
            <li> no more pulling or cuts and a very close smooth shave now</li>
            <li> did not last nearly as long as the original one.</li>
            <li> Quickly finding replacement heads for other Norelco models when you need them is not a problem.  </li>
            <li> I love my razor but these are hard to find at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> so far they last and cut very well</li>
            <li> In general, I don&#x27;t think the Norelco HS85 gives a close shave in the first place unless you go over your face multiple times.</li>
            <li> it seems like I have trouble getting a smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still not as close or fast as shaving with multiple blade razor, but no nicks either.</li>
            <li> replaced for the old one..... used to be your customer....</li>
            <li> Because it was just very simple and straight forward.</li>
            <li> Of course, the razor was manufactured in 2007, so perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised.</li>
            <li> Years ago, they lasted for years of trouble free service.</li>
            <li> After much searching for this item at our local stores we found this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li> well I put this head on to replace the old head and</li>
            <li> This was a direct replacement for my non-functioning razor head which stopped rotating after a couple years of use.  </li>
            <li> The blades seem to cut OK, but they are unusually noisy from day one and duetting worse after 11 months of use.</li>
            <li> They make equal or better shavers including a head for less today!</li>
            <li> The lotion is very light, not oily at all, and a little goes a long way..  </li>
            <li> and they last a decent amount of time..</li>
            <li> (I recommend using a wet bar of soap rubbed directly to one&#x27;s skin -- much better than the Nivea lube &amp; less prone to get rubbed off, which often doesn&#x27;t become apparent until you&#x27;ve given yourself a \\&quot;razor</li>
            <li> First of all these things are getting harder to find, but I still have the electric razor and it works well.</li>
            <li> I was way overdue to replace these blades and the new blades made a big difference in comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting the old ones back on and throwing these away.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are somewhat different than the originals with the shaver which I used for nearly three years.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep that old shaver this will definitely make it easier to hang on to.  </li>
            <li> I am using it for regular shave every day for nearly a year.</li>
            <li> love philips warrenty , they stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Thus, the shortage of replacement Nivea heads, to me, seems like a very telling indicator of a fundamental design shortfall with the Nivea -- most people don&#x27;t experience the breakage, but enough do that spares are hard to find, much less obtain when needed.      </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheaper to be a new &amp; different, model entirely.  </li>
            <li> I replaced the head on my shaver because I thought my original head was getting dull.</li>
            <li> A few more years shaving please for just a little investment.</li>
            <li> Installation is as easy as putting the existing head back on your current one after you bang it too hard on the side of the sink and it flips off.</li>
            <li> That feature is totally unnecessary, more costly, &amp; mucho inferior to a bar of regular hand soap).      </li>
            <li> The new shaving head provides a closer shave than the year old one and takes less time.  </li>
            <li> New in box as expected.  </li>
            <li> I get less razor burns and marks and shave much faster.</li>
            <li> It actually lasts at least 1 year as long as you keep it clean.  </li>
            <li> The replacement blades were worse then my worn out original blades.</li>
            <li> I can buy a new razor for less than the heads.  </li>
            <li> I needed to switch to an electric razor because my arms were not steady enough to hold a regular razor, because of 4 open back surgeries, and I would cut myself.</li>
            <li> Hoping the shaver will last that long.</li>
            <li> proper use and care of these blades don&#x27;t expect your pockets to be going overboard on buying replacement heads on a regular basis as they have a high product warranty and remain sharp even after several months of shaving.</li>
            <li> I shave, I usually have to go over my face twice with this new shaving head, then I still have to touch up my face with a regular shaving razor.  </li>
            <li> These little guys are finer than the old school Philips Norelco heads.</li>
            <li> I wish this razor came with the protective hard plastic piece that the original came with, if it did, my new blade probably wouldn&#x27;t be broken.</li>
            <li> The replacement head although seems expensive, it provides the smooth shave you can expect from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Norelco shavers, and their latest model has not been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I hope the replacement lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> Long time user of the razor and this is a year replacement</li>
            <li> Saved me from having to buy a new one with my heavy beard..!</li>
            <li> Bought these as a back-up to go with the Philips Norelco HS8420 Nivea for Men Razor, which I also bought from Amazon, but little did I know that I would only require their use after about a year of using the current shaving heads which came with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this thru Amazon.com after shopping the price on several other sites.</li>
            <li> Unlike other models in which just the screen or razor part can be replaced, if any part of this head breaks, the ENTIRE unit must be replaced.  </li>
            <li> We will continue to use this product as long as Philips produces it!</li>
            <li> This price is ridiculous and I would never pay that much for just one replacement head two years ago</li>
            <li> I have this Norelco which is a little outdated, but with the new heads each year they make the shaver feel like it was brand new.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough facial hair and can grow a full beard in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> This item is the entire head for the razor, and not just the blades which I had bought previously.</li>
            <li> Can shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it cuts those little stuborn hairs that the screen shavers always seem to miss.</li>
            <li> The only NEGATIVE comment is that I can&#x27;t get the same close shave unless I shave every day.</li>
            <li> it even makes it harder to please him</li>
            <li> Just what would be expected out of a replacement head for an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It traveled in duffle bags in all kinds of vehicles over rough terrain.  </li>
            <li> , it is not available at local store.</li>
            <li> These blades last a year with heavy use.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t shave on the weekends or on days off and try to mow down the whiskers with just the electric shaver it takes way too long and leaves some rough spots.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my original shaving head had gotten, until I replaced it!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This fragility is uncharacteristic of Norelco&#x27;s other shavers.  </li>
            <li> My store quit carrying my replacement heads, but they still carried some other Norelco heads.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Although it is recommended to change the blades yearly, I had the previous (stock) blades for 2 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two heads break in less than six months.  </li>
            <li> I bought him the razor that goes with this razor head about a year or year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> Being that he MUST shave 5 days out of the week, this has saved up tons of money and his face is much less irritated.</li>
            <li> Work as intended and made me a less hairy man again.  </li>
            <li> I bought a little over a year ago for less than $40 -- now they are ripping us off by charging over $170???  </li>
            <li> I have a little problem with ingrown hairs, but you probably cannot get both a close shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Yes you had to do a little looking around when you did not have a model</li>
            <li> After the cutting blades were worn down to about one half I decided to purchase new ones.</li>
            <li> Apparently this is a common occurrence as I&#x27;ve found it VERY difficult to locate replacement heads on store shelves where the entire razor is sold (empty shelf space is routine).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy a new razor because the heads are almost as expensive as the razor..</li>
            <li> Although I am disappointed with this head, using an electric razor is much nicer on face than a conventional razor blade.  </li>
            <li> they were sending the wrong model of shaver head per a completely different Reference number.  </li>
            <li> Usually it takes about a week or too to get adjusted to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I added a small amount of oil to each head, but it did not help.</li>
            <li> It almost looks like they are not made in the same factory as the originals, but it would be unlikely because of their complexity.</li>
            <li> They jell is a bit expensive, but only need it sparingly,with stubborn hairs, they dissapear immediately.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in my small hands.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for at least the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> Really hard to find and expensive because of that, I´m thinking that I should have to buy a newer model with less expensive cutting blades in the near future.  </li>
            <li> but they hardly pick up any hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my shaving head was until I replaced them.</li>
            <li> I recommend you change the heads on your electric razor at least once a year.</li>
            <li> It has been very difficult to buy in regular stores, i.e Sears, Walmarts etc.  </li>
            <li> It was a struggle to shave with the old head, grabbing hair now and then instead of cutting it!</li>
            <li> Also, much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> but the head is next to impossible.  </li>
            <li> They are ridiculously priced at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is a very hard to find product.  </li>
            <li> This product works as expected, nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat confused.  </li>
            <li> Sadly though, it&#x27;s already broken.  </li>
            <li> but I ordered the wrong heads.      </li>
            <li> if anything goes wrong they will send you replacement.</li>
            <li> After just one month, one of the heads broke....pretty expensive to buy a set of 3 just to replace one...</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Very expensive but does the job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve routinely bought replacements for mine for $27-30 on Amazon, and am disappointed to find that it&#x27;s no longer being produced.  </li>

            <li> None better than these blades.</li>
            <li> My husband has an older model of the Norelco Nivea razor that needed new blades.  I found them the cheapest on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived quickly and in good condition.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased here on several occasions to replace my razor blade sets. It was always prompt and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> With these new Norelco heads my shaver is like new again.  Great product and quick delivery.  I now get a very close and comfortable shave again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my original shaving head had gotten, until I replaced it! Wow, it&#x27;s like getting a new shaver all over again. I should have replaced it sooner!</li>
            <li> great, fast ship two thumbs up</li>
            <li> Something off about these.  Don&#x27;t seem as sharp nor glide across skin as easily as original heads or replacement heads that I purchased in a store.</li>
            <li> good price, good product, does what it claims to do :)</li>
            <li> I have a very tough facial hair and can grow a full beard in less than two weeks. Razor blades tend to cause neck irritation but electric razors never provide a sufficiently close shave. I wear a tie and after I wear a shirt a dozen time the inside of the shirt collar shows signs of fraying. This shaver won me over the first time I used it and continues to provide the closest shave ever. The only NEGATIVE comment is that I can&#x27;t get the same close shave unless I shave every day. If I don&#x27;t shave on the weekends or on days off and try to mow down the whiskers with just the electric shaver it takes way too long and leaves some rough spots. If you&#x27;re a religious every day shaver you should have no problems. During the week I get the best, closest and smoothest shave I have experienced in my 45+ years of shaving. The Nivea lotion also acts as a great shave lotion to the point I don&#x27;t need to apply an after shave lotion or cream. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Bought these as a back-up to go with the Philips Norelco HS8420 Nivea for Men Razor, which I also bought from Amazon, but little did I know that I would only require their use after about a year of using the current shaving heads which came with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With proper use and care of these blades don&#x27;t expect your pockets to be going overboard on buying replacement heads on a regular basis as they have a high product warranty and remain sharp even after several months of shaving.</li>
            <li> Fit my razor perfectly, wasn&#x27;t expecting to get a replacement gel resevoir that apparently comes standard (it doesnt match my razor, thats my only gripe).</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving head I have ever used. I needed to switch to an electric razor because my arms were not steady enough to hold a regular razor, because of 4 open back surgeries, and I would cut myself. This gives a clean shave cut free...</li>
            <li> I have used the Philips Norelco system for almost three years now.  The recommended length of time to use one of the heads is for one year.  The first two shaving heads I had were great (probably worth 4 stars), but then I bought this one and it seems like I have trouble getting a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obvious difference I noticed was in color.  The first shaving heads I used were gray, but this new one is white.  Other than that, I don&#x27;t know why or if Philips changed their manufacturing process, or maybe I just got a bum replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shave, I usually have to go over my face twice with this new shaving head, then I still have to touch up my face with a regular shaving razor.  Although I am disappointed with this head, using an electric razor is much nicer on face than a conventional razor blade.  If you are considering switching, I would recommend giving the Norelco HS85 a try!</li>
            <li> This package is exactly what it says it is. A replacement head for the shaver. It works as promised and there are no complaints here.</li>
            <li> I have had my Philips Norelco shaver for around two years, and I really like it. It works without trouble, and it gives a very good close shave. I have a little problem with ingrown hairs, but you probably cannot get both a close shave and no razor burn. I use special after shaves that help reduce razor irritation. The Philips shaving conditioner also helps reduce the shaving irritation. I also recommend using shaving oil prior to shaving. OK, let&#x27;s get back to the shaving head itself. My last head at times cut under my chin, and it bled sometimes. However, I have never had a problem with the new head. It might also be because now I have more experience in using the shaver. Anyway, I give this shaver head a perfect score! I also like that the package includes an additional cartridge.</li>
            <li> I did not use this product. I had to return it because I do not have the Norelco HS85 model razor.</li>
            <li> Although it is recommended to change the blades yearly, I had the previous (stock) blades for 2 years and I noticed no change in my shave quality, nor the time it takes to shave.  This all makes me wonder why it is recommended to change the blades; perhaps it is $$ driven?</li>
            <li> Easy to replace head, and a new conditioner pump - something I didn&#x27;t expect.  Back to smooth, irritation-free shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My edit is that I realized I miss-clicked and only gave the product 4 stars, now editted to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to friends. I am very satisfied with Philips shaving accessories.&lt;br /&gt; I am hoping that they will always be available to me.</li>
            <li> ON TIME AND WHAT I NEEDED AT THE RIGHT PRICE AND NEW, NOT RECONDITION, NEW RAZOR BLADES NEW CONDITIONERS THE MAKE SHAVING EASIER</li>
            <li> Excellent  product and best price . Tried to find it locally but prices were very high, will not find a better deal any where</li>
            <li> This was the exact replacement that we needed for my husband&#x27;s shaver. It was easy to replace and works great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thru Amazon.com after shopping the price on several other sites. Some were twice the price, others were out of stock. I was way overdue to replace these blades and the new blades made a big difference in comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these are nice.  Amazon shipped what I ordered but I ordered the wrong heads.      Wasteful to throw the 30 dollars and new heads in the trash but I have no use for them.  Already opened and can&#x27;t return.  I&#x27;d sell them for 10 dollars if anyone wants to buy them.</li>
            <li> Very good product, as expected .I love philips warrenty , they stand behind their product. if anything goes wrong they will send you replacement.</li>
            <li> The new shaving head provides a closer shave than the year old one and takes less time.  Still not as close or fast as shaving with multiple blade razor, but no nicks either.</li>
            <li> If you have one of these razors, you need to replace the heads about once a year, you need these, and there are no substitutes.  They are pricey...you can buy a new razor for the normal retail proce for these heads!  Amazon&#x27;s price is the best around.  Amazon also offers the NIvea cream used by this razor in a 3 pack at the best price around.</li>
            <li> This item is the entire head for the razor, and not just the blades which I had bought previously. This is a much better value item and just snaps into place. I noticed an improvement straight away compared to my year old blades. For the price it is also very good value and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I replace the shaving head on my Norelco Razor once a year. If I go longer than that, I start to get more irritation with my shaves.</li>
            <li> description is accurate, item is as described.  Replacing an old one that worked for longer than advertised, and expect this one will be good also.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement blades about 3 months after being my Nivea shaver. The replacement blades were worse then my worn out original blades. I ended up putting the old ones back on and throwing these away. I dont understand why but they hardly pick up any hair.</li>
            <li> did not last nearly as long as the original one.</li>
            <li> I left it too long (2 years) to replace the shaver head - the new one is great.... back to a smooth and easy shave! Good price and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me? These aren&#x27;t classic muscle cars worth this high price restoring to new, theyre parts of an electric shaver! They make equal or better shavers including a head for less today! Somehow norelco has made fools out of it&#x27;s customers as these are being sold everywhere for an arm and a leg. Do yourselves a favor and google how to sharpen these on your own like an old WWII vet would do. There are actually several methods, and as far as the replacement lubes just use your god given paws and throw on your face some cheap shaving cream. Don&#x27;t be fools.</li>
            <li> bought this to replace my worn out blade from my original purchase.  Sadly though, it&#x27;s already broken.  One of the heads has come apart.  I wish this razor came with the protective hard plastic piece that the original came with, if it did, my new blade probably wouldn&#x27;t be broken.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE:  This shaver head is made of very cheap plastic.  I&#x27;ve had two heads break in less than six months.  This fragility is uncharacteristic of Norelco&#x27;s other shavers.  IF yours breaks you&#x27;ll find that replacement costs (direct $ &amp; opportunity) are such that you&#x27;d probably have been better off with something else entirely.      Apparently this is a common occurrence as I&#x27;ve found it VERY difficult to locate replacement heads on store shelves where the entire razor is sold (empty shelf space is routine).  Note how that shaver head is teed up like a golf ball on a golf tee -- very easy to knock off (it snaps in without any kind of locking mechanism &amp; is easily popped off; a drop in the shower is sure to break it on the spot or generate a crack that will fail soon enough).  Unlike other models in which just the screen or razor part can be replaced, if any part of this head breaks, the ENTIRE unit must be replaced.  Depending on one&#x27;s purchase price one or two such breaks and it&#x27;s cheaper to be a new &amp; different, model entirely.  Cheap to buy, very costly to maintain.      IF YOU OPT TO TRY ONE OF THESE SCAN THE SHELVES AT THE STORE &amp; SEE IF THEY CARRY REPLACEMENT HEADS, OR, IF THE SHELF SPACE IS VACANT.  If vacant, (my experience at multiple stores in Northern Virginia) its a pretty good sign that enough others are having the same problem &amp; if/when yours breaks you&#x27;ll have to make alternative shaving arrangements for ??? days/week(s).  Quickly finding replacement heads for other Norelco models when you need them is not a problem.  Thus, the shortage of replacement Nivea heads, to me, seems like a very telling indicator of a fundamental design shortfall with the Nivea -- most people don&#x27;t experience the breakage, but enough do that spares are hard to find, much less obtain when needed.      I contacted Norelco&#x27;s 800 phone customer support on a Saturday &amp; was given a Reference number to track the replacement they&#x27;d send free.  Monday I got a confirmation e-mailthat they were sending the wrong model of shaver head per a completely different Reference number.  After four call-backs they got it resolved.  So they said....    When it works (while its still holding together), it tends to work great (I recommend using a wet bar of soap rubbed directly to one&#x27;s skin -- much better than the Nivea lube &amp; less prone to get rubbed off, which often doesn&#x27;t become apparent until you&#x27;ve given yourself a \\&quot;razor burn.\\&quot;  Also, much less expensive.  Try this &amp; you&#x27;ll probably agree the Nivea lube is a sales gimmick.  That feature is totally unnecessary, more costly, &amp; mucho inferior to a bar of regular hand soap).      Regardless, the Nivea&#x27;s heads have proven so fragile that I refuse to purchase a replacement head next time (and I&#x27;m sure there will be a next time).  When the company stops replacing mine under warranty (assuming they get the order correct), I&#x27;m switching to something made of materials that aren&#x27;t prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> Good product. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Nice to have new blades</li>
            <li> Very expensive but does the job</li>
            <li> so far they last and cut very well</li>
            <li> The package was delivered in a timely manner, it was sealed and meets my needs. These heads are self sharpening, but need to be replaced about once per year. So, now I&#x27;m ready for another year.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this on amazon.  I love my razor but these are hard to find at the drug store.  This kit also comes with a replacement for the section that holds the Nivea shave cream.  A nice plus.</li>
            <li> Got it for my fiance, works great!  Easy to use, and he has been using this product for 3 years.</li>
            <li> replaced for the old one..... used to be your customer....I can use it for a year....I like it..hope it good ....</li>
            <li> As per manufacturers recommendations, you are advised to replace your shaver head every year for a smooth shave.  I have been using Norelco shavers for about 15 years and i tend to change the head every  12-18 months and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that.  Usually it takes about a week or too to get adjusted to your skin.  The replacement head although seems expensive, it provides the smooth shave you can expect from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own this razor anymore.  The price was too high.</li>
            <li> Exact factory replacement head.  Works like new.  Installation is as easy as putting the existing head back on your current one after you bang it too hard on the side of the sink and it flips off.</li>
            <li> The replacement head fits and works great.  It was brand new in box and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference from the one that came with the shaver</li>
            <li> Because it was just very simple and straight forward. Yes you had to do a little looking around when you did not have a model no. was my case but it was really as I stated with my first statement.</li>
            <li> I replaced the head on my shaver because I thought my original head was getting dull. But the replacement head didn&#x27;t give me any closer shave.  In general, I don&#x27;t think the Norelco HS85 gives a close shave in the first place unless you go over your face multiple times.</li>
            <li> The razor part works great, but only one side will dispense the lotion.  This is probably a razor problem as it has been this way since the day I received it.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the old original one. A few more years shaving please for just a little investment. Hoping the shaver will last that long.</li>
            <li> The complete product is outstanding.  I use it in the shower, completely water resistant, very easy to clean.  Easy to take apart to clean the inner workings of the blades and easy to put back together.</li>
            <li> This product works as expected, nothing bad to say. Love the razor with the lotion ejection system built in. Have been using it for at least the past 7 years. The latest model has a better system.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product fast and it was accurate. The price was better than if I got it at the store.</li>
            <li> I love shavng wity it cause of its great flexibility and effectiveness. I&#x27;ve been use your razors sonce 1981 and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I used to use a razor for shaving, which often left my skin red and irritated.  With this system (nivea lotion &amp; norelco shaving head) I get clean close shaves with no irritation.  The lotion is very light, not oily at all, and a little goes a long way..  This replacement head will give me another year of close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> Just what my father needed and I was lucky to find it on amazon. Made my dad happy for older people do not like change and with him being 84 and living in a nursing home it even makes it harder to please him but this worked for him for he just wanted to keep the shaver he had owned for several years. Great job from the seller and would buy again from this seller. Thank you for you saved me from a big headache occurring.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement blade and comes with replacement reservoir for cream. Last over six months when used daily and cleaned on a regular basis</li>
            <li> I used the heads for about 6 months before I bought a upgraded razor.  They weren&#x27;t an exact replacement for my model but the cut was ok.</li>
            <li> These cutter heads give me a great shave every time I use them and they where at a great price at Amazon also. Very nice that it can be used wet  or dry.</li>
            <li> Fits well. Razor works like a new one. Saves money. Easy to install. Will definitely purchase another one when it is needed.</li>
            <li> I really like my Norelco HS85 shaver that extrudes Nivea lotion while shaving, but I don&#x27;t think that they make it any more. I used to get replacement heads at Target, but they don&#x27;t carry them or the Nivea lotion any more. This is the most comfortable and closest shaving electric razor I have ever used and hope they keep making the replacement heads and lotion for awhile.</li>
            <li> I purchased my shaver for work &amp; use it on a daily basis. The replacement head use to be $38 &amp; now thwe price has really increased dramatically.  Why?</li>
            <li> I bought him the razor that goes with this razor head about a year or year and a half ago. He LOVES it!! It was time to change the razor head and we couldn&#x27;t find the replacement! (I think we just forgot the specific name of it- didn&#x27;t originally buy it on Amazon). Anyways, he tried some cheaper electric razors until I finally found him the right replacement head. He&#x27;s been using the new one for a week and keeps telling me how much he &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; using his favorite razor. He loves this razor and razor head. So happy to have a happy husband!! Most definitely recommend purchasing the razor and razor head!! We will continue to use this product as long as Philips produces it!</li>
            <li> Made my old shaver feel like new</li>
            <li> I bought the right shaving head for my razor, but since my black plastic &amp;#34;drive shaft&amp;#34; was a bit worn, the shaver drive shaft frequently spun without engaging the head.  Be forewarned:  the new heads might not work in your old shaver if your drive shaft is worn,</li>
            <li> very easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;works great with my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Good clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;Not as close as a razor but still very good.&lt;br /&gt;use it for three days then I use the razor for a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;must faster than a razor.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these because I loved it so much.  I can still find the shaving gel and they are much cheaper at drugstore.com but the head is next to impossible.  They are ridiculously priced at Amazon.  So I have two new ones, one old one and I am going to try to squeeze 2 years of shaving out of them.  I am so upset with Philips that I refuse to but another Norelco product.</li>
            <li> This unit does exactly what it was constructed to do and does it well.  What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> The replacement head is very comfy and smooth cut is better then the original one !!! very good love it :) :)</li>
            <li> Cheaper than store prices (In Canada), even with shipping and import fees. It comes with the lotion container replacement in the handle (which I don&#x27;t use... so in the trash it went).</li>
            <li> Per the Philips website and numerous third-party vendors, the HS85 Replacement Head has been discontinued.  I&#x27;ve routinely bought replacements for mine for $27-30 on Amazon, and am disappointed to find that it&#x27;s no longer being produced.  Of course, the razor was manufactured in 2007, so perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much difference new shaving heads could make. I recommend you change the heads on your electric razor at least once a year. They were easy to install and made an automatic improvement in the performance of my razor. The Amazon prices were very competitive and the service was great!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Amazon on Nov 8, 2013 for $34.41.  Not only did I get heads but also a lotion cartridge.  I have no idea why the price should be increased so much!</li>
            <li> First of all these things are getting harder to find, but I still have the electric razor and it works well. Locally many stores stopped carrying these replacement blades because they want to continue to push the new models and their replacement blades. With Amazon, I am able to still get these and at a really good price.</li>
            <li> I like the way the head flows and I can wash it easy because the head dosen t set down into the body</li>
            <li> Cuts great, makes my dad look good, and in the aging process the neck skin tends to loosen.  The shaving head is very flexible and helps him achieve a great shave without and I say without any - none burns or cuts.  I would recommend this to any man!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad, he loves this razor. Glides on easy and smooth, really close shave. Baby face smooth</li>
            <li> I seldom write reviews but I just have to ask, &amp;#34;Who in their right mind would pay this much for replacement blades when a brand new razor costs less?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!  It actually lasts at least 1 year as long as you keep it clean.  Goes very smooth and he loves it!</li>
            <li> The fact that you can wash it directly with water is great. It doesn&#x27;t rust and it lasts for a good 8-10 months.</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised.  Just what would be expected out of a replacement head for an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is true, if you want to keep your Norelco shaver shaving like new, this is the best way to get your replacement heads. Amazon.com has more replacements, they are easier to find, and you do not have to go from store to store to find them. My store quit carrying my replacement heads, but they still carried some other Norelco heads. I highly recommend Amazon.com as the best place to get your replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The price for this unit was around US$ 32.00, now it US$ 109,98, any spacial reason? it made from gold now?????</li>
            <li> I am somewhat confused.  I have written to Amazon to say that I have yet to receive this item and have had no correspondence from either Amazon or the supplier.  I would very much like to be in the position to review this product!</li>
            <li> Works great. Prompt shipping. Shame they quit making this razor.</li>
            <li> After just one month, one of the heads broke....pretty expensive to buy a set of 3 just to replace one...</li>
            <li> I was pleased to learn that I received not only the razor and heads but also a replacement gel compartment.</li>
            <li> My husband love it. work very well for him.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed, after going over 3 years without a new head.  It works great!  I would recommend it to anyone, instead of buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> These little guys are finer than the old school Philips Norelco heads. Years ago, they lasted for years of trouble free service. Running the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; system with lotion, it&#x27;s important to replace the heads regularly. This kit includes a new lotion reservoir, very nice.</li>
            <li> I love it best prices works great.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for, although I didn&#x27;t know it would come with the lotion pack as well as the shaver head.  I don&#x27;t use the lotion feature, but it was still cheaper than getting it at Target.  Besides, Target doesn&#x27;t seem to stock it anymore.</li>
            <li> I like the Nivea Norelco electric razor.  I just keep forgetting to change blades annual.  The purchase of new rotor and blades reminded me why I like the razor.</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect way to bring your shaver back to as new condition and I would recommend an annual service in this manner.</li>
            <li> This product came very quickly, was as advertised. I&#x27;m getting really good wear on this set of heads. What can I say, norelco is a great product, I use the razor to shave both face and head and I get a real comfortable shave everytime. BZ</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for a couple years now. Replace the head about once a year. I&#x27;d buy another one. Decent shave, no problems so far.</li>
            <li> This was the replacement head I needed for my husbands razor. It was exactly what I ordered and needed. Thanks</li>
            <li> After much searching for this item at our local stores we found this item on Amazon. It is one of our Subscribed item so we no longer have to go searching for it. It has made the razor as new.</li>
            <li> Bought the razor for my husband years ago and it&#x27;s been a godsend. Being that he MUST shave 5 days out of the week, this has saved up tons of money and his face is much less irritated.</li>
            <li> My husband has reordered these twice.  Both times they arrived in time and the price was right.  So was the product.&lt;br /&gt;A happy wife.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco Nivea for Men Shaving Replacement Head is an outstanding product.  It has been very difficult to buy in regular stores, i.e Sears, Walmarts etc.  Amazon.Com was the only source for this item. I have had the Norelco Nivae Electic Shaver going on 2 years.  It was given to me for a Christmas gift by my wife in Dec 2009.  It was with me when I deployed to Afghanistan.  It traveled in duffle bags in all kinds of vehicles over rough terrain.  It always functioned.  It never quit.&lt;br /&gt;It continues to give me the best shaves I every had.  Thank you Philips and Thank You Amazon for stocking the parts needed for it to function properly.</li>
            <li> According to my husband, he gets a really close shave. He says no other razor he has had did a better job.</li>
            <li> This is a very hard to find product.  This is probably the best price I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is not available at local store.</li>
            <li> Fit exactly on the Phillips shaver.  Had dropped the shaver too many times and had bent the head.  Works fine, now.</li>
            <li> Fits great on my shaver and is perfect replacement. Arrived fast without any problems. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are somewhat different than the originals with the shaver which I used for nearly three years. After the cutting blades were worn down to about one half I decided to purchase new ones. The blades seem to cut OK, but they are unusually noisy from day one and duetting worse after 11 months of use. I added a small amount of oil to each head, but it did not help. It almost looks like they are not made in the same factory as the originals, but it would be unlikely because of their complexity. I&#x27;ll further investigate the reason and, if I find the root cause, I&#x27;ll publish it.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that works for me.  This is the only place can find the r5efills and this razor.  So when i need to I come here to get what I need that is all.</li>
            <li> works great.. close shave</li>
            <li> I should have changed the heads years ago. no more pulling or cuts and a very close smooth shave now</li>
            <li> So this works as you would expect however I find that for a replacement this seems quite pricey.  That said I tend to get a lot more life out of these than they advertise.  I am able to use these for ~1 year.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and cheaper than the cost of a new razor. Nine more words required in this review here now.</li>
            <li> I received the replacement head on time. It fit into my electric shaver. It worked fine as the replacement head.</li>
            <li> I have always been happy with these products. I have used them for years. Amazon has always been there when I need anything.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I ever used.</li>
            <li> They work great, good value</li>
            <li> My shaving head had to be replaced. The new Norelco head gives me a perfect shave with no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Ordered Thursday night at 6pm and got it in Southern Maryland at Noon. Terrific. Fixed the older blade and cream dispenser.</li>
            <li> Good product, well made and reliable. If you want to keep that old shaver this will definitely make it easier to hang on to.  Its a lot cheaper than having to replace the entire razor.</li>
            <li> Item shipped in a timely manner.  New in box as expected.  Fit my razor without a problem and heads work much better than the older (duller unit).</li>
            <li> This is an identical OEM replacement for the factory shaving head.  The blades are sharp again, and my face is happy again.  It is easy to snap off the old head and snap on the new one.  Problem solved!</li>
            <li> I have this Norelco which is a little outdated, but with the new heads each year they make the shaver feel like it was brand new. Highly recommend this product if you have this type of shaver.</li>
            <li> The razor is an older model and we were sure it would work. The new razor head was shipped quickly and was also affordable.</li>
            <li> The blades work fine. Now I need a replacement.  I bought them for $32 in 2013, now they cost $69. Why is that ?  Probably because they discontinued them. That is almost the cost of a new similar razor, with more features in Costco !</li>
            <li> I think this replacement head was better than the original head on my shaver, The blades seem to cut closer and it fits perfect.</li>
            <li> They are replacement blades for my older Norelco electric shaver.  They do what they are designed to do!  installation was easy.</li>
            <li> this is the best blades i&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> My well used razor cuts like it did when it was new...!!  Saved me from having to buy a new one with my heavy beard..!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly in my shaver - shaver now as new with the use of this replacement head. Would recommend it to anyone with one of these Nivea for Men Shavers.</li>
            <li> these new blades are very good quality and are so easy to change never had such a great shaver  would buy again and again</li>
            <li> The shaving machine design is great, and so its razor cartridge! I personallt highly recommend this product to all men.</li>
            <li> This price is ridiculous and I would never pay that much for just one replacement head two years ago I bought a package from amazon that contained two heads, one back of the shaver cartridge and four... yes 4 bottles of the shaving gel don&#x27;t waist your money you ed be better off getting a new razor</li>
            <li> I especially like that it cuts those little stuborn hairs that the screen shavers always seem to miss. Doesen&#x27;t matter how many days U chose not to shave in between. They jell is a bit expensive, but only need it sparingly,with stubborn hairs, they dissapear immediately. Very quite compared to Braun.Can shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Very good quality! I am using it for regular shave every day for nearly a year. washable and well designed.</li>
            <li> This an improvement over the original head which was pretty good. This norelco is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. Keep in mind I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.A moist face Pryor to shaving helps.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this replacement head several times now.  I replace them about once a year, and keep the last replacement around in case the razor gets dropped and the head is damaged.  Amazing how nice a new head feels and also how close it gets.</li>
            <li> I thought I was just getting the heads. However, I was surprised to get the whole head assembly. In addition you get a new gel pack/pump. New blades make for nice shave.</li>
            <li> What more can I say I like the shaver and the blades and they last a decent amount of time..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my shaving head was until I replaced them. Now It&#x27;s as good as new and smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores so I just ordered it online. It&#x27;s the official replacement so you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> These blades last a year with heavy use. Norelco throws in a free case part (the soft rubber can wear out and rip). Better to buy from Amazon than Norelco if you qualify for free shipping. Cheaper through them.</li>
            <li> Since I use the Norelco 6100 shaver, this is the only gel product that works with it.  Suppliers we out of stock a while ago and I tried a gel product in a tube without much satisfaction.  This product works way better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better new blades feel after a year of use on the original ones. I recommend replacing them annually. I had been sharpening them on a piece of emory paper, but these worked well.</li>
            <li> they work wonderful very happy</li>
            <li> Good product and price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> this ia a great product!  I have use for years now,  last me a year before I need to replace them</li>
            <li> I bought a little over a year ago for less than $40 -- now they are ripping us off by charging over $170???  What gives.  I can buy a new razor for less than the heads.  Guess I&#x27;ll be transferring over to Remington or Braun.</li>
            <li> Really hard to find and expensive because of that, I´m thinking that I should have to buy a newer model with less expensive cutting blades in the near future.  Other than that, the product is really good.</li>
            <li> Not using the shaver right now</li>
            <li> Works great and that is why I ordered a new one. Though a new cleaning brush would of made me rate this as a love it</li>
            <li> It was a struggle to shave with the old head, grabbing hair now and then instead of cutting it! The new head works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I usually just buy a new razor because the heads are almost as expensive as the razor.. Whty not?  My father loves the product though.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Norelco shavers, and their latest model has not been a disappointment. After using the shaving head for almost a year, I decided to purchase a replacement. That replacement, along with a can of Edge shaving cream, has yielded me a comfortable,close shave.</li>
            <li> A very nice shave what else can you say hmm well I put this head on to replace the old head and</li>
            <li> I purchased this same item for about $50 two years ago. Now its $112. It is nothing special for the cost but it is what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li> I used for almost three years. I like it and is very good for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I recomended this product 100 %</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HS85 Nivea for Men Shaving Replacement Head  Works well - better than original. It is sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> I actually use this product to shave my head. I&#x27;ve had problems with razor bumps using a traditional razor, but now that issue has been resolved. I get a clean, bump-free shave using this product, and that&#x27;s worth a lot to me!</li>
            <li> Heads worked fine and were much better than the old ones. Subsequently, I received a Braun as a Christmas present and I like it much better than the Norelco. Shaves much faster and closer. I had been a Norelco user for years.</li>
            <li> Sure, these heads provide a decent shave and breathe new life into your aging Norelco shaver.  But when it&#x27;s cheaper to get a brand new Panasonic ES-RT51-S 3 Blade Electric Razor Wet/Dry with Flexible Pivoting Head for $54.28 - Then these replacement heads aren&#x27;t something to get excited about.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought replacement heads for this shaver.  I like the shaver very much.  It fits nicely in my small hands. But the original blades, for whatever reason, gave me a closer shave.  Still, I&#x27;m not going to switch to another razor and will continue to buy replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance.</li>
            <li> I was noticing my Norelco shaver wasn&#x27;t getting as close a shave as I originally got with it, so it was time to replace the blades and what a difference it made!</li>
            <li> Easier than hunting for this in the stores and at a good price!</li>
            <li> This was the first time for me to order a replacement head for this model of my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice much difference in effectiveness that may suggest that my old shaver was still in good condition after a year of use.</li>
            <li> thanks good product fast shipping</li>
            <li> replacement head, not as good as original but it works</li>
            <li> They suggest changing the blades once a year, but my original head lasted for 4 years. I hope the replacement lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> Long time user of the razor and this is a year replacement</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this pack for the cream cartridge that needed replacement. But I discovered the real bonus was the blades I had to buy with it. I always had problems shaving with an electric razor. It just didn&#x27;t fit my face correctly. The first step was switching to Philips Nice a last year and now the next one was to change my blades to HS85. I get less razor burns and marks and shave much faster.</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;The Blades are Great! The price cannot be matched and I have looked. It gives a great shave and I am very Happy.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for many years and this is about the 5th replacement.  The price was reasonable and the service fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Easily changed and works like new again</li>
            <li> This was a direct replacement for my non-functioning razor head which stopped rotating after a couple years of use.  Work as intended and made me a less hairy man again.  Yay</li>
