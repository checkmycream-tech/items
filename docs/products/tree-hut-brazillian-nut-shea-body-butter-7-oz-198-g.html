            <li>Fabulous fragrance!</li>
            <li>it is much smoother and softer to the touch and smells great</li>
            <li>This is easily my favorite lotion or body butter.</li>
            <li>When I buy more (an inevitability)</li>
            <li>Nice smooth cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better shea butter though...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, Tree Hut&#x27;s body butter is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, after each bath I rub into my feet and elbows.</li>
            <li>I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like the scent any more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel and look.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Bod.y Lotion...</li>
            <li>I like the smell better and it works just as well.</li>
            <li>It also gave me beautiful soft skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and feels beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is so rich and decadent and it makes my mouth water!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good body butter since i despise dry skin and this one really is the best.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My feet are baby smooth.</li>
            <li>, he absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the creaminess, how it is not oily or greasy and really does soften my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so lucky to have my boyfriend who will rub my feet every night.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product as I also use it on my 93-year-old father to remove dry skin thank you for allowing me to order more than one at a time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands feeling soft and looking much better</li>
            <li>And the price here is JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li>They are now so very soft and feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>It goes on well after soaking your feet or after a hot bath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is smooth and  creamy and has nice smell but over priced and I prefer another brand which is more expensive.</li>
            <li>Again, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I started first with a product called Baby&#x27;s Feet to peel away the unwanted roughness.  </li>
            <li>However it did not do much to soften my callouses.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizers your skin.  </li>
            <li>You can only imagine how pleased I was to find the same product on Amazon since I do not reside on the U.S. mainland.</li>
            <li>I got this as a present and have been in love with it since for every reason possible.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>did find that it absorbs quickly especially if you put on a pair of socks right after.</li>
            <li>Found the exact product at the local dept. store for 5.88.</li>
            <li>I first tried the Tree Hut Brand of Brazilian Body Butter at another retail store and was instantly a fan.</li>
            <li>The shea butter keeps your feet soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I was sad as I really loved the smell of the pomegranate, but I have had allergic reactions such as hives which were really severe and did not want to risk another trip to the ER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased this product after an article I read by a lady who was a dancer and had very calloused, rough soles.</li>
            <li>the fact that its all natural is definitely a plus! must try!</li>
            <li>Not greasy and leaves your skin soft to the touch all day long!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not greasy and leaves your skin soft to the touch all day long!</li>
            <li> It dries fast with very little greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, and it does a great job of moisturizing, especially in cold winter months when hands are vulnerable to cracking and drying out.</li>
            <li> I sometimes open it throughout the day just to take a long whiff.</li>
            <li> I use this all over and as I have several rough patches of skin around my toes, ankles and elbows; this stuff is GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a note, I tried another body butter sold at Target, which was pomegranate scented.</li>
            <li> It last a long time because a little goes a lone way.</li>
            <li> Warning: you will smell so yummy that it&#x27;s a bad idea to wear it to work as it distracts people, makes mouths water (unless you work in a bakery, then it would fit in!).</li>
            <li> I cannot stand having rough feet.  </li>
            <li> I love Tree Hut and Amazon, so I&#x27;m disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t get it here.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to try the bidy wash and other scents from tree hut as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products from this line.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t reorder online unless the price goes down.</li>
            <li> i have used this product everyday since i received it</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong at all and dissipates within 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Whatever you do do not buy the vanilla lavender scent the have it stinks to high heaven with a musky man scent.</li>
            <li> I use this during really cold Pacific Northwest winters, and my skin is always soft and always moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find, but amazon has it.</li>
            <li> It was NOT AS THICK or creamy and when it was on, I felt like I was going to break out in an allergic reaction.</li>

            <li> This smells amazing! It also gave me beautiful soft skin. Do not use on face, I broke out when I used it on my face!</li>
            <li> Amazing body butter. I use this during really cold Pacific Northwest winters, and my skin is always soft and always moisturized. The smell is amazing. It&#x27;s just as moisturizing as it is fragrant, and both the moisture and the smell last forever. It is cheaper at Walmart, which is why I&#x27;m leaving this review. I love Tree Hut and Amazon, so I&#x27;m disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t get it here. But if you can, do it! It&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband got me a jar of this several years ago; lasted forever.  It&#x27;s got a luxurious feel and smell.  Hope they keep making it so I can replenish when I run out again.  Would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after an article I read by a lady who was a dancer and had very calloused, rough soles. It goes on well after soaking your feet or after a hot bath.&lt;br /&gt;I did find that it absorbs quickly especially if you put on a pair of socks right after. However it did not do much to soften my callouses.</li>
            <li> I tried this product today and it is absolutely awesome! it smells divine and feels so creamy. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good body butter since i despise dry skin and this one really is the best. its been a couple hours since i put it on and it still smells sooo good! the fact that its all natural is definitely a plus! must try!</li>
            <li> Fabulous fragrance! Product Always works well, have relied on this product for years. Warning: you will smell so yummy that it&#x27;s a bad idea to wear it to work as it distracts people, makes mouths water (unless you work in a bakery, then it would fit in!). Applied before bedtime it does an excellent and  reliable overnight skin-repair job on your driest skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub in Wal Mart and loved the way it smelled and loved rubbing it all over my arms and shoulders.My skin is so soft and feels beautiful.When I went back to Wal Mart they told me they no longer carry the scrub so I found it at drugstore.com.What an experience!</li>
            <li> i have used this product everyday since i received it and i can tell a difference in my skin it is much smoother and softer to the touch and smells great i&#x27;m going to try the bidy wash and other scents from tree hut as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so lucky to have my boyfriend who will rub my feet every night.  We&#x27;ve been through a lot of lotions, and this has the best consistency and has the best smell ever!  It is almost edible!</li>
            <li> This is easily my favorite lotion or body butter. The smell is amazing, and it does a great job of moisturizing, especially in cold winter months when hands are vulnerable to cracking and drying out. I highly recommend it. Since buying it here, I found it in a store for $6, so I recommend being on the lookout for it in stores if possible. When I buy more (an inevitability) I won&#x27;t reorder online unless the price goes down.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth cream.  It dries fast with very little greasy feel.  It keeps my hands feeling soft and looking much better</li>
            <li> Smells good. I&#x27;ve had better shea butter though...</li>
            <li> The shea butter keeps your feet soooo soft. It is hard to find, but amazon has it. I will stock up soon.</li>
            <li> I only use body creams with Shea Butter in them. Keeps my skin from drying out. This product does the job. The scent is not strong at all and dissipates within 15 minutes. Not greasy and leaves your skin soft to the touch all day long!</li>
            <li> I have not tried it yet. I imagine however that it will work. I hope it does and believe it will.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have looked all over for it since my local source has stopped selling it. As always ,Amazon.com is my go to source For all products and books.Yeah! I found it! Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to see you sold this, because even though Tree Hut&#x27;s website says Walmart sells it, they DON&#x27;T and the place I used to buy it, does not either.

I use this all over and as I have several rough patches of skin around my toes, ankles and elbows; this stuff is GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a note, I tried another body butter sold at Target, which was pomegranate scented. It was NOT AS THICK or creamy and when it was on, I felt like I was going to break out in an allergic reaction. I could not believe it. My skin felt like it was on fire. I immediately stopped using it and ordered this. I was sad as I really loved the smell of the pomegranate, but I have had allergic reactions such as hives which were really severe and did not want to risk another trip to the ER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, Tree Hut&#x27;s body butter is FABULOUS! And the price here is JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li> Way over priced!! Found the exact product at the local dept. store for 5.88. I paid 13.00. Rated 1 only because of the price. Do like it tho</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself but it seems like I bought it for my husband, he absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li> It is smooth and  creamy and has nice smell but over priced and I prefer another brand which is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer and I looove the smell</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! Smells delicious and almost gone bc I use it every day! I need to get another 2. Whatever you do do not buy the vanilla lavender scent the have it stinks to high heaven with a musky man scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, after each bath I rub into my feet and elbows. They are now so very soft and feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> After all these years I finally found it. I&#x27;m so happy. I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like the scent any more. Nope, I STILL do.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Tree Hut Brand of Brazilian Body Butter at another retail store and was instantly a fan. You can only imagine how pleased I was to find the same product on Amazon since I do not reside on the U.S. mainland. I received the product today and could not wait to open it to slather its moisturizing ingredients on my hands and feet! Again, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> A smooth excellent mositurizer.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizers your skin.  Has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This body butter is the yummiest smelling thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my body. It is so rich and decadent and it makes my mouth water! I sometimes open it throughout the day just to take a long whiff. LOL It&#x27;s also extremely moisturizing. I can put this on today and I would still feel the moisturizing effects tomorrow. Just amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products from this line.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Adovia</li>
            <li> I got this as a present and have been in love with it since for every reason possible.  I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel and look.  I am a forever customer!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Bod.y Lotion...It smells so awesome!!! My kiddos say I smell like cookies...lol!</li>
            <li> I just love this product as I also use it on my 93-year-old father to remove dry skin thank you for allowing me to order more than one at a time</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and very moisturizing. Absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Received this in the time promised.  This was actually the second time I used this product and I like it very much.  It last a long time because a little goes a lone way.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer and the smell is sublte and lovely. (one person saying &amp;#34;I smell delicious sugar cookies, What is that great smell?&amp;#34; I won&#x27;t tell.) I trust this product to help keep my elbow psoriasis at bay. I used to get another type of shea butter from this company but one time it was out and I got this instead. I like the smell better and it works just as well. I wash/use alcohol hand sanitizer a gazillion times each shift I work in my hospital. This helps alot!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I cannot stand having rough feet.  I started first with a product called Baby&#x27;s Feet to peel away the unwanted roughness.  Then I apply this body butter every day.  My feet are baby smooth.</li>
