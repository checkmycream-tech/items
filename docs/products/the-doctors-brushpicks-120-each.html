            <li> Very hard to find them in the drugstore.</li>

            <li> Best toothpicks ever. Great size for your purse.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. Would buy again...</li>
            <li> Deserves 0 stars. The brush end bends too easily. Had to use 5 for my entire mouth. Not worth it. Junk. Could use to put olives on for martinis.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite teeth picks.  I love that they do the job easily, have a great container, and don&#x27;t  take up much room.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!  The best picks ever!</li>
            <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> I love these brushpicks. Ordering was so easy. Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> The best pick to use.  Easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> These brush toothpicks are great for cleaning your teeth particularly in getting meat, seeds from fruit, etc. stuck between your teeth. I feel my dental hygiene is improved using the picks.</li>
            <li> This is an unusually good product.  It&#x27;s like a toothpick only at the end of each pick is a &amp;#34;brushlike&amp;#34; design, which cleans well between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find them in the drugstore. Good price ; good purchase</li>
            <li> Have. used them for years. Very good.</li>
            <li> great received as expected</li>
            <li> best tooth picks around</li>
            <li> Our family loves these toothpicks and we really like these small packages....have them all through the house...</li>
            <li> Everyone I&#x27;ve shared these with love them</li>
            <li> Love these picks.  I&#x27;ve been using them regularly for the last 6-8 months and when I went to my last checkup and cleaning the hygienist told me that whatever I was doing, keep doing it because my teeth looked great.  The picks have a brush on one end and a pick with slightly rough edges on the other that seems to break up any plaque deposits before they can calcify.  These new smaller packages are nice as they fit in your pocket or car console easily and so are always available and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These items are great, thin enough for the spaces between my teeth. Durable enough to last several uses[place in monthwash] I have enough to give as gifts after ordering all these.</li>
            <li> I use it as a gift for all my girl friends, they all love it and and ask me where to buy.</li>
            <li> My wife and I take these everywhere we go.  Our dental hygienist has noted for several years in a row the reduction of plaque buildup and general gum health.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted sent in a timely manner, no hassles</li>
            <li> Bought these for my parents they love this product!</li>
            <li> These are nice plastic picks to have handy after a meal.  I keep them in my vehicles and this large package was just right for stocking stuffers at Christmas.</li>
