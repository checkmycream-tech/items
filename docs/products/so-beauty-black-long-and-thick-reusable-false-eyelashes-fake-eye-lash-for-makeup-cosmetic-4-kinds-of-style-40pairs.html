            <li>Good, standard lashes for that eye popping look.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re really soft  and nice</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap product</li>
            <li>so the value of the eyelashes are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Durable and very pretty</li>
            <li>Plastic lashes, took a long time to receive the package, but good for a performer.</li>
            <li>I love my new eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and they were exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Very impressed,  I received earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>yes price is cheap but love them cuz there easy oer to put on and you wont have to deal with irritation i use a 2 specific eyelash glues and they stay on the entire day!!!</li>
            <li>very natural and blended well !!!</li>
            <li>First off it took me over 20 minutes to get them out of the package.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>I love how there are different sets.</li>
            <li>They are really pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan, I only wished they came with a number size to make sure I reorder only the ones that I want.</li>
            <li>But thats better then being to long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I ran out of these lashes recently and had forgotten to order more, so I went to the store and bought a new set to hold me over for a while--and what a difference they</li>
            <li>Got to me fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are too straight (not curved)  </li>
            <li>They look very tacky .</li>
            <li>but you really need to.</li>
            <li>Really upset.</li>
            <li>I honestly think that you&#x27;re better off purchasing the more expensive lashes elsewhere, like a drugstore or some other company on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I do have to say is that I got them in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li>The lashes themselves are exactly what was advertised and they&#x27;re pretty good, the only complaint I have is the shipping...</li>
            <li>Minus the very full set</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super obvious its plastic</li>
            <li>Takes more lash glue that the drug store sells and they still don&#x27;t hold because they are so stiff.  </li>
            <li>After reading a lot of reviews, I read more positive then negative....</li>
            <li>I Cut them down to fit my eye shape</li>
            <li>For these being my first sets of false eyelashes, I&#x27;ll admit that I had enjoyed them and thought that they were perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got these to practice wearing falsies (since I have a ridiculously difficult time applying them) and they actually look pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I use revlon clear glue and they stay put just hold for a min .</li>
            <li>It was a heavy beaded cheap necklace one that my six year old could make.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to get here, but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it at all really cheep and not high quality</li>
            <li>Good price but bad quality.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good price but bad quality.</li>
            <li> had thought that all false lashes were like these--stiff, cheap, and not always matching in lengths.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lash doesn&#x27;t really have a shape because the lash band is stiff</li>
            <li> I like the variety of the lashes, though the thicker they are, the less natural they look.</li>
            <li> My lashes are so thin, but these help tremendously.</li>
            <li> When arrived, the boxes were horribly squashed, but other than that, great deal!</li>
            <li> They just too long to get here and the cases were smashed</li>
            <li> cheapest eyelashes ever and took a VERY long time to ship</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t stay down , i tryed different glues and they keep lifting up.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re plastic and a little different than what we&#x27;re used to seeing in the States.</li>
            <li> i have worked with a wide rage of different brands and types of lashes for a very long time and these are hard to shape to the eye-</li>
            <li> lashes are pretty but EXTREMELY difficult to put on...</li>
            <li> I only wish the band wasn&#x27;t so thick.</li>
            <li> I do have to trim them down some.</li>
            <li> The other two packs are just normal false eyelashes, my only complaint with them is the adhesive strip is narrow and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> lashes, while nice for a beginner or someone practicing applying them, are actually terrible in comparison to other products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient if you wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> In all honesty you do get what you pay for I would not suggest for you to buy them because they are stiff</li>
            <li> Stiff.  </li>
            <li> Yes they are hard to apply if you&#x27;ve never used them before, but once you do start using them and get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> Honestly never bought any off here</li>
            <li> I mean it</li>
            <li> VERY thick band- not sure I would recommend...</li>
            <li> Not very easy to apply!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a joke or serious.</li>
            <li> they are very hard to apply the lash line</li>
            <li> In this case, I have to leave a poor review.</li>
            <li> They came in soon and they are great..don&#x27;t go all nasty fast..</li>
            <li> I never got the false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The quality of these fake lashes are not good...</li>
            <li> Really ugly lashes not worth 5 there</li>
            <li> Some are over exaggerated,  but that is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> (I do wear lashes every day) and have never had a worse time trying to get them to stay on then these!</li>
            <li> USELESS</li>
            <li> They look really fake</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> The lashes were too shinny that looks like plastic, felt like plastic, looks too fake.</li>
            <li> They look very fake.</li>
            <li> So fake hate them so ugly had to throw away</li>
            <li> I was shocked at what I received.</li>
            <li> These eye lashes suck :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I won&#x27;t need to buy more lashed for a while.</li>
            <li> Great styles to choose from😄💄💏</li>
            <li> They are gorgeous. Some are over exaggerated,  but that is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> What a great deal for so many lashes.  I got these to practice wearing falsies (since I have a ridiculously difficult time applying them) and they actually look pretty good.  Minus the very full set, they&#x27;re plastic and a little different than what we&#x27;re used to seeing in the States. Still, great product. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> They arrived right on time and were beautiful! They stay on and last over a week! I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments and have been recommending them to everyone! Will definitely be ordering them again</li>
            <li> Met my expectations :)</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap product so the value of the eyelashes are pretty cheap. It&#x27;s convenient if you wear them everyday. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I might invest in  Lili Ghalichi&#x27;s eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I like the variety of the lashes, though the thicker they are, the less natural they look.</li>
            <li> The quality of these fake lashes are not good...&lt;br /&gt;The lash doesn&#x27;t really have a shape because the lash band is stiff</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews, I read more positive then negative.... In this case, I have to leave a poor review. First off it took me over 20 minutes to get them out of the package. I was so excited to get them and wear them. I Cut them down to fit my eye shape and they did not stick. I used several different glues and they wouldn&#x27;t stay on. I am a pro-eyelash wearer. (I do wear lashes every day) and have never had a worse time trying to get them to stay on then these! The only positive thing I do have to say is that I got them in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li> Very impressed,  I received earlier than I expected. .... I actually love them.</li>
            <li> OMG when I say I don&#x27;t have to buy lashes for awhile I mean it I freaking love these lashes...I&#x27;m definitely buying these again!!!</li>
            <li> So fake hate them so ugly had to throw away</li>
            <li> Not very easy to apply!!! They pop off your eyes!!!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re cheaply made but the thinner ones looks great !!!! very natural and blended well !!! can&#x27;t wait to use a thicker one !! I don&#x27;t have eyelashes cx</li>
            <li> Love them! Got to me fast and iv got a lot of comments. Deff recommend this.</li>
            <li> love these eye lashes.</li>
            <li> These eye lashes suck :(&lt;br /&gt;They are too straight (not curved)  so don&#x27;t stay down , i tryed different glues and they keep lifting up. USELESS</li>
            <li> Plastic lashes, took a long time to receive the package, but good for a performer.</li>
            <li> cheapest eyelashes ever and took a VERY long time to ship</li>
            <li> Theses are the ugliest looking eyelashes ever. I bought them for my job and they don&#x27;t work. They look really fake so don&#x27;t buy people</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this product. They look very fake.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are amazing ! Wasn&#x27;t a fan of the bigger ones but hey still work. I&#x27;ve been ordering these eyelashes for about a year now. I&#x27;m a huge fan, I only wished they came with a number size to make sure I reorder only the ones that I want. Yes they are hard to apply if you&#x27;ve never used them before, but once you do start using them and get the hang of it there shouldn&#x27;t be a an issue took me a try or two. You can also clip the left over rim of them to install . I use revlon clear glue and they stay put just hold for a min .</li>
            <li> They came in soon and they are great..don&#x27;t go all nasty fast..they actually last</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all really cheep and not high quality</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get here, but it was worth the wait! A fun variety of eyelashes! They work pretty well and I can apply them easily! It&#x27;s a great amount of eyelashes for the price you pay!&#x27;</li>
            <li> In all honesty you do get what you pay for I would not suggest for you to buy them because they are stiff they are very hard to apply the lash line isn&#x27;t as great and you will probably probably spend a lot of glue on just appliance. They look very tacky .</li>
            <li> My pkg came bent and smashed some of my lashes got ruined but the others are great</li>
            <li> Good, standard lashes for that eye popping look.</li>
            <li> Bought for my makeup kit...packaging was okay...lashes are pretty but EXTREMELY difficult to put on...i have worked with a wide rage of different brands and types of lashes for a very long time and these are hard to shape to the eye- VERY thick band- not sure I would recommend...</li>
            <li> I love my new eyelashes. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Honestly never bought any off here but ive gotten the same product and i love these best lashes yes price is cheap but love them cuz there easy oer to put on and you wont have to deal with irritation i use a 2 specific eyelash glues and they stay on the entire day!!! Looking forward to buying some soon!!!!</li>
            <li> Mine arrived before the estimated date, bonus! The lashes themselves are exactly what was advertised and they&#x27;re pretty good, the only complaint I have is the shipping... When arrived, the boxes were horribly squashed, but other than that, great deal!</li>
            <li> They work amzing my girls and their friends use them all the time</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. The lashes were too shinny that looks like plastic, felt like plastic, looks too fake. Good price but bad quality.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for....you believe that?  These lashes were cheap.  That&#x27;s what we got.  Cheap. Stiff.  Hard to apply.  Takes more lash glue that the drug store sells and they still don&#x27;t hold because they are so stiff.  Try something that cost more.  And, it took weeks to deliver</li>
            <li> Great Item! Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I got five boxes instead of four, which was a lovely surprise! they&#x27;re really soft  and nice</li>
            <li> My daughters do Cosplay.  They love them.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Don&#x27;t recommend it to nobody.</li>
            <li> Love them. They are just perfect. I do have to trim them down some. But thats better then being to long. I love how there are different sets. So i can try out all different kinds of styles.</li>
            <li> I ordered these a while back and already wrote a review, but my stance on these eyelashes have changed so I&#x27;m going to rewrite this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of product you get for the price is great. For these being my first sets of false eyelashes, I&#x27;ll admit that I had enjoyed them and thought that they were perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I ran out of these lashes recently and had forgotten to order more, so I went to the store and bought a new set to hold me over for a while--and what a difference they made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes, while nice for a beginner or someone practicing applying them, are actually terrible in comparison to other products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought that all false lashes were like these--stiff, cheap, and not always matching in lengths. But that&#x27;s not the case. I honestly think that you&#x27;re better off purchasing the more expensive lashes elsewhere, like a drugstore or some other company on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The are very soft and wonderful to work with.  I have had so many compliments on them.  My lashes are so thin, but these help tremendously.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and they were exactly what I wanted! I only wish the band wasn&#x27;t so thick. But other then that great lashes!!</li>
            <li> They work great with the right kind of glue</li>
            <li> They are really pretty but you really need to. Work with them</li>
            <li> Durable and very pretty</li>
            <li> It went beautifully with me, worth it !</li>
            <li> Received as promised. There are two packs which are dense eyelashes and I am totally in love with these. They look beautiful. The other two packs are just normal false eyelashes, my only complaint with them is the adhesive strip is narrow and hard to work with. Overall I will probably be ordering another pack.</li>
            <li> So cheap save your money I&#x27;ll never use them again.</li>
            <li> They just too long to get here and the cases were smashed</li>
            <li> I never got the false eyelashes. I was shocked at what I received. It was a heavy beaded cheap necklace one that my six year old could make. I threw it in the trash. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a joke or serious. Really upset.</li>
            <li> Great product second time ordering. They do need adjusting but very simple fix.</li>
            <li> Really ugly lashes not worth 5 there plastic and it&#x27;s super obvious its plastic please don&#x27;t buy them!</li>
            <li> Took a  min to get n mail. Waited forever!!!!  Although was happy for the price with the  quality of the product.</li>
