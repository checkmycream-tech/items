            <li> works great should come in a larger bottle</li>
            <li> i am 19 years old and have sensitive skin. When i wear flip flops my feet get so dry ( i apply lotion day/night) and i have some callus on the bottom of my feet so i tried it, at first i thought i received an expired bottle and i applied to my feet with bare hands after soaking them in water, let it sit on my feet for like 8 minutes ( more than what the bottle says) and nothing happened i took it off with mr.pumice stone but my feet were the same. my hands did get thin layer of skin removed but not my feet. i&#x27;m still wondering it is supposed to be a clear jelly like product?</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this and this is amazing! This works just like the stuff they use at the nail shops only better because you can use it in your own home with your own pumice. Definitely recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> Getting to be a certain age in life, you discover--oh the injustice of it all--that your once sweet little tootsies are now the equivalent of saggy, baggy elephant skins that appear on the ends of your legs. How&#x27;d that happen? Or maybe you like to wear flip-flops--which everyone knows are H-E-double-toothpick on foot skin. Either way, you have heinous heel skin. Cracked, dry, looks scary in sandals--yup, that&#x27;s you, embarrassingly enough. You&#x27;ve tried Ped-Egg, which does work, by the way, but it isn&#x27;t enough. You&#x27;ve tried creams and potions, which again, do work, but not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, finally, you realize this is going to take a multi-pronged approach. Even to get your foot skin into good enough shape to actually go for a pedicure without getting scoffed at by the spa staff--you have to do more than a little something. You have to call in the major artillery. Mr. Pumice IS the major artillery. But here&#x27;s your battle plan with a reward of winning the war on ugly foot skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Rub the delightful-smelling Mr. Pumice Callus Terminator on your heels or anywhere else on your feet that need help.&lt;br /&gt;2) Let soak in for longer than the package states--10 minutes? It won&#x27;t hurt and may help.&lt;br /&gt;3) Rinse thoroughly until your skin is no longer slick.&lt;br /&gt;4) Scrub offensive areas with Mr. Pumice Pumi Bar--scrub well and dig in--repeat until the skin feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;5) Apply a light lotion or oil (if you don&#x27;t have any handy, olive oil or other kitchen oil will do.&lt;br /&gt;6) You will notice an immediate improvement, but dry skin may return the next day. If so, repeat steps 1 through 5 daily until you have baby-soft, movie-star quality feet that stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;7) Apply lotion/oil daily at the very least and touch up with the Mr. Pumi one-two punch as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something for my feet that really works and I&#x27;ve tried so many. My feet were so bad that I was too embarrass to go the Nail Salon and get them done. It got to a point that I stopped wearing sandals all together, and starting wearing socks to cover my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I walked around the house bare feet, I would feel the dead skin on my feet sticking to the carpet or sheets on the bed. They would even stick on my socks. Let me tell you that sucks big time. So I came across this product and decided to give a try. I read the direction and it says to leave on for 3 to 5 minutes and then gently rub it off with Mr. Pumice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was like yeah right, like that&#x27;s really going to work on my feet. I need something rougher than a Mr. Pumice because I have a Mr. Pumice and it hasn&#x27;t helped in the past. I tried it and it&#x27;s like a gel that you rub on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you it SHUT ME UP! This product is MAGIC IN A BOTTLE. It really works and all you really need is a Mr. Pumice to gently rub it off. You can see immediate results. I love this product it.</li>
            <li> I got to say I was highly skeptical. I specifically got this stuff for a callus on my ring finger due to ingrown finger nails. It was thick, tough, scratchy and ugly. The first time I tried it, followed the directions on the bottle. A little came off but the callus was still there. I did it again a week later. Callus was noticeably smaller but not gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did something stupid. I left the Callus terminator on for a longer time. About 10 minutes. The tingle went to a bit of a burning feeling (like using Nair). Not only did it soften the callus, but it also softened up a little bit of my fingernail and turned it yellow. While, definitely not the smartest thing I have ever done, my nail grew to the point where the yellow part could be trimmed off, and my callus is gone! I don&#x27;t recommend you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small callus on my boyfriend&#x27;s toe. Used the callus terminator. Smaller after the first application, then it peeled off on it&#x27;s own a week later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin that wasn&#x27;t coming off my feet? Callus terminator!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Takes the rough skin right off.  My only suggestion is to was your hands immediately after you apply it or use gloves.  It took some skin off my hands too.  Amazing.  I have recommended this to several people, and I will always keep some on hand.</li>
            <li> This does help get off that rough skin but definitely wear gloves with application and scrubbing.....learned first hand it dries out the hand</li>
            <li> Works great on hard edges of callouses. My son used on entire sole of both feet and said took care of all tough skin</li>
            <li> Used this to fix my gf&#x27;s feet.Worked like a champ!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once.  It worked OK.  Didn&#x27;t completely get rid of the calluses, but left my feet smoother.  With daily use, I&#x27;m sure it would eventually get rid of them.  I&#x27;m just not that disciplined lol.</li>
            <li> works awesome!!! worth the money its really works dead skin peel off and get the mr pumice stone its really works well together</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I thought all callus removers were equal wrong. I jumped to another product when Sallys was out of this one. Waste of money. I will never be without this again. I keep on 7 to 10 minutes and use with Mr. PUMICE stone. I get gel pedicures which last a month...now i dont feel like i should go in at 3 weeks bc my calluses are so bad.</li>
            <li> Not enough efectiveness as described in product.  It requires much more time to act as time indicated in product.  3 to 5 minutes is not enough in foot bottom</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.  I followed the directions and gave it some time to work, but alas...my heels looked the same as always.</li>
            <li> Best callus remover on the market!</li>
            <li> Takes off that winter shell in one application. But wear gloves as it took a layer of skin off my hand too even though I washed my hands immediately after application. The stuff really didn&#x27;t want to come off not even with soap. So now, 3 days later, I&#x27;m pumicing my hand to get rid of the rough, dry skin that resulted.</li>
            <li> The stuff is great.  I slather it on, use a piece of plastic wrap to cover my feet, then a pair of socks.  Leave it on about 10 minutes,  sit on the edge of the tub and run water over my feet and use a nail brush to scrub the stuff off.  Works like a dream.  Usually afterwards I soak in the tub then use the pumice stone.  My feet usually are bad, dry, cracked, yuck, but not now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results that some people said they did in their reviews, but I will keep using the product to see if I can obtain better results.</li>
            <li> Works Really Really Well! Ive always hated going in for the $5 upgrade when getting a pedicure because I never felt the results were worth the money! ...This is a different story, for  a fraction of the cost of a pedicure trip,  I have enough callus remover to do my feet at least 10 times. I let it sit for a few minutes and go at it with a Mr  Pumice block and my feet are smoth and line/crack free! As an added bonus it smells good and the product stays put really well with its get type formula.</li>
            <li> It definitely does what it says it will do. I do a lot of weightlifting so I get callouses on the palms of my hands that I have to cut down because when they get too thick, my hands rip so much easier. The first time I used this (along with the Mr. Pumice Pumi bar), it basically got rid of the callouses on my palms 100%. It works great on my heels too, but for my feet I think I prefer the Japanese baby foot peel.</li>
            <li> I first tried this Callus remover during a stay with my sister.  I came home and ordered it immediately because I was so impressed with the results.  Just remember not to stand while the gel is on your feet it is very slippery. I have a built in bench, you need a bench if in the shower. My feet are so smooth and callus free, I am proud and happy to wear sandals and open heal shoes.</li>
            <li> This product will be the only heel treatment I use!  I have purchased mr. Pumice scrubber stones for my heels but this treatment and the scrubber just makes perfect soft beautiful heels</li>
            <li> Works great but use with caution...very very strong! You could easily remove the entire bottoms of your feet with this! ( joking).... Well...not quite joking! It&#x27;s extremely strong stuff and if left on too long, could really hurt your feet! It removed my calluses in a couple rubs of a Mr Pumice stone!</li>
