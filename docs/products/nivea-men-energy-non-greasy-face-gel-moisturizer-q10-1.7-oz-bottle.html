            <li>Liked this product very much.</li>
            <li>It has a feeling of quality to it and makes my skin immediately smooth.</li>

            <li>It has a pleasant aroma and make the skin feel fresh and alive.</li>
            <li>Refreshing to the face and at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>This feels refreshing and really makes skin feel rehydrated.</li>
            <li>It is good for facial skin on winter.</li>
            <li>cool gel with relaxing smell.</li>
            <li>, the gel definitely dries to the skin much more comfortably than the lotion did.  </li>
            <li>the feeling it gives you with smooth quality with out stick greasy type like many hands or facial cream does.quslity.</li>
            <li>I guess the amazon scanner didn&#x27;t work right because this isn&#x27;t the same as the more lotion0-like version that I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing since they discontinued the older Nivea refreshing gel in the dark blue bottles.  </li>
            <li>There is a minty quality which makes your skin feel alive and clean.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Do I know if it really works?</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell though is a bit much.</li>
            <li>I really like the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This gel goes on smooth and with a nice thin layer.</li>
            <li>bought another one and I will open it up before using to see if it is full or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>If not, its a decent product.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this moisturizer, gel is none greasy unlike lotion</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this moisturizer works very well for me without the oily feel of most facial lotions.</li>
            <li>smell of this gel is a little strong and very sticky to the hand, I had to wash my hands after putting it on in the morning or else will get it over my steering wheel.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 3 years now and it has really helped my face look fresher and younger</li>
            <li>your smell sensitive, then I&#x27;d pass.</li>
            <li>There is no way to tell how low you are getting on the product until you run out at 6AM trying to get ready for work.</li>
            <li>I really like the entire line of mens products Nivea has!</li>
            <li>However the small size means you run out of this quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got an almost empty one, a used one, or if this is normal.</li>
            <li>as mentioned by at least one other reviewer, for the money there&#x27;s not much product, and there seems to be a design flaw in the pump in that as you near the end the pump sticks, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s still a bit left inside that I can&#x27;t get at.</li>

            <li> Well, the container is now empty after merely 5-10 uses, two pushes each.</li>

            <li> I really like this product. Refreshing to the face and at a very affordable price. I have been using this product for over 3 years now and it has really helped my face look fresher and younger looking</li>
            <li> Awesome product, couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so I had to order line, I highly recommend this moisturizer, gel is none greasy unlike lotion</li>
            <li> This feels refreshing and really makes skin feel rehydrated. I use always after shaving and sometimes even after a shower as the winter dry air really sucks all the moisture from your skin.</li>
            <li> Good, Nivea is good for my facial skin. I have used it for several years. It is good for facial skin on winter.</li>
            <li> I was initially pissed that Nivea discontinued the lotion version of this.  But I&#x27;ve gotta say, the gel definitely dries to the skin much more comfortably than the lotion did.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you with that oily sweaty feeling.</li>
            <li> It has a great, light, fresh scent, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy-which is important to me. Now here&#x27;s the but........as mentioned by at least one other reviewer, for the money there&#x27;s not much product, and there seems to be a design flaw in the pump in that as you near the end the pump sticks, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s still a bit left inside that I can&#x27;t get at.</li>
            <li> My face gets really dry in this product helps keep it moisturized. I have been using it for a while now and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything else.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face with a slight tingly feel, does the job well, leaves my face feeling hydrated.  A good value.</li>
            <li> i got some red spots on my face after using it. i guess i&#x27;ll use it as hand moisture in the future.</li>
            <li> When I put on this lotion it&#x27;s much different than other kinds. It has a feeling of quality to it and makes my skin immediately smooth. Do I know if it really works? No, you&#x27;re constantly aging so how would you know the difference?</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite of Nivea&#x27;s moisturizers.  It absorbs quickly but has a strong aroma while being applied. Perhaps I just don&#x27;t like gels.</li>
            <li> Seems to keep skin moist and stuff.  Not sure about chemicals in it that might cause longer term dehydration.  Probably about as good as anything else for a guy I would think, but what do I know.</li>
            <li> Liked this product very much. Nice scent, you can feel the moisture it adds to your skin.  Absorbs well. no shiny greasy feeling</li>
            <li> this product was just performing normally among all the product that i have been using , i use it during evening cuz it has less oil .</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant aroma and make the skin feel good. I use it every day. There is a minty quality which makes your skin feel alive and clean.</li>
            <li> . This gel goes on smooth and with a nice thin layer. Not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;The smell though is a bit much. For others maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your smell sensitive, then I&#x27;d pass. If not, its a decent product.</li>
            <li> smell of this gel is a little strong and very sticky to the hand, I had to wash my hands after putting it on in the morning or else will get it over my steering wheel.  Smell so strong but some people might like it, smells like AXE.</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizer. It has a fairly strong scent but that works for me. You have to wash your hands after putting it on because they become sticky as another reviewer already noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I give it 1 star then? Well, the container is now empty after merely 5-10 uses, two pushes each. I don&#x27;t know if I got an almost empty one, a used one, or if this is normal. Anyways, $6 for 10 uses is not acceptable in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one and I will open it up before using to see if it is full or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the container doesn&#x27;t have an expiration date printed anywhere on it.</li>
            <li> I use this after shaving, Kyuko exfoliant, Kyuko facial cleanser, then I use a pore reducer and the last a oil reducer.</li>
            <li> This is the next best thing since they discontinued the older Nivea refreshing gel in the dark blue bottles.  Not as good as that was but still decent.  However the small size means you run out of this quickly.</li>
            <li> My mom chose this for me and i just bought it. As it arrived i tried and found it great. It costs like 2 minute&#x27;s work in the morning and guarantees a whole day with perfect skin condition.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but I hate how they fake how much of it is in the container by using a weighted dispenser. These don&#x27;t last very long and about half the weight is the dispenser itself.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I wish the product came in a bigger size...This kind of dispenser doesn&#x27;t give a warning when product is almost done...No visable indicators...</li>
            <li> cool gel with relaxing smell. It actualy great for face as after shave like the Nivea after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;I actualy enjoy the smell and the feeling it gives you with smooth quality with out stick greasy type like many hands or facial cream does.quslity. A bit expensive for size, but well worth your money</li>
            <li> I like the lotion much better. This does not even feel like it moisturizes. My face feels plastic after applying.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, feels great on the skin and smells super!</li>
            <li> Alternative to the non-gel moisturizer and works as well!  Great fragrance, in addition to the moisturizing aspect!!  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would recommend this to anyone...</li>
            <li> Light weight and non greasy. I have dry skin and this moisturizer works very well for me without the oily feel of most facial lotions. I&#x27;ve also noticed an improvement in my skin since using this.</li>
            <li> Using this German product and must to say it&#x27;s less costly than in Germany,great!!!</li>
            <li> this is the first time that I bought moisturizer on the internet, whatever, it is very good, I like Nivea.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant aroma and make the skin feel fresh and alive. I use it every day which leads me to my issue. There is no way to tell how low you are getting on the product until you run out at 6AM trying to get ready for work. They could improve the design by adding a transparent strip to the side of the bottle. I really like the entire line of mens products Nivea has!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the one with SPF15 and CoQ10 that I scanned in the store. I guess the amazon scanner didn&#x27;t work right because this isn&#x27;t the same as the more lotion0-like version that I wanted. It&#x27;s a gel, kust OK. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Smells good, sort of strong, doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize all that great. No SPF.</li>
