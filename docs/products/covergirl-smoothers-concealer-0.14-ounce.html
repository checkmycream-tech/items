            <li>Beautiful highlighting concealer for very dark skin</li>
            <li>This product does a great job with matching with my skin tone, but you have to layer it so many times to get any coverage and the coverage doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>This provides great coverage, and its thick stick texture is easy to blend.</li>
            <li>perect for some bruises I got in an accident, matches summer tan just right</li>
            <li>is that it runs out fast and i wouldent be a problem if it was bigger n size but other then that its flawless</li>
            <li>It was difficult to find the perfect shade of concealer in the store when I needed it, so I was excited to learn the one I really like could be purchased online.</li>
            <li>I first got this concealer when I was 15...</li>
            <li>It applies and blends very smoothly, and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>Only con is it can rub off easily.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s actually pretty decent.</li>
            <li>It works great and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li>I do have a warmer skin tone, but this concealer is a bit too much for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to try looking at department store quality concealers because this stuff really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already hard enough to find good foundation/concealer make-up for chocolate chicks, so thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li>I HAVE MANY DARK SPOTS THAT I WANT TO GET RID OF</li>
            <li>They changed the packaging but not the formula..i&#x27;ve been buying the concealer since 2006 and its not heavy, dont clog my pores, covers what i want covered haha and blends in close to my skin tone..</li>

            <li>purchased it from Amazon because, in the area where I live, the stores do not carry #720.</li>

            <li> It took me so long to find a concealer that worked.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time so I will not need to buy any for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> So when I found it on Amazon and at half the price from the local stores, I ordered several sticks.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my face dry and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> 1 tube last me months because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I purchased this concealer in Deep, a few shades lighter than my skin tone, in order to use it for cream contouring.</li>
            <li> The only downside is, it feels like you are not doing any favors for the blemish being covered, as it&#x27;s very heavy and feels like it&#x27;s probably doing some clogging.</li>
            <li> Having acne and health issues made it impossible to find coverage with out a clay mask this product inproves my apperance as wellas being smooth</li>
            <li> I can hardly find this product in my local WalMart, CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, Target and other stores where you can purchase makeup</li>
            <li> This concealer covers my dark under-eye circles and dark spots from acne.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have dark color skin</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken me out so far either,</li>
            <li> I ave had a very hard time locating this color at local stores so this is truly a blessing</li>
            <li> usually buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of covergirl products but this is something I will stand by!</li>
            <li> so it is very hard to find a concealer that matches my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find this color in the stores , found it here and will not stop buying it</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> but when I do it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> I hate I cant find this color in the stores.</li>

            <li> perect for some bruises I got in an accident, matches summer tan just right</li>
            <li> Nice product, matched my skin tone, but I think its best for people with dry skin (mine is oily).</li>
            <li> I love this product it does not clog skin and covers up any dark circles or dark marks on the skin. I cannot live without this product. Haven&#x27;t been able to locate in the stores anymore. I guess they discontinued but when I found it on Amazon I was sooooo happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say this product is a must have!!!! *****</li>
            <li> awesome this is my 3rd  time buying i adives you to buy this one problem is that it runs out fast and i wouldent be a problem if it was bigger n size but other then that its flawless</li>
            <li> It naturally blends in with my skin tone to cover the darker areas under my eyes. It gives a smooth look. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer that I have ever used. It works great and you only need a little bit. I ordered this product to take with me overseas. And I am glad I did. I cannot seem to find this in the stores in the USA or overseas but as long as I can order it on line, I am fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE This product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this concealer in Deep, a few shades lighter than my skin tone, in order to use it for cream contouring. For the price, it&#x27;s actually pretty decent. It applies and blends very smoothly, and lasts pretty long. It hasn&#x27;t broken me out so far either, so that&#x27;s another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for it regularly, however, because the color is way too orangey. I do have a warmer skin tone, but this concealer is a bit too much for me. It works with a very light hand for contouring the face, but I wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find this color in the stores , found it here and will not stop buying it</li>
            <li> It took me so long to find a concealer that worked. I needed something that made me look awake in the morning. I love this product. I like how it comes in lipstick form, because I don&#x27;t have to use my hands to apply it. it doesn&#x27;t make my face dry and it lasts all day. Now I just need a de-puffer cream.</li>
            <li> This concealer works for me because it blends so easily with my skin color, and it is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it from Amazon because, in the area where I live, the stores do not carry #720.</li>
            <li> Beautiful highlighting concealer for very dark skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for years! Love, love, love it - but now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere and I&#x27;m running low! It&#x27;s already hard enough to find good foundation/concealer make-up for chocolate chicks, so thank you Amazon! This concealer covers my dark under-eye circles and dark spots from acne. It goes on smooth and creamy like a lipstick giving great coverage - it sits well under powder or liquid foundation. It&#x27;s simply the best concealer and for drugstore pricing - I don&#x27;t even want to try looking at department store quality concealers because this stuff really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This concealer is great...perfect skin match and goes on smooth. I used to buy it at Target and CVS, however the shade that I need is not always available there. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this concealer kind of scared because I didn&#x27;t get to try it on in stores and etc but I don&#x27;t regret it! I like it a lot and its looks good on my skin and isn&#x27;t cakey and gross. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of covergirl products but this is something I will stand by!</li>
            <li> This provides great coverage, and its thick stick texture is easy to blend. The only downside is, it feels like you are not doing any favors for the blemish being covered, as it&#x27;s very heavy and feels like it&#x27;s probably doing some clogging. Otherwise, definitely covers up!</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find the perfect shade of concealer in the store when I needed it, so I was excited to learn the one I really like could be purchased online. I always re-order when I start running low so I can receive the new concealer before I actually run out. I am thoroughly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I first got this concealer when I was 15... it is 10 years later and I am still a fan. No other product has ever done what it has over the years and I will stick by this concealer for years to come. don&#x27;t change a thing</li>
            <li> I could not find these in my local stores and this is the perfect shade for me, so I was HAPPY when I found them here!! Will repurchase these!!</li>
            <li> I think that this product is amazing however I believe that whoever sells this particular color is into ripping good customers off of money. You can&#x27;t find 720 deep online or in stores then it pops up for sale for 17 dollars and some change I bought it because I only wear this brand and color (Never again).They say ohhh there&#x27;s only one stick left then the month and posted one stick for 40.00 some ppl sell them for 80.00 then it pops back up for another price .I usually buy in bulk. Cover girl has lost the most loyal customer ever. I found another brand that works just as great. Liars I tell you. ALSO,CALLED COVERGIRL THEY COULDNT EXPLAIN WHY THE PRODUCT WASNT AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS</li>
            <li> THIS IS A MIRACLE WORKER FOR ME. I HAVE MANY DARK SPOTS THAT I WANT TO GET RID OF AND THIS COVERS THEM UP WELL. I APPLY MY MAKE UP AFTERWARDS AND I AM GOOD TO GO.</li>
            <li> Having acne and health issues made it impossible to find coverage with out a clay mask this product inproves my apperance as wellas being smooth,light feel on skin and affordable.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have dark color skin so it is very hard to find a concealer that matches my skin tone. This product does a great job with matching with my skin tone, but you have to layer it so many times to get any coverage and the coverage doesn&#x27;t last long. Since I bought it I will continue to use it until I find a good concealer.</li>
            <li> Cover girl is the perfect cover up for my skin. I ave had a very hard time locating this color at local stores so this is truly a blessing</li>
            <li> I had to look all over to find this concealer. I love it and everyone always asks me what I use.q</li>
            <li> Love it! This item is discontinued so It&#x27;s nice to know i can count on amazon for my beauty needs!</li>
            <li> This provides great coverage for problem areas. Only con is it can rub off easily. I have been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I have a birthmark over my left eye and have used this concealer for over 10 yrs.  I NEVER leave the house without it on.  I can hardly find this product in my local WalMart, CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, Target and other stores where you can purchase makeup but when I do it&#x27;s expensive.  So when I found it on Amazon and at half the price from the local stores, I ordered several sticks. It lasts a long time so I will not need to buy any for quite some time.  By far my best purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this product! They changed the packaging but not the formula..i&#x27;ve been buying the concealer since 2006 and its not heavy, dont clog my pores, covers what i want covered haha and blends in close to my skin tone.. A toni braxton, megan good brown. 1st time i bought it online but i will buy again and again. 1 tube last me months because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product from amazon.com since 2005, and it is now spring of 2013. I must say that this is a great product. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Its perfect!!! It is so easy to apply on face and i just love it!!It WORKS MUST BUY NOW!! what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> I hate I cant find this color in the stores. Nonetheless it was the perfect fit for me. No problems</li>
