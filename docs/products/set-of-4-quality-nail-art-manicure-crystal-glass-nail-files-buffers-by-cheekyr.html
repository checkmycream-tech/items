            <li>I had no idea how much better glass nail files are than the metal ones!  </li>
            <li>Love the colors!</li>
            <li>Lots of bubble wrap to keep them safe on the trip here too!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>This are as nice as everyone says.</li>
            <li>Although the shipping did take awhile, they arrived in good packaging, safely and items are as described.</li>
            <li>These are nice glass files.</li>
            <li>They do their job well and are very attractive, much as they appear in the picture.</li>
            <li>Nice texture for the course and smoother side.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and perfect for getting that nice smooth edge.</li>
            <li>the packaging was very secure.</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed using my glass files.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li>I love these I have had mine for years</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love these nail files.  </li>
            <li>I have always used emory boards, and was weary of glass (mostly for concerns of the glass breaking).  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>love the colors</li>
            <li>Love these files.</li>
            <li>Same excellent quality!</li>
            <li>love  them ad their cute too</li>
            <li>I bought some of these for myself and I loved them so much that I had to buy more for the ladies I work with.  </li>
            <li>just be careful but they are awesome!!  </li>
            <li>Smooth nails better than metal or emery boards.  </li>
            <li>They are so smooth when they are filing nails, without any of the catching and leaving rough patches I have experienced using metal files.  </li>
            <li>These have the fine grit that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>THESE FIT THE BILL</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>Leave a smooth surface every time.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t file quite as smoothly as the ones from Sassella.</li>
            <li>These files leave nothing for clothing or fabric to catch on for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Built like cheap Emory board.</li>
            <li>These are better than the first ones I bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li>they not only look beautiful but are really gentle on your nails.</li>
            <li>They file well and quickly without chewing up your nails like you&#x27;ve used industrial machinery.</li>
            <li>You can quickly erase snags with one swipe of the file.</li>
            <li>Same excellent quality!these on for the night or even just ten minutes...  </li>
            <li>These are very pretty and seem durable.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty in person.</li>
            <li>Exactly the type of nail file I use and need!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I think I will order a bunch more, because I have 3 teenage girls and these will quickly scatter to the 4 winds and beyond!</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>mine lol... where the cuticle is not perfectly round, a bit more like square with round corners,</li>
            <li>Smile.  </li>
            <li>Smile.  </li>
            <li>The first one I tried before Cheeky and while I really liked it, it was only textured on one side.</li>
            <li>It works fine on normal nails.</li>
            <li>they really work nice and last forever!</li>
            <li>You have to be very gentle when doing this because of the roughness of the point.</li>
            <li>So when I saw I could get 4 Cheeky glass files at a very reasonable price, I jumped on the opportunity.</li>
            <li>Should one of these break (like my last one that I had for more than two years)</li>
            <li>Pretty color assortment.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I HOPED FOR</li>
            <li>Arrived more than a week earlier than the deadline posted.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Great to give as gifts and last a long time.</li>
            <li>and these are the only files I&#x27;ve been able to use.</li>
            <li>Note, this is the first time I have ever purchased crystal glass nail files.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I absolutely love that they have a pointed end, unlike regular emery board files!  </li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>Gentle on my nails.</li>
            <li>Haha..</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>What my nails are especially thankful for, is that these files actually smooth out my cuticles and the skin around my nails, also like butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li>I tried them out on my nails and they filed down quickly and smooth.  </li>
            <li>One file is exactly the degree of rough that I like to use but the cost was less to buy all these files than to buy one at my local store so it&#x27;s still a very good deal.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to the emery boards (that wear out so quickly) or metal files again.</li>
            <li>Decent files.</li>
            <li>I used it a few times on acrylic nails and it did ok.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you read how long they actually take to be mailed.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive nails</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Take a long time (1 month) to get here, but are worth the wait for the price.</li>
            <li>All the manufacturer has to do is smooth down the point &amp; that would solve the challenge.</li>
            <li>Works as might be expected, but the grain might be somewhat coarser - it is too fine and requires a lot of back and forth to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>Love these boards , shipping was a bit slow but that could have been just my expectations.</li>
            <li>Then I bought Cheeky and discovered that the texturing is even smoother and more gentle on my thin, peeling, bending nails.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I expected, but OK</li>
            <li>Each are about five inches long and strong enough to live in a purse and wallet (if it&#x27;s big enough).</li>
            <li>I had already had them in the past and knew they were fantastic.</li>
            <li>It took a long time to receive, but they work very well.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m assuming they are of the same quality as the ones marked Cheeky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I do remember seeing a few mixed reviews, I listed the seller I purchased these glass files from at the top of this review and uploaded a few pictures.  </li>

            <li> Loved this order. Good price but shipping took forever.</li>
            <li> Exactly the type of nail file I use and need! If emry board just don&#x27;t do the job for you then these are just what the doctor ordered! Each are about five inches long and strong enough to live in a purse and wallet (if it&#x27;s big enough). I keep mine on person because I&#x27;m always getting hang nails. Should one of these break (like my last one that I had for more than two years) you hav back ups since they send four! Should I manage to break and lose all of these, I know which one to come back to!</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much better glass nail files are than the metal ones!  We sell these at work, and I finally tried one.  WOW!  They are so smooth when they are filing nails, without any of the catching and leaving rough patches I have experienced using metal files.  These never seem to wear down…I have been using one for over a year with great results.  I will never go back to the emery boards (that wear out so quickly) or metal files again.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Takes a little while to come from China.  Each one comes in a plastic sleeve which will hold up for a while.  Pretty color assortment.  Great stocking stuffer.  Just know it takes a couple of weeks to come.</li>
            <li> This are as nice as everyone says. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but these are great. They file well and quickly without chewing up your nails like you&#x27;ve used industrial machinery. And they work with getting the edges off of Jamberry nail wraps nicely! I think I will order a bunch more, because I have 3 teenage girls and these will quickly scatter to the 4 winds and beyond!</li>
            <li> Decent files. Feel substantial in your hand.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using my glass files.  Work well with my Jamberry nail wraps.</li>
            <li> Love these boards , shipping was a bit slow but that could have been just my expectations.Good product.</li>
            <li> I had already had them in the past and knew they were fantastic.</li>
            <li> These files are cheaper copies of what I&#x27;ve purchased in past . They are thick. Not as thin as desired if you wish to get under your nail to file. ALSO the sides of these files also have a file-type surface so when you file, you&#x27;re filing into your skin; a very unpleasant experience!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t purchase these ever again! They are a shoddy reproduction-poorly done.</li>
            <li> Although the shipping did take awhile, they arrived in good packaging, safely and items are as described.</li>
            <li> These files are awesome.  Last for a long time.  Only giving 4 stars because it look a month to be delivered.</li>
            <li> These are nice glass files. Love the colors! Nice and thick. These have the fine grit that I was looking for. Easy to clean and perfect for getting that nice smooth edge. I will be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li> Works as might be expected, but the grain might be somewhat coarser - it is too fine and requires a lot of back and forth to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> It took 27 days to get to me (within the time frame so I&#x27;m not complaining) and none were broken.  These are very pretty and seem durable.  I tried them out on my nails and they filed down quickly and smooth.  If I ever manage to break or lose all 4, I&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
            <li> I really like these they not only look beautiful but are really gentle on your nails.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I HOPED FOR, I HAD SOME YEARS AGO AND WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE SAME QUALITY--THESE FIT THE BILL</li>
            <li> Works well and shipped on time.</li>
            <li> I manicured my fingernails last night and found that the points on these files are very rough. I use the point to push back my cuticles. You have to be very gentle when doing this because of the roughness of the point. All the manufacturer has to do is smooth down the point &amp; that would solve the challenge.</li>
            <li> Great value for very nice glass nail files.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the name Cheeky is not printed on the files as were my previous purchase of this file.  They do seem to be holding up well so I&#x27;m assuming they are of the same quality as the ones marked Cheeky.</li>
            <li> Love these files!! Would purchase again!!</li>
            <li> These last long and are washable</li>
            <li> These are perfect for nail care.  You can quickly erase snags with one swipe of the file.</li>
            <li> I love these I have had mine for years</li>
            <li> As described.  Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Bought to give to hostesses for Jamberry business.  Prefer these over the Vktech Durable Crystal Glass Nail Files Manicure Nail Art Device Tool</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought, but I have really big hands. But they work beautiful, I love them.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2nd set of these files. I leave them all over the place, my car, office, bag. I love them. Gentle on my nails. Takes a while to arrive b/c it comes from over seas. Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to receive, but they work very well.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Lots of bubble wrap to keep them safe on the trip here too! Thank you</li>
            <li> Arrived more than a week earlier than the deadline posted. Look just like in the picture. Work perfectly. I would have like them to be a bit less thick but they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> I love these nail files.  My nails do not spit if I use these files.</li>
            <li> I bought some of these for myself and I loved them so much that I had to buy more for the ladies I work with.  These are awesome and they do such a great job because they are very precise!!  I did have one break when I dropped it on the tile floor so just be careful but they are awesome!!  I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Smooth nails better than metal or emery boards.  Great to give as gifts and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great files! Take a long time (1 month) to get here, but are worth the wait for the price.</li>
            <li> My third set.  I love them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have always used emory boards, and was weary of glass (mostly for concerns of the glass breaking).  I saw this set, and finally took the plunge.  I will never go back! These files are great! I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> great files, would be better if shorter</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected, but OK</li>
            <li> These are better than the first ones I bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li> They are the best I&#x27;ve tried.... they really work nice and last forever!</li>
            <li> I like these files. They do their job well and are very attractive, much as they appear in the picture. I&#x27;m tired of buying and discarding disposable files and these will last a long time with no sign of wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other brands besides Cheeky. The first one I tried before Cheeky and while I really liked it, it was only textured on one side. Then I bought Cheeky and discovered that the texturing is even smoother and more gentle on my thin, peeling, bending nails. When that one broke, a friend gave me her glass file because she didn&#x27;t like it. Guess what, I didn&#x27;t like it either. The texture was too rough and the file too thick to get under my nails comfortably. So when I saw I could get 4 Cheeky glass files at a very reasonable price, I jumped on the opportunity. They were shipped internationally and arrived several weeks before the estimated delivery date. None broken - the packaging was very secure. I&#x27;m happy and my nails are happy again, too.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product. I used it a few times on acrylic nails and it did ok. It works fine on normal nails. I would order again</li>
            <li> Great files... Just make sure you read how long they actually take to be mailed.</li>
            <li> Had one for over 11 years. Now I don&#x27;t have to hunt for it, I have one in every room and vehicle. Love them! I have very sensitive nails and these are the only files I&#x27;ve been able to use. Leave a smooth surface every time.</li>
            <li> they work great for what I need. love the colors</li>
            <li> These are great files for the price.  You can&#x27;t complain about that.  They should last years or until they break.  They don&#x27;t wear down at all.  They don&#x27;t file quite as smoothly as the ones from Sassella. Sassella has, in my opinion, superior glass files to these, but, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat these.  I went with these because I got 4 for the price of one Sassella file.  These files leave nothing for clothing or fabric to catch on for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> The reason I only gave 4 stars is that some of the files are a little rougher than I care for although someone else may prefer that. One file is exactly the degree of rough that I like to use but the cost was less to buy all these files than to buy one at my local store so it&#x27;s still a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Love these files. Seems to file smoother faster than other files.</li>
            <li> (See Photos)&lt;br /&gt;Purchased from seller: VAGA SHOP US&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nail files are amazing!!!  Note, this is the first time I have ever purchased crystal glass nail files. I have always heard they were the way to go but never saught them out, until I decided to order my next nail files online (convenience) and came about them here. Isn&#x27;t Amazon the best???!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought these were a bargain for the set of 4, under $7.  They took forever to ship, no longer than anything else I usually receive from Asia though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in perfect condition, well packaged.  I am now a permanent glass file kinda gal- no turning back, ever!!  I&#x27;ve been missing out, like, big time!  Haha..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I absolutely love that they have a pointed end, unlike regular emery board files!  I hadn&#x27;t thought about it but practically speaking, if anyone else has thumb nails like mine lol... where the cuticle is not perfectly round, a bit more like square with round corners, haha... These pointed ends are just awesome!  Especially for me who (confession!!) has picked-up a terrible habbit of removing my cuticles....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These glass files make my nails feel like butter (and my husbands lol, he was in for a treat of a manicure while watching The Voice, ha!).  What my nails are especially thankful for, is that these files actually smooth out my cuticles and the skin around my nails, also like butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone else has experienced hardened or over-grown cuticles, you know that no amount of moisturizer compares to the feeling of removing them (terrible as that is- don&#x27;t do it, they grow back worse!)! Well these can file, while smoothing, in a way that doesn&#x27;t quite feel like any grit of sand paper (I&#x27;ve tried just about all styles of regular nail files).  I can&#x27;t really explain it but if you&#x27;ve yet to try one- I definitely recommend these!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry cuticles or not, here are a treat I think every woman (and man for that matter) deserves!!!  Put a little cuticle oil, essential oils of choice, or hand cream on, and then put these on for the night or even just ten minutes...  It&#x27;s just like putting thin cotton socks on after a moisturizing foot soak- the cotton just locks in all the moisture and feels wonderful! They are of course sold in smaller packs but I think these were a great buy and I recommend them:  [[ASIN:B00CIBQD6Y CARA Model 810 Cotton Glove Dispenser Box, Small, 24 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I do remember seeing a few mixed reviews, I listed the seller I purchased these glass files from at the top of this review and uploaded a few pictures.  Very happy with my purchase and do recommend you buy from this seller with confidence.  Smile.  Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE - 9/25/15 - Just received another set after giving too many of my others away, lol. Purchased from same seller and received the same colors with sleeves. They are now labeled with brand name; uploading another photo. Same excellent quality!these on for the night or even just ten minutes...

            <li> love  them ad their cute too</li>
            <li> Very pretty in person.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t last. Built like cheap Emory board.</li>
            <li> Good quality and size.  Nice texture for the course and smoother side.  These nail files are not harsh on the natural nail as they are not as course as the files for artificial or acrylic  nails.</li>
