    <ol>
            <li> Works GREAT!  Bought eight of these bad boys for the whole family!</li>
            <li> my lady and I have had this toothbrush for months now it is everything we could have ever asked for my mouth feels fresh and my gums are pink and nice, we just bought  pair of these for our niece and nephew (to whom hate toothpaste) they love this alternative toothbrush they just went to the dentist both zero cavity this toothbrush is amazing</li>
            <li> The Soladey 3 ionic solar toothbrush exceeds all other toothbrushes in plaque removal ability!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend ionic toothbrushes to everyone.</li>
            <li> Lied post.  No replacement heads included.  False advertisement.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes were recommended by a friend and they make your teeth FEEL like you just had an official cleaning in the dental office. Smooooth and clean!</li>
            <li> Llevamos  apenas 2 semanas usando soladey y de momento la experiencia ha sido satisfactoria.&lt;br /&gt;Tenemos entendido que es bueno para evitar la caries dental en niños y adultos.</li>
            <li> Worst buy ever. Did not include extra brushes&lt;br /&gt;Came with NO instructions in English and no replacement brushes as quoted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a short time, so far my teeth feel cleaner and smoother but I need more time to check out the plaque.</li>
            <li> The handle is too short. When you brush you cover up the &amp;#34;light collector&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The is the second Soladey toothbrush I bought.  Loved mine and got this one for my husband.  Don&#x27;t need to use toothpaste to feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I notice the packaging of my Soladeys from Super Cool Japan is different and might just be a copy. I both 2 with different colors, one blue from Super Cool Japan, another from FUJI JAPAN in orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one from Super Cool Japan is already open and soesn&#x27;t come with a free head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one from FUJI JAPAN is still intact and comes with a free head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspection wise, I see a discoloration difference. I like the ones from FUJI JAPAN.</li>
            <li> The original costs about $20 more and is much bigger. I didn&#x27;t know that this one was any different, until I recommended it and my mother in law bought one too. Her&#x27;s is almost twice as thick. She told me that the Chinese took the technology and created their own. I guess this is the Chinese one and the bigger more expensive one is the original. If I knew that I would&#x27;ve just bought the original. If your ok with the Chinese one it works really well. The handle is just not as big as the real Soladey brushes.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this toothbrush, it said it came with replacement heads. Even another reviewer said their&#x27;s came with 4 replacement heads. What I got, 3-4 weeks after I ordered, was a single toothbrush with no replacement heads. Had it not come all the way from Japan I would have returned it!</li>
            <li> Not sure whether this works or not since there is no movement and I&#x27;m used to sonicate. Will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I really love this and can tell it cleans my teeth better than I could have expected. I use an electric toothbrush and then use this to clear the plaque. Best buy for sure.</li>
            <li> When I first received this toothbrush, I was disappointed---I thought that it was very expensive for what looked like a regular toothbrush.  Once I used it, however, I immediately noticed the difference.  I love it!  My teeth have never felt so clean.  I&#x27;m buying them for everyone in my family.  5 stars!</li>
            <li> i think its just needs time to work. my teeth do feel cleaner using it though.</li>
            <li> No toothpaste needed.  Brush with water at night, still have shiny clean teeth in the morning.  I have used an older model of this toothbrush for a decade.  My dentist asked me what kind of toothpaste I use because my teeth in such good shape.  I am 74.  I bought this toothbrush for a family member.</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush, for me the best in the world</li>
            <li> After the first two times that I brushed, it left me the feeling of just being at the dental office for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I think it really works.</li>
            <li> I Can feel the difference between it and my oral b spin brush. it cleans the plaque off alot better. and the bristles are soft which is what my dentist told me works best for teeth. great buy. fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Soladey 3 from Amazon about a month ago after doing a little internet research on it. Soladey ionic toothbrushes are very popular in Japan and the science behind it seems plausible. My toothbrush arrived quickly and I am happy with its quality and performance. Soladey states that the ions produced by the toothbrush is all that is needed to clean your teeth ( no need for toothpaste ). I however still use toothpaste and will continue to do so. While this technology may have some merit, I think that it should only aid the toothpaste and proper brushing in cleaning your teeth. The soladey toothbrush that I ordered came with four replacement heads. Other replacement heads ( regular or soft ) can be ordered off of Amazon or other internet vendors. Overall, I am very pleased with the Soladey 3 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer!..  I first heard about this from my dentist who knew of it but did not know how or if it actually worked.  My lower front teeth are crowded and I have difficulty keeping tarter from forming and hardening.  I still don&#x27;t know how this toothbrush works, but it works.  Tarter stays gone and you keep that newly cleaned &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; feeling.  It says no need for toothpaste, but I still do a bit afterwards with my regular brush, just out of desire for a minty taste.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, great for travel and you can use it without toothpaste!  Great for camping or when you don&#x27;t have a toiletry kit handy</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here, came with no instructions in English, and no replacement brushes... Would have returned if I thought I would actually get my money back.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special about the toothbrush other than the fact that it&#x27;s a toothbrush. I&#x27;m giving a mid-range rating as to be neutral for the time being. If I notice an improvement in the near future, I&#x27;ll update my posting.</li>
            <li> I just received the Soladey-3 ionic toothbrush. While I believe I will need to use the product for at least a month before I can say whether it delivers the promisses, I want to make some comments on the seller, a company called Fuji Japan, from Shizuoka. The product was sent to me by mail, and inside the package, there was a very polite and hart warming hand written thank you notice signed by two people from the company and a very japanese gift: a paper origami tsuru (a crane). I was really impressed by this small detail: very polite, very delicate, very japanese and extremely hart warming. Congratulations to Fuji Japan. Even though we are half a world apart, it feels as if I purchased the item from an old friend´s store around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;Way to go, Fuji Japan!</li>
            <li> The first line in the description says: &amp;#34;Solar Powered and Made in Japan High Tech Ionic Toothbrush.&amp;#34; Utter BS, and Amazon should not stand for false advertising. I bought mine from MIYABI_JAPAN, fulfilled by Amazon. And right there on the back of the package it says &amp;#34;Made in China.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, they are lying when they claim Made in Japan right there on the Amazon page, which is there as of the date of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brush itself: I think the bristles are too hard. Also, since you have to make sure the end of the handle receives light, it is a bit awkward to hold while using. Also, there really is no indicator that lets you know if it is getting enough light. There should be some sort of LED indicator to let you know it has enough light to be powered. Especially at its price. Poorly designed, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Color me a skeptic, but this thing certainly makes my teeth feel cleaner, my dentist will let me know how well it works in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> SEEMS TO DO WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES,  REDUCE PLAQUE.  I LIKE TO DIP THE BRUSH IN LISTERINE TOTAL CARE PRIOR TO BRUSHING&lt;br /&gt;RATHER THAN DO A DRY BRUSH.</li>
            <li> It says I was supposed to get 4 replacement heads. All I got was the toothbrush! And no instructions in English!</li>
            <li> I love it since the very beginning, I know there is to some advance technology around this toothbrush and I&#x27;m very impress on how it works. however I bought it because I hate the other brands of toothbrush the look like a toy. This one is very fancy, well made and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still testing the benefits of the Ionic thing.</li>
