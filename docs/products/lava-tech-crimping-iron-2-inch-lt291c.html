            <li>While this did its job for the most part it took a while to get there.</li>

            <li>I had a crimper once, years ago, that worked beautifully and totally transformed my unruly locks, so I kept hoping, but I had kind of given up on crimpers.</li>
            <li>It creates a beautiful straight, slightly patterned look that is just awesome.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a good crimper for the price!</li>
            <li>:) You will love it as much as I do !!</li>
            <li>The comb goes through my hair so easily after it&#x27;s been crimped.</li>
            <li>It crimped my hair just fine</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great item, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This crimping iron is very good, doesn&#x27;t scorch, gets hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>Works very well heats up quickly and has a nice design</li>
            <li>but when it does the crimping clean.</li>
            <li>cuz it looked so full, they thought I added extensions</li>
            <li>I used a crimping iron before on my wife&#x27;s hair back in the UK and wanted one as good as that.</li>
            <li>it gets hot easy.  </li>
            <li>Got this for an 80&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve party and it worked better than my original iron.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>bought it for my 8 year old grand daughter and she loves it</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 7yr old just love it takes about 10mins to crimp her hair so loves it to .good product.</li>
            <li>Worth the price..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use on thick curly hair and looks amazing!</li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly, doesn&#x27;t snag or pull hair.</li>
            <li>says it takes 3-4 minutes to warm up but was hot enough after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing for such a great little tool!!</li>
            <li>really hot and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>The straight, crimped look delivered by this iron lasts overnight!</li>
            <li>I was having to hold the crimper 10-15 seconds on the first section of hair to get it to crimp.</li>
            <li>O have thick hair and it heats up enough that my hair crimps perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is small but does a good job styling her hair.  </li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough to crimp my hair and I have medium fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very responsive to heated tools.</li>
            <li>At any rate, thanks to M. Patterson&#x27;s rave review, I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>My hair now looks so much thicker.</li>
            <li>People asked if it was my real hair</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>this got here so fast,  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter after reading many reviews of other crimping irons.  </li>
            <li>Nice sized crimps that last all day long.</li>
            <li>It heats in less that 45 seconds and is so hot not to set fire to your hair but to crimp and last for the day with no hair spray awsome so pleased!</li>
            <li>I highly doubt it, but for the price this is a decent product.</li>
            <li>More like a frizzy mess since I couldn&#x27;t get it to crimp.</li>
            <li>For the low price, I figured I had nothing to lose, anticipating that I would most likely be tossing it, as I have the last three.</li>
            <li>I ended up just wearing it in a side ponytail and added a few bright colored clip on extensions to distract from the mess.</li>
            <li>This is a hard to find item in most retail stores.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be that great since the price was a lot lower than some of the others.</li>
            <li>It does take a while though to do her whole head, as her hair is about to mid shoulder blade.</li>
            <li>I found the 3 seconds, or slightly less than that was adequate for each section.</li>
            <li>The crimps are very small and easy to do.</li>
            <li>Exceeded my expectations and other more expensive hot irons.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thin, fine hair</li>

            <li> I have wanted a hair crimper for so long</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning with thick, straight locks, and all I had to do was comb it.</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t have to hold it in one place for very long for it to work.</li>
            <li> I did each section of my wife&#x27;s hair by counting to 3 and then moved down to the next bit</li>
            <li> That being said I had to hold this longer than I would have expected to achieve a noticeable crimp.</li>
            <li> my hair is down to the middle of my back and thick.</li>
            <li> When I tried out the crimper, I only did so on a part of a very small section.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my little girls father daughter dance.</li>
            <li> I have been so skeptical about hair straighteners and crimpers in general since I can&#x27;t usually get them to work on my extremely wiry, unruly hair!</li>
            <li> Usually, every morning I have to shampoo my hair because I can&#x27;t get the comb through my wiry, unruly locks.</li>
            <li> use it almost every day to give my hair a little volume and it hasnt failed me.</li>
            <li> No great loss though</li>
            <li> This product did not crimp or straighten my hair, it was useless, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> When I got it out to crimp my hair for the party, I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ended up returning it. :(</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t turn out that way and my hair looked terrible, not 80&#x27;s at all.</li>

            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who always wanted a crimper.  After reading the good reviews I decided I would give it a try.  My daughter used it once and I doubt she will ever use it again.  Nothing against the crimper...it worked and did what it was supposed to do, but you know how teenagers are.  :)</li>
            <li> Crimp-a-licious! Nice sized crimps that last all day long. Like, totally!</li>
            <li> it gets hot easy.  it works well.  This is a hard to find item in most retail stores.  Worth the price.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what this thing is for. My granddaughter said she had to have it for her hair. Whatever it does, she says it is great.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my little girls father daughter dance. It was 80s theme. While this did its job for the most part it took a while to get there. My daughter has thin, fine hair and it&#x27;s very responsive to heated tools. That being said I had to hold this longer than I would have expected to achieve a noticeable crimp. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> my wife ordered this crimping iron. It arrived on time it&#x27;s a great product with a great price .gets really hot and does it&#x27;s job. added loads of volume to her hair she would order again.</li>
            <li> Love this crimper, uses a good heat and creates wonderful texture and volume. all around a great product for an AWESOME price</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 7yr old just love it takes about 10mins to crimp her hair so loves it to .good product.</li>
            <li> Got this for an 80&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve party and it worked better than my original iron. Wonderful item for the money. It is a great tool for the value. Very pleased! My hair was a hit!</li>
            <li> It did just what I wanted it to. It crimped my hair just fine, I just hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I have been so skeptical about hair straighteners and crimpers in general since I can&#x27;t usually get them to work on my extremely wiry, unruly hair! I had a crimper once, years ago, that worked beautifully and totally transformed my unruly locks, so I kept hoping, but I had kind of given up on crimpers. I had to toss the last three crimpers I&#x27;ve owned because they did nothing. Maybe they weren&#x27;t hot enough; I&#x27;m not sure. At any rate, thanks to M. Patterson&#x27;s rave review, I purchased this one. For the low price, I figured I had nothing to lose, anticipating that I would most likely be tossing it, as I have the last three. No great loss though at that low price, so I decided to order one just on the off-chance that it might actually work. The good news is that this thing is amazing. It works, it works, it works! It&#x27;s like the one I once had that worked miracles on my ultra-fine, ultra-wiry hair! I LOVE THIS CRIMPER!! And you don&#x27;t have to hold it in one place for very long for it to work. It creates a beautiful straight, slightly patterned look that is just awesome. My hair now looks so much thicker. It has more volume and is straight and gorgeous! WOO-HOOO!!! Even better news: The straight, crimped look delivered by this iron lasts overnight! I woke up this morning with thick, straight locks, and all I had to do was comb it. The comb goes through my hair so easily after it&#x27;s been crimped. Usually, every morning I have to shampoo my hair because I can&#x27;t get the comb through my wiry, unruly locks. It&#x27;s always tangled and knotted after a night&#x27;s sleep. I can&#x27;t say enough about this crimping iron! The price is amazing for such a great little tool!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to get one! My hair didn&#x27;t even look so good after a Brazilian Blow-out! Not even close!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great item, highly recommended! A++++</li>
            <li> This hair crimper works great! It&#x27;s easy to use on thick curly hair and looks amazing! It has a lot of volume and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase! This is a must buy for hair styling!</li>
            <li> Worth the price.. I have had this crimper for about 2 years and it is still holding up! Exceeded my expectations and other more expensive hot irons.</li>
            <li> I bought this crimping iron just before this last Halloween. I was a party rock chick and I thought the crimped look would be perfect with my outfit. It definitely was! It gave my hair a ton of volume and I got several compliments. People asked if it was my real hair cuz it looked so full, they thought I added extensions and it didn&#x27;t take too long to style either. About 35 minutes. I didn&#x27;t use any product with the iron and my hair stayed crimped even after sleeping on it thru the night. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Works great! It takes a while to heat up but when it does the crimping clean. Very happy I&#x27;m glad I bought two.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an 80&#x27;s party. Crimping my hair is a must. I tried it out as soon as I got it and I was impressed. I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be that great since the price was a lot lower than some of the others. But it did the job! Heats up quickly. I like that bigger 2 inch size...my hair is down to the middle of my back and thick. The crimps are very small and easy to do. Love it! Can&#x27;t wait to show everyone at the party in 2 weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: Well, I have to change my 5 star rating to a 3. When I tried out the crimper, I only did so on a part of a very small section. When I got it out to crimp my hair for the party, I was so disappointed. I was having to hold the crimper 10-15 seconds on the first section of hair to get it to crimp. I didn&#x27;t want to fry my hair by doing that to my entire head of hair. I don&#x27;t know what the deal is. I was counting on the same crimps I got when I tested it on a tiny section. Didn&#x27;t turn out that way and my hair looked terrible, not 80&#x27;s at all. More like a frizzy mess since I couldn&#x27;t get it to crimp. I ended up just wearing it in a side ponytail and added a few bright colored clip on extensions to distract from the mess. Ended up returning it. :(</li>
            <li> Works very well heats up quickly and has a nice design&lt;br /&gt;I use it almost every day to give my hair a little volume and it hasnt failed me. O have thick hair and it heats up enough that my hair crimps perfectly. i would recommend this to anyone &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This crimping iron is very good, doesn&#x27;t scorch, gets hot enough to do the job. Gets hot quickly, doesn&#x27;t snag or pull hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter after reading many reviews of other crimping irons.  It is small but does a good job styling her hair.  It does take a while though to do her whole head, as her hair is about to mid shoulder blade.</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing ! I have wanted a hair crimper for so long and I am so happy with my choice.  The crimps in my hair last for days and look so wonderful.  I have gotten so many compliments about my hair whenever I use this crimper.  This is a must buy item. :) You will love it as much as I do !!</li>
            <li> I used a crimping iron before on my wife&#x27;s hair back in the UK and wanted one as good as that. I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It says it takes 3-4 minutes to warm up but was hot enough after 2 minutes. I did each section of my wife&#x27;s hair by counting to 3 and then moved down to the next bit and it works very well. I found the 3 seconds, or slightly less than that was adequate for each section. I always love crimped hair on a girl and this style also puts a lot of volume into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 20 minutes to do all of her hair and the results were just as good as before and she is happy with it too. Looks to be a well made product and I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this got here so fast,  I love it,  its perfect, it&#x60;s just what I wanted. Nice product. works as specified.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this hair crimping iron. My husband finds crimped hair really attractive and so I got this to use when we have date nights. For the price it&#x27;s great. Is it the best crimper out there? I highly doubt it, but for the price this is a decent product. Would order again if I ever needed to.</li>
