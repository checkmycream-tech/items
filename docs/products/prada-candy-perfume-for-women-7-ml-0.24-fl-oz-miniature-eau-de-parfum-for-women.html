            <li>I was able to get it to linger longer if I dabbed my clothing with it</li>
            <li>SO I do love the way it smells</li>
            <li>A spray top I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>A signature fragrance for sure on mr.  </li>
            <li>I wish the bottle had a spray top for easier application.</li>
            <li>love the fragrant but needs a spray spout for easy application like the rest of the \\&quot;prada\\&quot; candy perfume bottles.</li>
            <li>but overall it is worth the money to have my wife smell so wonderful....</li>

            <li>Great for daily wear and even a night out.</li>
            <li>I was really happy to pay less for this fragrance than at the department store.</li>
            <li>Uniquely scented and lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it didn&#x27;t cost much so</li>
            <li>I also feel the scent is very light and doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more and bought a larger size.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t have a spray top.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and you definitely smell like candy.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells and am glad it&#x27;s not a spray as that would be wasting this expensive stuff!</li>
            <li>This perfume does not last that long, I love the smell of this perfume but it seems to last only a couple hours .</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a very heavy smell, as opposed to light and candy coated.</li>
            <li>The smell is great but the size of the bottle disappointed meðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡</li>

            <li> , It&#x27;s a very heavy smell, as opposed to light and candy coated.</li>
            <li> The smell is great but the size of the bottle disappointed meðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡</li>
            <li> the bottle could stand to be a little bigger and the price not so high.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday because it is subtle and not an overwhelming fragrance.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as it does when you buy from Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> but alas it was only a few extra hours.</li>
            <li> but it is watered down from what I tried at the store</li>
            <li> Also hate the top on it because you can&#x27;t close it tight and if it turns over it spills out.</li>
            <li> the size was large enough for me to try a little and then switch to another fragrance with out feeling bad about the purchase</li>
            <li> But this little bottle has lasted me for months</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s WAY too expensive for the short linger of this scent.</li>
            <li> Very very small size.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what I got.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fake!</li>

            <li> Smells really great! Good for summer however, I ordered perfume but meant to order the cologne spray. I prefer spray for its coverage.</li>
            <li> Smallest bottle in the world for 30$ damn</li>
            <li> Very very small size. The scent doesn&#x27;t last. I should have paid more and bought a larger size. This was does not spray you have to put it in with your hand. Too expensive for what I got. The scent is nice but it&#x27;s gone as soon as I put it on. Would not order this size again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE my Prada candy perfume.The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t have a spray top. But this little bottle has lasted me for months so I am content. It smells great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> love the fragrant but needs a spray spout for easy application like the rest of the \\&quot;prada\\&quot; candy perfume bottles.</li>
            <li> I like it but it is watered down from what I tried at the store</li>
            <li> Love this tiny bottle. I will have to go with the spray next time since you must pour this in your hand to apply....</li>
            <li> I think it is a fake! Smells nice when you put it on but 10 min. later you cant even smell it. Also hate the top on it because you can&#x27;t close it tight and if it turns over it spills out. This would not be good to take along with you on trips.</li>
            <li> The bottle will never be big enough!  Great scent! the size was large enough for me to try a little and then switch to another fragrance with out feeling bad about the purchase</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent BUT it doesn&#x27;t last on my skin. I was able to get it to linger longer if I dabbed my clothing with it but alas it was only a few extra hours. SO I do love the way it smells BUT it&#x27;s WAY too expensive for the short linger of this scent.</li>
            <li> subtle, sophisticated and sensuous fragrance...love it !!</li>
            <li> This perfume does not last that long, I love the smell of this perfume but it seems to last only a couple hours .</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like you are getting a bang for your buck..... Know quality over quantity</li>
            <li> A spray top I would have preferred. I also feel the scent is very light and doesn&#x27;t last at all. I also waited around a month for my item to arrive</li>
            <li> I liked the scent when I smelled it at Ulta, and even in the magazines but when I received this TINY bottle I was a bit upset, It&#x27;s a very heavy smell, as opposed to light and candy coated. Also, no spray so you have to dab it on. The aurora of the scent fades away within an hour or two, but your clothes still smell like it, so It&#x27;s nice if someone presses their face against your body. Probably won&#x27;t order online anymore,</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and am glad it&#x27;s not a spray as that would be wasting this expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for someone. She loved the smell but it made her skin itch. When she bought a bottle from Macy&#x27;s it didn&#x27;t make her skin itch. Also, the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as it does when you buy from Macy&#x27;s.  Luckily, it didn&#x27;t cost much so throwing it away wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> My favorite Prada scent!!!!! It&#x27;s sweet and you definitely smell like candy. Guys love it!</li>
            <li> I was really happy to pay less for this fragrance than at the department store. I love it, it was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> It is a light fragrance my husband&#x27;s sensitive nose can enjoy!!! I like it too! So wear it I will!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked the perfume.  I should have ordered a bigger size, but this fit the purpose.  The Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Uniquely scented and lasts the whole day.  A signature fragrance for sure on mr.  I thought I would use if on the weekends, but have ended up using it for workday wear.  One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> The smell is great but the size of the bottle disappointed meðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡</li>
            <li> This scent never disappoints! Great for daily wear and even a night out. I love the overtones of sweet coconut.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle had a spray top for easier application. The scent is yummy and seductive. I wear it everyday because it is subtle and not an overwhelming fragrance.</li>
            <li> Prada Candy at an affordable price. I was unable to obtain this size in the store but was glad to see it online.  The service was everything I could hope for.</li>
            <li> it is a nice smelling perfume. the bottle could stand to be a little bigger and the price not so high. but overall it is worth the money to have my wife smell so wonderful....</li>
