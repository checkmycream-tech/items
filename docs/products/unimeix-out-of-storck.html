            <li>but that&#x27;s an easy problem to fix.</li>
            <li>Those brushes are cheap material...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use them for what I originally wanted them for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about this product</li>
            <li>Everything is clean and the brushes have a plastic covering.</li>
            <li>You have to air them out a bit because they smell like the factory or plastic chemicals when they arrive other than that it is a very nice set and work well.</li>
            <li>The case is a great size to store in a drawer or take up a little space on a desk or shelve.</li>

            <li>The carrier itself looks a bit cheap and &amp;#34;foily&amp;#34; for lack of a better word, but she&#x27;s not a bridezilla or sisterzilla (ha), and I know she&#x27;ll like the little touch.</li>
            <li>The colors are fun colors, and the brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>The brush bristles are synthetic and are a vibrant purple color.</li>
            <li>its ok not so soft like other review said</li>
            <li>so of course i loved it,brush same very durable but my biggest complaint was the bag that came with</li>

            <li> Bought a few months ago and one of the brush heads is loose.</li>
            <li> it had a harsh checmical fume that im still</li>

            <li> Bought these for past Christmas still have them !</li>
            <li> Am disappointed with the quality of the larger brushes (including the fan brush).</li>
            <li> It stinks</li>

            <li> They are really soft brushes. I can&#x27;t use them for what I originally wanted them for but my niece is enjoying them.</li>
            <li> These are good makeup brushes. They came in this adorable magenta/purple brush roll. The inside of the brush roll is white with mesh pockets. The brush bristles are synthetic and are a vibrant purple color. The handles are a maroon color. They look great displayed on my vanity.  These brushes are not high end but are well made and can get the job done. I currently have them out on my vanity but because of the brush roll they can be packed up and taken on the go. I recommend this brush set to someone who is just starting out in makeup or to the intermediate person experimenting with different looks. You have a brush for every technique. My only complaint was the strong smell from packaging but it quickly went away after a good washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Beautiful.I totally love it.</li>
            <li> Love love love. It was delivered in just a day and the packaging was great. Quite funny it came in such a big box too. Downside is mine smelt a lot like paint? Wierd i know but it did! Other then the smell i love it there much bigger then i would have expected and they are just super soft as well!</li>
            <li> I will stick to my Mac brushes</li>
            <li> Good looking brushes but doesn&#x27;t hold makeup good , nor does it apply good , I even washed them when i received them and still nothing , wouldn&#x27;t recommended these at all</li>
            <li> Very nice for a teen gift or even a young mom</li>
            <li> purple is my favorite color so of course i loved it,brush same very durable but my biggest complaint was the bag that came with it had a harsh checmical fume that im still not sure why so i sat it out to air out hopefully the smell dimensihes after time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a surprise that this product has 5 star reviews. I received the package quickly and it was in perfect condition! I love the shiny, purple case and it is so convenient for storage and travel purposes! Everything is clean and the brushes have a plastic covering. The case is a great size to store in a drawer or take up a little space on a desk or shelve. I&#x27;m so excited about this product and I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it! Get this makeup brush set!!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m doing my sister&#x27;s makeup for her wedding and decided to buy these for her since purple is one of her wedding colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m happy with the look of the brushes. The carrier itself looks a bit cheap and &amp;#34;foily&amp;#34; for lack of a better word, but she&#x27;s not a bridezilla or sisterzilla (ha), and I know she&#x27;ll like the little touch. Purple brushes for her purple wedding. I&#x27;ll update this if she hates them lol.</li>
            <li> I love using these makeup brushes! I use them daily. When I first got them they did smell a bit weird but that&#x27;s an easy problem to fix. I washed mines. I reccoment them ! They&#x27;re also really nice.</li>
