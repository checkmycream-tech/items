    <ol>
            <li>Bee Bars are wonderful, but some people don&#x27;t care for the scented versions.  </li>
            <li>Well this is my go-to lotion because it doesn&#x27;t irritate, it moisturizes well, and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li>It is so great not to have sore hands anymore! !!</li>
            <li>perfect</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This one just smells like beeswax and allows me to share this great product with my scent-sensitive friends.</li>
            <li>They make a great gift.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>She still loved it and we don&#x27;t have to choke on the smell of it.</li>
            <li>It is a good skin protectant and makes my hands stay nice and supple.</li>
            <li>IT is my favorite!</li>
            <li>A friend showed me this product &amp; I had to get my own.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong, but is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell without being flowery or strong.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This works better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I make sure we never run out.  </li>
            <li>has asked me where they can buy more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this as a hand moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s unscented (if you want it that way, which I do----fragrances irritate my eczema) and contains pure, very effective ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Works wonderfully and really heals all those cracks and splits in dry hands.</li>
            <li>I preferred the scent of my original purchase.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li>It is great on really dry skin.</li>
            <li>But these bars are so beautiful when you first open the paper lining.  </li>
            <li>Works great for busy work hands, leaves a nice barrier to protect hands so they don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Positive: It was very moisturizing, and I enjoyed the tin it arrived in.</li>
            <li>but that is necessary for it to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>It also seems to only need to go on once a day for probably two or three days, and your hands feel better for a week or so (depending on</li>
            <li>I love it and cant get enough of it!</li>
            <li>and it really didn&#x27;t work very well on my skin and made my hands feel more dry.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a nice little tin to store it in.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I really like it.</li>
            <li>They last a long time, do not feel greasy, do a nice job.</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff, the only thing my husband will use for his dry cracked out hands!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this product, I used it alone with no other lotion</li>
            <li>Then I came up with the idea of using it along with my usual lotion (which is a good, high quality lotion, but just not heavy enough for Wisconsin winters!)  </li>
            <li>I found a recommendation online to try lotion bars and figured it was worth giving it a shot because of my really dry hands this winter.</li>
            <li>Not only does it heal, but it keeps hands soft and the cracks and splits from happening in the first place.</li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower and my skin stays soft all winter long.</li>
            <li>Within days my fingers were on the mend and within a week they were completely healed.  </li>
            <li>: It absolutely did not last six months!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years, it&#x27;s so much faster and easier to apply than regular lotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy scent at all.</li>
            <li>I also love it because once I&#x27;ve massaged it in, there&#x27;s just enough reside on my hands that I can run my fingers through my hair and it will tame fly-aways without leaving my hair all greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have found to really soften and heal my hands at the same time!</li>
            <li>I guess some people just need the water that&#x27;s contained in a lotion or cream and a super heavy moisturizer like this to help with extremely dry areas.  </li>
            <li>I went through several containers of pure coconut oil, which didn&#x27;t burn, but was too thin to be of any real help.</li>

            <li> Anyway, it is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that keeps my skin from getting dry and itchy in winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m think that because of this great product, my hands will make it through a brutal Wisconsin winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little waxy smelling, but if you are sensitive to perfumes it won&#x27;t set you off.</li>
            <li> especially some other stuff I purchased specifically for cracker fingers.  </li>
            <li> I am not exactly a &#x27;stoic male&#x27; but I am not a fan of hand lotion.</li>

            <li> I have extremely dry hands that I have a habit of picking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love what fragrance it does have, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant either.</li>
            <li> I get very dry skin and itchy legs in winter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even hold my mouse without my hand slipping off.</li>
            <li> It just has substance, unlike the watered down lotions you buy in a lot of stores.</li>
            <li> This one works just as well as the other two I&#x27;ve purchased but without the heavy fragrance.  </li>
            <li> his hands were healed after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> We live on a farm and every winter my husband gets cracked hands from the cold.  </li>
            <li> The waxy residue takes a little getting used to, but that residue soaks into your skin and STAYS!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little thick</li>
            <li> My mother adores this stuff, but she usually buys the vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Negative</li>
            <li> The smell of the bar was not particularly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Almost everything I need to use my fingers to do, cooking, typing, even washing my hands became impossible.</li>

            <li> I have had this product before and I love it. It goes on smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff, the only thing my husband will use for his dry cracked out hands!</li>
            <li> I get very dry skin and itchy legs in winter. This works better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Some people think it&#x27;s oily feeling--I don&#x27;t. It just has substance, unlike the watered down lotions you buy in a lot of stores. Anyway, it is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that keeps my skin from getting dry and itchy in winter. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is truly the ONLY stuff that works for me! Since moving back into a colder climate my fingers have been cracked and bleeding to the point the pain keeps me awake at night.  Almost everything I need to use my fingers to do, cooking, typing, even washing my hands became impossible. I remembered this stuff that I had bought from years ago and still happened to have the container so I bought 3 of them.  OMG! Within days my fingers were on the mend and within a week they were completely healed.  Nothing else worked and almost everything else burned like fire especially some other stuff I purchased specifically for cracker fingers.  I keep one of the Bee Bars at my bedside and one in my purse so that I can re-apply after I was my hands. Yes, it is a little thick but that is necessary for it to work it&#x27;s magic. I went through several containers of pure coconut oil, which didn&#x27;t burn, but was too thin to be of any real help. This is truly a miracle in a can!!!</li>
            <li> Negative: It absolutely did not last six months! It lasted for about a month with nearly daily use. The smell of the bar was not particularly pleasant. The bar was smaller then what I had in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive: It was very moisturizing, and I enjoyed the tin it arrived in.</li>
            <li> We live on a farm and every winter my husband gets cracked hands from the cold.  This stuff is fantastic! his hands were healed after just a few weeks.  Been using for 2 years now and I make sure we never run out.  I give these tins away as Christmas gifts and everyone has asked me where they can buy more.</li>
            <li> Bee Bars are wonderful, but some people don&#x27;t care for the scented versions.  This one just smells like beeswax and allows me to share this great product with my scent-sensitive friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have eczema and need a hand lotion during that day that helps my skin stay moisturized.  Well this is my go-to lotion because it doesn&#x27;t irritate, it moisturizes well, and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is a good skin protectant and makes my hands stay nice and supple. It is great on really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, it&#x27;s so much faster and easier to apply than regular lotion.  I use it right out of the shower and my skin stays soft all winter long.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly a &#x27;stoic male&#x27; but I am not a fan of hand lotion. Not sure why, exactly, but anyways... I found a recommendation online to try lotion bars and figured it was worth giving it a shot because of my really dry hands this winter. I have to admit, I really like it. I can put it on, and not feel all greasy like you can&#x27;t grab onto anything. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong, but is pleasant. It also seems to only need to go on once a day for probably two or three days, and your hands feel better for a week or so (depending on just how dry it is). I am definitely going to buy another bar when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product, I used it alone with no other lotion and it really didn&#x27;t work very well on my skin and made my hands feel more dry.  Then I came up with the idea of using it along with my usual lotion (which is a good, high quality lotion, but just not heavy enough for Wisconsin winters!)  I apply my lotion first and then scoop out a little of the Bee Bar and rub it into my cuticles and dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;Voila---beautifully moisturized hands!!  I guess some people just need the water that&#x27;s contained in a lotion or cream and a super heavy moisturizer like this to help with extremely dry areas.  I would highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s unscented (if you want it that way, which I do----fragrances irritate my eczema) and contains pure, very effective ingredients.  Thank you Honey House Naturals.  I&#x27;m think that because of this great product, my hands will make it through a brutal Wisconsin winter.</li>
            <li> This is the second of this brand of lotion bar I&#x27;ve had. They last a long time, do not feel greasy, do a nice job. Pleasant smell without being flowery or strong.</li>
            <li> This was a repeat purchase. I had used up a lotion bar from the same brand. This one was the Honey one...with no scent added. I didn&#x27;t like how honey smelling it was. I preferred the scent of my original purchase. But these bars are so beautiful when you first open the paper lining.  They make a great gift.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands that I have a habit of picking. This is the only product that I have found to really soften and heal my hands at the same time! It is so great not to have sore hands anymore! !!</li>
            <li> Wanted something for work - makes your hands too greasy to work. I can&#x27;t even hold my mouse without my hand slipping off.</li>
            <li> This one works just as well as the other two I&#x27;ve purchased but without the heavy fragrance.  I don&#x27;t love what fragrance it does have, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant either.</li>
            <li> I am always ordering this product.  IT is my favorite! I love it and cant get enough of it! perfect</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works wonderfully and really heals all those cracks and splits in dry hands. Not only does it heal, but it keeps hands soft and the cracks and splits from happening in the first place.</li>
            <li> Great product! The waxy residue takes a little getting used to, but that residue soaks into your skin and STAYS! Will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> A friend showed me this product &amp; I had to get my own. Works great for busy work hands, leaves a nice barrier to protect hands so they don&#x27;t dry out. Also can be used on feet, I would recommend this product to family &amp; friends!..</li>
            <li> I love this as a hand moisturizer.  I also love it because once I&#x27;ve massaged it in, there&#x27;s just enough reside on my hands that I can run my fingers through my hair and it will tame fly-aways without leaving my hair all greasy.  It&#x27;s a little waxy smelling, but if you are sensitive to perfumes it won&#x27;t set you off.</li>
            <li> My mother adores this stuff, but she usually buys the vanilla scent. Frankly I despise the smell of that stuff. So... this year we gave her a non scented one. She still loved it and we don&#x27;t have to choke on the smell of it. It&#x27;s not a heavy scent at all. The lack of scent means they didn&#x27;t add one - you still get the beeswax/honey smell to it. Comes in a nice little tin to store it in.</li>
