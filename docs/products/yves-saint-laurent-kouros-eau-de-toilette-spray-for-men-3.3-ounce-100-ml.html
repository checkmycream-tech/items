            <li> Hi, I am Wanda&#x27;s husband.  This cologne is hard to find in department stores, and is one I extremey like.  This cologne has been around a long time, but I constantly get complements whenever I wear it.  It&#x27;s a huge hit with the ladies!!!  I would recommend this cologne to any one young or old, expecially those who are trying to attract their lady friends.  And not trying to affend anyone, for those who swing the different way, I feel certain they would get the same response.  Good day!</li>
            <li> Use by husband.  His no. 1 pick.  He prefers this over any fragrance he has used.  Will choose again.  Great choice</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this one in department stores, thanks for carrying it online. Love this cologne on men...also makes a great gift</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic on my guy!</li>
            <li> I really like to smell it on my husband</li>
            <li> I received the perfume fast. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble.</li>
            <li> This Kouros spray is not the same product we&#x27;ve bought for the last 20 years.  The fragrance has changed and it&#x27;s not what the normal Kouros fragrance is.  We&#x27;re very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent products and delivery time.  I will definitely order again.  Do you carry Jean Nate?</li>
            <li> I order/buy this cologne for my husband every Christmas.  He gets so many compliments, and I love it.  A unique fragrance, do not need to use much, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Kouros is women killer.. this is all I can say!</li>
            <li> My husband loved it !</li>
            <li> Received a 3.3oz instead of 3.4</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time was as described.</li>
            <li> Men.....you can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance.  Every time my husband wears it, women ask what he&#x27;s wearing.  Too bad it&#x27;s being discontinued....or at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve heard.  YSL needs to reconsider if this is true.</li>
            <li> Excellent product i have loved this scent for years - sad to know it will no longer be made.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love the kouros by yves saint Laurent eau de toilette. I would like to order another if possibly</li>
            <li> KOUROS de Yves Saint Laurent Eau De Parfum Spray 3,3 oz Men</li>
            <li> If the men on this planet knew the affect this stuff has on woman they couldnt make enough.</li>
            <li> I have worn Kouros for 30 years and always keep at least one unopened spare. It has a unique aroma and is like no other product available. Recently it has become hard to find in stores and now I purchase it online causing me to stock pile two unopened spares.</li>
            <li> An excellent perfume. Recommended to all. Great setting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Success olfactory, for sure. Traditional that does success.&lt;br /&gt;Sucessfull</li>
            <li> This is a classic and i liked it, fresh and sweet sent, must have for the classic man in any house</li>
            <li> This perfume I use it for over 30 years and is very special for its scent and fixative in the body makes it a very elegant scent</li>
