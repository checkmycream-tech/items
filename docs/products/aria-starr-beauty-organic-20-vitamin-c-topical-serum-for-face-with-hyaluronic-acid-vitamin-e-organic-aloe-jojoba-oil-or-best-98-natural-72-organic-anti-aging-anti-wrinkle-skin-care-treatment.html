            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This vitamin c serum is amazing.</li>
            <li>My opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li>The glide on the skin is nice.</li>
            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion in return for candid feedback.  </li>
            <li>but that is also coupling it with water consumption, good sleep, and a healthy diet.  </li>
            <li>EFFECTIVE</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results from using this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product second one I&#x27;ve tried the best one</li>
            <li>The serum applies nicely.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I can see a difference in my skin texture and appearance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I did receive this product for a discounted rate for my honest &amp; unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I did purchase this item at a discount in return for an honest review.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky, massages in nicely.</li>
            <li>All thought and opinions are my own and not influenced by anyone.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very nicely and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of products and can&#x27;t say for certain how this would stand alone, but I do know that Vitamin C is one of the best ingredients for the skin and this formula seems to incorporate on of the more stable versions of that.</li>
            <li>These new serums with hyaluronic acid are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great product, love the texture and light scents.</li>
            <li>Great product doesn&#x27;t leave the face feeling oily also dries quickly.</li>

            <li>Let me tell you that I&#x27;ve never been more pleased with a Vitamin C serum!  </li>
            <li>Love it and will purchase more!</li>
            <li>I will say that the customer service is great, and that seems to be a rare commodity these days.  </li>
            <li>I really love that the product smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>I liked most is that it is helping my skin lose the freckles and used with my dermaroller</li>
            <li>and Surprisingly it did gave me a glowing effect I noticed a smooth finish on my face.</li>
            <li>However, it does provide a nice refreshing feel and I have confidence that it will produce results once used longer.</li>
            <li>and if I can afford more after bottle runs out I won&#x27;t attempt to make my own</li>
            <li>I have very fine wrinkles</li>
            <li>It came quickly and this product is amazing!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this along with my other moisturizers and creams and it was the perfect addition.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Also, the founder of Aria Starr Beauty was very quick to answer questions I had.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;labels were easy to read and understand</li>
            <li>Comes with a pump (not a dropper) for easy application.&lt;br /&gt;POWERFULLY</li>
            <li>Then easily apply your moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li>This smells like strong alcohol.</li>
            <li>I liked this very much.</li>
            <li>and when you are done make sure you moisturize right after!  </li>
            <li>It gives my skin enough moisture and a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>It is easy to appy, feels light on my skin.  </li>

            <li>i see huge improvement for my face.  </li>
            <li>Time will tell if there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliment about my skin and how fresh I look.</li>
            <li>Light weight and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>ADVANCED FORMULA</li>
            <li>Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review.</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff it brightens and makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li>Product was smooth and wasn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy diminshed wrinkle formation, even skin tone, and improved smooth texture.</li>
            <li>ADVANCED FORMULA</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic,  works as well as the $250.00 two part C serum I used to buy from my  esthetician.</li>
            <li>but manages to be a smooth serum with the Vitamin C.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a great Seeum with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>This serum is sticky and stays on top of skin instead of being absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Amazing customer service with follow up emails, Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is not an oily serum and works as a daily moisturizer, great for combination skin like myself.</li>
            <li>However, I was happy with the retinol serum and was looking for a vitamin C serum, so it only made sense to try Aria Starr again.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and lightly..does not leave face oily</li>
            <li>I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li>At under $20, this is a great deal and should last you quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Great product at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum, nice blend of vitamin c &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Items worked great, terrific value thank you!</li>
            <li>The serum goes on smooth without any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED A FREE PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UNBIASED REVIEW</li>
            <li>but once I diluted it in some lotion it worked good to make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>However, I have now come to the age of becoming more intense with my routine and adding firming, skin repair and pigmentation lightening products.  </li>
            <li>applying this product followed by retinol is super easy.</li>
            <li>No harsh smell and has a super handy dispensing top.</li>
            <li>And the results after regular use are amazing!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this</li>
            <li>Love the all natural health benefits,so far I feel great</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light, fairly citrusy and barely noticeable and when applied to the skin fades quickly to start working immediately.</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter, healthy  and is sure soft.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I&#x27;m so pleased with these 2 Aria Starr serums I&#x27;m going to try their mask next.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT smell pleasant enough to wear on my face.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely and works nicely with other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This serum has a very watery texture so it is perfect for my extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many serums before and this was pure liquid like water.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my skin feel so refreshed and clean before I add my make up :)</li>
            <li>This one is pretty good for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this so far, last time I bought the best seller one, and it was like 10 dollars more, and so far I havent noticed a huge difference between them except the smell a tad.</li>
            <li>I had read that antioxidants, especially vitamin C, were good for this.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft and leaves a bit of a coating on it I believe as it kind of unwrinkles the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Much more gentle on my face than another brand I had tried.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell what the results might be but feels like a nice product.  </li>
            <li>far as the smell goes, I like it kind of reminds me of a lavender scent for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency</li>
            <li>Need to use much longer to see better results.  </li>
            <li>It is practically fragrance free, easily absorbed without leaving any sticky residue.</li>
            <li>Its so smooth on your face, not grease at all, feels I&#x27;m nurturing my skin with all the right ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I do feel my face feeling more tight and naturally bright.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and does not leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>This is isn&#x27;t a lotion, you need to and absolutely should use a moisturizer over this.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good sensitive skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After cleansing my skin, I apply this Vitamin C serum all over my face, neck, and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; -- it absorbs quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin with no sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, and has an overall more healthy look and feel.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the blue bottle to create preservation for shelf life and the fact that instead of a dropper like most, this serum uses a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>better than some high end departmental stores products that I have used</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this serum without any worries of break outs, which I had experienced with big name brands at the local stores.</li>
            <li>Dark spots are greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>Love my new oil/serum vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>Absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I started using it and the first thing I noticed was my face was smoother!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably put as much in the sink as I&#x27;ve put on my skin!!</li>
            <li>It really helps with fine lines, and skin discoloration.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin tone and plan to continue using for more results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really enjoying this product so far.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far that I have tested.  </li>
            <li>It smells more of like a natural oil.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is really nice Vitamin C facial serum.  </li>
            <li>The smell goes away after it&#x27;s absorbed in the skin,</li>
            <li>Every penny is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum on my face for over a month and my skin looks healthy and feels soft.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth a try</li>
            <li>I highly enjoyed using  the  Professional Strength Vitamin C &#x27;</li>
            <li>great consistency, absorbs easily, no oily residue.</li>
            <li>other than that seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>I use this right before applying retinol.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>So that being said, I try to be careful because I really do like this C serum, and honestly I will buy it again!</li>
            <li>It also gets absorbed by your skin super fast</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this one, and like the retinol serum, it&#x27;s a great value for the money as a little goes a long way (even using it twice daily).  </li>
            <li>It dries fast, so work quickly to smear it around your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really lightweight and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had great results using this product on my hands and forearms, to get rid of the nasty results of sun overexposure (LOL!).  </li>
            <li>It has a very silky feeling when I apply it, and absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has been about 6 days and nights of applying after gentle face washing and then applying the Aria Starr super retinol serum.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel clean and refreshed and very soft!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in sun spots, but not as much in my newly developing crows feet ;), been using Vitamin C serum for about 2 months.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>my wife like it very much.</li>
            <li>I found my skin to be more youthful, smooth and even than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>The product goes on very easy and it does not take much to cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  still waiting for better results since it&#x27;s only been 1 week of use.</li>
            <li>Now I do recommend that you read directions, the first night I did not</li>
            <li>I love this product and any organic vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used (at this point I&#x27;ve used 3 different ones).  </li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying any sort of</li>
            <li>The first Vitamin C serum that worked for me.</li>
            <li>Seems to splash everywhere, unless you first apply it to your hands then work it in to your face.</li>
            <li>But the counter tops are completely wrinkle free....</li>
            <li>and I will get back to give more comment about the product.</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite facial serums I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I really like this serum!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li>when I did one pump the first time.</li>
            <li>am really liking this a lot!</li>
            <li>I just applied it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>Got this for $1, thanks!</li>
            <li>Thinner than some of the more expensive serums I&#x27;ve tried, and other than being a great moisturizer, haven&#x27;t experienced notable benefits, and I definitely don&#x27;t look 10yrs younger (wish I did).</li>
            <li>…You are going to love how your skin feels after just a few days of using this serum…I can already notice reduced fine lines and wrinkles, brighter and smoother skin and an even complexion after purchasing it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that say it smells nice</li>
            <li>Nice with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>In many instances, a long-lasting radiant natural healthy glow to their previous age-related and sun damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;LOOK</li>
            <li>It gave my skin a glow and made it feel more smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see the spots are fading slowly within a week, very impressive.</li>
            <li>As with any of these types of wonder serums, cleanse well, use toner, apply small amount of serum and when it is dry, follow up with a moisturizer for best results.</li>
            <li>thanks so much !</li>
            <li>Aria was very helpful,  informative and seems actively interested in both her customers and her product&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh new and AWAKE.</li>
            <li>It really works as long as you apply sunscreen during day time because this makes your skin more prone to sunburn.</li>
            <li>I love it and even use it on my hands, dry elbows and feet</li>
            <li>Turned cloudy rather quickly indicating old vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel super soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li>and we were very impressed...not sure about the long term effects</li>
            <li>I cup one hand and pump once into it and then apply with the fingers on my other hand-works fine, easy, and no waste!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine overall</li>
            <li>I really like this product the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, it seems to be making my skin softer and diminishing the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>So far so good - I like the way this serum has a little body to it; makes it easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s too soon to see results-and I&#x27;m still young-ish enough where I am just starting to get fine lines, but so far it does make my face look brighter and more even, so</li>
            <li>Great product my husband uses all the time and he has no complaints&amp;#34; would definitely recommend this product to other people !!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>This product brightens skin, through intense moisture and antioxidant power.</li>
            <li>Fast ship.  </li>
            <li>Very nourishing, organic serum.</li>
            <li>I wanted the ease of the pump, but the issue I&#x27;m having is the pump isn&#x27;t a smooth and fluid movement.  </li>
            <li>Really noticed changes in the lines and pore size</li>
            <li>It absolutely renews your skin...</li>
            <li>Very cooling feel as well.</li>
            <li>Fast forward about a week</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s really getting nourished.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has really brightened up.</li>
            <li>To me it is very necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but thanks to this product my skin doesn&#x27;t reflect my age -- or the fact that, as an adolescent and young adult, I was rarely careful about using sun block despite the fact that I have fair skin that burns rather than tans.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It has never broken me out</li>
            <li>I really lpved how it felt and it brought out that radience on my skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I use it with the retinol at night and with a gentle moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li>If you need an anti aging serum that really works, this is the one.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>it dries so fast.</li>
            <li>I use about 5 pumps and spread it fast.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs very nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>it dries fast as it soaks into skin..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much smoother than ever.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really have time to spread it around my face</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast so</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling smooth, fuller and nourished.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth, I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It works better than other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>I love the ratio of HA added to this serum with the Vitamin C and its other skin nourishing and repair ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this serum a few days, but really like everything about its easy application and ingredients, and am anticipating noticeable results in a couple more weeks.  </li>
            <li>It will dry out some of your more sensitive skin, but it says to use a moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I have been using various Vitamin C serums for the past year and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this a few days now, twice a day, morning and night, it goes on smooth, dries quick, and goes well alone</li>
            <li>was very excited to try this super vitamin c serum by Aria Starr Beauty because mixed with the other serum they gave me</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>My face feels firmer, and I have noticed less lines and a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>This product not only did not cause irritation, but it cleared up my dryness and now the skin is soft and looks smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>I just bought another brand, mainly because it came in a 4 ounce bottle, but I do not like it at all.</li>
            <li>that just isn&#x27;t realistic.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the product said organic, but upon further inspection, it&#x27;s not purely organic.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>It is highly absorbable and it does not break my face out in any way.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and also, I will never be without it.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend the seller who contacted me after purchase and before the serum arrived to address any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something a little more viscous.</li>
            <li>I need to use it a little longer to be able to tell a deference.</li>
            <li>I expected some burning or a light rash to appear but nothing like that happened.</li>
            <li>So far I am really liking this serum.</li>
            <li>Just after a few days my skin looks more even</li>
            <li>My face feels more firm.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few more days of use.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and more hydrated after using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li>I can say that it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn at all and feels nice going on, not greasy or thick</li>
            <li>This is not &#x27;typical over the counter, drug store moisturizer&#x27; - this is a product that really helps.  </li>
            <li>I think the ingredients look good but the number one ingredient is &#x27;organic herbal infusion&#x27; which seems a bit mysterious to me, but 2nd and 3rd ingredients are aloe and vitamin C respectively.</li>
            <li>It did dry with a mild stiff feeling that was immediately alleviated by applying my nightly moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother, is much healthier, and my complexion has definitely improved!</li>
            <li>I received The Professional Strength Organic 20% Vitamin C Topical Serum complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is acne prone.</li>
            <li>When using the dropper I noticed how silky and soft it is!</li>
            <li>I can see that the fine lines around my eyes are smoothing out, and I would say they are somewhat less noticeable since my skin is tighter.</li>
            <li>Skin is softer now and fine lines around eyes and mouth are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>- &amp;#34; I used this product last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>Fine lines around the eyes and mouth are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Was a little strong</li>
            <li>Interestingly, the one part of my face that has always been very oily and plagued with blackheads, my nose and central forehead, seems to have balanced out as well, and is less greasy but still soft with far fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and when I try out new skincare products I make sure to test on a small portion of my skin.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way which makes it cost effective.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive and break out prone skin had no problems accepting this new product.</li>
            <li>Much of this depends on the condition of your skin, but realize the true benefit is in using this product over the course of your life (i.e. not having your skin dried out by chemical laden anti-aging products).  </li>
            <li>The fluid serum has a good ability to flow and spread, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I can hardly wait to see even more results the longer</li>
            <li>It helps to smooth out rough skins and gives you the glow you had when you were younger.</li>
            <li>I do like it and with only using in for a few days, I can&#x27;t really give an accurate review.</li>
            <li>This helps clear up the marks faster.</li>
            <li>The texture and consistency is almost like a clear water.</li>
            <li>It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>Feels light, did not feel heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>So far no irritation to my skin and will continue to use</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Professional Strength &#x27; Vitamin C [20%] Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Vit E Review by  AriaStarrBeauty</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth without a heavy or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>YOUNG AGAIN</li>
            <li>IN THE USA with 98% Natural and 72% Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li>and under my night and day cream, with no irritation at all, even near my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out and my skin tone is starting to evening out.</li>
            <li>I guess that my skin is too sensitive, broke out.</li>
            <li>and it hydrate the skin, protect it and makes it so soft.</li>
            <li>In 3 weeks, I can really see a big difference...</li>
            <li>so it surprised me when I pumped it out.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The serum is usable on sensitive skin and is made in the USA with FDA approved</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it will help, but it does keep my skin looking radiant as 65 year old grandma.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the serum once so far, I&#x27;ll update this in a few months to give a better account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>[20%] Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Vit E from AriaStarrBeauty  because it is a complete anti-aging solution in one bottle</li>
            <li>I had minor hyperpigmentation from a recent breakout and those spots are fading quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivered to you in a dark glass bottle to limit exposure to light for ultimate preservation.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite thing is the fact that it goes on smoothly and leaves no greasy mess behind.</li>
            <li>The texture is very clean and only took a small amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short while, but so far I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I have dark spots like a very light french mustache above my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Aria Starr Beauty Super Vitamin C serum for a little over a week now</li>
            <li>I really love the serum, but the pump is a little rough.</li>
            <li>Oh yes Sun screen 30 up broad spectrum after applying in the morning.</li>
            <li>Made my face feel very soft but not sure it&#x27;s right for someone whose acne prone</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>It glides on my skin and is clearly making a big diference already!</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY since vitamin c serum can dry out your skin (and mine is super dry already)</li>
            <li>my skin reacts to it very well and will continue to use until bottle is empty</li>
            <li>So far, though, we&#x27;ve been using the serum daily and nightly.  </li>
            <li>Works as well as a similar one costing nearly 3 times as this one.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but was surprised at how fluid it was.</li>
            <li>But after few minutes of letting it absorbed you can feel the softness of your skin.</li>
            <li>found within a few weeks that my skin was smoother, more even, brighter and my pores were less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It comes in a dark  blue glass bottle, so it limits light into it to keep it at it potency as long as possible.</li>
            <li>Since I cannot use it everyday because it dried out my skin; mostly because I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>It tends to get a little sticky when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>Although I have not been using it long enough to see any changes in my skin it does make my skin very soft and it feels firmer.</li>
            <li>Skin is much smoother and dark</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a decent product.</li>
            <li>The only down side is the pump it squirts across your whole hand</li>
            <li>The area&#x27;s directly under both of my eyes are chronically very dry and flaky, but most everything I try there causes extreme irritation being such thin, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

            <li> My opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li> The glide on the skin is nice.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion in return for candid feedback.  </li>
            <li> but that is also coupling it with water consumption, good sleep, and a healthy diet.  </li>
            <li> EFFECTIVE</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the results from using this product.  </li>

            <li> I did purchase this item at a discount in return for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky, massages in nicely.</li>
            <li> All thought and opinions are my own and not influenced by anyone.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very nicely and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of products and can&#x27;t say for certain how this would stand alone, but I do know that Vitamin C is one of the best ingredients for the skin and this formula seems to incorporate on of the more stable versions of that.</li>
            <li> These new serums with hyaluronic acid are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the texture and light scents.</li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t leave the face feeling oily also dries quickly.</li>

            <li> Let me tell you that I&#x27;ve never been more pleased with a Vitamin C serum!  </li>
            <li> Love it and will purchase more!</li>
            <li> I will say that the customer service is great, and that seems to be a rare commodity these days.  </li>
            <li> I really love that the product smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> I liked most is that it is helping my skin lose the freckles and used with my dermaroller</li>
            <li> and Surprisingly it did gave me a glowing effect I noticed a smooth finish on my face.</li>
            <li> However, it does provide a nice refreshing feel and I have confidence that it will produce results once used longer.</li>
            <li> and if I can afford more after bottle runs out I won&#x27;t attempt to make my own</li>
            <li> I have very fine wrinkles</li>

            <li> Lightweight, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Also, the founder of Aria Starr Beauty was very quick to answer questions I had.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;labels were easy to read and understand</li>
            <li> Comes with a pump (not a dropper) for easy application.&lt;br /&gt;POWERFULLY</li>
            <li> Then easily apply your moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li> This smells like strong alcohol.</li>
            <li> I liked this very much.</li>

            <li> ADVANCED FORMULA</li>
            <li> Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff it brightens and makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> Product was smooth and wasn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy diminshed wrinkle formation, even skin tone, and improved smooth texture.</li>
            <li> ADVANCED FORMULA</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic,  works as well as the $250.00 two part C serum I used to buy from my  esthetician.</li>
            <li> but manages to be a smooth serum with the Vitamin C.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a great Seeum with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> This serum is sticky and stays on top of skin instead of being absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Amazing customer service with follow up emails, Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is not an oily serum and works as a daily moisturizer, great for combination skin like myself.</li>
            <li> However, I was happy with the retinol serum and was looking for a vitamin C serum, so it only made sense to try Aria Starr again.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and lightly..does not leave face oily</li>
            <li> I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li> At under $20, this is a great deal and should last you quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Great product at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, nice blend of vitamin c &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Items worked great, terrific value thank you!</li>
            <li> The serum goes on smooth without any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED A FREE PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UNBIASED REVIEW</li>
            <li> but once I diluted it in some lotion it worked good to make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> However, I have now come to the age of becoming more intense with my routine and adding firming, skin repair and pigmentation lightening products.  </li>
            <li> applying this product followed by retinol is super easy.</li>
            <li> No harsh smell and has a super handy dispensing top.</li>
            <li> And the results after regular use are amazing!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this</li>
            <li> Love the all natural health benefits,so far I feel great</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light, fairly citrusy and barely noticeable and when applied to the skin fades quickly to start working immediately.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter, healthy  and is sure soft.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;m so pleased with these 2 Aria Starr serums I&#x27;m going to try their mask next.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT smell pleasant enough to wear on my face.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely and works nicely with other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This serum has a very watery texture so it is perfect for my extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many serums before and this was pure liquid like water.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my skin feel so refreshed and clean before I add my make up :)</li>
            <li> This one is pretty good for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I like this so far, last time I bought the best seller one, and it was like 10 dollars more, and so far I havent noticed a huge difference between them except the smell a tad.</li>
            <li> I had read that antioxidants, especially vitamin C, were good for this.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft and leaves a bit of a coating on it I believe as it kind of unwrinkles the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Much more gentle on my face than another brand I had tried.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell what the results might be but feels like a nice product.  </li>
            <li> far as the smell goes, I like it kind of reminds me of a lavender scent for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency</li>
            <li> Need to use much longer to see better results.  </li>
            <li> It is practically fragrance free, easily absorbed without leaving any sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Its so smooth on your face, not grease at all, feels I&#x27;m nurturing my skin with all the right ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I do feel my face feeling more tight and naturally bright.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and does not leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> This is isn&#x27;t a lotion, you need to and absolutely should use a moisturizer over this.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good sensitive skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After cleansing my skin, I apply this Vitamin C serum all over my face, neck, and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; -- it absorbs quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin with no sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, and has an overall more healthy look and feel.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the blue bottle to create preservation for shelf life and the fact that instead of a dropper like most, this serum uses a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> better than some high end departmental stores products that I have used</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this serum without any worries of break outs, which I had experienced with big name brands at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Dark spots are greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> Love my new oil/serum vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> Absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I started using it and the first thing I noticed was my face was smoother!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably put as much in the sink as I&#x27;ve put on my skin!!</li>
            <li> It really helps with fine lines, and skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin tone and plan to continue using for more results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really enjoying this product so far.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far that I have tested.  </li>
            <li> It smells more of like a natural oil.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is really nice Vitamin C facial serum.  </li>
            <li> The smell goes away after it&#x27;s absorbed in the skin,</li>
            <li> Every penny is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum on my face for over a month and my skin looks healthy and feels soft.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth a try</li>
            <li> I highly enjoyed using  the  Professional Strength Vitamin C &#x27;</li>
            <li> great consistency, absorbs easily, no oily residue.</li>
            <li> other than that seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I use this right before applying retinol.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> So that being said, I try to be careful because I really do like this C serum, and honestly I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> It also gets absorbed by your skin super fast</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this one, and like the retinol serum, it&#x27;s a great value for the money as a little goes a long way (even using it twice daily).  </li>
            <li> It dries fast, so work quickly to smear it around your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really lightweight and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had great results using this product on my hands and forearms, to get rid of the nasty results of sun overexposure (LOL!).  </li>
            <li> It has a very silky feeling when I apply it, and absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has been about 6 days and nights of applying after gentle face washing and then applying the Aria Starr super retinol serum.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel clean and refreshed and very soft!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in sun spots, but not as much in my newly developing crows feet ;), been using Vitamin C serum for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> my wife like it very much.</li>
            <li> I found my skin to be more youthful, smooth and even than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> The product goes on very easy and it does not take much to cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  still waiting for better results since it&#x27;s only been 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> Now I do recommend that you read directions, the first night I did not</li>
            <li> I love this product and any organic vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used (at this point I&#x27;ve used 3 different ones).  </li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying any sort of</li>
            <li> The first Vitamin C serum that worked for me.</li>
            <li> Seems to splash everywhere, unless you first apply it to your hands then work it in to your face.</li>
            <li> But the counter tops are completely wrinkle free....</li>
            <li> and I will get back to give more comment about the product.</li>
            <li> It made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite facial serums I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I really like this serum!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> when I did one pump the first time.</li>
            <li> am really liking this a lot!</li>
            <li> I just applied it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> Got this for $1, thanks!</li>
            <li> Thinner than some of the more expensive serums I&#x27;ve tried, and other than being a great moisturizer, haven&#x27;t experienced notable benefits, and I definitely don&#x27;t look 10yrs younger (wish I did).</li>
            <li> …You are going to love how your skin feels after just a few days of using this serum…I can already notice reduced fine lines and wrinkles, brighter and smoother skin and an even complexion after purchasing it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that say it smells nice</li>
            <li> Nice with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> In many instances, a long-lasting radiant natural healthy glow to their previous age-related and sun damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;LOOK</li>
            <li> It gave my skin a glow and made it feel more smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see the spots are fading slowly within a week, very impressive.</li>
            <li> As with any of these types of wonder serums, cleanse well, use toner, apply small amount of serum and when it is dry, follow up with a moisturizer for best results.</li>
            <li> thanks so much !</li>
            <li> Aria was very helpful,  informative and seems actively interested in both her customers and her product&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh new and AWAKE.</li>
            <li> It really works as long as you apply sunscreen during day time because this makes your skin more prone to sunburn.</li>
            <li> I love it and even use it on my hands, dry elbows and feet</li>
            <li> Turned cloudy rather quickly indicating old vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel super soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li> and we were very impressed...not sure about the long term effects</li>
            <li> I cup one hand and pump once into it and then apply with the fingers on my other hand-works fine, easy, and no waste!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine overall</li>
            <li> I really like this product the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, it seems to be making my skin softer and diminishing the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> So far so good - I like the way this serum has a little body to it; makes it easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s too soon to see results-and I&#x27;m still young-ish enough where I am just starting to get fine lines, but so far it does make my face look brighter and more even, so</li>
            <li> Great product my husband uses all the time and he has no complaints&amp;#34; would definitely recommend this product to other people !!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> This product brightens skin, through intense moisture and antioxidant power.</li>
            <li> Fast ship.  </li>
            <li> Very nourishing, organic serum.</li>
            <li> I wanted the ease of the pump, but the issue I&#x27;m having is the pump isn&#x27;t a smooth and fluid movement.  </li>
            <li> Really noticed changes in the lines and pore size</li>
            <li> It absolutely renews your skin...</li>
            <li> Very cooling feel as well.</li>
            <li> Fast forward about a week</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s really getting nourished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has really brightened up.</li>
            <li> To me it is very necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but thanks to this product my skin doesn&#x27;t reflect my age -- or the fact that, as an adolescent and young adult, I was rarely careful about using sun block despite the fact that I have fair skin that burns rather than tans.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It has never broken me out</li>
            <li> I really lpved how it felt and it brought out that radience on my skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I use it with the retinol at night and with a gentle moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li> If you need an anti aging serum that really works, this is the one.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> it dries so fast.</li>
            <li> I use about 5 pumps and spread it fast.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs very nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> it dries fast as it soaks into skin..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smoother than ever.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really have time to spread it around my face</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast so</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling smooth, fuller and nourished.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth, I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It works better than other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I love the ratio of HA added to this serum with the Vitamin C and its other skin nourishing and repair ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this serum a few days, but really like everything about its easy application and ingredients, and am anticipating noticeable results in a couple more weeks.  </li>
            <li> It will dry out some of your more sensitive skin, but it says to use a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have been using various Vitamin C serums for the past year and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few days now, twice a day, morning and night, it goes on smooth, dries quick, and goes well alone</li>
            <li> was very excited to try this super vitamin c serum by Aria Starr Beauty because mixed with the other serum they gave me</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> My face feels firmer, and I have noticed less lines and a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> This product not only did not cause irritation, but it cleared up my dryness and now the skin is soft and looks smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> I just bought another brand, mainly because it came in a 4 ounce bottle, but I do not like it at all.</li>
            <li> that just isn&#x27;t realistic.  </li>
            <li> I liked that the product said organic, but upon further inspection, it&#x27;s not purely organic.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> It is highly absorbable and it does not break my face out in any way.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and also, I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend the seller who contacted me after purchase and before the serum arrived to address any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more viscous.</li>
            <li> I need to use it a little longer to be able to tell a deference.</li>
            <li> I expected some burning or a light rash to appear but nothing like that happened.</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this serum.</li>
            <li> Just after a few days my skin looks more even</li>
            <li> My face feels more firm.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few more days of use.</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and more hydrated after using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I can say that it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn at all and feels nice going on, not greasy or thick</li>
            <li> This is not &#x27;typical over the counter, drug store moisturizer&#x27; - this is a product that really helps.  </li>
            <li> I think the ingredients look good but the number one ingredient is &#x27;organic herbal infusion&#x27; which seems a bit mysterious to me, but 2nd and 3rd ingredients are aloe and vitamin C respectively.</li>
            <li> It did dry with a mild stiff feeling that was immediately alleviated by applying my nightly moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother, is much healthier, and my complexion has definitely improved!</li>
            <li> I received The Professional Strength Organic 20% Vitamin C Topical Serum complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is acne prone.</li>
            <li> When using the dropper I noticed how silky and soft it is!</li>
            <li> I can see that the fine lines around my eyes are smoothing out, and I would say they are somewhat less noticeable since my skin is tighter.</li>
            <li> Skin is softer now and fine lines around eyes and mouth are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> - &amp;#34; I used this product last night for the first time.</li>
            <li> Fine lines around the eyes and mouth are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Was a little strong</li>
            <li> Interestingly, the one part of my face that has always been very oily and plagued with blackheads, my nose and central forehead, seems to have balanced out as well, and is less greasy but still soft with far fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and when I try out new skincare products I make sure to test on a small portion of my skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which makes it cost effective.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive and break out prone skin had no problems accepting this new product.</li>
            <li> Much of this depends on the condition of your skin, but realize the true benefit is in using this product over the course of your life (i.e. not having your skin dried out by chemical laden anti-aging products).  </li>
            <li> The fluid serum has a good ability to flow and spread, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to see even more results the longer</li>
            <li> It helps to smooth out rough skins and gives you the glow you had when you were younger.</li>
            <li> I do like it and with only using in for a few days, I can&#x27;t really give an accurate review.</li>
            <li> This helps clear up the marks faster.</li>
            <li> The texture and consistency is almost like a clear water.</li>
            <li> It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> Feels light, did not feel heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> So far no irritation to my skin and will continue to use</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Professional Strength &#x27; Vitamin C [20%] Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Vit E Review by  AriaStarrBeauty</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth without a heavy or sticky feeling.</li>

            <li> IN THE USA with 98% Natural and 72% Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li> and under my night and day cream, with no irritation at all, even near my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out and my skin tone is starting to evening out.</li>
            <li> I guess that my skin is too sensitive, broke out.</li>
            <li> and it hydrate the skin, protect it and makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> In 3 weeks, I can really see a big difference...</li>
            <li> so it surprised me when I pumped it out.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The serum is usable on sensitive skin and is made in the USA with FDA approved</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it will help, but it does keep my skin looking radiant as 65 year old grandma.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the serum once so far, I&#x27;ll update this in a few months to give a better account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> [20%] Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Vit E from AriaStarrBeauty  because it is a complete anti-aging solution in one bottle</li>
            <li> I had minor hyperpigmentation from a recent breakout and those spots are fading quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivered to you in a dark glass bottle to limit exposure to light for ultimate preservation.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite thing is the fact that it goes on smoothly and leaves no greasy mess behind.</li>
            <li> The texture is very clean and only took a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short while, but so far I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I have dark spots like a very light french mustache above my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Aria Starr Beauty Super Vitamin C serum for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> I really love the serum, but the pump is a little rough.</li>
            <li> Oh yes Sun screen 30 up broad spectrum after applying in the morning.</li>
            <li> Made my face feel very soft but not sure it&#x27;s right for someone whose acne prone</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> It glides on my skin and is clearly making a big diference already!</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY since vitamin c serum can dry out your skin (and mine is super dry already)</li>
            <li> my skin reacts to it very well and will continue to use until bottle is empty</li>
            <li> So far, though, we&#x27;ve been using the serum daily and nightly.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as a similar one costing nearly 3 times as this one.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but was surprised at how fluid it was.</li>
            <li> But after few minutes of letting it absorbed you can feel the softness of your skin.</li>
            <li> found within a few weeks that my skin was smoother, more even, brighter and my pores were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It comes in a dark  blue glass bottle, so it limits light into it to keep it at it potency as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Since I cannot use it everyday because it dried out my skin; mostly because I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It tends to get a little sticky when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> Although I have not been using it long enough to see any changes in my skin it does make my skin very soft and it feels firmer.</li>
            <li> Skin is much smoother and dark</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a decent product.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the pump it squirts across your whole hand</li>
            <li> The area&#x27;s directly under both of my eyes are chronically very dry and flaky, but most everything I try there causes extreme irritation being such thin, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> Do not see any significant change in the dark circle(using over the past 4 weeks).</li>
            <li> Have only been using for one week so no major change yet</li>
            <li> Only 2-3 pumps are needed so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product seems to be able to bring everything into balance without being heavy, greasy or irritating.</li>
            <li> but my face is a little sensitive to this product, especially my nose.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this product is it is very runny, almost like water,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it a positive or negative review.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product, but you might be if your expectations are to magically have new skin in 3 days.  </li>
            <li> This serum is different than any other vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I would definitely try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> chose this vitamin C serum above other options because it has a pump, this preserves vitamin C integrity as exposure to air</li>
            <li> the softer it becomes and the fewer dry patches remain.</li>
            <li> Used for my dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping long term use will help lighten dark spots but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Only been using for a few days and starting to see a difference!</li>
            <li> I particularly like the fluidity and absorption of this product, some can be thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> The smell could be better, but it&#x27;s not too unpleasant.</li>
            <li> the swelling goes down or it disappears, depending on how big your pimple is..</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long ways with this serum.</li>
            <li> and I am just starting to notice a slight difference in evened out skin tone.</li>
            <li> The skin on the rest of my face has become significantly less red and the longer I use the serum</li>
            <li> And I think I can  see a slight  lightning, only time will tell.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily with just a few drops and absorbs without leaving any greasy mess behind.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though, my daughter&#x27;s skin hasn&#x27;t improved at all and in fact seems to have broken out a little more than normal.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin a little oily so I only use it at night time.</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ll add is that natural products are about longevity, some experience a rejuvenation in a matter of a few days where others take a little longer to see the changes.  </li>
            <li> My skin is actually smoother after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> Sort of a bitter orange smell.</li>
            <li> so if you see dryness, you are using a product your face is not ready for.  </li>
            <li> Be careful</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> have the same complaint about it, and I don&#x27;t know why it works differently than the pump on the retinol serum, but I have to pump it 5 or 6 times to get what should amount to product from 2 pumps, and you have to be careful because it will go where you don&#x27;t want it to.  </li>
            <li> I have spent  a lot of money on things that did nothing.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful when u pump it out</li>
            <li> I would have given it five stars but it does have a little bit of a strange smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn, has other nutritive carrier oils with it</li>
            <li> You may want to begin using this once per day or every other day, working up to twice per day.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and this is helpful to have all the ingredients in one thing.</li>
            <li> I have used other products</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product has helped my skin tone a lot.</li>
            <li> Compared to other Vitamin C Serums I&#x27;ve used this was a thinner serum</li>
            <li> I plan on applying that on every other night.</li>
            <li> QUALITY form of active, bioavailable Organic 20% Vitamin C Serum + 11% Vegan Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> This serum is the highest quality out there of active, bioavailable organic 20% Vitamin C Serum plus 11% Vegan Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Small amount went a long way.</li>
            <li> I am still using it twice daily and will give it at least 2 months before I give up.</li>
            <li> It helps with the appearance of dark circles and dryness.</li>
            <li> I believe with time, the appearance of dark circles will diminish.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the pump.</li>
            <li> Was watery and squirted out so fast because it had the wrong cap on it</li>
            <li> a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already started to reduce my dark spots.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I&#x27;m already seeing fading in the dark spots I have from acne</li>
            <li> It did not knock my age down, like it advertised.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin looking brighter after a week and a half.</li>
            <li> But the times I did use it, I did see a slight difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> :  (1) Sustained results over time are important to me; and (2) I&#x27;m a cynic and a skeptic who has no difficulty panning inferior products.  </li>
            <li> Seller got this product to me in two days with no special request for expedited service.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you and it does it job.&lt;br /&gt;PREMIUM</li>
            <li> When I used to have dark spots (which this product has corrected!)</li>
            <li> , I applied another little bit over the hyperpigmented areas, then followed with moisturizer in the morning and then before bed.  </li>
            <li> I add tangerine oil to make it smell a little fresher</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit thinner than their retinol serum, but I don&#x27;t find it watery (as some others have stated).  </li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Everyday</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It catches and when it releases it causes the product to splash into my hand and some goes to waste.  </li>
            <li> My mom and a few others have asked me to purchase bottles for them as well.</li>
            <li> Been using it everyday morning and night for about a week now.</li>
            <li> am 52 and have been using HA and Vitamin C for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> I will return in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it after it is dried.</li>
            <li> I have a few days using vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> they notice results in a few days ...</li>
            <li> This serum promotes the diminishing lines of aging as well as sunspots and uneven looking textured skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days now.</li>
            <li> The scent is not likable, an odd citrus chemical mix, but it&#x27;s not overly  unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly, no smell, and looks like it&#x27;s been helping my skin.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses I can see a difference!</li>
            <li> Mine came with a small pump, not a dropper.</li>
            <li> Usually I had to apply my Hyaluronic Acid and then Vitamin C</li>
            <li> but I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky, nor excessively runny.</li>
            <li> : Usually customers report smoother, brighter skin within weeks.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try and add some thing to my skin regimen and was looking at retinol products saw reviews for this one , been using it a week now and had someone tell me &amp;#34; you look like you have a glow about you what are you doing to your skin &amp;#34; I am not sure if I feel like it is making a difference but going to give it a month,</li>
            <li> so the pump makes it hard to dispense without it squirting and dripping .</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum goes on the skin nicely, not sticky like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this not even a week, but I use it at least five times a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slowly fading my acne marks.</li>
            <li> The freckles are not a problem it the age spots are big and ugly.</li>
            <li> it was getting very dull and flakiness .</li>
            <li> John has horrible sun damage and we both have really horrendous bruising from cancer and its assorted medications.</li>
            <li> : Drop 10 years from your face and get noticed from strangers asking what your secret is.</li>
            <li> This serum is incredibly thin.</li>
            <li> This serum has a bad smell and I also noticed it burns a little when I apply.</li>
            <li> Really sorry I didn&#x27;t like it .</li>
            <li> it out-performs products that are 8X as expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve never used a serum, or any of the ingredients for that matter</li>
            <li> : A very thin, watery serum.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if something is wrong with my bottle, but this stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> and use a thin layer!!</li>
            <li> I have tried very expensive Vitamin C products (serums, capsule, and powder)</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> It does not have an oil base.</li>
            <li> Do your skin a favor and try some -- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This serum is different than any other vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve used. When using the dropper I noticed how silky and soft it is! ESPECIALLY since vitamin c serum can dry out your skin (and mine is super dry already) I didn&#x27;t have to worry about rushing to get out my moisturizer. My skin looks fresh new and AWAKE.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference what-so-ever by using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It works better than other brands I have used. It really helps with fine lines, and skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> Love this face serum. Leaves my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything yet...but it&#x27;s only been a week or so.</li>
            <li> Love this !!!! But what is its shelve life ? And do you offer or recommend a face wash ?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but this product is amazing! Thanks so much. After a few uses I can see a difference!</li>
            <li> Great serum! Doesn&#x27;t burn, has other nutritive carrier oils with it so you can use it all over your face! This is the first vitamin C serum I have used that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, it&#x27;s wonderful! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Skin feels tighter after 1st use.  I&#x27;m  still waiting for better results since it&#x27;s only been 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> I used this product for more than a month and love the way it made my skin look and feel! I used it both morning (under my moisturizer) and night. It gave my skin a glow and made it feel more smooth and firm. I like how it absorbs quickly and minimized my pores! The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the smell of this product. It wasn&#x27;t horrible but I guess I had it in my head that it would smell like oranges lol. I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I have been using after a peel and my skin looks amazing. Using with Skin Refinery, Ultra effects Anti-Aging Daily moisturizer with Matrixyl 3000. The combination is working great. I have received so many compliment about my skin and how fresh I look.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Definitely satisfied. Noticeable difference.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Was a little strong but once I diluted it in some lotion it worked good to make my skin soft. I wonder if you could add it to making soap. :)</li>
            <li> I had never thought to use or had tried a Vitamin C Serum in my daily regimen- now I don&#x27;t think I could go without. This product brightens skin, through intense moisture and antioxidant power. My sensitive and break out prone skin had no problems accepting this new product. My skin feels much smoother, is much healthier, and my complexion has definitely improved! I love that I can use this serum without any worries of break outs, which I had experienced with big name brands at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Great aroma and I noticed a difference after just a few uses.  I can&#x27;t wait to see to see the results after 30 and 60 days.</li>
            <li> Feels light, did not feel heavy or oily. So far no irritation to my skin and will continue to use</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is awesome!! . I can see that the fine lines around my eyes are smoothing out, and I would say they are somewhat less noticeable since my skin is tighter. Now I do recommend that you read directions, the first night I did not and my face was read as a tomato, but then reading the directions and following it made a world of difference.  You may want to begin using this once per day or every other day, working up to twice per day. and use a thin layer!! and when you are done make sure you moisturize right after!  Everyday I use this i see huge improvement for my face.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast ship.  Light weight and non greasy.  My skin is soft in the morning.  Vitamin c is great for your skin. Every one should use this to keep healthy skin looking great</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent service.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to apply. Mine came with a small pump, not a dropper. Only 2-3 pumps are needed so it lasts a long time. I have been using it for a few weeks and I am just starting to notice a slight difference in evened out skin tone. Time will tell if there is a huge difference. I will update my review at that point.</li>
            <li> I love how this has been making my skin look and feel</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy or oily. My skin is actually smoother after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> Smells great not overpowering and is very easy to apply because of the spray pump. Absorbs quickly and does not leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Professional Strength &#x27; Vitamin C [20%] Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Vit E Review by  AriaStarrBeauty, I received this product and am very happy with it. I have tried other products and this is helpful to have all the ingredients in one thing. Usually I had to apply my Hyaluronic Acid and then Vitamin C so this goes one step further and has Vitamin E in it. I like anything that saves me time don&#x27;t you? It comes in a dark  blue glass bottle, so it limits light into it to keep it at it potency as long as possible. It has a pump for easier application. It helps to smooth out rough skins and gives you the glow you had when you were younger. I like the smoothness of  my skin because of the winter months it was getting very dull and flakiness . So I like the results I have gotten. I have used other products this is a good  one in my book as well. I think the price of this one has the rest beat. Isn&#x27;t everyone looking to save money nowadays? I know I am trying to make sure every penny stretches and with this product it does. A little dab will do you and it does it job.&lt;br /&gt;PREMIUM ADVANCED FORMULA INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;+ 20% Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;+ 11% Vegan Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;+ Ferulic Acid&lt;br /&gt;+ Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;+ Organic Aloe&lt;br /&gt;+ Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
            <li> This Serum is so Great. It glides on my skin and is clearly making a big diference already!</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff it brightens and makes my skin so soft im hooked!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Aria Starr Beauty rocks!!!&amp;#34; will be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> So far so good...my skin reacts to it very well and will continue to use until bottle is empty</li>
            <li> Love this serum. I have only used it for a week and I can already notice a difference. I love how it penetrates the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> What I like most about this serum is that it is light. It goes on smooth without a heavy or sticky feeling. The glide on the skin is nice. Just after a few days my skin looks more even</li>
            <li> What could be better than Vitamin C in a bottle.  Feels great on my skin.  No burning and I like that I am giving my skin a topical vitamin.  Over time it can only help the condition of my skin.  I follow the application with a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product but I am very disappointed. This serum has a bad smell and I also noticed it burns a little when I apply. Really sorry I didn&#x27;t like it . The reviews and price were the reason I purchased it but I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> These new serums with hyaluronic acid are wonderful. This one is 20% Vitamin C and 11% hyaluronic acid. It also contains aloe, Vitamin E and witch hazel. As with any of these types of wonder serums, cleanse well, use toner, apply small amount of serum and when it is dry, follow up with a moisturizer for best results.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice serum! I have been seeing  improvement in my skin and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a couple days ago and have been using it twice a day since. Although I have not been using it long enough to see any changes in my skin it does make my skin very soft and it feels firmer. My only complaint with this product is it is very runny, almost like water, other than that seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> Smells Great And Feels Wonderful on my skin! My skin feels refreshes when I put it on</li>
            <li> Absolutely love vitamin C. I&#x27;m 27 but trying to be proactive and get a head start on my preventative skin care routine. I love that this included jojoba oil too, and aloe. Very nourishing, organic serum. Good to use under makeup or on its own before bed.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion in return for candid feedback.  I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now.  It is easy to appy, feels light on my skin.  So far I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin tone and plan to continue using for more results.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin about a week after I started using this serum. The area&#x27;s directly under both of my eyes are chronically very dry and flaky, but most everything I try there causes extreme irritation being such thin, sensitive skin. This product not only did not cause irritation, but it cleared up my dryness and now the skin is soft and looks smooth and supple. The skin on the rest of my face has become significantly less red and the longer I use the serum the softer it becomes and the fewer dry patches remain. Interestingly, the one part of my face that has always been very oily and plagued with blackheads, my nose and central forehead, seems to have balanced out as well, and is less greasy but still soft with far fewer breakouts. Overall, this product seems to be able to bring everything into balance without being heavy, greasy or irritating. I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;m hoping long term use will help lighten dark spots but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Definitely seeing results with my skin clarity and tone.  Dark spots are greatly diminished. On my second bottle.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using the product for a week now and chose this serum based on the ingredients.  We were hoping that it would benefit both my middle age skin and her teen-age break-outs.  I had read that antioxidants, especially vitamin C, were good for this.  So far, though, we&#x27;ve been using the serum daily and nightly.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements yet for my skin, but I am hopeful.  Unfortunately, though, my daughter&#x27;s skin hasn&#x27;t improved at all and in fact seems to have broken out a little more than normal.  We still plan to continue using the product and see if things turn around.  It does feel good on your skin, and I think my skin seems brighter.  I will say that the customer service is great, and that seems to be a rare commodity these days.  I would definitely try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> Do not see any significant change in the dark circle(using over the past 4 weeks).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it this week, so I don&#x27;t know if it does it&#x27;s job or not.</li>
            <li> I liked this very much. It makes your skin soft and leaves a bit of a coating on it I believe as it kind of unwrinkles the wrinkles. It is not sticky, nor excessively runny. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars as I only bought the one bottle and that&#x27;s not enough time for it to work, I also use it on my hands and arms as well as the same spots on my husband. John has horrible sun damage and we both have really horrendous bruising from cancer and its assorted medications. I just bought another brand, mainly because it came in a 4 ounce bottle, but I do not like it at all.</li>
            <li> The product itself is so great.  The firming of my skin was felt almost immediately.  I&#x27;ve been using this along with my other moisturizers and creams and it was the perfect addition.  Just turning 37 I realize I&#x27;m not getting any younger, but I want to keep that number on paper and my twenties on my face.  The only downside and the sole reason I went this this one over others was the pump on the bottle instead of the dropper others use.  I wanted the ease of the pump, but the issue I&#x27;m having is the pump isn&#x27;t a smooth and fluid movement.  It catches and when it releases it causes the product to splash into my hand and some goes to waste.  This has happened since the beginning and isn&#x27;t a cause of use or spillage.</li>
            <li> I just received it- package  was good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine overall but my face is a little sensitive to this product, especially my nose.</li>
            <li> Great serum for the face. My face feels more firm. Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> My face is smoother and more supple. This product works well.</li>
            <li> Really noticed changes in the lines and pore size</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It gives your skin a good glow, and the smell really isn&#x27;t that strong. Sort of a bitter orange smell. It dries fast, so work quickly to smear it around your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Aria Starr Beauty Super Vitamin C serum for a little over a week now and I&#x27;m really enjoying this product so far. It&#x27;s really lightweight and it absorbs quickly. I really love that the product smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on my face. My skin is also looking noticeably brighter. I had minor hyperpigmentation from a recent breakout and those spots are fading quickly. I recommend this product and I look forward to continuing my use. Also, the founder of Aria Starr Beauty was very quick to answer questions I had. Great product, great service!</li>
            <li> I love this product and any organic vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used (at this point I&#x27;ve used 3 different ones).  One thing I&#x27;ll add is that natural products are about longevity, some experience a rejuvenation in a matter of a few days where others take a little longer to see the changes.  Much of this depends on the condition of your skin, but realize the true benefit is in using this product over the course of your life (i.e. not having your skin dried out by chemical laden anti-aging products).  I can tell noticeable changes in my skin and circles under my eyes because this product truly energizes your skin and renews it...but that is also coupling it with water consumption, good sleep, and a healthy diet.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product, but you might be if your expectations are to magically have new skin in 3 days.  It absolutely renews your skin...but over the course of time.  I keep ordering this product because it works and I know it will keep my skin looking good while adding longevity.</li>
            <li> Product was smooth and wasn&#x27;t greasy.  Used for my dry hands.  Small amount went a long way. Scent wasn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li> Love this vitamin c serum!</li>
            <li> This serum is FABULOUS!  My favorite so far that I have tested.  The scent is lovely and it feels so light.  Very cooling feel as well. LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I started using this the same day that it arrived and it left my skin feeling refreshed. Fast forward about a week and I derma-rolled and used this serum immediately after (as a vitamin c serum is recommended) and my skin drank it in. I expected some burning or a light rash to appear but nothing like that happened. My skin looks brighter, healthy  and is sure soft. I will continue to use this serum and expect it to be a staple in my beauty routine. My mom and a few others have asked me to purchase bottles for them as well.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love, use it every morning!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Been using it everyday morning and night for about a week now. Skin is much smoother and dark acne scars/spots are disappearing! It will dry out some of your more sensitive skin, but it says to use a moisturizer! Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> thank you very much. my wife like it very much.</li>
            <li> great on my face , no irritation skin or anything, gives my face healthy looking shine. thank you so much</li>

            <li> Great product, my face is looking so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this formula. Skin is softer now and fine lines around eyes and mouth are less noticeable. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for numerous reasons!! Its great for almost everything!!</li>
            <li> Thinner than some of the more expensive serums I&#x27;ve tried, and other than being a great moisturizer, haven&#x27;t experienced notable benefits, and I definitely don&#x27;t look 10yrs younger (wish I did). I liked that the product said organic, but upon further inspection, it&#x27;s not purely organic. I&#x27;m on the middle of the fence with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for a free or drastically reduced cost in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short while, but so far I really like this product. It makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s really getting nourished. It seems more youthful and even. I can hardly wait to see even more results the longer I use it.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of organic C serum from Aria.  It&#x27;s fantastic,  works as well as the $250.00 two part C serum I used to buy from my  esthetician.</li>
            <li> I got this product through promotion. Well I tried it next morning and Surprisingly it did gave me a glowing effect I noticed a smooth finish on my face. Definitely recommend this product. Its nice to start a good beauty regimen knowing that the product works great and I love the fact that its Organic.</li>
            <li> The product squirts out of control on the second pump so beware! Other than that, this product has helped my skin tone a lot. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has really brightened up. I love that its not greasy/oily. I use this after applying the stem cell eye cream.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The product came on time and seems to be working; I have only been using it about 5 days now. I am still having breakouts but hopefully they will subside soon. I am still using it twice daily and will give it at least 2 months before I give up. I will keep you posted on my results...</li>
            <li> Only used it for a couple of days and I can already tell the difference!</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time today. Made my skin feel great and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few more days of use.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time . Great product my husband uses all the time and he has no complaints&amp;#34; would definitely recommend this product to other people !!</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C serum. It helps with the appearance of dark circles and dryness. It absorbs very nicely and leaves skin feeling smooth. I believe with time, the appearance of dark circles will diminish. Love the glass bottle with the darker glass to help with exposure to light.  Would highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few days now, twice a day, morning and night, it goes on smooth, dries quick, and goes well alone and under my night and day cream, with no irritation at all, even near my sensitive eye area. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s too soon to see results-and I&#x27;m still young-ish enough where I am just starting to get fine lines, but so far it does make my face look brighter and more even, so even if that is all it does - it&#x27;s a win!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have tried many many products but this one takes the gold! It makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt; To me it is very necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
            <li> Seller got this product to me in two days with no special request for expedited service. Would definitely recommend buying from this seller again. Love the product.  The feel and appearance of my skin is obvious.  My face feels like silk and just radiates.  I am thrilled with the results from using this product.  The product goes on very easy and it does not take much to cover your entire face.  Love this product and so glad I ordered two bottles.  I recommend trying this product from this seller.  You wont be disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this formula.  It is highly absorbable and it does not break my face out in any way.  I can see noticeable changes occurring in the depth of my wrinkles around my eyes, forehead and chin area.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;11% hyaluronic acid but manages to be a smooth serum with the Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed reviews talk about redness and irritation. They are using this wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 and have been using HA and Vitamin C for a few months now.  This is not &#x27;typical over the counter, drug store moisturizer&#x27; - this is a product that really helps.  It helps by fading discolorations, pluming and exfoliating so if you see dryness, you are using a product your face is not ready for.  Some people need to start with lower percentages of Vitamin C and HA to accustom their skin to the effects.  This is isn&#x27;t a lotion, you need to and absolutely should use a moisturizer over this.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good sensitive skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Much more gentle on my face than another brand I had tried. And the results after regular use are amazing! Should definitely be a part of your daily routine of facial attention towards rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> I tried it and also let a family friend of mine try it and we were very impressed...not sure about the long term effects but it did make a noticable difference short term..</li>
            <li> I have been using various Vitamin C serums for the past year and have been happy with the results. My brown sun spots are fading. The price on this was great compared to others I have purchased. My only complaint was the pump. Compared to other Vitamin C Serums I&#x27;ve used this was a thinner serum so the pump makes it hard to dispense without it squirting and dripping . I would have preferred a squeeze dispenser.</li>
            <li> This serum is very fresh, so, gooooood for summer!!</li>
            <li> Has worked great to even out tone in my skin, and doesn&#x27;t cause me breakouts. I&#x27;ve needed to follow up with a moisturizer. Multiple purchases with this seller, all have been perfect.</li>
            <li> It my 3rd day using this product. So far so good.  I do like it and with only using in for a few days, I can&#x27;t really give an accurate review. I do like how it moisturizes my face. It feels good when applying to face. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that say it smells nice but my bottle smells a lil chemically  however, I have. Nothing to compare it to. This is my first time trying any sort of vitamin c. Btw I also bought Aria Starr retinol, to go along with this I have only used it one time which was last night. I plan on applying that on every other night. I appreciate you emailing back to see how it&#x27;s working for me. Shipping was good too. Arrived a day earlier.  Thank you. Naomi</li>
            <li> Star using it. Dont know yet how is going to work.. I will return in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review after using this product for 6 months because:  (1) Sustained results over time are important to me; and (2) I&#x27;m a cynic and a skeptic who has no difficulty panning inferior products.  Let me tell you that I&#x27;ve never been more pleased with a Vitamin C serum!  I&#x27;ll be turning 55 this year (arrrgghh!!) but thanks to this product my skin doesn&#x27;t reflect my age -- or the fact that, as an adolescent and young adult, I was rarely careful about using sun block despite the fact that I have fair skin that burns rather than tans.  Daily use of this serum has not only corrected my hyperpigmented areas, but has also improved skin tightness over my face and neck.  After cleansing my skin, I apply this Vitamin C serum all over my face, neck, and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; -- it absorbs quickly and leaves no residue. When I used to have dark spots (which this product has corrected!), I applied another little bit over the hyperpigmented areas, then followed with moisturizer in the morning and then before bed.  I&#x27;ve also had great results using this product on my hands and forearms, to get rid of the nasty results of sun overexposure (LOL!).  Suffice to say I&#x27;ll never be without this amazing Vitamin C serum -- it out-performs products that are 8X as expensive.  Do your skin a favor and try some -- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this products. Products that make my face look younger.</li>
            <li> Great product second one I&#x27;ve tried the best one</li>
            <li> The first Vitamin C serum that worked for me. Great product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> made my skin peel and bubble</li>
            <li> This smells like strong alcohol. Is this normal? I was excited to use this but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have very sensitive skin that is acne prone. It has never broken me out and I feel like it helped with overall tone and texture of skin. It&#x27;s a really good product for the price. I would have given it five stars but it does have a little bit of a strange smell. I add tangerine oil to make it smell a little fresher</li>
            <li> Love this Super Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I used it every night after shower instead of my regular moisturizer. I love it. It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves my face and neck moisturized.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell what the results might be but feels like a nice product.  WJ</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum goes on the skin nicely, not sticky like others I have tried. Have only been using for one week so no major change yet but will keep at it!</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping lines in the face.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for over a month now and havent seen any results one way or another. It feels like putting water on my face and I havent noticed any change in my skin from using it.</li>
            <li> Was opened. Was watery and squirted out so fast because it had the wrong cap on it (it is not the cap in this picture) It definitely does not feel like a serum. I have used many serums before and this was pure liquid like water. I do not see any results.</li>
            <li> Meet all my expectations. I really lpved how it felt and it brought out that radience on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I put it on at night and morning and it leaves my skin glowing. Also if I break out I dab it on my blemish and leave it on over night next day the swelling goes down or it disappears, depending on how big your pimple is.. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I think this has a great ingredient list but I did receive the pump instead of the dropper. The pump would have been okay if the formula was a bit thicker. For the consistency it is, it should have been a dropper as pictured. Other than that, this is a decent product. I use a lot of products and can&#x27;t say for certain how this would stand alone, but I do know that Vitamin C is one of the best ingredients for the skin and this formula seems to incorporate on of the more stable versions of that.</li>
            <li> totally love this product ! my skin is beautiful now ! thanks so much !</li>
            <li> Works great!I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and has helped my skin feel supple.</li>
            <li> great consistency, absorbs easily, no oily residue. I love it.</li>
            <li> Such a great Seeum with Vitamin C. It is reducing the sun and age spots !!  I love love love it !</li>
            <li> Excellent product! !!</li>
            <li> It is too soon to  give a proper review.  The serum applies nicely.  Be careful a small amount goes a long way. It absorbs nicely and works nicely with other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will give a better review after using it for a month or more.</li>
            <li> It does NOT smell pleasant enough to wear on my face.  Ewe!</li>
            <li> I really like this product the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, it seems to be making my skin softer and diminishing the fine lines on my face. Just wish there was an easier way to put it on your face. Seems to splash everywhere, unless you first apply it to your hands then work it in to your face.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. As expected. Great customer service. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like that this product uses organic ingredients, but I wish it was thicker. The pump send it splashing out of my hand and all over the counter tops. But the counter tops are completely wrinkle free....</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth. Only been using for a few days and starting to see a difference! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The one thing I do not like a out this product is that it smells.  BUT only when you&#x27;re applying it. I don&#x27;t notice it after it is dried. if others do they aren&#x27;t telling me. But I put it on before bed and in the morning. I just added it to my Rhonda Allison face Care product&#x27;s.  I am in my lower 20s so wrinkles are not a problem. I do feel my face feeling more tight and naturally bright.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to try this product and I will get back to give more comment about the product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for a friend of mine, they love Vitamin C</li>
            <li> Most of the Vit C serum that I&#x27;ve tried has that citrusy smell like of an orange, but not this one. It smells more of like a natural oil. It tends to get a little sticky when you first apply it. But after few minutes of letting it absorbed you can feel the softness of your skin. I use it twice a day, morning under my sunscreen and night before I go to bed under my night cream. Vitamin C helps a lot in wound healing that&#x27;s why I love it. My face is prone to acne so I have to remove blackheads once in a while. This helps clear up the marks faster. Getting serum applied in facial spa is costly that&#x27;s why I love this one. It saves me tons of money plus I have the freedom to apply it more often. It really works as long as you apply sunscreen during day time because this makes your skin more prone to sunburn. My husband didn&#x27;t believe me when I told him I am not wearing any makeup at all. Im so happy to hear that of course. I was lucky to be able to purchase it for a discounted price in return for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Visibly reduces age spots and&lt;br /&gt; wrinkles after 30 days.</li>
            <li> I will buy more after this runs out. My skin looks great; smoother, softer, more even-toned; love it!</li>
            <li> I really love the serum, but the pump is a little rough. It makes the product splatter because of the force. So that being said, I try to be careful because I really do like this C serum, and honestly I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It makes my skin feel so smooth. I have not broken out and my skin tone is starting to evening out. The scent smells like oranges but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing to your skin!</li>
            <li> I have a few days using vitamin C serum my face is liking it. Also bought retinol serum to use at Night hoping they work wonderfully as read.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product great value</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum and I like that the company sent me information through Amazon on how to use the product  I have tried very expensive Vitamin C products (serums, capsule, and powder) and this is the best.  Mine came in the pump and I love it.  I cup one hand and pump once into it and then apply with the fingers on my other hand-works fine, easy, and no waste!</li>
            <li> I guess that my skin is too sensitive, broke out.</li>
            <li> I like using Vitamin C but my face doesn&#x27;t always like Vitamin C.  This one is pretty good for my sensitive skin.  For whatever reason, Vitamin C causes a burn to my skin.  The burn didn&#x27;t happen with this one, although I do not use daily.  Smells good. I have a thing with smelly things on my face and this one didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the texture and light scents. Great price. Use daily to help rejuvenate your skin</li>
            <li> This serum is sticky and stays on top of skin instead of being absorbed.  It is oily and leaves a greasy looking film on skin.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I wouldn&#x27;t ever go without it. If anyone wants an awesome vitamin C serum and other great things for your face. Buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for four days and already see results . It has a nice light texture and I&#x27;m able to put makeup on right after application . Really love the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve never used a serum, or any of the ingredients for that matter and I&#x27;d never tried Aria Starr products. I&#x27;ve been using for 1 month and I really like this product. I use it with the retinol at night and with a gentle moisturizer in the morning. I&#x27;m 34 and I can honestly say I can see a difference in my skin texture and appearance.</li>
            <li> i have used several more expensive versions of this. This works just as well. One thing to note: it is a sprat and not a dropper. I just spray on my fingers.</li>
            <li> If you need an anti aging serum that really works, this is the one. I love it and even use it on my hands, dry elbows and feet and it hydrate the skin, protect it and makes it so soft. I highly recommend it and also, I will never be without it. I got an discount from Amazon  for a review for a reviw on this one, and I&#x60;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It works great - exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a couple of nights and I can totally say that my skin completion is changing.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and when I try out new skincare products I make sure to test on a small portion of my skin. But, after trying this out, my skin seems to love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is making my face look more radiant. In addition, I love to use Vitamin C serum after derma needling. People say that is the best way serums seep into your skin and cause amazing skin. I have been following this regimen and will continue to because I am all for anti-aging !&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell goes, I like it kind of reminds me of a lavender scent for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is great, not thick or too thin.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I did receive this product for a discounted rate for my honest &amp; unbiased review.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try and add some thing to my skin regimen and was looking at retinol products saw reviews for this one , been using it a week now and had someone tell me &amp;#34; you look like you have a glow about you what are you doing to your skin &amp;#34; I am not sure if I feel like it is making a difference but going to give it a month,</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Turned cloudy rather quickly indicating old vitamin C.  Probably needs refrigeration.</li>
            <li> The fluid serum has a good ability to flow and spread, and a little goes a long way. The pump head is well designed and a proper amount of product can be dispensed each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a fairly low-price serum, this Vitamin C serum absorbs fast and smells good. It is definitely worth the price. It gives my skin enough moisture and a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> I have only had a chance to use it twice but I do see a difference in my skin brightness. It leaves my skin a little oily so I only use it at night time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I can already see improveness in my face. It made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is really nice Vitamin C facial serum.  It goes on easily with just a few drops and absorbs without leaving any greasy mess behind.  This is one of my favorite facial serums I have ever tried.  My skin feels softer and more hydrated after using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this 3 days ago and i  love it! It&#x27;s made my complexion even. I bought it to go with a derma roller and I use it after i use my roller and I love it! The instructions say to use 1-2 pumps but that&#x27;s totally not enough cause it dries so fast. I use about 5 pumps and spread it fast. Love it and will purchase more!</li>
            <li> Good product great packaging.</li>
            <li> I have been using botanicals and organics for many years.  However, I have now come to the age of becoming more intense with my routine and adding firming, skin repair and pigmentation lightening products.  I have experimented with several.  I love the ratio of HA added to this serum with the Vitamin C and its other skin nourishing and repair ingredients.  I particularly like the fluidity and absorption of this product, some can be thick and sticky.  A little goes a long way which makes it cost effective.  It absorbs quickly into my skin with no sticky residue.  Then easily apply your moisturizer and makeup.  I also apply at night, under my moisturizer so it can continue to work its&#x27; magic.  I have only used this serum a few days, but really like everything about its easy application and ingredients, and am anticipating noticeable results in a couple more weeks.  I will update.</li>
            <li> I like this so far, last time I bought the best seller one, and it was like 10 dollars more, and so far I havent noticed a huge difference between them except the smell a tad. I have noticed a huge difference in sun spots, but not as much in my newly developing crows feet ;), been using Vitamin C serum for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I use this religiously after I wash my face in the morning. Acne has disappeared and my face feels tighter. If you are thinking of trying a Vitamin C serum, look no further this is the one for you&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Awesome product with an awesome price! I no longer have to buy the $156.00 Vitamin C serum-this works just as well!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum! It&#x27;s great for the price! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s already started to reduce my dark spots. My skin looks brighter every morning! This serum has a very watery texture so it is perfect for my extremely oily skin. It also absorbs very nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: A blue frosted glass bottle. Product size is 30ml(1oz).&lt;br /&gt;Smell: You can definitely smell the vitamin C. The smell goes away after it&#x27;s absorbed in the skin, though.&lt;br /&gt;Texture: A very thin, watery serum.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself but it was quickly taken by my friend who swears it is the best ever.</li>
            <li> I really am very impressed with this vitamin C serum. I am a female, was diagnosed with Melasma about four months ago and I have dark spots like a very light french mustache above my upper lip. I did everything i could including chemical peels and all different cures. didn&#x27;t have any luck. It&#x27;s started psychologically effecting me resonantly. Heard about this from a therapist. I&#x27;ve been using this not even a week, but I use it at least five times a day. I can definitely see the spots are fading slowly within a week, very impressive. So grateful that I&#x27;ve found this miracle product. Amazing customer service with follow up emails, Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly Good.  I&#x27;m a guy.  I don&#x27;t like putting stuff on my face.  My wife suggested this product. It works.  Even I can tell the difference. But hey! Don&#x27;t breathe a word about this.  It&#x27;s a private thing. O.K.?</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin c serum. it smells great  and feeld great on my skin. great product.</li>
            <li> In 3 weeks, I can really see a big difference... skin is brighter and looks refreshed. I am very satisfied with this product. It delivered fast, they were nice to follow up if I was happy with the product. Every penny is worth the price. I wish they had a facial wash of this product line too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 4 days.  One push of the pump amount doesn&#x27;t cover my entire face.  I will  apply this to a moist face &amp; see if it spreads better. I like the price that is for sure. I have very fine wrinkles &amp; I&#x27;m over 70. Would like to keep them at a minimum for the rest of my life. Also hope to see a difference in my skin tone.  Need to use much longer to see better results.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if something is wrong with my bottle, but this stuff stinks. It smells like bacon or hotdogs. I would have loved to try it, but not with it smelling like this. My neighborhood dogs won&#x27;t leave me alone if I go outside with it!</li>
            <li> - &amp;#34; I used this product last night for the first time. The texture is very clean and only took a small amount. I did not feel any irritation with the use. It does not have an oil base. I like this because I can use it at night and in the morning under my makeup.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love the all natural health benefits,so far I feel great</li>
            <li> I used it once a day after showering and didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Great quality, good packaging and container with pump and cap for easy for travel. Has no foul smell. I have been using this serum on my face for over a month and my skin looks healthy and feels soft. It is not an oily serum and works as a daily moisturizer, great for combination skin like myself.</li>
            <li> Love my new oil/serum vitamin C.  Its so smooth on your face, not grease at all, feels I&#x27;m nurturing my skin with all the right ingredients.  I highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Along with my moisturizer it leaves my face in great shape.</li>
            <li> Not to repeat myself, but I also just reviewed the Aria Starr retinol product and stated in that review that I don&#x27;t trust reviews on skin care by people who state they notice results in a few days ... that just isn&#x27;t realistic.  Most of these people also state they received a discount or got free product, which makes me more leery about buying a product.  However, I was happy with the retinol serum and was looking for a vitamin C serum, so it only made sense to try Aria Starr again.  I use this product twice daily (I only use the retinol at night).  It has a very silky feeling when I apply it, and absorbs into the skin quickly.  My skin is brighter, and has an overall more healthy look and feel.  It&#x27;s a little bit thinner than their retinol serum, but I don&#x27;t find it watery (as some others have stated).  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the pump on this product.  I&#x27;ve noticed others have the same complaint about it, and I don&#x27;t know why it works differently than the pump on the retinol serum, but I have to pump it 5 or 6 times to get what should amount to product from 2 pumps, and you have to be careful because it will go where you don&#x27;t want it to.  It&#x27;s not a deal breaker ... I just pump it into a cupped palm so I don&#x27;t lose product.  If you&#x27;re looking for a Vitamin C Serum I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this one, and like the retinol serum, it&#x27;s a great value for the money as a little goes a long way (even using it twice daily).  I can honestly say I&#x27;m so pleased with these 2 Aria Starr serums I&#x27;m going to try their mask next.  Hopefully that&#x27;s as great to use!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and lightly..does not leave face oily it dries fast as it soaks into skin..I use before I got to bed every night after washing my face..I wake up with a morning glow and feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> Nice with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about using this product, but I am glad I did. I have been using the product for about a week, in the morning and at night. I am impressed. My face feels firmer, and I have noticed less lines and a more youthful appearance. It came with a pump and I am very glad it did. ( I had heard others received droppers). I think my favorite thing is the fact that it goes on smoothly and leaves no greasy mess behind.</li>
            <li> Turned cloudy and smelled like rotten oranges. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly, no smell, and looks like it&#x27;s been helping my skin.  It&#x27;s much smoother than ever.</li>
            <li> This serum is incredibly thin. I&#x27;ve never had a serum that was so watery so it surprised me when I pumped it out. It also gets absorbed by your skin super fast so I didn&#x27;t really have time to spread it around my face when I did one pump the first time. I guess that&#x27;s why you are supposed to use 2 pumps. I am trying it now mixed with my regular face serum to see how it does. I think the ingredients look good but the number one ingredient is &#x27;organic herbal infusion&#x27; which seems a bit mysterious to me, but 2nd and 3rd ingredients are aloe and vitamin C respectively. All in all, the ingredient list seems really solid, so I&#x27;m hoping I see some results soon. It&#x27;s only been a couple days so I doubt I will have a drastic change in skin tone. I do have a couple blemish scars I am trying to lighten, so I hope this serum helps. Will update at a later date! I did purchase this item at a discount in return for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Great firming effect!  Works as well as a similar one costing nearly 3 times as this one.</li>
            <li> Have only used for a short time. I have extremely sensitive skin but so far no real problem with the product, will have to wait and see if it helps the redness on my face.</li>
            <li> The pump feature is awesome because it makes it easy to control the amount of the product.  I was using a different type of vitamin c serum before but this one is much better because of how it absorbs.  I use this right before applying retinol.  It absorbs fast so applying this product followed by retinol is super easy. I apply once a day at night. I noticed my skin looking brighter after a week and a half. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great serum. It is practically fragrance free, easily absorbed without leaving any sticky residue. It left my skin feeling smooth, fuller and nourished. Retinol is a great antioxidant which also helps collagen stimulation. So, I feel its healthy skin care.&lt;br /&gt;Its better than some high end departmental stores products that I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;I am really liking this a lot!</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to try this super vitamin c serum by Aria Starr Beauty because mixed with the other serum they gave me I found my skin to be more youthful, smooth and even than any other product I have tried. This serum is the highest quality out there of active, bioavailable organic 20% Vitamin C Serum plus 11% Vegan Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin E. I enjoyed the blue bottle to create preservation for shelf life and the fact that instead of a dropper like most, this serum uses a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found within a few weeks that my skin was smoother, more even, brighter and my pores were less noticeable. This serum promotes the diminishing lines of aging as well as sunspots and uneven looking textured skin. The serum is usable on sensitive skin and is made in the USA with FDA approved facilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, fairly citrusy and barely noticeable and when applied to the skin fades quickly to start working immediately. At under $20, this is a great deal and should last you quite awhile. The texture and consistency is almost like a clear water. Try it on Amazon for $10.95 with a satisfaction guarantee or your money back!!</li>
            <li> I started using it and the first thing I noticed was my face was smoother! I love it!</li>
            <li> Ordered this twice now.  Love this item and have my granddaughter using it to fight acne, as well.  Don&#x27;t know if it will help, but it does keep my skin looking radiant as 65 year old grandma.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great quality it goes on smooth! I will surely order more.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product. I just applied it for the first time tonight. The smell could be better, but it&#x27;s not too unpleasant. A little definitely goes a long ways with this serum.</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum is amazing. No harsh smell and has a super handy dispensing top. I&#x27;ve tried others that left a oily residue but not this one. Absorbed quickly. I am totally in love with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and so far so good!  I was given an chance to review this at a good price and it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my skin feel so refreshed and clean before I add my make up :)</li>
            <li> I have yet to see any results, as I&#x27;ve only had the product for 2 days. However, it does provide a nice refreshing feel and I have confidence that it will produce results once used longer. I&#x27;ll update my review as I use longer.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better, don&#x27;t care for the smell but would recommend it for the benefits.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my skin feel super soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but was surprised at how fluid it was. I was expecting something a little more viscous. That being said, the dispenser is rather forceful and the product squirts out all over. I&#x27;ve probably put as much in the sink as I&#x27;ve put on my skin!!</li>
            <li> It came quickly and this product is amazing! Feels great!!!</li>
            <li> Made my face feel very soft but not sure it&#x27;s right for someone whose acne prone, I am not and 2 days after using this product I broke out with 2 white heads.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it a positive or negative review. Since I cannot use it everyday because it dried out my skin; mostly because I have very sensitive and dry skin. But the times I did use it, I did see a slight difference in my skin. It did not knock my age down, like it advertised.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed anything at this time.  I use it in the AM and PM and with a moisturizer over it wit5h a sunscreen lastly.  I need to use it a little longer to be able to tell a deference.</li>
            <li> so far so good! I put this on every morning and each night before going to bed. I like the fact that the batches are made each week so that the Vit C does not go off, as it can deteriorate in sunlight and age. So best to always use it when indoors and away from light! Great price as well. I will be ordering this again and again to maintain my skin. Customer service is 5 star as well!!!</li>
            <li> I like it alot. It isn&#x27;t sticky, massages in nicely. It works for me</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great Company, too!</li>
            <li> Great product at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> So far so good - I like the way this serum has a little body to it; makes it easier to apply.  I don&#x27;t see any real skin changes but have only been using a few days.</li>
            <li> Got this for $1, thanks!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel really soft. It&#x27;s slowly fading my acne marks.</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this serum. It has been about 6 days and nights of applying after gentle face washing and then applying the Aria Starr super retinol serum. I am in my 40&#x27;s I am Irish, German and Native American descendant and have skin that can tan a reddish freckled way. My freckles used to be only on nose but as I age I have age spots and through time I have freckles on my hands and legs. The freckles are not a problem it the age spots are big and ugly. And I think I can  see a slight  lightning, only time will tell. I can say that it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn at all and feels nice going on, not greasy or thick just right. I am happy so far and if I can afford more after bottle runs out I won&#x27;t attempt to make my own and I can update a longer-term results. Oh yes Sun screen 30 up broad spectrum after applying in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the serum once so far, I&#x27;ll update this in a few months to give a better account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this vitamin C serum above other options because it has a pump, this preserves vitamin C integrity as exposure to air will cause it to degrade, and because it includes Hyaluronic Acid which improves absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied to my face after using a derma roller and it produced a pleasant tingling sensation. It did dry with a mild stiff feeling that was immediately alleviated by applying my nightly moisturizer over it. The scent is not likable, an odd citrus chemical mix, but it&#x27;s not overly  unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No immediate results but I didn&#x27;t expect that, time will tell. I do highly recommend the seller who contacted me after purchase and before the serum arrived to address any questions or concerns. Aria was very helpful,  informative and seems actively interested in both her customers and her product&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, nice blend of vitamin c &amp;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid so I don&#x27;t have to do two separate applications &amp; it makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> Wonderful feeling and the smell isn&#x27;t to strong . I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple days but I feel like I&#x27;m already seeing fading in the dark spots I have from acne</li>
            <li> Items worked great, terrific value thank you!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my serum! It made my skin feel clean and refreshed and very soft! I would definitely would reccomend and purchase again!</li>
            <li> I received The Professional Strength Organic 20% Vitamin C Topical Serum complimentary for review purposes. All thought and opinions are my own and not influenced by anyone. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days now. The serum goes on smooth without any sticky feeling. Fine lines around the eyes and mouth are less noticeable. My skin feels smooth, I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have noticed improvement in my skin after one week.  Worth a try I have spent  a lot of money on things that did nothing.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so healthy after using this!</li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t leave the face feeling oily also dries quickly. The only down side is the pump it squirts across your whole hand so you have to be careful when u pump it out</li>
            <li> I highly enjoyed using  the  Professional Strength Vitamin C &#x27; [20%] Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Vit E from AriaStarrBeauty  because it is a complete anti-aging solution in one bottle…You are going to love how your skin feels after just a few days of using this serum…I can already notice reduced fine lines and wrinkles, brighter and smoother skin and an even complexion after purchasing it from Amazon. #VITAMINCSERUM  DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED A FREE PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UNBIASED REVIEW</li>
