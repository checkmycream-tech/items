            <li>GREAT value!</li>
            <li>but they are not the best.  </li>
            <li>These razor blades work exceptionally well &amp; are a great value!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased with the recycled razor handle--they are a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Happy to support a company that does not test on animals</li>
            <li>work great</li>
            <li>I have now switched to the triple blade and these work great too.</li>
            <li>a disposable razor--not a great shave, bounces around.</li>
            <li>The razor look attractive in its packaging.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find a good price on these Preserve razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li>This kind, until I found preserve!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razors are good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Good for pocket, good for environment.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for years now and I am very pleased with it and the company.  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Plus they are better for the environment!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t really the best, but I will continue on with them since they are cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li>What kind of vegan uses razors from corporations that mutilate bunnies?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a razor that is recyclable and made of recycled plastic.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited because this is a 6 pack with four razors in each pack!!</li>
            <li>These razor blades are really nice and the fact that they are recycled material makes them even better knowing that we are helping the environment out.</li>
            <li>Never thought about it before, but many of the most popular razors on the market use chemicals in their mosturizing strip.</li>
            <li>but my husband continues to happily use these ;)</li>
            <li>I get a very smooth shave, including bikini area.  </li>
            <li>and I have been able to use one razor for up to a week or two.</li>
            <li>I vote with my dollars and buy as many \\&quot;green\\&quot;/recycled products as I can.  </li>
            <li>At a price better than I was paying before to boot.</li>
            <li>Mostly I buy these because I like what the company does for the environment.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of this product...</li>
            <li>Maybe they do a better job for the men, with the angle of the blades or something.</li>
            <li>Better to pay the arm n&#x27; leg instead the qt of blood from all the nics.</li>
            <li>I love these razor blades.  </li>
            <li>These top quality razors from companies like Gillette have non-disposable handles, so you don&#x27;t throw out the handles--just the blades, like Preserve.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so many nicks</li>
            <li>triple blade gives a lovely close shave&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I guess the one good thing is that I will be supporting a \\&quot;green\\&quot; company.</li>
            <li>Good first shave...</li>
            <li>I love that I could find cruelty free razors and blades.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I&#x27;m very happy with the Preserve toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>, you can be more earth friendly and still have smooth legs.</li>
            <li>I gave these a good try, but eventually I could not deny that I had a lot of new slices on my shins and knees.</li>
            <li>The blades are fine.</li>
            <li>These are super!</li>
            <li>The preserve product line is good for environmentally conscious individuals and those who wish to shop cruelty free.</li>
            <li>The blades are a good price-seem a lot cheaper than major brands.</li>
            <li>I have found that they work well for shaving any nooks and crannies as they are smaller and more maneuverable than many cartridge razors, and I have experienced no trouble with razor burn.</li>
            <li>There are not any truly environmentally friendly razors out there that I have seen.  </li>
            <li>When I notified Amazon of the problem, they immediately refunded the full amount of the purchase.</li>
            <li>I wish they lasted longer and weren&#x27;t as flimsy; but, they are made from recycle yogurt cups, and that&#x27;s pretty cool!</li>
            <li>A big box of my favorite razors, what could be better?</li>
            <li>They wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie and say when I first started using these razors it was love at first shave...</li>
            <li>They shave beautifully and the 6 pack should tide me over for quite a few months.</li>
            <li>These are only good for 1 shave, both legs, and I have very fine, blonde body hair.  </li>
            <li>Now I can shave my legs without hypocrisy and crushing guilt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also fast shipping and packed well.</li>
            <li>Just my opinion, my experience for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Unlike other people who have reviewed this product I have been delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>Right now I am traveling and I needed something compact,&lt;br /&gt;these</li>
            <li>When submitted to warm to hot water, the blade cartrige constantly falls off the razor.  </li>
            <li>Far as I can tell they are Personna blades repackaged; the Personna are priced more reasonably.</li>
            <li>I used the double blade from the same company and they worked great.</li>
            <li>it is super practical as the fun colors of razor make it really easy to see whose is whose and yet not sacrificing quality of razor for a different look.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to recycle the cartridges, but the handle is the only part that is recyclable.</li>
            <li>And they get the job done just as well as any fancy razor (I&#x27;ve tried the whole lot of them!).</li>
            <li>My girlfriend uses them for shaving her legs, and she&#x27;s very tall, so has lots to cover.  </li>
            <li>Only the razor handle is recyclable and it is so light that it feels like</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got a pack of 4 blades if anyone wants them.</li>
            <li>Thanks to preserve</li>
            <li>These are definitely an improvement over their original version, and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The price per cartridge is excellent, and they do last for a very long time, but the shave is not as close as you might get from some of the larger, more common razors.</li>
            <li>Just wish they were a bit more substantial and less flimsy.</li>
            <li>I have, however, had to shave more frequently with these than with other razors.</li>
            <li>I would love to support this green business, but it doesn&#x27;t make sense when I&#x27;m creating MORE waste by using their product.</li>
            <li>Now, after a few shaves, I love these razors.  </li>
            <li>but if I have to use a new blade every time, then I&#x27;m creating more waste.</li>
            <li>and I was worried I would have to switch to a new razor.  </li>
            <li>The blades work fine and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>have stopped shaving (ive gone Wild &amp; Natural!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m careful with all razors, but this one takes extra care and still cuts easily.</li>
            <li>I buy these purely because they are the only cruelty-free razor I know of.  </li>
            <li>The idea is great but rendition is disappointing.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses them, I use them, and our teenage/young adult</li>
            <li>I like these razors because they use all natural products to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I tried another box, got new razor, with same result.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself kind of sucks (gets dull fast), but I&#x27;ll keep using for now.</li>
            <li>It will last me much longer than Venus, and they only give you 3 in 1 pack for almost the same price!</li>
            <li>I am not sure what problems the other reviewers have had, but I love preserve products and have no problems.</li>
            <li>Too bad: seemed like a good product</li>

            <li> Also, the blade gets dull fast which is too bad because they have to be thrown out more frequently than a tough, long-lasting blade like the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> The packaging, however, is recyclable and minimal for the product.</li>
            <li> Keep them dry to prevent rust.&lt;br /&gt;Often when traveling my products are in ziplock bags and slightly moist</li>
            <li> BE careful!</li>
            <li> These cartridges cost less than widely-know brands and they get the job done.  </li>
            <li> They work well, they cost WAY less than brand ones.</li>
            <li> is my face a mess after trying 2 blades.</li>
            <li> I usually expect a disp shaver to last at least 3-4 uses.  </li>
            <li> so the handle of this got a little funky before I noticed.</li>
            <li> You get a little case to return your razor for recycling.  </li>
            <li> I may have had a few around the house when the box arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I wasted my money b/c</li>
            <li> My family has been using preserve products for a few years now, and I am just now getting around to reviewing them.</li>
            <li> But only two because the product is so poor.</li>
            <li> So little waste!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the order was not filled properly.  </li>
            <li> As good as anything comparable on the market, and unlike the big guys, they aren&#x27;t as crazy expensive and don&#x27;t come in all the crap</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the negative reviews are about.  </li>
            <li> The razors are dull after one use.</li>
            <li> I threw out dull blades four times as often (no exaggeration) with the Preserve razor than with the Gillette.</li>
            <li> They are not always the easiest to find, so i usually stock up when i do!</li>
            <li> Bought these razors because I got tired of paying arm n&#x27; leg for the fusion 5blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the blades are made of, but they irritated my skin so badly</li>
            <li> (this is difficult to find when it comes to razors).  </li>
            <li> Useless for me.</li>
            <li> Razor blades are typically expensive.</li>
            <li> wrong-</li>
            <li> But then I found out about how cruel the other razors are and couldn&#x27;t keep using them.  </li>
            <li> This razor is terrible, for at least two reasons:    1)</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> they are so expensive in the stores!!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the worst razors, don&#x27;t get me</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I last bought 24 of these in January 2009, just getting to the last one now. I may have had a few around the house when the box arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake them dry and wipe on dry towel (not against the edge or you&#x27;ll shave your towel) and keep out of the shower blade up when not in use. Haven&#x27;t used them on legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: These have gone up in price substantially since my review, they must have hired an MBA. Far as I can tell they are Personna blades repackaged; the Personna are priced more reasonably. Look for Personna Tri-flexxx Cartridges and see the difference. I wish Preserve no ill-will, bought them for years when they were the same price, but this is gouging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002IFNS36 24 Personna Tri-flexxx Cartridges - For all Gillette Sensor and Personna Tri-flexxx Razors (3 X 8 Ct.)]]</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find a good price on these Preserve razor cartridges.  they are so expensive in the stores!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these blades.  Happy to support a company that does not test on animals (this is difficult to find when it comes to razors).  I get a very smooth shave, including bikini area.  No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for years now and I am very pleased with it and the company.  I just take care shaving, keep it dry between uses, and appreciate the companies ethics.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The razors are dull after one use.</li>
            <li> I should have researched these razors before throwing out my 7 year-old Schick. I thought I would be able to recycle the cartridges, but the handle is the only part that is recyclable. So, I wasted my money b/c I obviously didn&#x27;t need a handle that is disposable (remember, 7 years). I guess the one good thing is that I will be supporting a \\&quot;green\\&quot; company. The razor itself kind of sucks (gets dull fast), but I&#x27;ll keep using for now.</li>
            <li> The blades are fine. Unfortunately, the order was not filled properly.  I was suppose to receive a case containing 6 packs of 4 cartridges.  The order only contained one pack of 4 cartridges.  When I notified Amazon of the problem, they immediately refunded the full amount of the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well and gets the job done -- both my wife and I can use them! Plus we like the ability to have Amazon automatically send these to us on a schedule we choose.</li>
            <li> This razor is terrible, for at least two reasons:    1) The cartridges are not recyclable, which makes the company&#x27;s tagline a bit of a fallacy.  2) I&#x27;m not sure what the blades are made of, but they irritated my skin so badly I had to stop using them.     On the other hand, I&#x27;m very happy with the Preserve toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> The idea is great but rendition is disappointing.  When submitted to warm to hot water, the blade cartrige constantly falls off the razor.  I tried another box, got new razor, with same result.  Useless for me.</li>
            <li> Reading reviews I thought I would regret this purchase, however it has been perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I had to use lotion after shaving or suffer razor burn. Right now I am traveling and I needed something compact,&lt;br /&gt;these work great and I have been able to use one razor for up to a week or two. Keep them dry to prevent rust.&lt;br /&gt;Often when traveling my products are in ziplock bags and slightly moist so the handle of this got a little funky before I noticed. I have no complaints and I have not had to use lotion which saves me space and money.</li>
            <li> I vote with my dollars and buy as many \\&quot;green\\&quot;/recycled products as I can.  My local store no longer carries them and I was worried I would have to switch to a new razor.  Amazon to the rescue.  They shave beautifully and the 6 pack should tide me over for quite a few months. At a price better than I was paying before to boot.</li>
            <li> Mostly I buy these because I like what the company does for the environment.  These are definitely an improvement over their original version, and the price is reasonable.  Razor blades are typically expensive.</li>
            <li> Unlike other people who have reviewed this product I have been delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product...brilliant!  I gave these a good try, but eventually I could not deny that I had a lot of new slices on my shins and knees. I usually expect a disp shaver to last at least 3-4 uses.  These did not work well for that long for me. I went sadly back to my venus shaver.  Maybe they do a better job for the men, with the angle of the blades or something. Just my opinion, my experience for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Bought these razors because I got tired of paying arm n&#x27; leg for the fusion 5blade.  Good first shave...after that feels like using a shard of glass. Better to pay the arm n&#x27; leg instead the qt of blood from all the nics.</li>
            <li> I used the double blade from the same company and they worked great. I have now switched to the triple blade and these work great too. I am not sure what problems the other reviewers have had, but I love preserve products and have no problems.</li>
            <li> My family has been using preserve products for a few years now, and I am just now getting around to reviewing them. My husband uses them, I use them, and our teenage/young adult au pair uses them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors are good. As good as anything comparable on the market, and unlike the big guys, they aren&#x27;t as crazy expensive and don&#x27;t come in all the crap packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For our family it is super practical as the fun colors of razor make it really easy to see whose is whose and yet not sacrificing quality of razor for a different look. We also appreciate that there is no animal testing with any of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, will subscribe and save, we know that we will never run out... as they are delivered quarterly to our door. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Love these! So little waste! And they get the job done just as well as any fancy razor (I&#x27;ve tried the whole lot of them!).</li>
            <li> These are only good for 1 shave, both legs, and I have very fine, blonde body hair.  I bought them because of the eco-friendly factor but if I have to use a new blade every time, then I&#x27;m creating more waste.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but I just got them and I am so excited because this is a 6 pack with four razors in each pack!! It will last me much longer than Venus, and they only give you 3 in 1 pack for almost the same price!</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades.  The titanium coating resists corrosion, allowing me to use the same blade for months at a time; and I shave in the shower daily.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the negative reviews are about.  There are not any truly environmentally friendly razors out there that I have seen.  But Preserve is doing what they can by making their products as &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; as possible.  I am now only throwing away a razor cartridge instead of an entire disposable razor with handle and blade.  These cartridges cost less than widely-know brands and they get the job done.  My girlfriend uses them for shaving her legs, and she&#x27;s very tall, so has lots to cover.  She gets several shaves out of them.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of a recycled razor, but I&#x27;d like to point out that the cartridges are NOT recyclable, just the handle. The packaging, however, is recyclable and minimal for the product. The price per cartridge is excellent, and they do last for a very long time, but the shave is not as close as you might get from some of the larger, more common razors. I have found that they work well for shaving any nooks and crannies as they are smaller and more maneuverable than many cartridge razors, and I have experienced no trouble with razor burn. I have, however, had to shave more frequently with these than with other razors. I&#x27;m continuing to purchase and recommend these in the hopes that the recyclability of the cartridges and the closeness of the shave will improve with further product development.</li>
            <li> A big box of my favorite razors, what could be better?</li>
            <li> Two stars for effort. But only two because the product is so poor. Only the razor handle is recyclable and it is so light that it feels like a disposable razor--not a great shave, bounces around. I&#x27;m careful with all razors, but this one takes extra care and still cuts easily. Bad. Also, the blade gets dull fast which is too bad because they have to be thrown out more frequently than a tough, long-lasting blade like the Gillette Fusion. These top quality razors from companies like Gillette have non-disposable handles, so you don&#x27;t throw out the handles--just the blades, like Preserve. And the blades of these big-company razors are not recyclable, but neither are Preserve&#x27;s. I threw out dull blades four times as often (no exaggeration) with the Preserve razor than with the Gillette. I would love to support this green business, but it doesn&#x27;t make sense when I&#x27;m creating MORE waste by using their product. Please create a quality razor Preserve, and I&#x27;ll give you another try.</li>
            <li> The preserve product line is good for environmentally conscious individuals and those who wish to shop cruelty free. I wish they lasted longer and weren&#x27;t as flimsy; but, they are made from recycle yogurt cups, and that&#x27;s pretty cool!</li>
            <li> They work well, they cost WAY less than brand ones. I like the idea that I dont have to throw away tons of plastic as you have to do with the regular blades. Good for pocket, good for environment.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are really nice and the fact that they are recycled material makes them even better knowing that we are helping the environment out.</li>
            <li> I love that I could find cruelty free razors and blades. Just wish they were a bit more substantial and less flimsy.</li>
            <li> GREAT value! We&#x27;ve used the razors for years. Love them.</li>
            <li> BE careful! The razor look attractive in its packaging. The blades are a good price-seem a lot cheaper than major brands. But boy! is my face a mess after trying 2 blades. I&#x27;ve never had so many nicks and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with that for years. Thank goodness for styptic pencils!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a pack of 4 blades if anyone wants them. Never again.Too bad: seemed like a good product but my faces says no way.</li>
            <li> I buy these purely because they are the only cruelty-free razor I know of.  They aren&#x27;t really the best, but I will continue on with them since they are cruelty-free.  I had emailed the company last year and they said they were working on an improved version so I hope that comes out soon!  They aren&#x27;t the worst razors, don&#x27;t get me wrong- but they are not the best.  They wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> These are super! What kind of vegan uses razors from corporations that mutilate bunnies? This kind, until I found preserve! Now I can shave my legs without hypocrisy and crushing guilt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also fast shipping and packed well.</li>
            <li> These razor blades work exceptionally well &amp; are a great value!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased with the recycled razor handle--they are a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;The triple blade gives a lovely close shave&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped shaving (ive gone Wild &amp; Natural!) but my husband continues to happily use these ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie and say when I first started using these razors it was love at first shave...because before hand I had a 4 or 5 bladed disposable.  But then I found out about how cruel the other razors are and couldn&#x27;t keep using them.  Now, after a few shaves, I love these razors.  They are durable, smoothing and get the job done.  Plus they are better for the environment! Works for me!</li>
            <li> Never thought about it before, but many of the most popular razors on the market use chemicals in their mosturizing strip. I like these razors because they use all natural products to moisturize.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a razor that is recyclable and made of recycled plastic.  You get a little case to return your razor for recycling.  The blades work fine and last a long time.  They are similar to the American Safety Razor brand of blades.  Thanks to preserve, you can be more earth friendly and still have smooth legs.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for about 5 years now! I will never go back! They are not always the easiest to find, so i usually stock up when i do!</li>
