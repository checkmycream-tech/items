            <li> This product rocks!! My hair looked defined right after! Ladies hate the frizz...USE THIS.  Shipping is very swift too. It&#x27;s a very natural product for those of you folks who like organic. SHOP HERE!</li>
            <li> Love it. I can comb right through my natural hair after washing.</li>
            <li> This is a gem for dry ends. I&#x27;ve used this for years and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This stuff is THICK THICK THICK!!! I love that about a deep conditioner. Now this product smells nice, had no real slip (which I&#x27;m okay with), and does its J-O-B! Only thing is remember this has protein in it therefore I would not recommend this being used every week if your moisture balance is off.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great! I recently moved to an area with hard water so every time I wash my hair it is tangled, extremely dry and frizzy. This conditioner was great for strengthening my curls and preventing breakage.</li>
            <li> I have used before and never track the results this time I will but it does make your hair really soft which is what I need my hair is extra hard and dry!</li>
            <li> My hair is silky and full of body. I am using toque magico on my 7 years old daughter as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this conditioner.  It works very well and makes my hair soft.  It was delivered on time and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT ON EXTREME DAMAGED DRY BRITTLE HAIR AND AFRO HAIR. IF YOUR HAIR IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF AN EMERGENCY FIX , THIS IS THE PRODUCT TO USE. THIS TREATMENT WORKS LIKE AN UPSCALE TREATMENT $70. - UP. ITS THE BEST. U GET AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT FOR THE PRICE. I CAN DO HAIR COMMERCIALS NOW THAT MY HAIR IS SO BEAUTIFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE EXTREME DAMAGED HAIR, THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> Really helps with tangles and dryness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good deep conditioner for African American women with natural hair. I used it with my steamer and my hair was super soft</li>
            <li> I was put on to this product by a friend of mine. I had just taken out my weave and my hair was damaged. I felt a difference in my hair the first time I used it. I recommend this product to anyone. It even worked for my sister.</li>
            <li> This product is a staple in a lot of Dominican households and it does contain mineral oil and parabens, therefore it does not get 5 stars. Does make hair manageable, but nothing WOW about it. I will stick with my bentonite clay, amla powder and coconut milk deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair. Leave it soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I have been getting my hair done my Dominicans since I decided to go from natural to processed hair (I was natural-only getting it pressed for 19 years). I have long hair that is pretty thick and my issue was that I wanted to make sure that after washing, my hair still had moisture (especially since I have to use dandruff shampoo which leaves it really dry). I constantly saw my hairdresser use these only when customers paid extra so I found it on here. I usually use Silicon but I liked how my hair felt after using this product (moisturized and smelling great). I would definitely recommend it. Don&#x27;t be put off by how it looks (honestly, it looked like something someone threw up). Worked great.</li>
            <li> I love Emergencia and the Dominican Salons always sell them for about $30.00. To be able to buy it at a lower price is wonderful and it does hair great! It helps it grow , stay strong and keep beautiful. I am so happy with the product I will keep ordering from this buyer!</li>
