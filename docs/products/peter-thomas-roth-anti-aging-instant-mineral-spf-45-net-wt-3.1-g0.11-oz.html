            <li>This is the PERFECT SPF protection for me if I&#x27;m on the go and do not need anything waterproof.</li>
            <li>Love!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for reapplication over make-up!  </li>
            <li>The color is kind of orange which makes it the perfect product for us.</li>
            <li>Great idea</li>
            <li>This is great for my face, arms, neck, and ears.</li>
            <li>This product was a great find.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S GREAT POWDER</li>
            <li>Its a great way to protect your skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is so great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for those with oily skin because since its a powder and not a lotion it doesn&#x27;t make your face feel</li>
            <li>This is a great and very handy product but carrying it in my purse shakes it up</li>
            <li>It is easy and perfect sun protection.  </li>
            <li>Great product--used its predecessor and loved it--very convenient to always have sunscreen handy</li>
            <li>Basically a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good packaging idea and perhaps a good product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often rate, but when I do, it must be awesome, so be cool like me and get it.  </li>
            <li>So glad i found this product online!</li>
            <li>Works great when you are on the slopes snow skiing because it is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so I have no clue whether or not it is effective</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it&#x27;s actually effective as sun protection because I am unwilling to leave the house looking</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if the product works or not or if it&#x27;s even depositing onto my skin.</li>
            <li>I really liked using a powder as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and even though I have a fairly tan complexion, it didn&#x27;t leave me looking like I was coated in powder.</li>
            <li>I own another brand and it works much better.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy I ordered it!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love the ease of this product.  </li>
            <li>Such a great way to protect your skin!</li>
            <li>But I love how I can carry it with me</li>
            <li>Love the product and convenience of the product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t burn easily</li>
            <li>and they can tell easily if a product works well, but they are both away for the summer.  </li>
            <li>so you can easily tell when there&#x27;s powder on it.  </li>
            <li>Applies easily</li>
            <li>It is so easy to brush on sunblock instead of smearing some greasy lotion all over.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>On side note, the cap is the cheapest flimsiest cap ever and cracked easily.</li>
            <li>sure how to clean bristles without ruining the powder inside the shaft</li>
            <li>Need a strong sunscreen all the time.</li>
            <li>Although I admit I have not yet got any kind of burn on my face, I do apply first the Peter Thomas 45 spf lotion which I</li>
            <li>whole reason for choosing a powder mineral sunblock is that you can get a good clean formula without all the parabens and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it looks fine, but it others</li>
            <li>Its light and easy to just brush on over makeup during your day.</li>
            <li>Such a great product - easy to re-apply.</li>
            <li>This iis a great product to use when you are going outside and want uv coverage --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li>Great idea, but falls short because of orange color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, fits in my purse, and feels light on my face.  </li>
            <li>to another room right away, you&#x27;d be OK.  </li>
            <li>The size is small, perfect for your purse.  </li>
            <li>I was originally excited about this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail and use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best way to apply sunscreen to my face without rubbing hot, grainy sand into my skin, but like other reviewers said, you will get some stares.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if there was a way to control the amount that came through the brush it might be better (you can make more come out, but not less).</li>
            <li>i found my  make up bag full of  powder</li>
            <li>I bought this product in early April to have for the nice weather.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-it looks cool</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I can quickly pull this stick out of my purse, and brush the powder on my face on top of my makeup...</li>
            <li>This is also a good price and higher SPF compared to most other powder-based sunscreens I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>there is not enough powder coming out of the brush, so I have to push the brush again my face too many times, as far as it&#x27;s a good product,</li>
            <li>so I am always looking for natural and better options.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have really light skin, but this still made my face look dark and kind of orange.</li>
            <li>However, this product is NOT translucent as the product description states; it was WAY too dark for my fair skin, almost like a bronzer.</li>
            <li>And the powder comes down generously which is good for application.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this instant mineral SPF.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased Peter Roth powder sunscreen several times and I love it.</li>
            <li>But, when I apply the product, I love the consistency and the smoothing quality much like bare minerals.</li>
            <li>Anyone with suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li>I was given this as a gift and my first response was...</li>
            <li>I was pretty embarrassed using this at the beach since it looked like I was primping myself up for the seagulls or something.</li>
            <li>I hope there is actual proof that this stuff actually works as good sunblock.</li>
            <li>Kept refreshing it on my long hot summer tour in the deserts of Israel.  </li>
            <li>But, I carry it in my purse so that when that oil breaks through in the early afternoon I have a great way to tame it.</li>
            <li>I really like the concept and the convenience, but who wants to look like an Oopaloompa!</li>
            <li>I try to wear SPF as much as possible, and this makes it easy without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell how well it works.  </li>
            <li>Could not figure out how much tapping I needed to do before the powder would release.</li>
            <li>Keep getting too much out.</li>
            <li>The idea behind this product is great.  </li>
            <li>really like.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>having to use hands to apply a liquid sunscreen is really convenient</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup regularly (i.e., girls like me and most dudes), then you&#x27;ll feel pretty self-conscious using this product in public.</li>
            <li>I usually love this product, but for some reason the brush would not go down very well.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily in combination with regular liquid sunscreen since this is easy to reapply and maintain consistent sun protection throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and I got a mild (gone the next day)</li>
            <li>Particularly the beach.</li>
            <li>I think the dust cloud that happens when applying it can hurt your eyes under normal use.</li>
            <li>a nice side-effect!&lt;br /&gt;it is a little pricey, but if it continues to work well and last as long as they claim, it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Very powdery and made huge mess.  </li>
            <li>This container is orange and the powder was too dark for my light olive skin tone.</li>
            <li>It goes on sheer and seems to protect my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to regular sunscreens</li>
            <li>I bring it with me whenever I am in direct sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I like this product and because I&#x27;m naturally oily anyway, I like using a powder sunscreen on my face rather than a moisturizer with SPF which seems to make me even oilier.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 one to for a gift and one for me, after barely using it</li>
            <li>It barely comes out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the directions about a 100 times and no matter what I can barely get any of the product to reach through the brush.</li>
            <li>So misleading since I can barely get ANY out.</li>
            <li>My skin is far less sensitive to this product</li>
            <li>If I stand in direct sunlight and apply it, I sometimes see swirls of powder wafting up into the air, but other than that, it&#x27;s pretty much a guessing game.</li>
            <li>It is also very blendable for all other hair and skin types, I will never be without this stuff!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money but the other ones I have had came in white tubes with black writing.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra money but the other ones I have had came in white tubes with black writing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to stop the powder from coming out (or if there is, I haven&#x27;t found it), so while it sits in my purse, powder falls down into the cap the whole time and makes a big mess when I open it, even when I try to be careful.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long this lasts.</li>
            <li> The only time I got a little burned was wearing sunglasses after riding my horses for several hours in the heat, the sweat from under my eyes caused the powder run</li>
            <li> Only the brush is a little prickly and not enough powder in the tube for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you brushed it on then waited some period of time for the powder cloud to settle, or walk (with eyes closed!)</li>
            <li> The bottle actually has a neat sleeve that pulls up so you can put the cap back on without destroying your bristles.  </li>
            <li> BUT I am kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Actually has shockingly little number of uses per container, something one cannot realize until buying the product.</li>
            <li> What I like about this is that unlike some other powder sunscreens the bristles are black instead of white</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A must have for all red heads. The color is kind of orange which makes it the perfect product for us. It is also very blendable for all other hair and skin types, I will never be without this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really light skin, but this still made my face look dark and kind of orange. There&#x27;s no way to stop the powder from coming out (or if there is, I haven&#x27;t found it), so while it sits in my purse, powder falls down into the cap the whole time and makes a big mess when I open it, even when I try to be careful. It wastes a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Basically a good product. Remember to apply a lot of it. I don&#x27;t miss the greasy residue on my hands that I get with regular sun screen.</li>
            <li> This iis a great product to use when you are going outside and want uv coverage -- I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often rate, but when I do, it must be awesome, so be cool like me and get it.  Nuff said.</li>
            <li> Great idea but it left my face greezy</li>
            <li> Very powdery and made huge mess.  I own another brand and it works much better.</li>
            <li> The second use of this product the bottom pulled all the way out and product spilled all over!  It&#x27;s a good packaging idea and perhaps a good product but functionally it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Peter Roth powder sunscreen several times and I love it. It&#x27;s worth the extra money but the other ones I have had came in white tubes with black writing. This container is orange and the powder was too dark for my light olive skin tone. In fact the powder had an orange tint and after 6 uses the bottom of the tube fell out and the expensive powder went all over. I bought this product in anticipation of summer and it arrived a few weeks ago so the return window is closed. Next time I will buy the white tube from sephora -- this stuff is to expensive to risk having it spilt all over the floor again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned but I don&#x27;t burn easily so I can&#x27;t really tell how well it works.  Usually I ask my two red headed friends to test a spot on themselves with a sunscreen for me because they burn in about 5 minutes and they can tell easily if a product works well, but they are both away for the summer.  What I like about this is that unlike some other powder sunscreens the bristles are black instead of white so you can easily tell when there&#x27;s powder on it.  And the powder comes down generously which is good for application.</li>
            <li> The powder gets out and it&#x27;s a mess</li>
            <li> Actually has shockingly little number of uses per container, something one cannot realize until buying the product.</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT SPF protection for me if I&#x27;m on the go and do not need anything waterproof. I love this stuff bc sometimes I don&#x27;t like that feeling of using SPF lotion on my skin. This is great for my face, arms, neck, and ears. It&#x27;s especially convenient to apply on kids!! Don&#x27;t leave home without this. I always stock up.</li>
            <li> This product was a great find. Saw a relative had it with color, I got a plain one. Love!!!!</li>
            <li> I brush this powder on my face and hands before leaving work every day. I really like the fact that I can quickly pull this stick out of my purse, and brush the powder on my face on top of my makeup...but just can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s actually working as SPF45 sunblock...... I am very allergic to regular sunscreens so I am always looking for natural and better options. I hope there is actual proof that this stuff actually works as good sunblock.</li>
            <li> I usually love this product, but for some reason the brush would not go down very well. As a result, all of the powder spilled out. I don&#x27;t know if they switched manufacturers or I was just unlucky.</li>
            <li> This powder is not translucent, it&#x27;s a darker color. Also there are parabens and ingredients in it not listed here on Amazon.  Not happy . Sent it back.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought this sunscreen because it was too hard to reapply my liquid sunscreen during the day.  This stuff is great. It goes on sheer and seems to protect my skin pretty well. I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m using enough, but I do see the dust puffing out when I shake it, so I&#x27;ll assume that it&#x27;s getting applied properly. I haven&#x27;t burned or freckled excessively since I started using it.  The size is small, perfect for your purse.  The bottle actually has a neat sleeve that pulls up so you can put the cap back on without destroying your bristles.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again when I finish this bottle. We&#x27;ll see how long this lasts.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 one to for a gift and one for me, after barely using it i found my  make up bag full of  powder as the twist cap has open. then my friend told me that the same thing happens to her. I tried to get it replaced but ii has pass the 30 days return policy.  $43 dollar wasted.</li>
            <li> bottom of tube appears to leak a bit--like the concept and powder itself.</li>
            <li> So glad i found this product online!</li>
            <li> I have been using this  on my face for years.  I keep one in my purse, one on my bureau, and one in the car.  It is easy and perfect sun protection.  Applies easily, no greasy-ness, no smell.  I wore it during  a 3 week trip to Kauai--no sunburn.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in early April to have for the nice weather. I finally had the opportunity to use it yesterday - unfortunately it is too late to return it - after 30 days - even though I just opened it. It is definitely not translucent!! Some places it looks fine, but it others it is orange and streaky (which makes me wonder about even coverage, too). Perhaps if there was a way to control the amount that came through the brush it might be better (you can make more come out, but not less). I really like the concept and the convenience, but who wants to look like an Oopaloompa! Would never apply this without watching very carefully in a mirror. There has to be a way to make this product without it being orange. Great idea, but falls short because of orange color.</li>
            <li> there is not enough powder coming out of the brush, so I have to push the brush again my face too many times, as far as it&#x27;s a good product, IT&#x27;S GREAT POWDER, I do not feel the sun burning my face when I am wearing it, IT&#x27;S JUST THE BRUSH THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED.  I will not repurchase this product again, I tested another brush similar and powder comes out in the amount i need.</li>
            <li> It looks like it has been used and the powder was all over the box. Didn&#x27;t get a chance to even use it.</li>
            <li> Such a great product - easy to re-apply.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting g the colour to be so dark.</li>
            <li> Works great when you are on the slopes snow skiing because it is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> i thought this was a regular sunblock.  didn&#x27;t know it would look like girls make up with sparkles in it.  let&#x27;s just say it won&#x27;t be living in my golf bag.</li>
            <li> Its a great way to protect your skin.  I bring it with me whenever I am in direct sunlight.  Its light and easy to just brush on over makeup during your day.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of this product.  I try to wear SPF as much as possible, and this makes it easy without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product--used its predecessor and loved it--very convenient to always have sunscreen handy</li>
            <li> I keep this in my car, not like liquid or cream type product, this one can be kept in the car without separating or change consistency.</li>
            <li> The bottom fell off and I lost the product in the sink so I have no clue whether or not it is effective</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I HATE the feel of traditional sunscreen and, because of that, never wore it. After yet another sunburn, I found this. It was a little tricky to get enough to dispense initially, but tapping it against a hard surface helped. It goes on easy and even though I have a fairly tan complexion, it didn&#x27;t leave me looking like I was coated in powder. The only time I got a little burned was wearing sunglasses after riding my horses for several hours in the heat, the sweat from under my eyes caused the powder run and I got a mild (gone the next day) burn. My skin is far less sensitive to this product and I keep it in my purse always. I also noticed when I wore it my skin appeared less oily in the heat...a nice side-effect!&lt;br /&gt;it is a little pricey, but if it continues to work well and last as long as they claim, it was worth every penny! So far, I am very happy I ordered it!</li>
            <li> I used this for over a month I notice no difference in my skin and find this to be a waist of my money and time.</li>
            <li> I like this product and because I&#x27;m naturally oily anyway, I like using a powder sunscreen on my face rather than a moisturizer with SPF which seems to make me even oilier.</li>
            <li> Such a great way to protect your skin!</li>
            <li> This is the firs time I have used a powder sunscreen that works.  Only the brush is a little prickly and not enough powder in the tube for me. But used it constantly at the seashore and skiing. Need a strong sunscreen all the time. Only thing is that PRT doesn&#x27;t seem to make it anymore;</li>
            <li> This product is so great.  I tend to be oily so never use sunscreen.  But, I carry it in my purse so that when that oil breaks through in the early afternoon I have a great way to tame it.</li>
            <li> Could not figure out how much tapping I needed to do before the powder would release. Keep getting too much out. :-( But, when I apply the product, I love the consistency and the smoothing quality much like bare minerals. I keep this product in my car as touch-up later in the day for the sunscreen factor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be translucent, but it&#x27;s actually orange. I have no idea if it&#x27;s actually effective as sun protection because I am unwilling to leave the house looking like I rubbed Cheeto dust all over my face.</li>
            <li> The idea behind this product is great.  It is so easy to brush on sunblock instead of smearing some greasy lotion all over.  My kids who hate sunblock even tolerated this.  Unfortunately, after using this frequently for a couple of months, my eyes started to hurt and turn red.  After a visit to the eye doctor, I learned the powder caused scratches on my corneas.  Obviously, I didn&#x27;t brush it in my eyes on purpose, nor do I remember any accidents using the product.  I think the dust cloud that happens when applying it can hurt your eyes under normal use. Maybe if you brushed it on then waited some period of time for the powder cloud to settle, or walk (with eyes closed!) to another room right away, you&#x27;d be OK.  Unfortunately, I had serious damage to my eyes.  Before you put this on, or put it on your kids, please use with care.  Whatever is in it can not only cause eye irritation but corneal abrasions.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily in combination with regular liquid sunscreen since this is easy to reapply and maintain consistent sun protection throughout the day. This is also a good price and higher SPF compared to most other powder-based sunscreens I&#x27;ve found. However, this product is NOT translucent as the product description states; it was WAY too dark for my fair skin, almost like a bronzer. I ended up having to empty the powder into an old sifter jar and mix it with a white foundation base I already had so that it would blend in with my skin tone and not look odd.</li>
            <li> This is a great and very handy product but carrying it in my purse shakes it up I think - so when I go to use it there&#x27;s a lot of powder coming through the brush and it can be a lot so you have to shake it out a bit. But I love how I can carry it with me and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was originally excited about this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail and use BUT I am kind of disappointed. It barely comes out and I can&#x27;t even tell if there&#x27;s any product on. I&#x27;ve read the directions about a 100 times and no matter what I can barely get any of the product to reach through the brush. Although I admit I have not yet got any kind of burn on my face, I do apply first the Peter Thomas 45 spf lotion which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows a massive amount of mineral powder on the tip of the brush! So misleading since I can barely get ANY out. Anyone with suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift and my first response was... ick!&lt;br /&gt;The whole reason for choosing a powder mineral sunblock is that you can get a good clean formula without all the parabens and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it takes a while to find it, but here is what i found...&lt;br /&gt;Dipeptide Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide 5, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glycolic Acid, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide 7, Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Water (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propyparaben, Isobutylparaben, ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Love the product and convenience of the product. Kept refreshing it on my long hot summer tour in the deserts of Israel.  I used it with other suntan lotion. Unlike similar visits without it, my face was spared from Burns. On side note, the cap is the cheapest flimsiest cap ever and cracked easily.</li>
            <li> ...Hence the 2 stars. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if the product works or not or if it&#x27;s even depositing onto my skin. If I stand in direct sunlight and apply it, I sometimes see swirls of powder wafting up into the air, but other than that, it&#x27;s pretty much a guessing game. Here&#x27;s my condensed list of thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-not having to use hands to apply a liquid sunscreen is really convenient&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t feel sticky&lt;br /&gt;-it looks cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-bristles were stiff (felt like I was poking holes into my skin and scratching it up)&lt;br /&gt;-can&#x27;t tell if product is being dispensed properly&lt;br /&gt;-can&#x27;t tell if I used enough product or not&lt;br /&gt;-product seems to just blow away if applied on drier skin (aka recommended use on moist/oily skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Not sure how to clean bristles without ruining the powder inside the shaft so there&#x27;s oil/dirt/sebum build-up on the brush over time&lt;br /&gt;-cap cracked with just a few travels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I was pretty embarrassed using this at the beach since it looked like I was primping myself up for the seagulls or something. XP It&#x27;s the best way to apply sunscreen to my face without rubbing hot, grainy sand into my skin, but like other reviewers said, you will get some stares. Like this --&gt; O.o&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So! If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup regularly (i.e., girls like me and most dudes), then you&#x27;ll feel pretty self-conscious using this product in public. Particularly the beach. If you&#x27;re used to wearing makeup on the daily and it&#x27;s no big secret that you do, then this will just be like another product you put on your face.</li>
            <li> I really liked using a powder as a sunscreen. The product does work: refined pores, reduced appearances of wrinkles, and it&#x27;s great for those with oily skin because since its a powder and not a lotion it doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The container/applicator could use a redesign. It spills a little when u close it.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this instant mineral SPF.  It&#x27;s convenient, fits in my purse, and feels light on my face.  But it&#x27;s messy, everytime you open the cap, or but the cap back on, be prepared to battle a mini-powder cloud.  Suggest you not use this product in small enclosed spaces.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I am always on the go. It&#x27;s great for reapplication over make-up!  Goes on sheer. No&lt;br /&gt;Glitter/shimmer</li>
