            <li>As good as any hair dryer I have used.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy considering the price.</li>

            <li>Does the job fine, great price.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful and sturdy blow dryer for a very good price.  </li>
            <li>nice price.</li>
            <li>and we liked it</li>
            <li>It is nice and compact.</li>
            <li>The thumb temperature control exceeded my expectations, and was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It folds up nicely.  </li>
            <li>I was very under impressed with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>its works well and its handy and nice for when I&#x27;m traveling</li>
            <li>My wife liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>folds up nicely</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect size for her and eventually she will be able to do it on her own as she gets older!</li>
            <li>Regarding it size, which is the best for traveling, the power is good enough.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great brand, but the very first time we used it the switch to turn it on/off got stuck in</li>
            <li>The handle folds so that it is slightly more compact, which is nice.</li>
            <li>it collapses and in my tiny apt bathroom cabinet that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>but they still work perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>it is powerful and compact, it folds and it dries hair very good and quick</li>
            <li>It is fine in the US, and does fold nice and compactly for travel.</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOW YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU  </li>
            <li>Has held up for more than a year now.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see why anyone would spend more.</li>
            <li>love it....</li>
            <li>Good basic construction and great price.</li>
            <li>It works ok for that</li>
            <li>Bought love want to get one for my daughter</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t need to, and I&#x27;m glad for that</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>Took it on two trips now and love it.  </li>
            <li>It is also very sleek and attractive.</li>
            <li>Love the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love the size of this unit, and it works well with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than that.</li>
            <li>Should have known better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about all there is to say, except that this review required me to write more words.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask more for the money.</li>
            <li>This is the best dryer on the market--and it&#x27;s under ten bucks!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I love this dryer\\&quot;--because</li>
            <li>I rarely love ANY product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with its blowing power as well as its quick heating.</li>
            <li>Not expensive, excellent products, shipping fast.</li>
            <li>I used it for a long time...now...and the way it works is really awesome...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for when I just need to dry my bangs.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, it is potent and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Does the job well, is inexpensive, compact, elegant and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived</li>
            <li>Very light weight and compact, which is so important when traveling.</li>
            <li>great size, easy to use and good for travelling - fits well in suitcase and ready to go - highly recommended</li>
            <li>Compact for packing, optimal speeds and performance for a quick use and most importantly multi-voltage settings within this amazing price range.</li>
            <li>It worked well on the low and cool settings, and in America all settings work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I had gotten a slightly better dryer given that I use it one or two times a week, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>Powerful and nice price.</li>
            <li>Some of Revlon&#x27;s hair dryers are good and some not so much.</li>
            <li>My six-year-old daughter has wanted her own hair dryer for some time, and this is perfect; it&#x27;s small and light</li>
            <li>Compact and easy.</li>
            <li>It is lite weight, so its easy to handle.</li>
            <li>So I can take it easy when I on a trip.</li>
            <li>I can store it easily in the bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>And the switch makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is a good dryer, but it hesitates before going to high speed.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing for its size.  </li>
            <li>It works as well as the full sized one I&#x27;ve got that we paid a lot more for.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the product and the speed settings and the cool option.  </li>
            <li>the perfect size for traveling and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space on my vanity when I lay it down..</li>
            <li>Small compact with nice power and a very good price.</li>
            <li>Just works fine and even folds up for storage.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>Folds up easy to fit in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>Lasts just fine.</li>
            <li>Again though, I&#x27;m fine with that delay for the price of the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>so it is fine for me</li>
            <li>Perfect little companion at home or not.</li>
            <li>I only use it for sixty seconds a day if that so for what I use it for, its great.  </li>
            <li>I tried as having MS even something as light as a hairdryer - combined with angle needed of arms - tires me.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it was much more powerful</li>
            <li>and I bought one just like it, because i liked it so much.</li>
            <li>There is a no heat setting to use as a blower, I use to light my BBQ and to chase my dog around.</li>
            <li>It also has a cool button for a burst of cool air!</li>
            <li>very powerful.</li>
            <li>And if I ever need to pack it, it&#x27;s super easy to fold up the handle.</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>Small, lightweight, and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful dryer for it&#x27;s size and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>It works better than my large blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Nice little compact dryer perfect for traveling or for a younger child to use (with supervision!).</li>
            <li>I love it so much, got my daughter one to take with her on vacation.</li>
            <li>very useful.everybody will be satisfied with this product .</li>
            <li>the cool air button just turns the heater off makes sense.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as any full size hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, and having gone to beauty school</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice and compact, but it&#x27;s way too loud.</li>
            <li>good for daily use</li>
            <li>but super find - it was an ad on item for like $9.</li>
            <li>It also dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very portable, great for occasional use.</li>
            <li>Lots of power, it quickly dries my hair.</li>
            <li>that does not make it travel worthy.  </li>
            <li>For 1875w the temperature isn&#x27;t high, but I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it works good for me.</li>
            <li>Works great and is so small and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Very small/compact and this dryer heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>so I returned it and bought a compact Conair Travel Smart that works fine and</li>
            <li>and it stopped blowing hot air!</li>
            <li>The unit is compact, folding option allows you to save space in your bag, option of daul amp is great for traveling overseas , having cold bottom is good for hair styling, oval is a great product, highly recommend for short hair.</li>
            <li>Great power for a little guy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special, it blows hot air.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, just the right size for everyday use, handy, easy to use, easy to store, dual voltage, and value for money.</li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>Cant complain much, ,it is worth for it is priced for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot.&lt;br /&gt;One thing worth mentioning</li>
            <li>Powerful and lightweight.</li>
            <li>Small, easy to use, good quality, everything i was looking for in a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It was just the right price</li>
            <li>Only draw back is the dryer is very loud, if you care about that then the dryer really is perfect.</li>
            <li>My wife needed a small hair dryer to go in her travel bag for our honeymoon, and this one worked great for that purpose.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few hair dryers that I have found that has good high heat and a strong blowing force.</li>
            <li>No matter what kind of dryer I buy, I cannot get her dry.</li>
            <li>Small but very effective.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>very very awsome product.</li>
            <li>It is a good little hair dryer for the price thank you.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see my new Hair dyer had arrived.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it switches from super powerful to regular on its own but for the price it is well worth the ADD on for only $9.</li>
            <li>It has a low and high option and also the cool setting which I love.</li>
            <li>Had one just like this for 20 years before it finally broke, so I&#x27;m glad I found this again.</li>
            <li>This one was exactly like the one I was replacing</li>
            <li>is fast to send and it is powerful,</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I love your products, next time I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>it happens within the first 20-30 seconds into drying.</li>
            <li>It quit blowing hot air after 4 uses.  </li>
            <li>It stopped to blow hot air today.</li>
            <li>Works in a pinch for drying hair too, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis since the compact design isn&#x27;t the most ergonomic.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for different locations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one of these I got on high overheated quickly for no reason and then began cycling.  </li>
            <li>Works well not as fast or hit ask larger ones but easy to hold not heavy and is just fine</li>
            <li>Disregarding the defect of overheating too easily because that was an obvious defect, the way it responded to being too hot makes no sense.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well and was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>It worked very well and was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>And forget anything with a retractable cord (which absolutely will NOT retract correctly after the first 5 uses--you&#x27;re a goof if you think I&#x27;m kidding).</li>
            <li>Mainly, it was too big for my travel needs, but it did work fine and the price was right, so I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li>Extra points for the folding handle which makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Travel Smart by ConAir is a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li>I am returning this and have already ordered the Conair Travel Smart.</li>
            <li>This one is more powerful and sturdier than the previous hairdryer I owned.</li>
            <li>Meaning that I&#x27;m spending MORE time trying to dry my hair!</li>
            <li>It was fine for ten bucks</li>
            <li>Great if you need to dry your hair but not great if you need to plug anything else like one more into the plug.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I would have to carefully push the cord back up into the retractable hair dryer so this new Relon unit is more convenient for me.</li>
            <li>nice little travel dryer.</li>
            <li>Nice little dryer doesn&#x27;t take up much cupboard space and works like a trooper.  </li>
            <li>Hard to beat the price for a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty frizzy afterwards, even while using my usual (and amazing) oil based heat protector.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light enough to hang on a command hook i put underneith there</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I do not need so much wattage or so much pressure, but it works for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get to use it much.</li>
            <li>So compact and doesnt take up much storage space.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is compact enough to fit in the vanity drawer, I also toss it in my gym bag .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very compcat and a very rasonable price.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Cant expect much for 10 bucks.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li>but it works fast and is very powerful,&lt;br /&gt;does not overheat</li>
            <li>Simply use cool and hot.</li>
            <li>I liked very much because it is small and easy to carry on during long trips.</li>
            <li>Ideal for small bathrooms with limited storage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not powerful enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li>but it took a while to dry my fine hair</li>
            <li>And, it folds up nice and small, so it fits in her backpack when she goes to a friend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li>small compact and folds up nicely.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;re left standing there either blowing into the fan or swinging it with your arm to get cool air into the unit to cool it off so the dryer kicks back on again.</li>
            <li>I liked that small size of the dryer and carried it with me on vacation to the D.R.</li>
            <li>It is pretty loud so all your neighbors will know you&#x27;re blowing something</li>
            <li>Delivers a lot more air than my 15-hear old dryer, and plenty hot enough shortly after it starts up.</li>
            <li>So, my satisfaction with this unit is mainly from my perspective.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be realistic.  </li>
            <li>is that while in the United Kingdom, I used it with an outlet converter and it would get very very hot and the inside wiring would turn orange as if it was overheating- only on the highest power setting.  </li>
            <li>I like the size, shape and weight of this hair dryer but it doesn&#x27;t have a high a setting as I would like to get the job done faster.</li>
            <li>and I can feel as if the heating element is working a bit judging by the smell of it, but not hot enough to warm up the air.</li>
            <li>and I can feel as if the heating element is working a bit judging by the smell of it, but not hot enough to warm up the air.</li>
            <li>As anyone with long or thick  hair has probably experienced with a hair dryer before, if you continually use the high setting it can over heat and just shut off...</li>
            <li>But its a bit loud, didnt expect it to be so much.</li>
            <li>SIMPLY ISN&#x27;T WORTH</li>
            <li>It kicks out HOT air in a hurry, has two speeds and a cool-down button when it starts to get too hot (which isn&#x27;t long).</li>
            <li>The Revlon 1875w Compact Stylist Dryer works as well as my larger Remington Supersonic and gets the job done quickly, though, loudly.</li>
            <li>This is good for daily and travel uses, and for alternate uses aside from hair (need to dry something quick - glue, something you got wet, who knows) it&#x27;ll do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is strong enough that i only need it for about sixty seconds a day.</li>
            <li>pretty thick too.&lt;br /&gt;The issue I have with this dryer is that it has an auto-cool on it, meaning it will blow super hot air on high for about 20-30 seconds</li>
            <li>But, for this cheap price, I can take it on my trip and leave it there if I don&#x27;t have enough room on the way back!</li>
            <li>It does blow very hot air, something I need because my hair is VERY long (to my waist) and</li>
            <li>I like a smaller unit that is also travel ready, so I did like the small size and the fold away handle that makes packing it up for travel very easy.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It a basic dryer, I will recommend go for a  higher model if u can.</li>
            <li>I like the size, etc., but it doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Got the first of these at Wal-Mart, and bought the second one from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>and the air still wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li>I bought this mini hair dryer for my 2 yr old daughter who has a lot of hair!</li>
            <li>This little dryer is more powerful than my much much more expensive Oster unit which hangs on the wall.</li>
            <li>Would at least like to get a year&#x27;s worth of effort out something designed to break quickly.</li>
            <li>Blows super powerful to dry the long hair that reaches to the bottom of my back.</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t see anything wring with the unit or have any complaints.</li>
            <li>because I use it frequently at home.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty long line.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I realize they put this feature on it to help keep the dryer from overheating and thus shutting off completely.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>For a small dryer, it&#x27;s pretty powerful, and I&#x27;d take it on trips.</li>
            <li>When I turned it on on high setting, it made an extreme loud noise (eeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!)</li>
            <li>I have only used this dryer a few times, but for the price it is a decent product, since it folds for packing, it does not produce a huge air volume, but then I do not have a lot of hair</li>
            <li>its small easy to store.</li>
            <li>If you need a full-time hair dryer, this will work fine, but I was looking for a small hair dryer for traveling.</li>
            <li>First of all, this dryer says &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34;, but I would say it was slightly smaller than standard size.  </li>
            <li>I turned it on on low setting and it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li>Quite the rough one, will dry your hair quickly on the high setting.</li>
            <li>The fan went from high to low and the heater went off.  </li>
            <li>After a minute or so it would turn the heater on and the fan back to high and start the cycle over again.  </li>
            <li>no matter what setting you select (low or high)</li>
            <li>I want a dryer that gives me constant heat on HIGH like</li>
            <li>no matter what setting you select (low or high)</li>
            <li>It works both at low and high speeps, when operating in 125V.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>But, this tiny dynamo dried very fast, did the straight hair thing on curling brush - and weighs like a dandelion!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is light and small.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE FINE HAIR.  </li>
            <li>Only 2 speeds - high and low - and the air wasn&#x27;t really much cooler with the low speed.</li>
            <li>It is not small size not too big~!</li>
            <li>This little hair dry will do the job is easy to fold and take with you any where you go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed how powerful this little hairdryer is.  </li>
            <li>Powerful for a little blow dryer.</li>
            <li>But it takes about a second for the high power to actually get power.</li>
            <li>Apparently I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it is extremely loud.  </li>
            <li>Of course its for daily use, dont expect a professional treatment.</li>
            <li>It definitely blows hard and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>After using less than 10 times, it stopped blowing hot air.  </li>
            <li>Turn the heater off sure, but switching the fan to low is just dumb.  </li>
            <li>multiple settings on such a small, cheap device are a plus.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well it worked and how fast it dried my hair.  </li>
            <li>Again, I only use it on short hair and not everyday.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda loud and not all that much smaller than my regular hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>As I a frequent traveler outside US, needed multiple voltage settings and this dryer met all my criteria.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and powerful.  </li>
            <li>though it uses the same energy as other high end models .</li>
            <li>It folds in half for easy storage in a small space and for tucking inside a suitcase.  </li>

            <li> I was very under impressed with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> its works well and its handy and nice for when I&#x27;m traveling</li>
            <li> My wife liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> folds up nicely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect size for her and eventually she will be able to do it on her own as she gets older!</li>
            <li> Regarding it size, which is the best for traveling, the power is good enough.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great brand, but the very first time we used it the switch to turn it on/off got stuck in</li>
            <li> The handle folds so that it is slightly more compact, which is nice.</li>
            <li> it collapses and in my tiny apt bathroom cabinet that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> but they still work perfectly fine!</li>

            <li> Bought love want to get one for my daughter</li>

            <li> Love the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love the size of this unit, and it works well with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than that.</li>
            <li> Should have known better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about all there is to say, except that this review required me to write more words.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask more for the money.</li>
            <li> This is the best dryer on the market--and it&#x27;s under ten bucks!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I love this dryer\\&quot;--because</li>
            <li> I rarely love ANY product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with its blowing power as well as its quick heating.</li>
            <li> Not expensive, excellent products, shipping fast.</li>
            <li> I used it for a long time...now...and the way it works is really awesome...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for when I just need to dry my bangs.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, it is potent and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Does the job well, is inexpensive, compact, elegant and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived</li>
            <li> Very light weight and compact, which is so important when traveling.</li>
            <li> great size, easy to use and good for travelling - fits well in suitcase and ready to go - highly recommended</li>
            <li> Compact for packing, optimal speeds and performance for a quick use and most importantly multi-voltage settings within this amazing price range.</li>
            <li> It worked well on the low and cool settings, and in America all settings work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish I had gotten a slightly better dryer given that I use it one or two times a week, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> Powerful and nice price.</li>
            <li> Some of Revlon&#x27;s hair dryers are good and some not so much.</li>
            <li> My six-year-old daughter has wanted her own hair dryer for some time, and this is perfect; it&#x27;s small and light</li>
            <li> Compact and easy.</li>
            <li> It is lite weight, so its easy to handle.</li>
            <li> So I can take it easy when I on a trip.</li>
            <li> I can store it easily in the bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> And the switch makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is a good dryer, but it hesitates before going to high speed.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing for its size.  </li>
            <li> It works as well as the full sized one I&#x27;ve got that we paid a lot more for.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the product and the speed settings and the cool option.  </li>
            <li> the perfect size for traveling and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space on my vanity when I lay it down..</li>
            <li> Small compact with nice power and a very good price.</li>
            <li> Just works fine and even folds up for storage.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Folds up easy to fit in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Lasts just fine.</li>
            <li> Again though, I&#x27;m fine with that delay for the price of the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> so it is fine for me</li>
            <li> Perfect little companion at home or not.</li>
            <li> I only use it for sixty seconds a day if that so for what I use it for, its great.  </li>
            <li> I tried as having MS even something as light as a hairdryer - combined with angle needed of arms - tires me.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it was much more powerful</li>
            <li> and I bought one just like it, because i liked it so much.</li>
            <li> There is a no heat setting to use as a blower, I use to light my BBQ and to chase my dog around.</li>
            <li> It also has a cool button for a burst of cool air!</li>
            <li> very powerful.</li>
            <li> And if I ever need to pack it, it&#x27;s super easy to fold up the handle.</li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful dryer for it&#x27;s size and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> It works better than my large blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Nice little compact dryer perfect for traveling or for a younger child to use (with supervision!).</li>
            <li> I love it so much, got my daughter one to take with her on vacation.</li>
            <li> very useful.everybody will be satisfied with this product .</li>
            <li> the cool air button just turns the heater off makes sense.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as any full size hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, and having gone to beauty school</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice and compact, but it&#x27;s way too loud.</li>
            <li> good for daily use</li>
            <li> but super find - it was an ad on item for like $9.</li>
            <li> It also dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Very portable, great for occasional use.</li>
            <li> Lots of power, it quickly dries my hair.</li>
            <li> that does not make it travel worthy.  </li>
            <li> For 1875w the temperature isn&#x27;t high, but I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it works good for me.</li>
            <li> Works great and is so small and cheap.  </li>
            <li> Very small/compact and this dryer heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> so I returned it and bought a compact Conair Travel Smart that works fine and</li>
            <li> and it stopped blowing hot air!</li>
            <li> The unit is compact, folding option allows you to save space in your bag, option of daul amp is great for traveling overseas , having cold bottom is good for hair styling, oval is a great product, highly recommend for short hair.</li>
            <li> Great power for a little guy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special, it blows hot air.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, just the right size for everyday use, handy, easy to use, easy to store, dual voltage, and value for money.</li>
            <li> worth the money.</li>
            <li> Cant complain much, ,it is worth for it is priced for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot.&lt;br /&gt;One thing worth mentioning</li>
            <li> Powerful and lightweight.</li>
            <li> Small, easy to use, good quality, everything i was looking for in a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It was just the right price</li>
            <li> Only draw back is the dryer is very loud, if you care about that then the dryer really is perfect.</li>
            <li> My wife needed a small hair dryer to go in her travel bag for our honeymoon, and this one worked great for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few hair dryers that I have found that has good high heat and a strong blowing force.</li>
            <li> No matter what kind of dryer I buy, I cannot get her dry.</li>
            <li> Small but very effective.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> very very awsome product.</li>
            <li> It is a good little hair dryer for the price thank you.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see my new Hair dyer had arrived.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it switches from super powerful to regular on its own but for the price it is well worth the ADD on for only $9.</li>
            <li> It has a low and high option and also the cool setting which I love.</li>
            <li> Had one just like this for 20 years before it finally broke, so I&#x27;m glad I found this again.</li>
            <li> This one was exactly like the one I was replacing</li>
            <li> is fast to send and it is powerful,</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I love your products, next time I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> it happens within the first 20-30 seconds into drying.</li>
            <li> It quit blowing hot air after 4 uses.  </li>
            <li> It stopped to blow hot air today.</li>
            <li> Works in a pinch for drying hair too, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis since the compact design isn&#x27;t the most ergonomic.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more for different locations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one of these I got on high overheated quickly for no reason and then began cycling.  </li>
            <li> Works well not as fast or hit ask larger ones but easy to hold not heavy and is just fine</li>
            <li> Disregarding the defect of overheating too easily because that was an obvious defect, the way it responded to being too hot makes no sense.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well and was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> It worked very well and was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> And forget anything with a retractable cord (which absolutely will NOT retract correctly after the first 5 uses--you&#x27;re a goof if you think I&#x27;m kidding).</li>
            <li> Mainly, it was too big for my travel needs, but it did work fine and the price was right, so I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li> Extra points for the folding handle which makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Travel Smart by ConAir is a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li> I am returning this and have already ordered the Conair Travel Smart.</li>
            <li> This one is more powerful and sturdier than the previous hairdryer I owned.</li>
            <li> Meaning that I&#x27;m spending MORE time trying to dry my hair!</li>
            <li> It was fine for ten bucks</li>
            <li> Great if you need to dry your hair but not great if you need to plug anything else like one more into the plug.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I would have to carefully push the cord back up into the retractable hair dryer so this new Relon unit is more convenient for me.</li>
            <li> nice little travel dryer.</li>
            <li> Nice little dryer doesn&#x27;t take up much cupboard space and works like a trooper.  </li>
            <li> Hard to beat the price for a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and it was pretty frizzy afterwards, even while using my usual (and amazing) oil based heat protector.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light enough to hang on a command hook i put underneith there</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I do not need so much wattage or so much pressure, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use it much.</li>
            <li> So compact and doesnt take up much storage space.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is compact enough to fit in the vanity drawer, I also toss it in my gym bag .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very compcat and a very rasonable price.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Cant expect much for 10 bucks.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li> but it works fast and is very powerful,&lt;br /&gt;does not overheat</li>
            <li> Simply use cool and hot.</li>
            <li> I liked very much because it is small and easy to carry on during long trips.</li>
            <li> Ideal for small bathrooms with limited storage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not powerful enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li> but it took a while to dry my fine hair</li>
            <li> And, it folds up nice and small, so it fits in her backpack when she goes to a friend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> small compact and folds up nicely.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;re left standing there either blowing into the fan or swinging it with your arm to get cool air into the unit to cool it off so the dryer kicks back on again.</li>
            <li> I liked that small size of the dryer and carried it with me on vacation to the D.R.</li>
            <li> It is pretty loud so all your neighbors will know you&#x27;re blowing something</li>
            <li> Delivers a lot more air than my 15-hear old dryer, and plenty hot enough shortly after it starts up.</li>
            <li> So, my satisfaction with this unit is mainly from my perspective.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be realistic.  </li>
            <li> is that while in the United Kingdom, I used it with an outlet converter and it would get very very hot and the inside wiring would turn orange as if it was overheating- only on the highest power setting.  </li>
            <li> I like the size, shape and weight of this hair dryer but it doesn&#x27;t have a high a setting as I would like to get the job done faster.</li>
            <li> and I can feel as if the heating element is working a bit judging by the smell of it, but not hot enough to warm up the air.</li>
            <li> and I can feel as if the heating element is working a bit judging by the smell of it, but not hot enough to warm up the air.</li>
            <li> As anyone with long or thick  hair has probably experienced with a hair dryer before, if you continually use the high setting it can over heat and just shut off...</li>
            <li> But its a bit loud, didnt expect it to be so much.</li>
            <li> SIMPLY ISN&#x27;T WORTH</li>
            <li> It kicks out HOT air in a hurry, has two speeds and a cool-down button when it starts to get too hot (which isn&#x27;t long).</li>
            <li> The Revlon 1875w Compact Stylist Dryer works as well as my larger Remington Supersonic and gets the job done quickly, though, loudly.</li>
            <li> This is good for daily and travel uses, and for alternate uses aside from hair (need to dry something quick - glue, something you got wet, who knows) it&#x27;ll do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is strong enough that i only need it for about sixty seconds a day.</li>
            <li> pretty thick too.&lt;br /&gt;The issue I have with this dryer is that it has an auto-cool on it, meaning it will blow super hot air on high for about 20-30 seconds</li>
            <li> But, for this cheap price, I can take it on my trip and leave it there if I don&#x27;t have enough room on the way back!</li>
            <li> It does blow very hot air, something I need because my hair is VERY long (to my waist) and</li>
            <li> I like a smaller unit that is also travel ready, so I did like the small size and the fold away handle that makes packing it up for travel very easy.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It a basic dryer, I will recommend go for a  higher model if u can.</li>
            <li> I like the size, etc., but it doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Got the first of these at Wal-Mart, and bought the second one from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> and the air still wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this mini hair dryer for my 2 yr old daughter who has a lot of hair!</li>
            <li> This little dryer is more powerful than my much much more expensive Oster unit which hangs on the wall.</li>
            <li> Would at least like to get a year&#x27;s worth of effort out something designed to break quickly.</li>
            <li> Blows super powerful to dry the long hair that reaches to the bottom of my back.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t see anything wring with the unit or have any complaints.</li>
            <li> because I use it frequently at home.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty long line.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I realize they put this feature on it to help keep the dryer from overheating and thus shutting off completely.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> For a small dryer, it&#x27;s pretty powerful, and I&#x27;d take it on trips.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on on high setting, it made an extreme loud noise (eeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!)</li>
            <li> I have only used this dryer a few times, but for the price it is a decent product, since it folds for packing, it does not produce a huge air volume, but then I do not have a lot of hair</li>
            <li> its small easy to store.</li>
            <li> If you need a full-time hair dryer, this will work fine, but I was looking for a small hair dryer for traveling.</li>
            <li> First of all, this dryer says &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34;, but I would say it was slightly smaller than standard size.  </li>
            <li> I turned it on on low setting and it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li> Quite the rough one, will dry your hair quickly on the high setting.</li>
            <li> The fan went from high to low and the heater went off.  </li>
            <li> After a minute or so it would turn the heater on and the fan back to high and start the cycle over again.  </li>
            <li> no matter what setting you select (low or high)</li>
            <li> I want a dryer that gives me constant heat on HIGH like</li>
            <li> no matter what setting you select (low or high)</li>
            <li> It works both at low and high speeps, when operating in 125V.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> But, this tiny dynamo dried very fast, did the straight hair thing on curling brush - and weighs like a dandelion!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is light and small.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE FINE HAIR.  </li>
            <li> Only 2 speeds - high and low - and the air wasn&#x27;t really much cooler with the low speed.</li>
            <li> It is not small size not too big~!</li>
            <li> This little hair dry will do the job is easy to fold and take with you any where you go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how powerful this little hairdryer is.  </li>
            <li> Powerful for a little blow dryer.</li>
            <li> But it takes about a second for the high power to actually get power.</li>
            <li> Apparently I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is extremely loud.  </li>
            <li> Of course its for daily use, dont expect a professional treatment.</li>
            <li> It definitely blows hard and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> After using less than 10 times, it stopped blowing hot air.  </li>
            <li> Turn the heater off sure, but switching the fan to low is just dumb.  </li>
            <li> multiple settings on such a small, cheap device are a plus.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it worked and how fast it dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> Again, I only use it on short hair and not everyday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda loud and not all that much smaller than my regular hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> As I a frequent traveler outside US, needed multiple voltage settings and this dryer met all my criteria.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and powerful.  </li>
            <li> though it uses the same energy as other high end models .</li>
            <li> It folds in half for easy storage in a small space and for tucking inside a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Just as dumb was that if you pushed the cool air button the fan also switched to low along with the heater turning off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with short hair and only really use this hair dryer to quickly dry my hair a little bit after putting gel in.  </li>
            <li> So while the concept of the overheat prevention is a good idea, allowing the hair dryer to blow on medium and cooler air to prevent an overheat, it&#x27;s BAD news if you&#x27;re trying to dry your hair!</li>
            <li> On high, it sounds like a small jet engine, so don&#x27;t expect whisper quiet.</li>
            <li> I can dry my short hair in just a few minutes with this powerful little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> for guys with short hair it does the job, but for long hair i wont recommend it.!</li>
            <li> It takes very short time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The low setting, on the other hand, compensates for this by being remarkably quiet.</li>
            <li> A little loud...</li>
            <li> Small, portable, high powered hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It covers both cold and hot blow, either low or high level.</li>
            <li> love the cold feature&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I have bought a dryer</li>
            <li> For the low price point, it&#x27;s as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter, but it actually blows harder than my blow dryer, so I think I will keep it for myself and give her mine.</li>
            <li> the same time High setting produces too much of heat which might be dangerous for your hair.</li>
            <li> Also due to the nature of the plug in and how it sits on the socket only allows one to be plugged in at a time.</li>
            <li> one problem is in the low setting, the air is not hot at all.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this item to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I got it to dry my dentures before applying denture fixative.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this hair dryer to stand in my bathrooom for almost an hour to try and dry my hair.</li>
            <li> one person said that it was the same size as a regular hair dryer but its like half the size!</li>
            <li> each so two will blow the breaker switch sometimes and 3 will every single time.</li>
            <li> Being a bitter old consumer curmudgeon, I HATE most products sold in America today.</li>
            <li> My previous $5 Vidal sassoon died after 8 years of daily usage.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This stopped working only after a few months.</li>
            <li> Not much else u need from a hair dryer</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is the option of an attachment for the end that directs air to sections of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> It has a painfully annoying screech when running, but it dries my hair and folds up nicely for travel.</li>
            <li> Dryer is smaller than appears and the dual voltage switch is not easy to operate.</li>
            <li> It was a little weird to setup, and we thought it didn&#x27;t work at first because of the different functions.</li>
            <li> I wanted to take this on a trip to Ireland but decided not to because I was not confident the voltage switch would work properly.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do and for not much money!</li>
            <li> My Conair 1875 kept getting borrowed, so I bought this for other people to use.  </li>
            <li> well i recommend if u want something small and simple</li>
            <li> but I swear it dries my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is just the thing for travel or home.&lt;br /&gt;Enough heat to dry hair,light weight and compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have had for about 9 months now, and am very rough on it, accidentally dropping it on occasion and throwing it around with disregard</li>
            <li> it folds down because I keep it in a tote with my other toiletries</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m almost always a man in a hurry, with absolutely no patience for time wasted while grooming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy compared to other blower dryers</li>
            <li> and then it cuts down to half the power in heat and air.</li>
            <li> It folds up to take up even less space.</li>
            <li> But the temperature control is odd....</li>
            <li> so maybe that is what they all do, but it seemed odd to me.  </li>
            <li> would have been happier if it would consume less that 1800 watts.</li>
            <li> As a guy,  i don&#x27;t have a long mane of thick hair.</li>
            <li> Hardly use it except to dry between my toes, and it&#x27;s already not working.  </li>
            <li> I needed some hair dryers to use to dry artwork on a drying stand in the shop, but these little suckers use 1875 watts</li>
            <li> The folding mechanism seems a little flimsy</li>
            <li> However, I have one daughter with hair thick hair almost to her waste, and it takes a bit of time to dry it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to wrap your hair around a round brush to blow your bangs, your bangs wont stay on the brush</li>
            <li> I have had a few compact hair dryers, but they always disappoint and shut off too soon.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday hair dryer</li>
            <li> It dries my long very thick hair and while I always wish I had my Babyliss with me, it performs.</li>
            <li> I actually may by a few extras to have when the current model eventually dies to ensure I have one of these bad boys for years to come.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is frequently shocked when she hears me say (while getting ready for work in a hurry)</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Small, compact, and has a ton of power.</li>
            <li> Was it totally wired wrong?  </li>
            <li> Not sure why the price went up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a WASTE of my time!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more to say.  </li>
            <li> Usually, you get</li>
            <li> To get the cold air you have to hold down the button continuously - not very ergonomic imho.</li>
            <li> Despite having the hair dryer on the 240V setting, and on the lowest drying speed, the motor ran really hard and started to smell of burning as soon as I turned it on.</li>
            <li> , I never use the low or cold function</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, I need some force.</li>
            <li> It actually allows me to dry my hair thoroughly, so I don&#x27;t catch my death of cold on cold weather winter days.</li>
            <li> I was seeking a very small dryer.  </li>
            <li> I use this for home use, not travel because I hate how heavy regular sized dryers are when blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible product due to its short time operation.</li>
            <li> Small and folds!!!</li>
            <li> Seems unlikely</li>
            <li> so she can handle it, and it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of complicated buttons or settings.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my folding retractable cord hair dryer which had the retraction mechanism fail.  </li>
            <li> This makes me sad.</li>
            <li> that if I needed to lighten up my suitcase on the way home I could leave it behind and not feel too bad about it</li>
            <li> It still blows cold air out but the heating element no longer heats up the air</li>
            <li> It still blows cold air out but the heating element no longer heats up the air</li>
            <li> some times cold air comes in.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> but I was so wrong!</li>
            <li> To bad it didn&#x27;t work when I plugged it in, even after using the reset/test button.</li>
            <li> I should have bought a Vidal Sassoon instead of this brand. :(</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed when I see the product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing..</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, since I bought this blow dryer specifically to keep at a vacation home for guests.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I hate this dryer because of this issue.</li>
            <li> So after reading almost every review I was expecting this hair dryer to be horrible before it even arrived</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Quite the rough one, will dry your hair quickly on the high setting. If you&#x27;re trying to wrap your hair around a round brush to blow your bangs, your bangs wont stay on the brush</li>
            <li> Does what it should. Compact and easy. Good blowing force. I have thick hair, I need some force. This works well.</li>
            <li> nice price. with this price, I didn&#x27;t expect it has two voltage systems (220v/110v) as well. very powerful. worth the money.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU  ITS EASY TO HANDLE TOO GREAT WORK REVLON I WOULD BUY THIS AS A GIFT</li>
            <li> I use this for home use, not travel because I hate how heavy regular sized dryers are when blow drying my hair. Works wonderfully. Great price. And if I ever need to pack it, it&#x27;s super easy to fold up the handle. Small, lightweight, and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with dryer.  Works well not as fast or hit ask larger ones but easy to hold not heavy and is just fine</li>
            <li> excellent value for the money and its easy to use with its compact size</li>
            <li> Small, easy to use, good quality, everything i was looking for in a hair dryer. Is the perfect one for traveling or use at home...</li>
            <li> loved the hairdryer but broke after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Excellent - all one needs to have a nice hair do.</li>
            <li> This is a great compact dryer for if you need to travel or if you just want one in a guest bathroom. It folds up to take up even less space. It also has a cool button for a burst of cool air!</li>
            <li> Just works fine and even folds up for storage.</li>
            <li> This little hair dry will do the job is easy to fold and take with you any where you go. It is lite weight, so its easy to handle. I love it so much, got my daughter one to take with her on vacation.</li>
            <li> loved it.....worth every cent. will recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> it collapses and in my tiny apt bathroom cabinet that&#x27;s awesome. it&#x27;s light enough to hang on a command hook i put underneith there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with short hair and only really use this hair dryer to quickly dry my hair a little bit after putting gel in.  I only use it for sixty seconds a day if that so for what I use it for, its great.  Again, I only use it on short hair and not everyday.  Extra points for the folding handle which makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is just the thing for travel or home.&lt;br /&gt;Enough heat to dry hair,light weight and compact.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Had one just like this for 20 years before it finally broke, so I&#x27;m glad I found this again. Perfect for packing for a trip and for storing away in a cabinet.</li>
            <li> Hardly use it except to dry between my toes, and it&#x27;s already not working.  Would at least like to get a year&#x27;s worth of effort out something designed to break quickly.</li>
            <li> Has held up for more than a year now. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Love it.</li>
            <li> Does the job fine, great price. Has choices of various speeds and works well. Can&#x27;t see why anyone would spend more.</li>
            <li> I can dry my short hair in just a few minutes with this powerful little hair dryer.  It folds in half for easy storage in a small space and for tucking inside a suitcase.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> This is a powerful and sturdy blow dryer for a very good price.  It works better than my large blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Regarding it size, which is the best for traveling, the power is good enough. I like this product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is more powerful than my much much more expensive Oster unit which hangs on the wall. I&#x27;m very pleased with its blowing power as well as its quick heating.</li>
            <li> I have had a few compact hair dryers, but they always disappoint and shut off too soon. Not the Revlon. It actually allows me to dry my hair thoroughly, so I don&#x27;t catch my death of cold on cold weather winter days.</li>
            <li> First of all, this dryer says &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34;, but I would say it was slightly smaller than standard size.  It definitely blows hard and is easy to use.  But the temperature control is odd....that is when it is close to your scalp you can feel the heat, but pull it about six inches away and it blows cooler air.  It has been a long time since I have bought a dryer so maybe that is what they all do, but it seemed odd to me.  I am not sure I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product it...I used it for a long time...now...and the way it works is really awesome...love it....</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It&#x27;s small and powerful.  So I can take it easy when I on a trip.</li>
            <li> This is same power as a larger version. I tried as having MS even something as light as a hairdryer - combined with angle needed of arms - tires me. But, this tiny dynamo dried very fast, did the straight hair thing on curling brush - and weighs like a dandelion! A little loud...but super find - it was an ad on item for like $9. NOT a typo $9</li>
            <li> its good for the price.! does the job but dont expect it to be great..! for guys with short hair it does the job, but for long hair i wont recommend it.!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. Very small/compact and this dryer heats up very quickly. No complaints at all! Very satisfied. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The Revlon 1875w Compact Stylist Dryer works as well as my larger Remington Supersonic and gets the job done quickly, though, loudly. On high, it sounds like a small jet engine, so don&#x27;t expect whisper quiet. The low setting, on the other hand, compensates for this by being remarkably quiet. In any event, I bought this unit for its compact size and drying power.  Good basic construction and great price.</li>
            <li> I was seeking a very small dryer.  This was the smallest I could find at the time.  It works for me well.  I do not need so much wattage or so much pressure, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> Small, compact, and has a ton of power. This is good for daily and travel uses, and for alternate uses aside from hair (need to dry something quick - glue, something you got wet, who knows) it&#x27;ll do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The multiple settings on such a small, cheap device are a plus.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this item to dry my hair.  I got it to dry my dentures before applying denture fixative.  It works ok for that but the air flow is inconsistent and as a result I doubt that it would work the best for hair drying.</li>
            <li> Cant complain much, ,it is worth for it is priced for. though it uses the same energy as other high end models . thats my only gripe. would have been happier if it would consume less that 1800 watts.</li>
            <li> I was replacing a hair dryer just like this one so I knew what I wanted.  This one was exactly like the one I was replacing so I bought it.  It has been great and I got an incredible price on it.</li>
            <li> Very happy to get it cheap n very useful.everybody will be satisfied with this product . After all revlon is revlon .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, just the right size for everyday use, handy, easy to use, easy to store, dual voltage, and value for money.</li>
            <li> Dryer is smaller than appears and the dual voltage switch is not easy to operate. I wanted to take this on a trip to Ireland but decided not to because I was not confident the voltage switch would work properly.</li>
            <li> In Dec 2014 I had bought a Revlon RV544PKF and we liked it so I thought another Revlon was a good bet but we needed a compact model.  Apparently I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one of these I got on high overheated quickly for no reason and then began cycling.  The fan went from high to low and the heater went off.  After a minute or so it would turn the heater on and the fan back to high and start the cycle over again.  Disregarding the defect of overheating too easily because that was an obvious defect, the way it responded to being too hot makes no sense.  Turn the heater off sure, but switching the fan to low is just dumb.  Just as dumb was that if you pushed the cool air button the fan also switched to low along with the heater turning off.  Was it totally wired wrong?  Seems unlikely so I returned it and bought a compact Conair Travel Smart that works fine and the cool air button just turns the heater off makes sense.</li>
            <li> it the perfect size and it suits my needs. So far I don&#x27;t see anything wring with the unit or have any complaints. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Bought love want to get one for my daughter so she don&#x27;t use mine!!! :) I would recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> This stopped working only after a few months. I didn&#x27;t get to use it much. Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Very good product, excellent service!</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on a trip to the UK from America.  It was just the right price that if I needed to lighten up my suitcase on the way home I could leave it behind and not feel too bad about it...but I didn&#x27;t need to, and I&#x27;m glad for that because I use it frequently at home.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for when I just need to dry my bangs.  Works just as well as any full size hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, and having gone to beauty school I&#x27;ve used a lot.&lt;br /&gt;One thing worth mentioning is that while in the United Kingdom, I used it with an outlet converter and it would get very very hot and the inside wiring would turn orange as if it was overheating- only on the highest power setting.  It worked well on the low and cool settings, and in America all settings work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Puts bigger more expensive blow dryers to shame. Compact powerful excellent product</li>
            <li> I bought this for it&#x27;s flexibility and it&#x27;s awesome. So compact and doesnt take up much storage space. It has a low and high option and also the cool setting which I love.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for her birthday. It was a little weird to setup, and we thought it didn&#x27;t work at first because of the different functions. But, when we DID get it on, it worked like a dream. It works as well as the full sized one I&#x27;ve got that we paid a lot more for. And, it folds up nice and small, so it fits in her backpack when she goes to a friend&#x27;s house. I&#x27;d purchase it again!</li>
            <li> WOW! this is the best choose to pick this one, is cheap, is fast to send and it is powerful,</li>
            <li> My six-year-old daughter has wanted her own hair dryer for some time, and this is perfect; it&#x27;s small and light so she can handle it, and it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of complicated buttons or settings. For a small dryer, it&#x27;s pretty powerful, and I&#x27;d take it on trips. Nice little compact dryer perfect for traveling or for a younger child to use (with supervision!).</li>
            <li> It covers both cold and hot blow, either low or high level. Light and easy to pack. I have long hair and it works good for me.</li>
            <li> It has a painfully annoying screech when running, but it dries my hair and folds up nicely for travel.</li>
            <li> Good size for travelling.  It is the simplest blow dryer, but it gets the job done.  The only thing is that it is extremely loud.  However, since I only use it when I am not at my house, it suits its purpose.</li>
            <li> Nice~! Power ! Nice price! Simply use cool and hot. It is pretty long line. It is not small size not too big~!</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my folding retractable cord hair dryer which had the retraction mechanism fail.  So now I just wind the cord up and put a twist tie on and I&#x27;m good to go.  Most of the time I would have to carefully push the cord back up into the retractable hair dryer so this new Relon unit is more convenient for me.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday. It is nice and compact. I can store it easily in the bathroom cabinet. It also dries my hair quickly. And the price in Amazon is as low as in Walmart, even with no tax. I love it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Solid product. Ideal for small bathrooms with limited storage. Pleased with purchase. Does everything you need a hair dryer to do.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer does its job of drying hair and it&#x27;s nice and compact, but it&#x27;s way too loud. For the low price point, it&#x27;s as expected.</li>
            <li> Small and folds!!! Blows super powerful to dry the long hair that reaches to the bottom of my back. Sometimes it switches from super powerful to regular on its own but for the price it is well worth the ADD on for only $9. Awesome for a travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li> $9 FOR A BLOW DRYER. EXCELLENT PRICE. AND THEN TO FIND OUT IT IS A REVLON PRODUCT. IT HAS A SECURITY MEASURE TO KEEP IT FROM BEING SHORTED OUT.</li>
            <li> It worked very well and was exactly what I needed but it stopped working after only 1 month. It still blows cold air out but the heating element no longer heats up the air no matter what setting you select (low or high) and I can feel as if the heating element is working a bit judging by the smell of it, but not hot enough to warm up the air. Very disappointing..</li>
            <li> GREAT AS ADD ON UNIT,,,,,, SOME TIME I NEED A BLOWIN HEATSORCE &amp; THIS IS IT</li>
            <li> Bought this for travel.  Took it on two trips now and love it.  Exactly as advertised.  Small but very effective.</li>
            <li> It is a good dryer, but it hesitates before going to high speed. It is a concern. I hope it lasts, as it seems to be a good dryer</li>
            <li> great size, easy to use and good for travelling - fits well in suitcase and ready to go - highly recommended</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t the trick and travels well!</li>
            <li> Not expensive, excellent products, shipping fast. I love your products, next time I will purchase again. I recommend to purchase  .Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> It does its job - no complains on what it promised to do. But its a bit loud, didnt expect it to be so much.It a basic dryer, I will recommend go for a  higher model if u can.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful dryer for it&#x27;s size and heats up quickly. It is also very sleek and attractive.</li>
            <li> As a guy,  i don&#x27;t have a long mane of thick hair. So, my satisfaction with this unit is mainly from my perspective. I like the size and the handle that folds for packing in luggage. It is strong enough that i only need it for about sixty seconds a day.</li>
            <li> Works great and I&#x27;ve had it for years</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do and for not much money!</li>
            <li> If you need a full-time hair dryer, this will work fine, but I was looking for a small hair dryer for traveling. Only 2 speeds - high and low - and the air wasn&#x27;t really much cooler with the low speed. To get the cold air you have to hold down the button continuously - not very ergonomic imho. Mainly, it was too big for my travel needs, but it did work fine and the price was right, so I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li> At the time that I bought this, its was the cheapest blow dryer on Amazon.  I think it was an add on item.  Not sure why the price went up.  My Conair 1875 kept getting borrowed, so I bought this for other people to use.  To my surprise it was much more powerful that my Conair 1875, and it lasted a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for the price... but after buying two of them - with the same results - I&#x27;m done. Just 6 months in and it stopped blowing hot air!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how powerful this little hairdryer is.  Works great and is so small and cheap.  I use it every day.  No issues.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE FINE HAIR.  THIS SIMPLY ISN&#x27;T WORTH A NICKEL EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN&#x27;T COST ANYTHING TO PURCHASE.  I RETURNED IT AND DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> It is great compact hair dryer, it has all the settings I needed.  Definitely a great price for what it does.  Only draw back is the dryer is very loud, if you care about that then the dryer really is perfect.</li>
            <li> love the cold feature&lt;br /&gt;love that it folds in half&lt;br /&gt;wish the fan part was skinnier&lt;br /&gt;definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> Love the blow dryer.  I bought it for my daughter, but it actually blows harder than my blow dryer, so I think I will keep it for myself and give her mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special, it blows hot air. The handle folds so that it is slightly more compact, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the product and the speed settings and the cool option.  Folds up easy to fit in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I liked very much because it is small and easy to carry on during long trips. Furthermore, it is potent and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> nice little travel dryer. small compact and folds up nicely. Very good airflow. Friend had one in her house and I bought one just like it, because i liked it so much. Perfect little companion at home or not.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing for its size.  It seems durable.  The thumb temperature control exceeded my expectations, and was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this unit, and it works well with shorter hair. However, I have one daughter with hair thick hair almost to her waste, and it takes a bit of time to dry it. If you were traveling, this item is great.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Works well.  Good price and good functioning - what more could you want!  Basic dependable hair dryer for guest room.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is compact enough to fit in the vanity drawer, I also toss it in my gym bag .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone is complaining about.  This thing works great.  It folds up nicely.  It&#x27;s not salon quality or anything but it&#x27;s $10.  Let&#x27;s be realistic.  We cannot expect something that is $10 to perform like a $100 hair dryer your hair stylist uses.</li>
            <li> Works good. Lasts just fine. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy compared to other blower dryers</li>
            <li> Great power for a little guy.  Perfect travel dryer.</li>
            <li> Small compact with nice power and a very good price. As good as any hair dryer I have used. Great for travel but can be used at home as well. Nice product!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Powerful for a little blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I was very under impressed with this hair dryer. I like a smaller unit that is also travel ready, so I did like the small size and the fold away handle that makes packing it up for travel very easy. However, my problem is performance of this hair dryer. It does blow very hot air, something I need because my hair is VERY long (to my waist) and pretty thick too.&lt;br /&gt;The issue I have with this dryer is that it has an auto-cool on it, meaning it will blow super hot air on high for about 20-30 seconds and then it cuts down to half the power in heat and air. Meaning that I&#x27;m spending MORE time trying to dry my hair! I realize they put this feature on it to help keep the dryer from overheating and thus shutting off completely. As anyone with long or thick  hair has probably experienced with a hair dryer before, if you continually use the high setting it can over heat and just shut off...then you&#x27;re left standing there either blowing into the fan or swinging it with your arm to get cool air into the unit to cool it off so the dryer kicks back on again. So while the concept of the overheat prevention is a good idea, allowing the hair dryer to blow on medium and cooler air to prevent an overheat, it&#x27;s BAD news if you&#x27;re trying to dry your hair! It doesn&#x27;t heat up for mins before it does this...it happens within the first 20-30 seconds into drying. It&#x27;s a WASTE of my time! I didn&#x27;t buy this hair dryer to stand in my bathrooom for almost an hour to try and dry my hair. I hate this dryer because of this issue. I want a dryer that gives me constant heat on HIGH like I NEED.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking for something else I suppose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda loud and not all that much smaller than my regular hairdryer.  The folding mechanism seems a little flimsy so I don&#x27;t risk folding it.  Current price is nearly double what I paid for it.  It was fine for ten bucks but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than that.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and folds up nicely for a more convenient travel item.</li>
            <li> Nice little dryer doesn&#x27;t take up much cupboard space and works like a trooper.  I definitely recommend it. Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> revlon it&#x27;s a great brand, but the very first time we used it the switch to turn it on/off got stuck in the on position.&lt;br /&gt;i like the fact it&#x27;s very compcat and a very rasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is very nice and you can carry it everywhere. It is not heavy. It works very well. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I like the size, shape and weight of this hair dryer but it doesn&#x27;t have a high a setting as I would like to get the job done faster.</li>
            <li> It quit blowing hot air after 4 uses.  There&#x27;s not much more to say.  It quit working almost immediately.  Should have known better.</li>
            <li> I like the size, etc., but it doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough.  I does also function abroad, so that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> The unit is compact, folding option allows you to save space in your bag, option of daul amp is great for traveling overseas , having cold bottom is good for hair styling, oval is a great product, highly recommend for short hair.</li>
            <li> It worked very well and was exactly what I needed but it stopped working after only 2 weeks. It still blows cold air out but the heating element no longer heats up the air no matter what setting you select (low or high) and I can feel as if the heating element is working a bit judging by the smell of it, but not hot enough to warm up the air. Very disappointing and I decided to trash the unit rather than try to negotiate a return since I no longer have the box, etc. I bought a similar one (different brand) at the local Walmart store for about the same price and hopefully it will last longer.</li>
            <li> It works very well. Powerful and nice price. It takes very short time to dry my hair. I love it very much.</li>
            <li> I needed some hair dryers to use to dry artwork on a drying stand in the shop, but these little suckers use 1875 watts each so two will blow the breaker switch sometimes and 3 will every single time. Also due to the nature of the plug in and how it sits on the socket only allows one to be plugged in at a time. Great if you need to dry your hair but not great if you need to plug anything else like one more into the plug.</li>
            <li> Does its job and I like it so far. I don&#x27;t use it often though. It&#x27;s a good buy considering the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same size as my regular drier. Only difference is the handle folds. But, for this cheap price, I can take it on my trip and leave it there if I don&#x27;t have enough room on the way back!</li>
            <li> I bought this dual voltage hair dryer because of a trip to England, which has a 240V electrical system. Despite having the hair dryer on the 240V setting, and on the lowest drying speed, the motor ran really hard and started to smell of burning as soon as I turned it on. I didn&#x27;t dare use it! It is fine in the US, and does fold nice and compactly for travel. But if you need the dual voltage/240V setting, it is not so good.</li>
            <li> Very good product and i&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the product and its functioning. good for daily use</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought it for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hairdryer. It works. That&#x27;s about all there is to say, except that this review required me to write more words.</li>
            <li> My wife needed a small hair dryer to go in her travel bag for our honeymoon, and this one worked great for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Got the first of these at Wal-Mart, and bought the second one from Amazon.com. Delivers a lot more air than my 15-hear old dryer, and plenty hot enough shortly after it starts up. Hard to beat the price for a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I liked that small size of the dryer and carried it with me on vacation to the D.R. but it took a while to dry my fine hair and it was pretty frizzy afterwards, even while using my usual (and amazing) oil based heat protector. It&#x27;s just not powerful enough to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Pros: This hair dryer is light and small. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and weight in the luggage when you travel. Cons: I turned it on on low setting and it wasn&#x27;t hot enough. When I turned it on on high setting, it made an extreme loud noise (eeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!) and the air still wasn&#x27;t hot enough. Overall, I am disappointed with this product. My previous $5 Vidal sassoon died after 8 years of daily usage. I should have bought a Vidal Sassoon instead of this brand. :( Not recommended!</li>
            <li> I intend to use this dryer when I shower in gym. It serves that purpose perfectly. For 1875w the temperature isn&#x27;t high, but I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> its works well and its handy and nice for when I&#x27;m traveling i recommend u buy this item if your looking for a travel size hair dryer</li>
            <li> For the price, this is great. But it takes about a second for the high power to actually get power. Again though, I&#x27;m fine with that delay for the price of the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Such as simple piece of equipment at such a low price. It&#x27;s no thrills, but blows well. There is a no heat setting to use as a blower, I use to light my BBQ and to chase my dog around. It is pretty loud so all your neighbors will know you&#x27;re blowing something</li>
            <li> I have only used this dryer a few times, but for the price it is a decent product, since it folds for packing, it does not produce a huge air volume, but then I do not have a lot of hair so it is fine for me THANKS</li>
            <li> so great I got 2 ! one for home, and one for gym locker. it is powerful and compact, it folds and it dries hair very good and quick</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer in August. It stopped to blow hot air today. That is to say this product doesn&#x27;t function well at all. It&#x27;s a terrible product due to its short time operation.</li>
            <li> its small easy to store. It works great. And the switch makes it easy to use. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the price that I bought it for (about $10) the size of this dryer is smaller than I thought, but anyways I have no complains about this product&#x27;s workability. It&#x27;s a great dryer it drys your hair the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> After using less than 10 times, it stopped blowing hot air.  Very disappointing, since I bought this blow dryer specifically to keep at a vacation home for guests.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my sister for a gift for Christmas and she likes it.  Good value but i saw the same thing cheaper at Ocean State recently.</li>
            <li> Cant expect much for 10 bucks.  have had it for a week and it works great.  functions well i recommend if u want something small and simple</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for when we travel. it does a good job with plenty of heat. We like that we can adjust the heat and the speed. We also like it&#x27;s compact size, used to travel with a larger folding dryer. Would recommend product!</li>
            <li> As I a frequent traveler outside US, needed multiple voltage settings and this dryer met all my criteria. Compact for packing, optimal speeds and performance for a quick use and most importantly multi-voltage settings within this amazing price range.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because it was inexpensive.  I was surprised at how well it worked and how fast it dried my hair.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Compact, folding handle. Powerful and lightweight. Fast shipping and inexpensive. Great hair dryer. Would recommend. Not much else u need from a hair dryer</li>
            <li> I bought this mini hair dryer for my 2 yr old daughter who has a lot of hair! It&#x27;s a perfect size for her and eventually she will be able to do it on her own as she gets older!</li>
            <li> I was excited to see my new Hair dyer had arrived.  To bad it didn&#x27;t work when I plugged it in, even after using the reset/test button.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel size and easily stores away.  The only thing missing is the option of an attachment for the end that directs air to sections of hair at a time.  Otherwise, works great.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I too started using it after having head bath.&lt;br /&gt;Only one problem is in the low setting, the air is not hot at all. some times cold air comes in.&lt;br /&gt;At the same time High setting produces too much of heat which might be dangerous for your hair.</li>
            <li> Very portable, great for occasional use. Not too heavy and very compact. I keep one in my ski boot bag to warm up the plastic, and it is perfect that for that. Works in a pinch for drying hair too, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis since the compact design isn&#x27;t the most ergonomic.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s house. It dries my long very thick hair and while I always wish I had my Babyliss with me, it performs. I like that it folds down because I keep it in a tote with my other toiletries and it doesn&#x27;t take up much room. I kind of wish I had gotten a slightly better dryer given that I use it one or two times a week, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed when I see the product.  Why?  It is not compact. I wish it mark the dimension on the product description next time.</li>
            <li> Small, portable, high powered hair dryer. Have had for about 9 months now, and am very rough on it, accidentally dropping it on occasion and throwing it around with disregard (I know i should treat my products better) but still works great. This is my everyday hair dryer and i also take it on when I travel, folds up nicely, I never use the low or cold function but they still work perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> very very awsome product. Using it for last 6-8 months. Working great. Of course its for daily use, dont expect a professional treatment. Works great for me</li>
            <li> Lots of power, it quickly dries my hair. Very light weight and compact, which is so important when traveling. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works well and good price</li>
            <li> No matter what kind of dryer I buy, I cannot get her dry. This makes me sad. I have cried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really basic but it definitely gets the job done. It kicks out HOT air in a hurry, has two speeds and a cool-down button when it starts to get too hot (which isn&#x27;t long). Can&#x27;t ask more for the money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few hair dryers that I have found that has good high heat and a strong blowing force. It is also dual voltage. I will be buying more for different locations.</li>
            <li> Does the job well, is inexpensive, compact, elegant and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived prior to its scheduled time-line and well packed.</li>
            <li> This dryer is about the size of any regular blow dryer.. It folds but that does not make it travel worthy.  Travel Smart by ConAir is a travel dryer.  I am returning this and have already ordered the Conair Travel Smart.</li>
            <li> Being a bitter old consumer curmudgeon, I HATE most products sold in America today. Usually, you get cheap, overpriced junk This, however, is a GREAT deal on a GREAT product!  Forget Conair. Forget the foofie salon dryer brands. And forget anything with a retractable cord (which absolutely will NOT retract correctly after the first 5 uses--you&#x27;re a goof if you think I&#x27;m kidding). This is the best dryer on the market--and it&#x27;s under ten bucks! I know it says it&#x27;s only 1875 watts but I swear it dries my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. And I&#x27;m almost always a man in a hurry, with absolutely no patience for time wasted while grooming. My girlfriend is frequently shocked when she hears me say (while getting ready for work in a hurry) \\&quot;I love this dryer\\&quot;--because I rarely love ANY product. I actually may by a few extras to have when the current model eventually dies to ensure I have one of these bad boys for years to come. Kudos to Revlon!</li>
            <li> This one is more powerful and sturdier than the previous hairdryer I owned. It feels like it is built to last.</li>
            <li> So after reading almost every review I was expecting this hair dryer to be horrible before it even arrived but I was so wrong! I absolutely love it. It it the perfect size for traveling and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space on my vanity when I lay it down..one person said that it was the same size as a regular hair dryer but its like half the size! Truly a great dryer for the price</li>
            <li> Travel size dryer, its a bit noisy but it works fast and is very powerful,&lt;br /&gt;does not overheat so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> It is a good little hair dryer for the price thank you.</li>
            <li> It works both at low and high speeps, when operating in 125V.&lt;br /&gt;As per the instructions given in the manaul, we should not operate in two speeds in 250V mode. This information is not provided any where in the products information advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.&lt;br /&gt;skumar</li>
            <li> Works great! Compact size.</li>
            <li> Some of Revlon&#x27;s hair dryers are good and some not so much. This one looks good nice amount of power but still portable. It also looks well built for travel. I haven&#x27;t taken it on the road and used it yet so that is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
