            <li>Product is great and delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li>Had some cute little Israeli girl give me a fantastic demonstration on this stuff and it was impressive stuff.</li>
            <li>(Totally Worth it!).</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped using it and started a drugstore brand, the eye swelling cleared up and the under eye area looked much smoother and better.  </li>
            <li>but I am never quite sure if my satisfaction is real or my imagination when it comes to face products.</li>
            <li>The texture is a rich serum and absorbs right in.  </li>
            <li>After hearing about this product from my aesthetician at an unaffordable price, I was happy to find it for much less on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>After spending $125 at a mall kiosk on this product, I&#x27;m kicking myself for not checking on Amazon first!</li>
            <li>Second bottle and loving it...</li>
            <li>Still well worth the $50.</li>
            <li>Lasts for a very long time goes on smoothly, smells very clean.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use very much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 6 months and am continually told I look in my mid 30&#x27;s though I am 48...</li>
            <li>Still on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that makes me feel better after spending that much money is that this product rocks!</li>
            <li>I use very little makeup now and think my skin looks good.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The eye serum works really well, as do the majority of Seacret Skincare products and</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>

            <li>Leaves your skin feeling very soft, without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>Early days but see an immediate improvement</li>
            <li>The only reason I Gave this four stars and not Five is that it really does not have an anti aging Property to it that I have noticed.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. She has been using it for several years and when I saw it at a on Amazon at a discounted price I took advantage if it. Savings were incredible, and product is top of the line. Keep in mind that you only use a drop of the product and this small bottle will last months</li>

            <li> Great Product!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce wrinkles.  This is a good price too!</li>
            <li> The item shipped early which was great! The eye serum works really well, as do the majority of Seacret Skincare products and the pricing was amazing too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 6 months and am continually told I look in my mid 30&#x27;s though I am 48...love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second or third bottle and I really like it.  It has smoothed out the area around my eyes and seems like it is preventing wrinkles.  The texture is a rich serum and absorbs right in.  I would rate it a 5 but I am never quite sure if my satisfaction is real or my imagination when it comes to face products.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  This is my 2nd bottle.  Don&#x27;t need to use very much.  Really helps so my eyelids no longer droop.  Pretty great.</li>
            <li> Fab product lasts approx 6 months and great results .. Second bottle and loving it...Feels light on skin but lasting moisturising and eye firming</li>
            <li> Luv it!  Almost time to reorder.</li>
            <li> Only needs a little on each eye.  I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the Regain Eye Cream for about 2 months now.  The skin around my eyes are noticeably firmer.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but when I ordered another one- all I got was an empty box- NO PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;How does this happen?????</li>
            <li> This is an excellent anti aging product. I have been using for 2 years &amp; I am very happy with the condition of the skin aroundy eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my under eyes Moisturized and takes all the dryness away that causes the creases. I only wish that the cream that is marketed to use over this product was&lt;br /&gt;Better. It is too thick and hard to apply. I don&#x27;t care for the cream and use another product over the serum. The only reason I Gave this four stars and not Five is that it really does not have an anti aging Property to it that I have noticed. This product is great along with an anti age Moisturizer over top the serum! Over all I love it!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied as always with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this eye serum at a mall.  Loved it but did not want to pay $250.00.  Went to Amazon and got a great deal.  This serum has really helped the area around my eyes.  It is no longer dry, itchy or wrinkled.</li>
            <li> this is wonderful , it took away the puffiness and tightened the skin around the eyes .  this a great product</li>
            <li> Product is great and delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  Feels beautiful to apply and you don&#x27;t need much.  I use in conjunction with eye cream in bottle.  Still on my first bottle.  Much cheaper to buy through amazon than in the shops.  Very flattering to receive comments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Feels nice going on but I thought it would have better results by now.</li>
            <li> After using the product twice daily as recommended for one month, I saw no results whatsoever. Not convinced this or any other of the other Seacret products really work.</li>
            <li> Visibly reduces wrinkles around eyes</li>
            <li> I do like how nicely it goes on, and is absorbed into the skin.  Leaves your skin feeling very soft, without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a very long time goes on smoothly, smells very clean.  Fine lines seem much less obvious and eyelids appear smoother.</li>
            <li> Had some cute little Israeli girl give me a fantastic demonstration on this stuff and it was impressive stuff. However the price tag was a little steep at $300 a bottle (Not worth it). Luckily I was smart enough to google it and found it here for around $30 a bottle (Totally Worth it!). I use this a couple times a week and I love it.</li>
            <li> After spending $125 at a mall kiosk on this product, I&#x27;m kicking myself for not checking on Amazon first! Lesson learned! The only thing that makes me feel better after spending that much money is that this product rocks! Every fall/winter my eyes start to betray me and become dry, itchy, even flaky as our dry Colorado weather takes hold. Not so this season! I use this serum every night and the skin around my eyes is supple and moisturized. I use this serum both under my eyes and on my lids. I wake up in the morning no longer worried if I&#x27;ll be able to wear my favorite shadows - not only is the skin around my eyes healthier, my makeup goes on easier. Highly recommended! Oh - and I&#x27;ve ordered a backup from Amazon!</li>
            <li> its the best I have ever used.  Was a Clarins eye girl for years.  With Seacret results are immediate and lasting!  wont use anything else!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results from this product!</li>
            <li> Pending future results</li>
            <li> Works well and feels great!</li>
            <li> This seems to soften the area around my eyes, as well as moisturize it.  My eyes don&#x27;t look so tired&lt;br /&gt;when I use this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this and the moisture cream for about a year.  I love it.  I use very little makeup now and think my skin looks good.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it little cashy but she swears by it</li>
            <li> SInce I treid out the eye creme, which was exceptionally amazing, I also ordered this serum. The texture is lovely, yet I see less results than when using the eye creme.</li>
            <li> After hearing about this product from my aesthetician at an unaffordable price, I was happy to find it for much less on Amazon.  I like the product but it&#x27;s not the miracle it was advertised to be.  Still well worth the $50.</li>
