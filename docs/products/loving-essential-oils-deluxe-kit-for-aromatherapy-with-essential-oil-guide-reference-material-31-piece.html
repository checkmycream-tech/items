            <li>I&#x27;m just getting started with essential oils and this was great!</li>

            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>:) Thanks!</li>
            <li>I cant say enough, how much I loved having this kit on hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pocket-sized guides, a quick reference card, and a mini booklet; all are very informative and easy to use.  </li>

            <li>As a new essential oil user, this was a great way to get what I needed to mix up some &#x27;lotions and potions&#x27; as my husband calls them.  </li>
            <li>Super handy especially for a beginner.</li>
            <li>plus the booklet was really amazing with lots of Ideas when using Essential Oils.</li>

            <li>Perfect little starter kit for mixing essential oils at home!</li>
            <li>I recently decided after spending way too much money that I would start blending EOs and make my own beauty products.</li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the most well-packaged, helpful and useful item I&#x27;ve purchased here.</li>
            <li>This is a great assortment for starting out in essential oils.</li>
            <li>The tiny dram bottles are perfectly sized for samples, or to carry a small amount of oil in my purse for use at work.  </li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I purchased this when I ordered my first doTerra oils.</li>
            <li>Love all the information and all the different types of bottles.</li>
            <li>and I like bringing my oils with me because they are good for reducing my anxiety (especially after long flights).</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Giving 4 instead of 5 because the roller bottles didn&#x27;t roll very well.</li>
            <li>very haappy.</li>
            <li>Am new to essential oils use</li>
            <li>Just started using Young Living Essential Oils in August.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this set. It has so many things all in one kit for me to make up so many DIY items with my Young Living essential oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great set but the pipettes are junk. I had two of them break at the seam in the bulb already. Aside from that, I do think this is a great kit to get started because you don&#x27;t get too much of anything that you&#x27;ll end up not using and it comes with some great information. I would recommend it to friends....but tell them to buy good pipettes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic kit for oily lovers. I love this so much!</li>
            <li> Overall I liked some of the items. The roller bottles leak which makes a mess when travelling!</li>
            <li> Love them. Great products</li>
            <li> Very good product. I&#x27;m just getting started with essential oils and this was great! I liked the versatility of the different bottles.</li>
            <li> Great kit w/all essentials to get you started</li>
            <li> I got this for myself and I am in love! I am going to give this set as a gift as well so that I can help share the wealth!</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for 2 years now and have not went to the level of customizing them. Now that I have this wonderful kit, I feel like a kid at Christmas opening their first chemistry set.&lt;br /&gt;The order was delivered when promised and packaged in a lovely gift bag.  It would make a great gift for anyone, but I think I will keep this one for myself.  :0)  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> love the kit!!  plus the booklet was really amazing with lots of Ideas when using Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love aromatherapy! My husband bought this for me for my birthday and it is amazing. I love that this aromatherapy set has so many tools in it and for a great price! This is an awesome value for sure! I am so happy that he picked this out as a gift for me. I travel a lot and I like bringing my oils with me because they are good for reducing my anxiety (especially after long flights). I was so happy when I saw the travel sized oil vials! I also had never been able to spray my oils in my home because I didn&#x27;t have the spray bottle. I had actually never even thought of that! But now since this came with the bottles, I am able to spray my oils around my home. The instructions helped me figure out things to do with my oils that I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of myself! Overall an awesome product. Great experience with this and would definitely buy again. :) Thanks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit, I purchased it as a birthday kit for my wife, because i knew she would use it a lot and she does!

Would really make an ideal present for someone, or for somebody who loves a good bit of aromatherapy, would recommend!</li>
            <li> Fantastic kit!  I use the smaller spray bottle for my &#x27;after sun spray&amp;#34; and the larger sprayer for multi-purpose cleaner.  The tiny dram bottles are perfectly sized for samples, or to carry a small amount of oil in my purse for use at work.  The jars are a good size for my homemade massage lotion.  The rollerball bottles will leak a bit if not kept upright, so I&#x27;m sure to keep them in an interior pocket in my purse.  All items are sized well to be TSA compliant, so this kit makes it super easy to travel with all your favorite essential oils.  My favorite part of this kit is the amazing guides!  Pocket-sized guides, a quick reference card, and a mini booklet; all are very informative and easy to use.  This kit is a great value; I will likely buy another one!</li>
            <li> Great deal with a good variety. Products are all very good quality.  The book comes in handy for learning more on oils and the uses of each one.</li>
            <li> This is my first review, but I absolutely had to leave one after receiving this awesome kit. There is so much here! It&#x27;s all packaged nicely. I was really impressed. I can&#x27;t believe the value I got. It would have cost me a small fortune to get this elsewhere. The seller goes the extra mile and everything I need is all there. I&#x27;ve started creating things and its so much fun. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> As a new essential oil user, this was a great way to get what I needed to mix up some &#x27;lotions and potions&#x27; as my husband calls them.  I made a lot of travel containers and am still figuring out ways to use more items.  A great set.</li>
            <li> Perfect little starter kit for mixing essential oils at home! And the little extra cards have some decent information. I do wish they would remove the recommendations for ingestion, but I hope everybody does their research before blindly following.</li>
            <li> Very good assortment .</li>
            <li> I loved this order! Everything came packaged so nicely. I have used most of the items already as gifts or stuff for our own home. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My shipping date was almost a month out but I got my product in less than 2 weeks!! I would order this again!</li>
            <li> Hope this kit is produced again but without the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> I think this is great for any one starting aromatherapy. it comes with good info as well! lots of supplies and little syringes for measuring small quanities..all around a good deal!</li>

            <li> This was a great bunch of helpful tools for using with my essential oils.  The only problem was that the spray bottle came with a cover that did not fit.  :-(  Otherwise, a great collection of useful things, all in one kit!  Love that!</li>
            <li> I recently decided after spending way too much money that I would start blending EOs and make my own beauty products. Came across this kit because I was looking for some starter items, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is quite possibly the most well-packaged, helpful and useful item I&#x27;ve purchased here. It&#x27;s perfect to start with, and the included EO guides are very helpful.</li>

            <li> Loved this, just what I expected- maybe better! Giving 4 instead of 5 because the roller bottles didn&#x27;t roll very well. Other than that- this is a great kit to get started mixing and blending with EOs! And it arrived promptly :)</li>
