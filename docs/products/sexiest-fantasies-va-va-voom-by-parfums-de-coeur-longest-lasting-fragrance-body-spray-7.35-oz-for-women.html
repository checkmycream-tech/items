            <li>But it&#x27;s smells really nice on my brother!</li>
            <li>the price of these sprays are very good compared to paying $100 to $50 for most perfumes.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>However, I was glad to find this on Amazon!</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact , VA VA VOOM would be nice layered with a spritz of Charlie Gold .</li>
            <li>Women and men both comment on how nice I smell.    </li>
            <li>Very strong, pungent smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not typically a fan of musky scents but this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic and sexy, and, because I love it, no doubt they will quit making it!  </li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE scent by sexiest fantasies.</li>

            <li>There aren&#x27;t many scents I like.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find it by itself here on Amazon.</li>

            <li>This product smells wonderful, you&#x27;ll be sure get compliments all day long if you when you wear it.  </li>
            <li>Super quick shipping!!</li>
            <li>Other fragrances that I have found that are great values ,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, and I HOPE Va Va Voom is not a fly-by-night product, since Walgreens already stopped carrying the large bottle, and you have to get the three pack (with two other fragrances</li>
            <li>My Mom gets migraines very easily from almost all body sprays or perfumes, but with this one she not only doesn&#x27;t get even the slightest head ache...</li>
            <li>(In general, men&#x27;s colognes smell much better to me than women&#x27;s.)</li>

            <li>My first experience with this scent was from a sampler 3 pack.  </li>
            <li>Lasts all day - a very \\&quot;confident\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>It also lasts all day , which makes it a real value .</li>
            <li>For that very reason that&#x27;s why you it&#x27;s always sold out in stores...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received plenty of compliments on the smell and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like most other fragrances do.</li>
            <li>Normally I wear Dior or Chanel , but decided to try this after reading favorable reviews .</li>
            <li>and i think  On the prowl is the best out of them all its hard to pick between On the prowl and Slow</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very strong so you would only need a little spray</li>
            <li>the only drawback is the shipping, it&#x27;s much too high.</li>
            <li>It came a day earlier than expected (came in 6 days) and it smells really nice and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Their description \\&quot;An unusually sexy &amp; feminine blend of creamy fig, dark flowers and sultry, exotic fruits, drying down to a subtle but long-lasting accord of rum chocolate liqueur and soft musks.\\&quot; is right on the nose if you remove the word \\&quot;flowers.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too masculine for me.</li>
            <li>, it does NOT cause a headache, as so many other fragrances, male and female alike, even way price-y ones, tend to do.  </li>
            <li>This smells sweet , but not excessively so , rich , and well balanced .</li>
            <li>smell fabulous , and cost little, are Tojours Moi , Charlie ( orginal in blue box ) and Charlie Gold .</li>
            <li>I give a wide berth to the perfume sections of large department stores or hold my breath if one sneaks up on me.</li>
            <li>The combination is magical and I probably should not have told you my secret...</li>
            <li>Just tested it out and you can certainly smell the chocolate rum with a bunch of other scents too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly musky... but not too much so.</li>

            <li> This is my FAVORITE scent by sexiest fantasies. I get compliments when I wear it. I am very disappointed that I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.  VIVA LA VA VA VOOM!</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite SF fragrance. Lasts all day - a very \\&quot;confident\\&quot; scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> As a fan of \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot;-anything, including romance (hand-holding, \\&quot;parking\\&quot;), I found that not only do men find it appealing, but *I* find it appealing on THEM.  It has just enough of a hearty, \\&quot;musky\\&quot; vanilla (if that is even possible?)aspect to it, that it is not too feminine for a man to wear, and if he&#x27;s agreeable, then I&#x27;m set!  It&#x27;s great, and I HOPE Va Va Voom is not a fly-by-night product, since Walgreens already stopped carrying the large bottle, and you have to get the three pack (with two other fragrances I&#x27;m not nuts about).  AND, and this is key, it does NOT cause a headache, as so many other fragrances, male and female alike, even way price-y ones, tend to do.  This stuff is fantastic and sexy, and, because I love it, no doubt they will quit making it!  Stock up while you can, and hope over time it doesn&#x27;t break down (maybe if you freeze them?).  Great stuff, I&#x27;d buy it for a man and just not TELL him it&#x27;s s&#x27;posed to be for the ladies...</li>
            <li> This scent smells like Angel perfume from Thierry Mugler, but this one smells like a man&#x27;s colone. Very strong, pungent smell. Not my fave.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when my local Walgreens stopped carrying this. I hate making the trek to Bath and Body Works, when they&#x27;re rather pricey. However, I was glad to find this on Amazon! I always get compliments when I wear this scent and my friends are forever snagging it out of my backpack for a spritz. It should come with a warning label - will be stolen by jealous friends! I suppose this upcoming Christmas I&#x27;ll have to buy them their own, so they&#x27;ll stop stealing mine! A great price, too!</li>
            <li> If I had to pick three scents to have for the rest of my life \\&quot;Sexiest Fantasies Va Va Voom\\&quot; would be one of them. (The other 2 being Calgon&#x27;s Red Velvet Body Mist and Calgon&#x27;s Pear Caramel Body Mist, in no particular order.)   There aren&#x27;t many scents I like. I give a wide berth to the perfume sections of large department stores or hold my breath if one sneaks up on me. I don&#x27;t like heavy perfumes, I don&#x27;t like florals or heavy musk. (In general, men&#x27;s colognes smell much better to me than women&#x27;s.) I can&#x27;t wear florals or heavy musks due to a tendancy to get headaches from them.  So I wear... food. Fruit scents, dessert scents, candy scents. Sometimes I get tired of smelling sweet; I want to smell *WOW*. Yep, this is the stuff!  This is not a light fruity scent. Their description \\&quot;An unusually sexy &amp; feminine blend of creamy fig, dark flowers and sultry, exotic fruits, drying down to a subtle but long-lasting accord of rum chocolate liqueur and soft musks.\\&quot; is right on the nose if you remove the word \\&quot;flowers.\\&quot; (I don&#x27;t smell them at all.)  Don&#x27;t let the tacky name stop you.  You can sniff it at Walgreens and Rite Aid. Don&#x27;t SPRAY, just SNIFF. (I don&#x27;t want even one less spray in the next bottle I buy!) And don&#x27;t tell everyone about it. (I don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else.) I&#x27;m only telling Amazon customers so Amazon keeps carrying it, in case my local stores stop! (FYI, Sexiest Fantasies Fireworks is also very good.)</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It is pretty funny watching my 6&#x27;5\\&quot; husband dance around singing Va Va Voom.  This product review requires a minimum of 20 words.  My first experience with this scent was from a sampler 3 pack.  It was the best in the pack.</li>
            <li> Normally I wear Dior or Chanel , but decided to try this after reading favorable reviews . Va Va Voom is GREAT! This smells sweet , but not excessively so , rich , and well balanced . It also lasts all day , which makes it a real value . I am amazed at the quality for the price and think it smells EXPENSIVE .&lt;br /&gt;  Other fragrances that I have found that are great values , smell fabulous , and cost little, are Tojours Moi , Charlie ( orginal in blue box ) and Charlie Gold . As a matter of fact , VA VA VOOM would be nice layered with a spritz of Charlie Gold .</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance mist at my local Walgreens last year. It is a very sexy seductive scent. It lasts from morning till late at night.I get loads of complements EVERY time I wear this.Women and men both comment on how nice I smell.    The good thing about this scent is that I do NOT have to layer it as I have had to with oher scents. This smells like a higer end perfume not anything like an inexpensive drug store perfume.Ladies try this one.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful, you&#x27;ll be sure get compliments all day long if you when you wear it.  For that very reason that&#x27;s why you it&#x27;s always sold out in stores...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this one. It doesn&#x27;t stink. It&#x27;s just too masculine for me. But it&#x27;s smells really nice on my brother! So, all is not lost...</li>
            <li> It came a day earlier than expected (came in 6 days) and it smells really nice and lasts long. I will order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Va Va Voom for a few years now... though I&#x27;ve had to buy the three packs with two other scents I don&#x27;t care for in order to get it for a while now, and even those are getting to be hard to find. I&#x27;m so glad to find it by itself here on Amazon. Definitely going to buy one, maybe two bottles! I&#x27;ve received plenty of compliments on the smell and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like most other fragrances do. My Mom gets migraines very easily from almost all body sprays or perfumes, but with this one she not only doesn&#x27;t get even the slightest head ache... but she actually loves the smell of it. It&#x27;s slightly musky... but not too much so. I&#x27;m not typically a fan of musky scents but this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> they used to sell this at my local drugstore and it was my comment go to body spray. But they stop selling it and I can only find it on the internet, I wear this with a combination of CK one shock, &amp; a little bit of angel. The combination is magical and I probably should not have told you my secret... lol</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites, the fragrance lasts all day and I get so many compliments about it.  the only drawback is the shipping, it&#x27;s much too high.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance!! Super quick shipping!!</li>
            <li> Just tested it out and you can certainly smell the chocolate rum with a bunch of other scents too.&lt;br /&gt;It is very strong so you would only need a little spray and it does smell a tad  like a mans perfume so maybe you and your man can use it too.&lt;br /&gt;I have 5 of the different body sprays and i think  On the prowl is the best out of them all its hard to pick between On the prowl and Slow dance.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Va Va voom for those of you that are looking for a heavy scent&lt;br /&gt;as On the prowl is very flowery and sweet smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say i have a lot of perfumes and body sprays and the price of these sprays are very good compared to paying $100 to $50 for most perfumes.</li>
