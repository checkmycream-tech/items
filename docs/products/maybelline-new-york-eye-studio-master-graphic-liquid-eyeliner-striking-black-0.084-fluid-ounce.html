    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The instructions on the Amazon Product Page are excellent.</li>
            <li>For a person with that style preference, this eyeliner was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt tried it in a search for the perfect no-mess stay put liner.</li>
            <li>the control is exquisite!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this isn&#x27;t a very good liner. . .</li>
            <li>It has great pigmentation and opacity along with wear.</li>
            <li>The shape of the applicator is great however the quality of the makeup takes away from this product.</li>
            <li>It looked GREAT while it was on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally very happy with affordable and imaginative Maybelline products.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I think it&#x27;s a great liner for someone who is experienced with makeup and likes to experiment.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li>It works best when you draw one continuous stroke, not unlike when you are painting in detail with a fine brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not crumbly, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This is a good one.  </li>
            <li>This is especially true if you are doing a wing.</li>
            <li>The point was good for a precision line</li>
            <li>My very favorite liner is KatVonD&#x27;s Tattoo liner---it DOES NOT BUDGE.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I got something at a beauty supply store that is way better than this for $2.00!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anyone using this with any kind of precision.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really liked this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It is not the absolute easiest and best liner I have every used.  </li>
            <li>She sort of liked it but had a problem&lt;</li>
            <li>This is kind of a surprise since&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Once on, it looks nice, however, if you have allergies, rub your eyes, etc.</li>
            <li>The Maybelline one dispenses the product in a nice, even line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so loving it,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Applying it is very easy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to control in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things</li>
            <li>It comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>It does look like a magic marker, but honestly, that made it easier to put on.</li>
            <li>Brilliant, really.</li>
            <li>I want to make sure that my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t move.  </li>
            <li>I use Lanc√¥me 24H Artliner, KatVonD&#x27;s Tattoo liner (my favorite of all time), and Estee Lauder liquid liner.</li>
            <li>But applying it, it was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried it though.</li>
            <li>I love the marker type edge/tip...</li>
            <li>I was always more of a pencil girl but now have also expanded to using gels, gel pencils, liquid, and creams as well as shadow as liner  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good eyeliner marker check out Prestige Colossal Ink Pen.</li>
            <li>I got this at Ulta and it is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good eye liner and, applied correctly, provides an even, consistent line.  </li>
            <li>But I have faith that over the time I would get there :) though I thought it would be easier since its like a marker.&lt;br /&gt;People who are experts with eyeliners might find it easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>am in love with how easy it makes it and</li>
            <li>When lining her top lids, it was fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice now, and have been pleasantly surprised by how great it is.  </li>
            <li>got someone with more experience (I consider myself an advanced beginner).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It has almost no pigmentation and what it does have wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li>Applying it was also relatively easy, but then again I&#x27;m someone who uses gel eyeliner, so I&#x27;m used to somewhat tricky liners.  </li>
            <li>One plus is that  It did remove easily; I did not test it in the rain</li>
            <li>but when I had watery eyes it tended to run easily.  </li>
            <li>it transfers really easily</li>
            <li>The eyeliner came off easily.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is a good liquid liner for beginners or those without a steady hand.</li>
            <li>The marker itself also has a fairly strong smell, almost like a Sharpie marker smell.</li>
            <li>Using this makes it pretty easy since you can just angle the tip outwards (angling up from the bottom of you lower lashline), and create a nice flick, which you can fill in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a previous reviewer said, it&#x27;s great for creating wings and I can imagine it would also be great for more high fashion looks.  </li>
            <li>OKAY, this smells EXACTLY like a magic marker.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application with the skinny end is quite easy and straightforward.  </li>
            <li>Applies like a Sharpie (but not as smoothly).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not recommend at all, more aggravation than success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m far from a perfect liquid eyeliner applier but this liner went on smoothly and seamlessly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li>Please note I am not the best cat eye-r in the world and don&#x27;t judge my skills too harshly, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the concept is nice, ideally making wings/cat eyes easier, this marker sucks.</li>
            <li>far as value,  this is about $6 for just .084 of an ounce, so it is no bargain cost wise.  </li>
            <li>, I loved the marker like applier and the color when you first put it on but fades so quickly its not even worth it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply specially for beginner like me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the color is noticeable (good for darker skinned people because you don&#x27;t have to do multiple layers).</li>
            <li>So far very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Because the color is so rich, it actually just takes one swipe and you&#x27;re good to</li>
            <li>Overall, good product for the price.</li>
            <li>, that really only looks good when we are going out or on occasion.</li>
            <li>The graphic eye liner went on easily and stayed on all day, until I washed it off with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li>downside to this is it smudges pretty easily.</li>
            <li>still would give it a 4 stars as Maybelline always makes high quality products, and I&#x27;m sure many women would find this liner promising.</li>
            <li>I use browns and grays in the other brands and am happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: The reason that this liquid liner doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that it smudges really quickly.  </li>
            <li>The fact that this liquid liner started smudging quickly means I probably won&#x27;t be using it unless I run out of my gel liner and need to put eyeliner on to buy another one.</li>
            <li>You can line your eyes with the thinner side or the bold line.</li>
            <li>I think it, and most, marker type eyeliners are really better for specific uses.  </li>
            <li>With the right technique it is possible to get a good result.  </li>
            <li>First of all I am a novice to eyeliners, thought to give it a try since I received a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it on for several hours now and no running or smudging, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>you become used to these markers, they are nice to use, but most people may want to stick with the conventional eye</li>
            <li>Still, it goes on easily and evenly, seems to dry quickly, but it also smudges very easily just from wear.</li>
            <li>I guess  there must be people out there who are looking for this kind of bold, graphic ability (someone in the theater?</li>
            <li>Those seem to apply more darkly black without any additional pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price and the right purpose, I think this is a nice liner.  </li>
            <li>This is good for the thick lined &amp;#34;Mod&amp;#34; look, just not for precise fine lining.  </li>
            <li>and I think that really helped my smooth results.</li>
            <li>It worked straight out of the package and went on smooth.</li>
            <li>not crazy about this liner.</li>
            <li>But it is fun to use as a change.</li>
            <li>applies easily enough, although you do want to prep it with a pump or three, kind of like a felt tip type marker or paint application.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more natural, subtle look, this is probably not the ideal liner for</li>
            <li>will definitely continue to use it and would buy it when this trial is over because it goes on easily, stays on all day, and is easy to remove without smearing.</li>
            <li>When i have the eyeliner on it comes off on the corner of my lid right away.</li>
            <li>Using this, I think it is best for dramatic looks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also smells very strongly like marker, like white board marker.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love Maybelline&#x27;s New York Eye Studio Liquid Liner, but it was not meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a really interesting way to put on eyeliner - and it gives a very rich, totally black color.</li>
            <li>(it went above the original line I made), so I had to re-apply and use the fine point to &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I had hoped this liner would be equally versatile at a more affordable price, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>even a great thick line.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Would have gave higher marks if it was thicker and somewhat smudge proof and/or waterproof.</li>
            <li>This one I was able to remove with the simple touch of a Kleenex.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly enough that it doesn&#x27;t seem safe to use on your skin, let alone around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many different liquid liners but this is the first marker type one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>that is exactly how it stayed from 7 AM to 8:36 PM.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tend to do thick eyeliner, but if this also allows you to be able to do a thicker stripe quick and easy, especially for the top eyelid.</li>
            <li>I really did feel like I had a massive magic marker in my hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real liner, but I actually like this Maybelline one much better since the Benefit one always gunks up on me.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the nice regular line that I got and the lack of skips or clumps.  </li>
            <li>It glides well, and the triangle point/tip function is beneficial because you can get many different looks without much effort.</li>
            <li>It definitely has a marker feel to it, and overall I would say that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Usually Maybelline has good products</li>
            <li>Went on really well</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really meant for thicker lines.</li>
            <li>but it does absolutely none of that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like this eyeliner this much</li>
            <li>I really dislike this product.</li>
            <li>Too much liner comes out when applied.</li>
            <li>to note, it has a rather intense smell.</li>
            <li>I really like the angled tip design of this.</li>
            <li>I really like this liner....now.</li>
            <li>I appreciated that the liner didn&#x27;t flake off or smear even though we had a rainy day today.</li>
            <li>I have a eye liner addiction, and I am very picky with how they work and my opinion about them.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap version of a Benefit product with the same slanted brush, which I like.  </li>
            <li>I rubbed my eye gently by accident and there it went.  </li>
            <li>This is a better quality than any other drugstore liquid liner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for playing around with and seems to have potential for more dramatic and experimental looks, but could be more richly black.</li>
            <li>When I finally got it on it wore off super fast despite having eye primer on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>The fine point contains barely any ink, dragging it across your eye causes irritation because it&#x27;s so dry, and even the broad end that has ink does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>BUT you have to use a eyeshadow primer and use an angled brush to tap a bit of black shadow on top for staying power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can alter the thickness of your application by applying more or less</li>
            <li>I use this along the angled edge, and it goes on very easily and quickly, and gives me a thin line.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there in drugstore and high end makeup there is.</li>
            <li>only thing I didn&#x27;t love about this liner is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as richly pigmented as the specialty and luxury brands of liners I usually buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but yet the size of the pen make it hard to control</li>
            <li>(And I&#x27;ve tried cheap to pricey drugstore!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: as soon as this got wet, it ran everywhere.</li>
            <li>Again, this is just my opinion, but I see this as more of a niche product ‚Äì if you aren‚Äôt applying a wing or heavy line, you probably won‚Äôt care for it.</li>
            <li>I did go over the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; of my cat eye a couple of times to deepen and sharpen it which is normal for me.  </li>
            <li>Not even just a normal day -</li>
            <li>The felt tip is very solid and very thick, so if you are experienced with liners, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, this Maybelline New York Studio Master eyeliner is a sharpie. . .</li>
            <li>a big fan of several Maybelline products, their lipstick primarily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to apply because it is like a chisel tip marker, however it does not go on dark requiring relining or do-overs, it does not flow in a steady stream and the point dries when you&#x27;re mid line and the tip is dragging across your lid.</li>
            <li>Use a folded paper towel, (use the kind with no fluff, or wet it just a little first) and swipe away.</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Graphic Liquid Eyeliner looks and works like a marker making it so much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>only other eyeliners that I&#x27;ve found that are this easy to use are the Kat Von D and Eyeko eyeliners, but this one is literally 1/3 of the cost of those higher-end liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nearly transparent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to a liquid liner with a brush, a gel with a brush, or a pen style with a soft flexible felt/sponge tip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right out of the package this pen worked, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>I prefer the thinner line, but at least we have a choice without having to have more than one eye liner to vary the width.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One hour after you apply it, it has already almost completely faded.  </li>
            <li>I had to apply a few times before I could hold it right and its going to take me a few more times to embrace it.</li>
            <li>The one draw back is that as the pen gets older, mine is like 3 months old</li>
            <li>A good black eyeliner is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I ended up in public with huge black smudges all over my face.</li>
            <li>I can have shaky hands but found this to be very easy to apply to my upper lids.</li>
            <li>It was dry straight from the box.</li>
            <li>But the application was smooth and it dried instantly.</li>
            <li>Maybelline Master graphic liquid eyeliner is very graphic, its super dark and sexy, BUT..its hard to apply.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say is that it is relatively easy to rub away until it sets--and you are definitely going to need a few tries with this.</li>
            <li>I normally get a smear right after application, before the liner has dried, but later in the day?</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that the cap doesn&#x27;t fit on the non-eyeliner end when you take the cap off the eyeliner end.</li>
            <li>I generally use Benefit products</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can barely remove my make-up at night.</li>
            <li>Hours later and then hours after that.. not a winner for me as far as eye liners go.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see it stating waterproof, so it may run if you get into rain, but what a nice way to dye your lashes without going blind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really meant for effects more than mere solid liquid lining.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and dark and thick.</li>
            <li>Bought this local but felt it necessary to warn anyone - skillful or new to liquid eyeliners - that this is a master mistake.</li>
            <li>tip is also great in that it allows you to get both a thin and thick line.  </li>
            <li>The marker really is too big for lining the eye, unless you want your line half an inch</li>
            <li>It looks like a Magic Marker, and the tip is slanted exactly as in the picture, making it possible to draw thick, thin, and singed lines effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>The eyeliner was difficult to open and made a mess on my fingers which wasn&#x27;t a good start (not a big deal, just annoying).&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>a general eye liner, where the desire is to accent the eyes but not make your mascara noticeable, I think conventional eye liner (pencil, crayon thin tip, etc.) are much better suited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is kind of a surprise since&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Once on, it looks nice, however, if you have allergies, rub your eyes, etc.</li>
            <li> The Maybelline one dispenses the product in a nice, even line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so loving it,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Applying it is very easy.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to control in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things</li>
            <li> It comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> It does look like a magic marker, but honestly, that made it easier to put on.</li>
            <li> Brilliant, really.</li>
            <li> I want to make sure that my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t move.  </li>
            <li> I use Lanc√¥me 24H Artliner, KatVonD&#x27;s Tattoo liner (my favorite of all time), and Estee Lauder liquid liner.</li>
            <li> But applying it, it was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried it though.</li>
            <li> I love the marker type edge/tip...</li>
            <li> I was always more of a pencil girl but now have also expanded to using gels, gel pencils, liquid, and creams as well as shadow as liner  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a good eyeliner marker check out Prestige Colossal Ink Pen.</li>
            <li> I got this at Ulta and it is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good eye liner and, applied correctly, provides an even, consistent line.  </li>
            <li> But I have faith that over the time I would get there :) though I thought it would be easier since its like a marker.&lt;br /&gt;People who are experts with eyeliners might find it easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> am in love with how easy it makes it and</li>
            <li> When lining her top lids, it was fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now, and have been pleasantly surprised by how great it is.  </li>
            <li> got someone with more experience (I consider myself an advanced beginner).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It has almost no pigmentation and what it does have wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li> Applying it was also relatively easy, but then again I&#x27;m someone who uses gel eyeliner, so I&#x27;m used to somewhat tricky liners.  </li>
            <li> One plus is that  It did remove easily; I did not test it in the rain</li>
            <li> but when I had watery eyes it tended to run easily.  </li>
            <li> it transfers really easily</li>
            <li> The eyeliner came off easily.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is a good liquid liner for beginners or those without a steady hand.</li>
            <li> The marker itself also has a fairly strong smell, almost like a Sharpie marker smell.</li>
            <li> Using this makes it pretty easy since you can just angle the tip outwards (angling up from the bottom of you lower lashline), and create a nice flick, which you can fill in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer said, it&#x27;s great for creating wings and I can imagine it would also be great for more high fashion looks.  </li>
            <li> OKAY, this smells EXACTLY like a magic marker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application with the skinny end is quite easy and straightforward.  </li>
            <li> Applies like a Sharpie (but not as smoothly).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not recommend at all, more aggravation than success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m far from a perfect liquid eyeliner applier but this liner went on smoothly and seamlessly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> Please note I am not the best cat eye-r in the world and don&#x27;t judge my skills too harshly, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the concept is nice, ideally making wings/cat eyes easier, this marker sucks.</li>
            <li> far as value,  this is about $6 for just .084 of an ounce, so it is no bargain cost wise.  </li>
            <li> , I loved the marker like applier and the color when you first put it on but fades so quickly its not even worth it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply specially for beginner like me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the color is noticeable (good for darker skinned people because you don&#x27;t have to do multiple layers).</li>
            <li> So far very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Because the color is so rich, it actually just takes one swipe and you&#x27;re good to</li>
            <li> Overall, good product for the price.</li>
            <li> , that really only looks good when we are going out or on occasion.</li>
            <li> The graphic eye liner went on easily and stayed on all day, until I washed it off with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li> downside to this is it smudges pretty easily.</li>
            <li> still would give it a 4 stars as Maybelline always makes high quality products, and I&#x27;m sure many women would find this liner promising.</li>
            <li> I use browns and grays in the other brands and am happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : The reason that this liquid liner doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that it smudges really quickly.  </li>
            <li> The fact that this liquid liner started smudging quickly means I probably won&#x27;t be using it unless I run out of my gel liner and need to put eyeliner on to buy another one.</li>
            <li> You can line your eyes with the thinner side or the bold line.</li>
            <li> I think it, and most, marker type eyeliners are really better for specific uses.  </li>
            <li> With the right technique it is possible to get a good result.  </li>
            <li> First of all I am a novice to eyeliners, thought to give it a try since I received a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it on for several hours now and no running or smudging, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> you become used to these markers, they are nice to use, but most people may want to stick with the conventional eye</li>
            <li> Still, it goes on easily and evenly, seems to dry quickly, but it also smudges very easily just from wear.</li>
            <li> I guess  there must be people out there who are looking for this kind of bold, graphic ability (someone in the theater?</li>
            <li> Those seem to apply more darkly black without any additional pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price and the right purpose, I think this is a nice liner.  </li>
            <li> This is good for the thick lined &amp;#34;Mod&amp;#34; look, just not for precise fine lining.  </li>
            <li> and I think that really helped my smooth results.</li>
            <li> It worked straight out of the package and went on smooth.</li>
            <li> not crazy about this liner.</li>
            <li> But it is fun to use as a change.</li>
            <li> applies easily enough, although you do want to prep it with a pump or three, kind of like a felt tip type marker or paint application.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a more natural, subtle look, this is probably not the ideal liner for</li>
            <li> will definitely continue to use it and would buy it when this trial is over because it goes on easily, stays on all day, and is easy to remove without smearing.</li>
            <li> When i have the eyeliner on it comes off on the corner of my lid right away.</li>
            <li> Using this, I think it is best for dramatic looks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also smells very strongly like marker, like white board marker.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love Maybelline&#x27;s New York Eye Studio Liquid Liner, but it was not meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a really interesting way to put on eyeliner - and it gives a very rich, totally black color.</li>
            <li> (it went above the original line I made), so I had to re-apply and use the fine point to &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had hoped this liner would be equally versatile at a more affordable price, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> even a great thick line.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Would have gave higher marks if it was thicker and somewhat smudge proof and/or waterproof.</li>
            <li> This one I was able to remove with the simple touch of a Kleenex.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly enough that it doesn&#x27;t seem safe to use on your skin, let alone around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many different liquid liners but this is the first marker type one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> that is exactly how it stayed from 7 AM to 8:36 PM.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to do thick eyeliner, but if this also allows you to be able to do a thicker stripe quick and easy, especially for the top eyelid.</li>
            <li> I really did feel like I had a massive magic marker in my hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real liner, but I actually like this Maybelline one much better since the Benefit one always gunks up on me.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the nice regular line that I got and the lack of skips or clumps.  </li>
            <li> It glides well, and the triangle point/tip function is beneficial because you can get many different looks without much effort.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a marker feel to it, and overall I would say that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Usually Maybelline has good products</li>
            <li> Went on really well</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really meant for thicker lines.</li>
            <li> but it does absolutely none of that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this eyeliner this much</li>
            <li> I really dislike this product.</li>
            <li> Too much liner comes out when applied.</li>
            <li> to note, it has a rather intense smell.</li>
            <li> I really like the angled tip design of this.</li>
            <li> I really like this liner....now.</li>
            <li> I appreciated that the liner didn&#x27;t flake off or smear even though we had a rainy day today.</li>
            <li> I have a eye liner addiction, and I am very picky with how they work and my opinion about them.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap version of a Benefit product with the same slanted brush, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed my eye gently by accident and there it went.  </li>
            <li> This is a better quality than any other drugstore liquid liner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for playing around with and seems to have potential for more dramatic and experimental looks, but could be more richly black.</li>
            <li> When I finally got it on it wore off super fast despite having eye primer on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> The fine point contains barely any ink, dragging it across your eye causes irritation because it&#x27;s so dry, and even the broad end that has ink does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> BUT you have to use a eyeshadow primer and use an angled brush to tap a bit of black shadow on top for staying power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can alter the thickness of your application by applying more or less</li>
            <li> I use this along the angled edge, and it goes on very easily and quickly, and gives me a thin line.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there in drugstore and high end makeup there is.</li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t love about this liner is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as richly pigmented as the specialty and luxury brands of liners I usually buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but yet the size of the pen make it hard to control</li>
            <li> (And I&#x27;ve tried cheap to pricey drugstore!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: as soon as this got wet, it ran everywhere.</li>
            <li> Again, this is just my opinion, but I see this as more of a niche product ‚Äì if you aren‚Äôt applying a wing or heavy line, you probably won‚Äôt care for it.</li>
            <li> I did go over the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; of my cat eye a couple of times to deepen and sharpen it which is normal for me.  </li>
            <li> Not even just a normal day -</li>
            <li> The felt tip is very solid and very thick, so if you are experienced with liners, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, this Maybelline New York Studio Master eyeliner is a sharpie. . .</li>
            <li> a big fan of several Maybelline products, their lipstick primarily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to apply because it is like a chisel tip marker, however it does not go on dark requiring relining or do-overs, it does not flow in a steady stream and the point dries when you&#x27;re mid line and the tip is dragging across your lid.</li>
            <li> Use a folded paper towel, (use the kind with no fluff, or wet it just a little first) and swipe away.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Graphic Liquid Eyeliner looks and works like a marker making it so much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> only other eyeliners that I&#x27;ve found that are this easy to use are the Kat Von D and Eyeko eyeliners, but this one is literally 1/3 of the cost of those higher-end liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nearly transparent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to a liquid liner with a brush, a gel with a brush, or a pen style with a soft flexible felt/sponge tip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right out of the package this pen worked, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> I prefer the thinner line, but at least we have a choice without having to have more than one eye liner to vary the width.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One hour after you apply it, it has already almost completely faded.  </li>
            <li> I had to apply a few times before I could hold it right and its going to take me a few more times to embrace it.</li>
            <li> The one draw back is that as the pen gets older, mine is like 3 months old</li>
            <li> A good black eyeliner is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I ended up in public with huge black smudges all over my face.</li>
            <li> I can have shaky hands but found this to be very easy to apply to my upper lids.</li>
            <li> It was dry straight from the box.</li>
            <li> But the application was smooth and it dried instantly.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Master graphic liquid eyeliner is very graphic, its super dark and sexy, BUT..its hard to apply.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say is that it is relatively easy to rub away until it sets--and you are definitely going to need a few tries with this.</li>
            <li> I normally get a smear right after application, before the liner has dried, but later in the day?</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the cap doesn&#x27;t fit on the non-eyeliner end when you take the cap off the eyeliner end.</li>
            <li> I generally use Benefit products</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can barely remove my make-up at night.</li>
            <li> Hours later and then hours after that.. not a winner for me as far as eye liners go.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see it stating waterproof, so it may run if you get into rain, but what a nice way to dye your lashes without going blind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really meant for effects more than mere solid liquid lining.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and dark and thick.</li>
            <li> Bought this local but felt it necessary to warn anyone - skillful or new to liquid eyeliners - that this is a master mistake.</li>
            <li> tip is also great in that it allows you to get both a thin and thick line.  </li>
            <li> The marker really is too big for lining the eye, unless you want your line half an inch</li>
            <li> It looks like a Magic Marker, and the tip is slanted exactly as in the picture, making it possible to draw thick, thin, and singed lines effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> The eyeliner was difficult to open and made a mess on my fingers which wasn&#x27;t a good start (not a big deal, just annoying).&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> a general eye liner, where the desire is to accent the eyes but not make your mascara noticeable, I think conventional eye liner (pencil, crayon thin tip, etc.) are much better suited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is dramatic and precise.</li>
            <li> so it looks ‚Äúnormal‚Äù from a little distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It applied like using a flat edged eyeliner brush with the slanted tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use the Kat Von D Tattoo Liner in Trooper and I adore it for delicate barely noticeable looks as well as fierce cat eye looks.</li>
            <li> My wife typically uses the more expensive makeup like Mac, Urban Decay, etc., but I thought I&#x27;d let her try out this Maybelline eyeliner because it&#x27;s about 1/5 of the price of the others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried several times to scrape it across my lids and finally along the back of my hand before getting anything to bleed out in blackest black.</li>
            <li> I have had my eyelashes start to turn grey and</li>
            <li> The liner stays on throughout long days, and there&#x27;s no migration.  </li>
            <li> I was curious to try this because I&#x27;d seen seen an ad for this in a beauty magazine and also because I&#x27;ve been branching out to different types of liners  </li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect that it would be long</li>
            <li> Traditional eyeliner is REALLY hard to use for the new cat eye trends.</li>
            <li> But I can only get it in Trooper (black) and being a blonde</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try a new eyeliner as my usual pencil from Almay did not give the impact I wanted.</li>
            <li> Ever try to use a dry erase marker as an eyeliner?</li>
            <li> To get a thin line you really can only use othe tip.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t note any irregularity in the pigment; rather, it seemed quite solid black, at least as much so as my gel liners.  </li>
            <li> came home, had dinner, and then sanded down an entire walk in closet.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t actually stay IN SHAPE the whole time!  </li>
            <li> What small amount hits your eye line, you can smear if you hurry,and it makes a great base for any color</li>
            <li> Coverage isn&#x27;t thick enough; can see through to bare skin when applied.</li>
            <li> It gives precision, but never dulls down like typical pencils do since it&#x27;s a marker.</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice as it&#x27;s a different technique than you are probably used to.</li>
            <li> It smudges and drips if you rub it or get it wet.  </li>
            <li> This is about what I expected.  </li>
            <li> , the cap is harder to remove.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother since I am not much of an eye makeup person.</li>
            <li> but after a couple of tries it was a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> kind of hate this liner.</li>
            <li> maybe would work better if you&#x27;re looking for a very thick, dramatic line.</li>
            <li> None of my other eye make-up smells so that took some getting used it.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to apply at first until I began using just the narrow tip.</li>
            <li> This product does not go on nearly as dark as the picture.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to blink for a few seconds to let it set.</li>
            <li> The tip is like a marker, thin to thick and if you do not hold it exact...</li>
            <li> The eyeliner itself was NOT bold, the color did not look like a dark black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to apply than the liquid liner I typically use.</li>
            <li> : The color is actually black instead of the charcoal gray that some &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; eyeliners are.  </li>
            <li> I applied it less than an two hours ago</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already slightly smudged.  </li>
            <li> But much less then</li>
            <li> but I could see where the learning curve would be less pronounced</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now avoiding it because our first date was awkward.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was impossible to get right to the lash line, it skips, and it isn&#x27;t as black as I like.</li>
            <li> It does stay all day &amp; smears a little.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am someone who likes to wear heavy eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like applying shoepolish to a shoe that dries unevenly (leaving darker and lighter patches).</li>
            <li> but I did not like the way it dried.  </li>
            <li> I looked like I was crying ink.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;uniqueness&#x27; of the squared tip doesn&#x27;t open up possibilities for design and application - it&#x27;s inflexible and doesn&#x27;t go on as needed.</li>
            <li> you can get uneven lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if the marker is dried out.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they got the picture on the packaging to look so dark</li>
            <li> This requires you to recap and shake the liner down into the hard tip.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the initial packaging and the design of the product... at all.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is the crappy packaging and weird scent.</li>
            <li> a little too thick and hard to control.</li>
            <li> It was very awkward to use at first</li>
            <li> but for me it was a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> would recommend this as stage makeup because it&#x27;s so dramatic, but the sweat from the lights and other makeups would make it run and ruin the production.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is also inconsistent e.g. it comes out a shiny reflective black but dries with a shiny thin sheen to it.</li>
            <li> I also found it hard to control the depth of color that was applied.</li>
            <li> but this product sucks.</li>
            <li> Let me list a few of the things that are not great about this</li>
            <li> the other expensive liners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I think if you are someone who likes subtle eyeliner</li>
            <li> The shape of the tip makes it hard to do a thin line, or</li>
            <li> The chisel tip is a bit awkward at first--especially compared to using a pencil but should take minimal time to get used to.</li>
            <li> It was very dark and very dramatic.</li>
            <li> You can get a VERY thick line if you want</li>
            <li> You can use the thin end or the thicker end, depending on what type of look you are going for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof though, and some people may find that irritating because it would smudge if it was raining.</li>
            <li> If you like dramatic though, pick this up.</li>
            <li> You have to pull real hard and that can splatter on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m a thinner eyeliner girl, because this behemoth was just crazy hard to manage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it is a bit difficult to get fully off.</li>
            <li> I put it on at 7 AM, wore it to work, teared up while reading a sad story at work,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> This is miserably disappointing.</li>
            <li> Opening it, it smells like one too, very weird and chemical.  </li>
            <li> The applicator on mine did not have an angle and had a blunt tip almost like the eraser on a pencil... made it almost impossible to use.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a magazine ad and as a person who is obsessed with getting the Cat Eye or Wing look done, I have failed miserably.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Rite Aid and I am just so disappointed with this</li>
            <li> I HATE mascara</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is terrible every time i take the cap off the plastic liner dosent even come of and it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it smells awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This eyeliner is terrible every time i take the cap off the plastic liner dosent even come of and it gets everywhere. When i have the eyeliner on it comes off on the corner of my lid right away. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Ever try to use a dry erase marker as an eyeliner? Now you can! This eyeliner was every bit as big and unwieldy as a kids marker. I normally use the Kat Von D Tattoo Liner in Trooper and I adore it for delicate barely noticeable looks as well as fierce cat eye looks. I had hoped this liner would be equally versatile at a more affordable price, but it&#x27;s not. I really did feel like I had a massive magic marker in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was impossible to get right to the lash line, it skips, and it isn&#x27;t as black as I like. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone using this with any kind of precision. The only positive thing I can say is that it is relatively easy to rub away until it sets--and you are definitely going to need a few tries with this.</li>
            <li> I had never used this before, but I have to say, I do like the angled tip.</li>
            <li> First of all I am a novice to eyeliners, thought to give it a try since I received a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you I struggled to apply this liner correctly, still couldn&#x27;t achieve the results But I have faith that over the time I would get there :) though I thought it would be easier since its like a marker.&lt;br /&gt;People who are experts with eyeliners might find it easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still would give it a 4 stars as Maybelline always makes high quality products, and I&#x27;m sure many women would find this liner promising. The instructions on the Amazon Product Page are excellent.</li>
            <li> I am someone who likes to wear heavy eyeliner. For a person with that style preference, this eyeliner was perfect for me. It goes on nice and dark and thick. It&#x27;s easier to apply than the liquid liner I typically use. It does look like a magic marker, but honestly, that made it easier to put on. It&#x27;s easy to hold. My one complaint is that the cap doesn&#x27;t fit on the non-eyeliner end when you take the cap off the eyeliner end. Otherwise, I really liked this eyeliner. I think if you are someone who likes subtle eyeliner this might not be the product for you. If you like dramatic though, pick this up.</li>
            <li> not crazy about this liner. a little too thick and hard to control. maybe would work better if you&#x27;re looking for a very thick, dramatic line.</li>
            <li> My wife typically uses the more expensive makeup like Mac, Urban Decay, etc., but I thought I&#x27;d let her try out this Maybelline eyeliner because it&#x27;s about 1/5 of the price of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s also about 1/5 the quality of the others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this Maybelline New York Studio Master eyeliner is a sharpie. . . in eyeliner form.  It smells like a Sharpie.  Applies like a Sharpie (but not as smoothly).  And it STAYS ON like a Sharpie.  And that&#x27;s not a compliment to its staying power.  It stains your eyelashes! Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t actually stay IN SHAPE the whole time!  It smudges and drips if you rub it or get it wet.  AWFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as stage makeup because it&#x27;s so dramatic, but the sweat from the lights and other makeups would make it run and ruin the production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this isn&#x27;t a very good liner. . . avoid.</li>
            <li> There is nothing about this product that I like. Let me list a few of the things that are not great about this eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is nearly transparent. It has almost no pigmentation and what it does have wears off very quickly. Within 4 hours, I looked like I never put it on.&lt;br /&gt;2. The shape of the tip makes it hard to do a thin line, or even a great thick line.&lt;br /&gt;3. It feels watery, not creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of hate this liner. I recommend that you skip this and try Essence brand chubby marker instead. It has great pigmentation and opacity along with wear. But skip this and save your money.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply specially for beginner like me</li>
            <li> faded within an hour every time i applied it. Went on really well, I loved the marker like applier and the color when you first put it on but fades so quickly its not even worth it. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this local but felt it necessary to warn anyone - skillful or new to liquid eyeliners - that this is a master mistake. While the concept is nice, ideally making wings/cat eyes easier, this marker sucks. It was dry straight from the box. I tried several times to scrape it across my lids and finally along the back of my hand before getting anything to bleed out in blackest black. Went on gray, faded, and with difficulty even after I got it going. I&#x27;ll be returning this.</li>
            <li> The shape of the applicator is great however the quality of the makeup takes away from this product. Coverage isn&#x27;t thick enough; can see through to bare skin when applied. Would have gave higher marks if it was thicker and somewhat smudge proof and/or waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is about what I expected.  Sort of a marker which is an eyeliner.  There are videos up showing how to hold it to get the line you want.  With the right technique it is possible to get a good result.  It is not the absolute easiest and best liner I have every used.  But it is fun to use as a change.</li>
            <li> OKAY, this smells EXACTLY like a magic marker. BUT it doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to water, or tickle my nose,so... That said,I would NOT get this in my eye under any circumstances, it does contain alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all of this, I may buy 20 of these. I am not going to use it as eyeliner per se. I have had my eyelashes start to turn grey and fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead of &amp;#34;dyelash&amp;#34; I will use this. Seems 800 times safer than dyelash with peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see it stating waterproof, so it may run if you get into rain, but what a nice way to dye your lashes without going blind. I HATE mascara, it seem to clump up even if I run the wand under water, and never lasts all day. This did.  Use a folded paper towel, (use the kind with no fluff, or wet it just a little first) and swipe away. What small amount hits your eye line, you can smear if you hurry,and it makes a great base for any color eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a lash dye it&#x27;s a WINNER!</li>
            <li> The applicator on mine did not have an angle and had a blunt tip almost like the eraser on a pencil... made it almost impossible to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but yet the size of the pen make it hard to control</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love Maybelline&#x27;s New York Eye Studio Liquid Liner, but it was not meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The color is actually black instead of the charcoal gray that some &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; eyeliners are.  Applying it was also relatively easy, but then again I&#x27;m someone who uses gel eyeliner, so I&#x27;m used to somewhat tricky liners.  This one was definitely easier to apply than gel liner.  I didn&#x27;t use the dash method, I just slid it across my eyelid and the line came out straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The reason that this liquid liner doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that it smudges really quickly.  I applied it less than an two hours ago and it&#x27;s already slightly smudged.  I can&#x27;t imagine it lasting all day.  Here&#x27;s the thing: I wear face primer, follow that up with foundation with primer included, followed by an actual eye primer, followed by eyeshadow with primer included, and then I apply the eyeliner.  I want to make sure that my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t move.  Now that method works with my gel liner and that doesn&#x27;t start to smudge up until about hour 8.  The fact that this liquid liner started smudging quickly means I probably won&#x27;t be using it unless I run out of my gel liner and need to put eyeliner on to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I generally use Benefit products but I thought I would try this out. I&#x27;ve been using liquid line for about 15 years and tried all kinds. This product but it&#x27;s really meant for thicker lines. To get a thin line you really can only use othe tip. It does stay all day &amp; smears a little. But much less then the other expensive liners I&#x27;ve tried. The one draw back is that as the pen gets older, mine is like 3 months old, the cap is harder to remove. You have to pull real hard and that can splatter on your clothes. I&#x27;ve reuioned two shirts that way. If they made this product for a thinner line I&#x27;d definitely but that. Overall, good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is a good liquid liner for beginners or those without a steady hand. It&#x27;s fast and easy to apply because it is like a chisel tip marker, however it does not go on dark requiring relining or do-overs, it does not flow in a steady stream and the point dries when you&#x27;re mid line and the tip is dragging across your lid. This requires you to recap and shake the liner down into the hard tip. The felt tip is very solid and very thick, so if you are experienced with liners, this is not the one for you. Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s on, unless you wipe your eye, then it&#x27;s destroyed. But it&#x27;s not crumbly, so that&#x27;s good. This is good for the thick lined &amp;#34;Mod&amp;#34; look, just not for precise fine lining.  I&#x27;ll stick to a liquid liner with a brush, a gel with a brush, or a pen style with a soft flexible felt/sponge tip.</li>
            <li> This is miserably disappointing. I like to do cat eye liner and thought this would expedite and refine my technique but it does absolutely none of that. The fine point contains barely any ink, dragging it across your eye causes irritation because it&#x27;s so dry, and even the broad end that has ink does not go on smoothly. It&#x27;s chunky, skips, and does not come out solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend at all, more aggravation than success.</li>
            <li> This eyeline truly acts like a marker and I had a bit of difficulty learning how to manuever the lines/edges correctly in order get the lines that I wanted. I also found it hard to control the depth of color that was applied. The pressure used determines the amount that comes out.  The color is also inconsistent e.g. it comes out a shiny reflective black but dries with a shiny thin sheen to it. It&#x27;s like applying shoepolish to a shoe that dries unevenly (leaving darker and lighter patches). One plus is that  It did remove easily; I did not test it in the rain but when I had watery eyes it tended to run easily.  I finally mastered the line that I wanted but I did not like the way it dried.  Overall I would not recommend the eyeliner; it did not work well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother since I am not much of an eye makeup person. She sort of liked it but had a problem&lt;br /&gt;with controlling how the line looked. When lining her top lids, it was fine. But the bottom lid, lining that, was more&lt;br /&gt;of an issue. She said she&#x27;ll finish using this sample but will not be purchasing again. This is kind of a surprise since&lt;br /&gt;I tend to like Maybelline when it comes to foundation. Perhaps eye makeup is just not their thing.</li>
            <li> A good black eyeliner is hard to find.  This is a good one.  It looks like a Magic Marker, and the tip is slanted exactly as in the picture, making it possible to draw thick, thin, and singed lines effortlessly.  The liner stays on throughout long days, and there&#x27;s no migration.  It stays put.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I use Lanc√¥me 24H Artliner, KatVonD&#x27;s Tattoo liner (my favorite of all time), and Estee Lauder liquid liner. That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there in drugstore and high end makeup there is. If it&#x27;s sold at Sephora, Ulta, department stores, you name it I have no doubt tried it in a search for the perfect no-mess stay put liner. My very favorite liner is KatVonD&#x27;s Tattoo liner---it DOES NOT BUDGE. But I can only get it in Trooper (black) and being a blonde, that really only looks good when we are going out or on occasion. I use browns and grays in the other brands and am happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the package this pen worked, which surprised me. But the application was smooth and it dried instantly. I had applied Urban Decay shadow primer before lining my eyes and I think that really helped my smooth results. This says to apply in dashed lines and then join them--I&#x27;d recommend that as well. I&#x27;m far from a perfect liquid eyeliner applier but this liner went on smoothly and seamlessly. I&#x27;ve had it on for several hours now and no running or smudging, I&#x27;m very pleased. You can get a VERY thick line if you want but I just used the edge. It applied like using a flat edged eyeliner brush with the slanted tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of several Maybelline products, their lipstick primarily. I didn&#x27;t expect to like this eyeliner this much but I would buy this again if I needed a liquid eyeliner and could only buy a drugstore product. This is a better quality than any other drugstore liquid liner I&#x27;ve tried. (And I&#x27;ve tried cheap to pricey drugstore!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: as soon as this got wet, it ran everywhere. I looked like I was crying ink. If I **HAD** to buy a liquid liner at the drugstore that needed to last longer than that, I&#x27;d buy a L&#x27;Oreal liquid liner or even a Wet N Wild H2O Proof liquid liner instead of this. It looked GREAT while it was on but it&#x27;s very fragile</li>
            <li> I really dislike this product. The &#x27;uniqueness&#x27; of the squared tip doesn&#x27;t open up possibilities for design and application - it&#x27;s inflexible and doesn&#x27;t go on as needed. Too much liner comes out when applied. I guess  there must be people out there who are looking for this kind of bold, graphic ability (someone in the theater? don&#x27;t try this if your hands shake at ALL) but for me it was a major disappointment. I&#x27;m normally very happy with affordable and imaginative Maybelline products.</li>
            <li> When I held this in my hand, I did not know it was make-up. Had I not opened it myself, I might have picked it up and put it in the kitchen thinking it was a marker. But that is what it is, eyeliner like a marker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying it is very easy. I can have shaky hands but found this to be very easy to apply to my upper lids. It was very dark and very dramatic. You can use the thin end or the thicker end, depending on what type of look you are going for. It is very easy to control in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note, it has a rather intense smell. Think of a marker, it smells like one. None of my other eye make-up smells so that took some getting used it. Once it is on, you can‚Äôt smell it. But applying it, it was overwhelming. Once on, it looks nice, however, if you have allergies, rub your eyes, etc. this might not be for you. It comes off very easily. Sometimes I can barely remove my make-up at night. This one I was able to remove with the simple touch of a Kleenex. If I rubbed my eye, I looked like a raccoon. If you are one to leave your eyes alone, this might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the style of the application but the smell and that fact that it does not stay on well I probably would not buy it in the future. I am glad I tried it though. Again, if you do touch your eyes, this might be for you. I am prone to run mine so it does not work for me.</li>
            <li> This is a really interesting way to put on eyeliner - and it gives a very rich, totally black color. I really like the angled tip design of this. It gives precision, but never dulls down like typical pencils do since it&#x27;s a marker. Brilliant, really. I use this along the angled edge, and it goes on very easily and quickly, and gives me a thin line. I don&#x27;t tend to do thick eyeliner, but if this also allows you to be able to do a thicker stripe quick and easy, especially for the top eyelid. Because the color is so rich, it actually just takes one swipe and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this is it smudges pretty easily. It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it is a bit difficult to get fully off. The marker itself also has a fairly strong smell, almost like a Sharpie marker smell. But it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my eyes or skin, so points there.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m a thinner eyeliner girl, because this behemoth was just crazy hard to manage. It&#x27;s really meant for effects more than mere solid liquid lining. Still, it goes on easily and evenly, seems to dry quickly, but it also smudges very easily just from wear. It does not last the day. As others have noted, it smells awful. It smells strongly enough that it doesn&#x27;t seem safe to use on your skin, let alone around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m passing on this liner.</li>
            <li> I really like this liner....now. It was very awkward to use at first but after a couple of tries it was a piece of cake. Yes, it flakes and comes off BUT you have to use a eyeshadow primer and use an angled brush to tap a bit of black shadow on top for staying power. This is especially true if you are doing a wing. My liner lasts all day this way. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It smudges after it dries. I ended up in public with huge black smudges all over my face. I love the marker type edge/tip...but this product sucks.</li>
            <li> I have used many different liquid liners but this is the first marker type one I&#x27;ve tried. I found it difficult to apply at first until I began using just the narrow tip. The marker really is too big for lining the eye, unless you want your line half an inch wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells very strongly like marker, like white board marker. Made me question whether I want to put this on my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the kicker for me was that it smeared on my lid throughout the day. I normally get a smear right after application, before the liner has dried, but later in the day? Hours later and then hours after that.. not a winner for me as far as eye liners go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now, and have been pleasantly surprised by how great it is.  The angled tip reminds me of the much-more-expensive Benefit They&#x27;re Real liner, but I actually like this Maybelline one much better since the Benefit one always gunks up on me.  The Maybelline one dispenses the product in a nice, even line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip is also great in that it allows you to get both a thin and thick line.  Using this makes it pretty easy since you can just angle the tip outwards (angling up from the bottom of you lower lashline), and create a nice flick, which you can fill in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other eyeliners that I&#x27;ve found that are this easy to use are the Kat Von D and Eyeko eyeliners, but this one is literally 1/3 of the cost of those higher-end liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are that it does smudge a bit and it transfers really easily while it&#x27;s drying.  I have to be careful not to blink for a few seconds to let it set.</li>
            <li> I was curious to try this because I&#x27;d seen seen an ad for this in a beauty magazine and also because I&#x27;ve been branching out to different types of liners  I was always more of a pencil girl but now have also expanded to using gels, gel pencils, liquid, and creams as well as shadow as liner  Using this, I think it is best for dramatic looks.  As a previous reviewer said, it&#x27;s great for creating wings and I can imagine it would also be great for more high fashion looks.  Because of this, I think it&#x27;s a great liner for someone who is experienced with makeup and likes to experiment.  The size and feel of this liquid liner took some time to get used to in my hand but I could see where the learning curve would be less pronounced got someone with more experience (I consider myself an advanced beginner).  If you&#x27;re looking for a more natural, subtle look, this is probably not the ideal liner for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t love about this liner is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as richly pigmented as the specialty and luxury brands of liners I usually buy.  Those seem to apply more darkly black without any additional pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price and the right purpose, I think this is a nice liner.  It&#x27;s great for playing around with and seems to have potential for more dramatic and experimental looks, but could be more richly black.</li>
            <li> The graphic eye liner went on easily and stayed on all day, until I washed it off with a warm washcloth. I appreciated that the liner didn&#x27;t flake off or smear even though we had a rainy day today. You can line your eyes with the thinner side or the bold line. I prefer the thinner line, but at least we have a choice without having to have more than one eye liner to vary the width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use it and would buy it when this trial is over because it goes on easily, stays on all day, and is easy to remove without smearing.</li>
            <li> The public had a need and Maybelline responded! Woo hoo! Traditional eyeliner is REALLY hard to use for the new cat eye trends. Maybelline New York Eye Studio Master Graphic Liquid Eyeliner looks and works like a marker making it so much easier to apply. It goes where you put it and stays there. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with smudging or fading throughout the day. It goes on evenly and not splotchy like some liquids. It&#x27;s smooth. It does take a little practice as it&#x27;s a different technique than you are probably used to. I think it&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good eye liner and, applied correctly, provides an even, consistent line.  I think it, and most, marker type eyeliners are really better for specific uses.  That would be a more exaggerated ‚Äúwing‚Äù eye liner or a ‚Äústage‚Äù makeup, where you want it thicker so it looks ‚Äúnormal‚Äù from a little distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a general eye liner, where the desire is to accent the eyes but not make your mascara noticeable, I think conventional eye liner (pencil, crayon thin tip, etc.) are much better suited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This applies easily enough, although you do want to prep it with a pump or three, kind of like a felt tip type marker or paint application.  It works best when you draw one continuous stroke, not unlike when you are painting in detail with a fine brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can alter the thickness of your application by applying more or less pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you become used to these markers, they are nice to use, but most people may want to stick with the conventional eye liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as value,  this is about $6 for just .084 of an ounce, so it is no bargain cost wise.  Again, this is just my opinion, but I see this as more of a niche product ‚Äì if you aren‚Äôt applying a wing or heavy line, you probably won‚Äôt care for it.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the initial packaging and the design of the product... at all.  It looks like a big fat permanent marker.  Opening it, it smells like one too, very weird and chemical.  However.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application with the skinny end is quite easy and straightforward.  I was surprised at the nice regular line that I got and the lack of skips or clumps.  I didn&#x27;t note any irregularity in the pigment; rather, it seemed quite solid black, at least as much so as my gel liners.  I did go over the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; of my cat eye a couple of times to deepen and sharpen it which is normal for me.  Please note I am not the best cat eye-r in the world and don&#x27;t judge my skills too harshly, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lasted ALL day.  Not even just a normal day - I put it on at 7 AM, wore it to work, teared up while reading a sad story at work, came home, had dinner, and then sanded down an entire walk in closet.  It stayed put.  I&#x27;ve attached a photo of the liner after the entire day.  No kidding, no retouching, that is exactly how it stayed from 7 AM to 8:36 PM.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is the crappy packaging and weird scent.</li>
            <li> I have a eye liner addiction, and I am very picky with how they work and my opinion about them. Maybelline Master graphic liquid eyeliner is very graphic, its super dark and sexy, BUT..its hard to apply. The tip is like a marker, thin to thick and if you do not hold it exact...you can get uneven lines. I had to apply a few times before I could hold it right and its going to take me a few more times to embrace it. Does it last all day? I put this on and 6 hours later I needed to reapply, and I was not dancing or sweating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now avoiding it because our first date was awkward.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Rite Aid and I am just so disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really difficult to apply. I had to go over the same spot several times to get it to work. It&#x27;s almost as if the marker is dried out. When I finally got it on it wore off super fast despite having eye primer on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some money and frustration. Don&#x27;t buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good eyeliner marker check out Prestige Colossal Ink Pen. I will leave a link at the bottom of this review. I got this at Ulta and it is my favorite eyeliner. It is dramatic and precise. Everything that this Master Graphic pen is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Prestige-Cosmetics-Colossal-Ultra-Black/dp/B00S4N7O72/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1437153600&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;prestige+colossal+ink+pen</li>
            <li> This product does not go on nearly as dark as the picture.  It is a cheap version of a Benefit product with the same slanted brush, which I like.  This eyeliner stays on for such a short time, it just dissolves. One hour after you apply it, it has already almost completely faded.  This was a complete waste of money.  I got something at a beauty supply store that is way better than this for $2.00!</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try a new eyeliner as my usual pencil from Almay did not give the impact I wanted. This liner is about as close as you can get to using an actual marker for eyeliner. Which I appreciate. It worked straight out of the package and went on smooth. The chisel tip is a bit awkward at first--especially compared to using a pencil but should take minimal time to get used to. So far very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a magazine ad and as a person who is obsessed with getting the Cat Eye or Wing look done, I have failed miserably. All the tricks from YouTube or Google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with how easy it makes it and the control is exquisite!!!!! I am so loving it,</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who had the following to say about the product:&lt;br /&gt;-- The eyeliner was difficult to open and made a mess on my fingers which wasn&#x27;t a good start (not a big deal, just annoying).&lt;br /&gt;-- The eyeliner itself was NOT bold, the color did not look like a dark black. Not sure how they got the picture on the packaging to look so dark but it definitely did not go on as &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;-- The eyeliner came off easily. I rubbed my eye gently by accident and there it went.  I don&#x27;t expect that it would be long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;-- I applied some of the eyeliner on the bottom and got some into my eyes which burned.&lt;br /&gt;-- The point was good for a precision line so I got the line where I wanted on my upper lid but then when I used the thicker part of the point to fill in the rest, the line became thicker than I wanted (it went above the original line I made), so I had to re-apply and use the fine point to &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; the part I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;-- Usually Maybelline has good products but this is one I definitely would not buy.</li>
            <li> I tried out the eyeliner and I think I would give it a four rating. It&#x27;s easy to use and the color is noticeable (good for darker skinned people because you don&#x27;t have to do multiple layers). It glides well, and the triangle point/tip function is beneficial because you can get many different looks without much effort. It&#x27;s not waterproof though, and some people may find that irritating because it would smudge if it was raining. It definitely has a marker feel to it, and overall I would say that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
