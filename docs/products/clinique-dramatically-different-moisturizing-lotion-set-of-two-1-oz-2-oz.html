            <li>This is a pretty good moisturizer.</li>

            <li>The original formula moisturizer worked well for many people for many years.  </li>
            <li>What can i say this moisturizer is so good it really gives my skin a glow</li>
            <li>Huge plus for those of you who do not like any sort of noticeable scent.</li>
            <li>I think it says oil free but who knows.</li>
            <li>and I was having a fit because I couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>Clinique&#x27;s dramatically different moisturizer is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth with no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>She looks young and her skin looks good.</li>
            <li>Delivery was awesome; faster than I expected!!!!</li>
            <li>First off, I LOVE Clinique.</li>
            <li>Always like small size because perfect size for traveling!!</li>
            <li>not overly dry on the skin, great for any weather.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the dramatically different cream.</li>
            <li>love it and plan on purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a allot of moisturizer right now</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery, product as described in Amazon, delivered to boderlinx and then to Switzerland</li>
            <li>Be aware that this moisturizer is the new + formula, not the original formula as it appears to be.  </li>
            <li>This has been my go-to moisturizer for years because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive combo skin.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful moistuizer I just wish it were not so expensive.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and I have not found anything better.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a moisturizer with a gel consistency, but I like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It retains the neutral feel of the original, but is less watery, so it stays on better too.</li>
            <li>My wife far prefers this product and, buying it this way is much more economical then repeatedly buying the pump bottle which I just simply refill.</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer, no special attributes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell.</li>
            <li>I go through the tubes fast</li>
            <li>Really soaks in.</li>
            <li>Just as described, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Glad to get to try it out in the tiny size instead of making a huge commitment with the normal size due to the cost.  </li>
            <li>Because I have oily skin and live in a state where its very humid (NC), I don&#x27;t really need this during the summer months.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and break out quickly with face lotions and creams I also suggest using Philosophy&#x27;s facial cleanser &amp;#34;Purity&amp;#34; That works WONDERS!</li>
            <li>This cream is a classic for a reason.</li>
            <li>Sometimes with a cream that is more of a lotion consistency (a little thicker), I lose the moisturized feeling quickly, but this lotion is an exceptionally different one.  </li>
            <li>I Absolutely highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the little tubes .  </li>
            <li>this is the NEW version of the Clinique</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s worked pretty well, although I haven&#x27;t gotten any awards for looking younger than my age.</li>
            <li>Many people, myself included, find the + formula to be excessively oily for even (in my case)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer since I was sixteen years old.</li>
            <li>There IS an obvious smell but it isn&#x27;t really describable.</li>
            <li>For young people.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin especially in the t-zone</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin so soft, it make my skin glow .</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and there is no problem here.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I can use this without waking up to a completely greasy face in the morning.</li>
            <li>71 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>this seems to be much thicker than what comes in the bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li>One of the only lotions that works for my super dry skin.</li>
            <li>anyone knows where I can purchase the old version of their Dramatically Different, please let me know!  </li>
            <li>The original formula is getting hard to find...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly thicker than the original Dramatically Different, so it gives my dry skin a nicer feel, and I can use it on my neck as well.</li>
            <li>My face is generally very sensitive to lotions/creams, and I usually use Bare Minerals moisturizer which works really well.</li>
            <li>Quality of cream is very poor as it is very old samples that they distribute in stores free with purchase.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good, or bad - kinda indifferent, but definitely is not noticeable unless you like to smell products (like I do)! :</li>

            <li> I bought these small sizes because I wanted to try out the new version.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I misplaced it last week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than drug store brands, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, especially during the hottest and coldest months (which is practically every month) my skin is drier than usual.</li>
            <li> I have used other moisturizer from Chanel and LeMer.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely oil T-zone, so I tend not to apply this moisturizer to that area, but to all the other parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Also, one of the tubes had exploded in the bag and made a mess all over the other tube.  </li>
            <li> Beats any store hands down.</li>
            <li> but I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is too heavy for me</li>
            <li> &gt;  Johnnie Green</li>
            <li> Clinique sells a gel moisturizer that is for oilier skins, but it leaves one&#x27;s face sticky and slightly stiff.  </li>
            <li> So expensive, in fact, that one must buy it in tiny little tubes like it&#x27;s liquid gold or something.</li>
            <li> I have numerous expensive unused products already jamming my cabinet space.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Not a good deal..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this lotion made my face break out.</li>
            <li> and It works  without irritating it!</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Non oily best moisturizer ever! Been using it for years and great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this was not that dramatically different in making my skin feel/look refreshed/moist.</li>
            <li> What can i say this moisturizer is so good it really gives my skin a glow</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 45 years and my skin is great! This is just what I needed for traveling - the perfect size of my all time best skin cream.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, this lotion made my face break out. I think it says oil free but who knows. It didn&#x27;t work for me but that&#x27;s not to say it won&#x27;t work for you. My face is generally very sensitive to lotions/creams, and I usually use Bare Minerals moisturizer which works really well. A friend of mine recommended Clinique so I gave it a try. If you are like me and break out quickly with face lotions and creams I also suggest using Philosophy&#x27;s facial cleanser &amp;#34;Purity&amp;#34; That works WONDERS!</li>
            <li> I have always loved the dramatically different cream. Very good product by Clinique. My sister loved it too and has been using it for years. She looks young and her skin looks good. A great moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time, good size as a refill or to travel with, carry in purse......:)</li>
            <li> Great price on this item.  Delivery was awesome; faster than I expected!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer since I was sixteen years old. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that I&#x27;ve found that I am not allergic to and/or does not get my face all greasy. I guess it&#x27;s worked pretty well, although I haven&#x27;t gotten any awards for looking younger than my age.</li>
            <li> My girl swears by this stuff. Great price. Beats any store hands down.</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE Clinique. This moisturizer is AMAZING for my normal-to-dry skin. Sometimes, especially during the hottest and coldest months (which is practically every month) my skin is drier than usual. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried over 30 different products but THIS definitely works, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin never feels greasy or oily after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;NO SMELL! Huge plus for those of you who do not like any sort of noticeable scent. There IS an obvious smell but it isn&#x27;t really describable. It doesn&#x27;t smell good, or bad - kinda indifferent, but definitely is not noticeable unless you like to smell products (like I do)! :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is amazing. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and plan on purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> I love clinique products</li>
            <li> I am allergic to  it...</li>
            <li> This is a review for the + version. One of the only lotions that works for my super dry skin. It&#x27;s lightweight and mom-greasy. I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell. I go through the tubes fast but I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is too heavy for me and I found it sticky.  It left my skin feeling sticky and it was not the feeling I was used too.  I have used Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion for about 30 years.  I&#x27;m  now looking for a different moisturizer.  Hope others have better results.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, no special attributes. For young people.</li>
            <li> This cream is a classic for a reason. It works great, makes your skin look healthier. The original formula is getting hard to find...</li>
            <li> People say this is very oily, but I use this everyday and it isn&#x27;t oily at all. I have very oily skin especially in the t-zone but it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me.</li>
            <li> Great skin lotion for oily skin. not overly dry on the skin, great for any weather. I will come back and buy again.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to moisturizer for years because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive combo skin. It&#x27;s pricier than drug store brands, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so so good, it makes my skin so soft, it make my skin glow . It stays on my face all day. I look so much younger. I have used other moisturizer from Chanel and LeMer. And out of all of them I love this one the best. I misplaced it last week and I was having a fit because I couldn&#x27;t find it. I was looking every where for it. Boy was upset. so this morning  I found it in my car. I was so so happy that I found it. I&#x27;m sold on this product for life.  I Absolutely highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;  Johnnie Green</li>
            <li> I like it and I am using it now. It makes my skin very smooth. I should have bought a bigger one.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful moistuizer I just wish it were not so expensive.  So expensive, in fact, that one must buy it in tiny little tubes like it&#x27;s liquid gold or something.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 40 years.</li>
            <li> Always like small size because perfect size for traveling!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wife happy, that sums it up.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great service.  Will reorder.</li>
            <li> The feeling of this moisturizer each morning is something that I look forward to.  I apply it after I put on my serums and do my &amp;#34;I&#x27;m getting older&amp;#34; routine each day.  The cream sits lightly on the skin and feels great.  Sometimes with a cream that is more of a lotion consistency (a little thicker), I lose the moisturized feeling quickly, but this lotion is an exceptionally different one.  Glad to get to try it out in the tiny size instead of making a huge commitment with the normal size due to the cost.  I have numerous expensive unused products already jamming my cabinet space.</li>
            <li> good stuff for travel</li>
            <li> The cream took longer than estimated to arrive. Quality of cream is very poor as it is very old samples that they distribute in stores free with purchase. Too bad</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, product as described in Amazon, delivered to boderlinx and then to Switzerland</li>
            <li> If I could have but 1 moisturizer this is the one I&#x27;d have.  Really soaks in. Improves the total health of my skin. I have sensitive skin and there is no problem here.</li>
            <li> Clinique&#x27;s dramatically different moisturizer is a great product.  It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth with no greasy residue.  I have used this for several years and I have not found anything better.  It is also great to put on your lips before applying lipstick.  This is a very good value.</li>
            <li> Love the way it moisturizes my skin! I have sensitive skin and It works  without irritating it! Love love this stuff</li>
            <li> It´s just what you´ve asked for. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Much smaller amounts than I thought.  Not a good deal.. I&#x27;m not doing this again if you count my words.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good moisturizer. This is my first time using a moisturizer with a gel consistency, but I like it. I have the combination to oily skin formula and I can use this without waking up to a completely greasy face in the morning. I have an extremely oil T-zone, so I tend not to apply this moisturizer to that area, but to all the other parts of my face. Because I have oily skin and live in a state where its very humid (NC), I don&#x27;t really need this during the summer months. However, if I relocated to dryer area, I will definitely repurchase this product to keep my face moisterized.</li>
            <li> Very light feel but content feeling of moisture.  Good for day and night use.</li>
            <li> Just as described, fast delivery.  I don&#x27;t use a allot of moisturizer right now so this was the perfect size/price combo.</li>
            <li> Nice size tubes for travel or purse. Good price. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this moisturizer is the new + formula, not the original formula as it appears to be.  I returned it.  Many people, myself included, find the + formula to be excessively oily for even (in my case) 71 year old skin.  Clinique sells a gel moisturizer that is for oilier skins, but it leaves one&#x27;s face sticky and slightly stiff.  The original formula moisturizer worked well for many people for many years.  I hope Clinique will bring it back for &amp;#34;intermediate&amp;#34; skins.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it leaves my skin feeling so smooth and moisturized!</li>
            <li> this seems to be much thicker than what comes in the bigger bottle.  It works.</li>
            <li> These are NOT what they say on the tubes!  When I received them, the ARE the Dramatically Different +.  Also, one of the tubes had exploded in the bag and made a mess all over the other tube.  Please make sure you let customers know this is the NEW version of the Clinique product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows where I can purchase the old version of their Dramatically Different, please let me know!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love Clinique.  Great moisturizer. I have used this product for 30 years.  The best.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 20 years.  I&#x27;m pleased with the little tubes .  One for camping and one for auto or air trips.</li>
            <li> The product is good but I don&#x27;t like the smell.. Besides, some of the cream spilled out a bit when it arrived.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. Not funky or turned. Excellent condition.</li>
