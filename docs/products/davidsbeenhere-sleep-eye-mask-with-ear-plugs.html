            <li>great products by Davidsbeenhere:</li>
            <li>But the mask itself was very comfortable and fits excellently.</li>
            <li>comes in handy!</li>
            <li>Quality is good and I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Works great! :)</li>
            <li>Quality and Materials are of good quality and you cannot get a better one for the money!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>They are brightly colored which advertises to fellow travelers that you need some &#x60;alone time&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it as a good value.</li>
            <li>The earplugs are good quality, but wear out after a while.</li>
            <li>I get a good nights rest.</li>
            <li>It blocks the light perfectly, and the ears plug is a plus.</li>
            <li>and I loved that the suggested item, when I was searching for this, was fuzzy handcuffs...</li>
            <li>They are light weight and the head band on them are just perfect.</li>
            <li>It blocks out the sun or lights so that is good.</li>
            <li>Awesome material and comfortable.</li>
            <li>He loved the comfortability of the fabric and the elastic band.</li>
            <li>The quality is superior.</li>
            <li>I trust the customer reviews I find here on Amazon to select good quality products.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear and great material for the money!</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>Overall, its an excellent product at a great price!</li>
            <li>But it also does a very good job of blocking out all light.</li>
            <li>Keeps light very good away</li>
            <li>I knocked off a star because the mask has a very potent plastic smell.</li>
            <li>This Product is great for more than just travel, that&#x27;s for sure!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The eye mask is great though :-)</li>
            <li>and I also have a luggage electronic scale and this is a great adage to the line :))</li>
            <li>I can see where this item would be ideal for people who need to sleep during daylight hours and need something to keep the light out.  </li>
            <li>This is a very comfortable eye mask!</li>
            <li>The Sleep eye mask is great for getting rest during travel, it works well because it&#x27;s comfortable!</li>
            <li>Both are a good price and nice quality.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I also love that it comes with ear plugs too!</li>
            <li>As an avid traveler, I can confirm that these earplugs and this eye mask are wonderful!</li>
            <li>I was the lucky recipient of this incredible companion.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and the polyester feels good.  </li>
            <li>the mask keeps out light and works great</li>
            <li>these are great if you have nocturnal housemates, neighbors, or blinds that don&#x27;t shut out the light.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t has to use it for that purpose yet, but I tried it on and fit great.</li>
            <li>the eye mask fits comfortably and works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ear plugs that come with this also come in a nice carrying case which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact that they include ear plugs is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The included ear plugs come in a nice plastic case.</li>
            <li>They are fairly effective, but I prefer a softer material.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice mask which helps me sleep during the day since I work nights.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s incredibly handy.</li>
            <li>The plugs do have a nice case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product kindly supplied for review by &#x27;Davidsbeenhere&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It has that manufactured rubbery B.O. kind of smell.  </li>
            <li>nice product.</li>
            <li>This one is padded, well constructed, and it&#x27;s so nice that if you leave it somewhere you&#x27;ll kick yourself and go buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ear plugs are the foam kind, like  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: in exchange for an honest opinion/review the company gave me the product.</li>
            <li>I was given this product in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>Wearing these is like having your own room on the plane.</li>
            <li>blocks out all the light, is comfortable, and is good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li>; material does not conform to your face so there is a great deal of light coming in from the top and bottom of the mask.</li>
            <li>meaning that they are the best you can purchase - the kind construction workers use to protect their eardrums from loud noise.  </li>
            <li>This makes it nice to be able to slip them in your purse and have them handy</li>
            <li>worked great on my 15 hour flight to Taipei  -- very effective at blocking out all the light, and a comfortable fit</li>
            <li>it is comfortable and the ear plugs are really good.</li>
            <li>But good for it&#x27;s soul purpose of blocking out light.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised with Davidsbeenhere Travel Sleep Kit that also included a pair of ear plugs, perfect for cancelling aircraft noise.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t believe David&#x27;s Been Here had any more tricks up his sleeve, until I was introduced to this Sleep Eye Mask with bonus ear plugs.</li>
            <li>He also liked the added feature of the nose ridge; it did its job in keeping that sneaky light out!</li>
            <li>But this product will be good for me even when there is no migraine; just when I want to cut out the light and/or sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My house gets plenty of sunlight so having a good eye mask is important.</li>
            <li>While it does stay in place and block out light fairly well, I find that it cuts into my ears after awhile.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on the eyes!</li>
            <li>Great covers and a really well made and handy product.</li>
            <li>I was worried I might get a headache from wearing it, but really it fits beautifully.</li>
            <li>Mask and ear plugs are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Overrall, it was very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>This mask is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>it are very comfortable for your ears.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The product shipped quickly, arrived intact, and is of good quality.</li>
            <li>The ear plugs are easy to put in and come with their own case.</li>
            <li>I read the package that the items came in, I noticed that it said that the &amp;#34;Sleeping Kit packs away into a handy carrying case for easy storage...</li>
            <li>- you can tell that David&#x27;s products are smartly designed, coming from an experienced traveler.</li>
            <li>mask works better than many.</li>
            <li>If I wanted something more ergonomically correct for covering my eyes, I might suggest looking for *just* an eye mask and then picking up ear plugs in bulk.</li>
            <li>I am throwing the pair away that I bought, and will use something else until I can find a better product.</li>
            <li>This works much better for his daytime sleep than the hat pulled over his eyes</li>
            <li>Love that it also came with ear plugs.  </li>
            <li>This blocks the light out on the bottom for me (try it)!  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;Lewis N. Clark Comfort eye mask&amp;#34; is must better.</li>
            <li>The free ear plugs are a nice accessory.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because for one I love the satin feel of the face mask on my skin.</li>
            <li>so I can rest or sleep better.</li>
            <li>We used it and enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>For the price I couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and hopefully it&#x27;ll stretch out a bit more over time.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I discovered this trick before I wrote the review.  </li>
            <li>Comfy, fits nicely and comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask itself does effectively block out light.</li>
            <li>An adjustable band would be better.</li>
            <li>have had many eye masks of all makes, fabric and shapes.</li>
            <li>so cant wait to buy one again :)</li>
            <li>It blocks out most of the light and the earplugs are a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t help you with that kid kicking your seat or somebody eating a bologna sandwich next to you, but it&#x27;s the best out there for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for more convenience traveling.  </li>
            <li>I received this eye mask and ear plus from the seller for free in exchange for my honest review.  </li>
            <li>Would gladly recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a sleeping mask.</li>
            <li>I thought the eye mask would of been of better quality.  </li>
            <li>At night, I just hear everything in my head amplified: the blood pulsating in my ear, my hair rubbing against the pillow, the sound of my own breathing.</li>
            <li>I will save them for more deafening</li>
            <li>I used it nightly as my wife insists on watching tv most of the night.  </li>
            <li>The eye mask does a good job of blocking out light and is comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>(this has happened to me too many times).  </li>
            <li>I own two other sleep masks and this mask works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The eye mask is very comfortable and easy to slip on.  </li>
            <li>and with our television in our bedroom, it&#x27;s pretty bright and interrupts my sleep.</li>
            <li>It keeps cool and doesn&#x27;t warm my face up</li>
            <li>Works great when new.</li>
            <li>It works, but I wish the nose was more contoured so the mask would block more light.</li>
            <li>ok.... fussy to fit in and just kept surrounding noise muffled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bucks but cheap product indeed!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to buy something in the range of 10$ or more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great so far</li>
            <li>The DBH sleep mask is so much better than the cotton ones because it&#x27;s so light weight.</li>
            <li>I have bought tons of eye masks, and most don&#x27;t seem to block out all of the light.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the mask is worth the $11 -- buy it and then acquire your own earplugs for peace anywhere.</li>
            <li>The item was provided complimentary in exchange for this honest review.</li>
            <li>But for the everyday person who either at home, on a metro commute, or in an airplane or in a noisy hotel when traveling then this very comfortable mask is one of the best.</li>
            <li>And after the migraine is there, I sure don&#x27;t want anymore light and/or sound.  </li>
            <li>The mask cuts most light and fits mostly comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this mask do a great job of keeping light out of view, it also is very comfortable and light-weight.</li>
            <li>Good for occasional use, but get a better quality one if you need to use it more often than twice a month.</li>
            <li>but some light will peak through the nose part...but other than that its great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be honest - at first</li>
            <li>and i think it looks cool too :))</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say my head is of average size, and the elastic band fits perfectly around my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that the mask (for me) fits fine.  </li>
            <li>it was fine.</li>
            <li>I used it on the train and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with my purchase and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>Stretches out easily and light comes through underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try &amp; it has helped tremendously!</li>
            <li>Overall, he thought it was the most comfortable and effective sleep eye mask that he has ever used!</li>
            <li>It fit the petite GF just fine, though.</li>
            <li>It also lets in a little bit of light around my face if not adjusted perfectly so as soon as I move</li>
            <li>This eye mask is great for traveling or simply anytime you want to cancel out the light and sleep.</li>
            <li>: Free</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but just note that for $4 you aren&#x27;t getting a mask that blocks out 100% of the light.  </li>
            <li>It blocks out light while being low-profile.  </li>
            <li>And also just as important</li>
            <li>The mask itself looks and feels cheap, but does the job.</li>
            <li>90% of light is blocked out, but the nose does not conform and leaks a lot.</li>
            <li>so it allows the mask to fit closer to the cheekbones and keep the light out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap and arrive on time, does it job.</li>
            <li>It does a gret job of blocking out all of the light</li>
            <li>It was comfortable and it always stayed on.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap, looked like it did the job, and was Prime eligible.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and keeps out the light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really comfortable to use</li>
            <li>It kept the light out (when there was movement in the room)</li>
            <li>The mask doesn&#x27;t block any light around the nose, even though the product description indicates \\&quot;added nose ridge blocks out all light\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Even if the nose ridge worked the way it was intended it wouldn&#x27;t matter, because you can see light THROUGH the cheap material this mask is made of.  </li>
            <li>stars for light blocking and material comfort; three stars for the headband.</li>
            <li>The eye mask is made of a light material</li>
            <li>One, it doesn&#x27;t block the light that enters at the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li>In addition, the ear plugs are great--comfortable, work well, and fit well.  </li>
            <li>and now she wants one of her own</li>
            <li>Unless you are photophobic and can&#x27;t bear even the slightest amount of light when you wish to sleep then this mask is probably not for you.</li>
            <li>Another thoughtful idea from Davisbeenhere.  </li>
            <li>This would definitely fit the bill for that.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy it, it doesn&#x27;t conform to your face and therefore doesn&#x27;t block light...</li>
            <li>eye mask has an additional amount of material over the nose area that prevents  light from peeking in.  </li>
            <li>The Davidsbeenhere eye mask is one that doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Fortunately noise isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t mold to the face and light still gets in.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>so I am always looking for ways to keep the light out.  </li>
            <li>The material is also comfortable against my face.  </li>
            <li>really enjoy the DBH product line</li>
            <li>I found it to be cheap.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t block the light from around the nose.</li>
            <li>I do like the fit of the mask</li>
            <li>I can still see light at the bottom of the mask when i put it on.</li>
            <li>The Travel Sleep Kit provides a light cancelling eye mask, and a set of noise cancelling Ear Plugs.  </li>
            <li>Before taking David Hoffman&#x27;s Travel Sleep Kit (\\&quot;light cancelling eye mask\\&quot; and \\&quot;noise cancelling ear</li>
            <li>This is important as the nose is often a source of light intrusion.</li>
            <li>I have put them in my passport container and look forward to light free sleep whenever I need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its flush against your face to keep all of the light out....</li>
            <li>earplugs work to block out the sound of airplane engines and noisy travelers.</li>
            <li>seriously, this mask is perfect if you want to be able to sleep when it&#x27;s still light out.</li>
            <li>I very rarely will rate anything one star</li>
            <li>Perfectly fine, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>This is a cool kit that consists of a super high quality eye mask and a pair of really good ear</li>
            <li>The strap is nice and wide, it&#x27;s comfortable, it effectively blocks out light, and it doesn&#x27;t slip off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited when the eye mask and ear plugs arrived.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>The mask was a nice fit when I first for the first week.  </li>
            <li>I have a rather large head (I wear size 8-1/2 hats), and many eye masks don&#x27;t fit me well.</li>
            <li>I purchase this for air travel where sleeping conditions can be less than ideal.</li>
            <li>but i really love this one and its nice and big and lots of room for the eyes and lightweight</li>
            <li>eye pillow is super comfy and blocks at all the light...</li>
            <li>/&gt;PRO:  Good enough light coverage</li>
            <li>I cannot remember how many freebie eye covers I have had from airlines and NONE of them ever really worked, either they did not close out the light or the straps</li>
            <li>I wore it with the room lights full on and outside in bright sunshine and it blocks out the light</li>
            <li>I like this eye mask, but it&#x27;s nothing special.  </li>
            <li>The earplugs, however are nothing special.</li>
            <li>The sleep mask in this kit isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>I thought I would solve this by getting a sleep mask and of course turned right to Amazon!</li>
            <li>I bought two right away!</li>
            <li>The combo of items in this kit work fairly well, but they won&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li>The material is very &amp;#34;plastic like&amp;#34; and does not have an appealing touch on your face.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different eye masks and most of them have not done the job of keeping the light out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of trying to block out light by putting a pillow over my head in my too-bright bedroom, this investment was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I loved the eye mask, I not only used for sleep but used on the kids for pin the tail on the donkey type games.</li>
            <li>included ear plugs are a nice foam material which definitely reduce noise and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>The nose piece effectively blocked out the light better than other products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to wear with the elastic strap and fabric is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This eye mask did its job beyond expectations - it blocked out almost all of the light and the headband fit just right around my head, providing comfort and peaceful slumber.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found the old one I was replacing which was much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>My roommate in college is always coming in an hour to two hours after me and the sleep mask is super helpful.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a tiny nose flap that helps block light coming in from below which was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can find a better mask for the same price.</li>
            <li>I really like the eye mask because its not only great for traveling but also to be used at home...</li>
            <li>I am sure guys or gals with short hair might do better with this.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this eye mask is very comfortable and has served me well so far!</li>
            <li>Overall a pretty good value.  </li>
            <li>Super comfy mask, blocks out the light really well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it was light and easy for me to sleep in.</li>
            <li>I often take a good day rest in the day if I did not sleep well the previous night.... and the mask keeps out plenty of light.  </li>
            <li>The material is soft and feels very comfortable on my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is a great little gift to leave for house guests that stay over.  </li>
            <li>Great little kit when you are traveling</li>
            <li>Good elastic, not too tight and the mask itself is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This is my first sleeping mask and I was looking for something that would block light and comfortable to wear at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Works very well at keeping out the light.  </li>
            <li>The eye mask doesn&#x27;t fit very well either and slides up.</li>
            <li>It also shuts out light very</li>
            <li>This eye mask blocks out all light and works really well.</li>
            <li>The earplugs don&#x27;t fit me and doesn&#x27;t block out noise very well.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice eye mask.</li>
            <li>[It was fun reviewing this product.</li>
            <li>It fit my head okay, but I know elastic well enough</li>
            <li>You can still hear with them, so they are safe, but it helps block the majority of the loud sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>kit is worth it for the sleep mask.</li>
            <li>Buying one of these was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Unless for traveling I can&#x27;t see them being useful.</li>
            <li>The ear plugs are just the standard squishy kind.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not hot or itchy and effectively cancels light, also the elastic band is the right size so it won&#x27;t give you a headache from being too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other good point is the strap.</li>
            <li>Right in my ear.)  </li>
            <li>It keeps light out pretty darn well, but it is really floppy.  </li>
            <li>For the first time I had an eye cover that really kept out all the light.</li>
            <li>The main reason is that 1) it accomplishes its mission in that it blocks out almost all light (depending on how you adjust it), 2) it doesn&#x27;t keep you awake with the feeling that you&#x27;ve been blindfolded, and 3)</li>
            <li>Comfortable and nice and black.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frequent travelers (especially international ones) likely already have a collection of eye masks, but if you don&#x27;t, or if you don&#x27;t have a favorite mask, this kit is a nice one.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the kit does have a nice little plastic container to put the plugs into, so that should help keep them a bit cleaner for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective at keeping out all ambient light - no light leaks near the edges or at the bridge of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s comfortable, and blocks enough light for him to rest easier.  </li>
            <li>That makes it important to fit in some dream time whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>Generally the extra flap of material over the nose is effective for blocking out additional light that might sneak in, unless the mask shifts while I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li>However, the ear plugs are too soft &amp; squishy &amp; wouldn&#x27;t fit right in my ears.</li>
            <li>The mask allows total darkness and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>the product overall was very cheap</li>
            <li>The elastic strap stretches out very fast, within three weeks.</li>
            <li>This mask has an extra piece of fabric there, so it&#x27;s better than others.</li>
            <li>and they work exactly how they should.</li>
            <li>The material is so soft and comfortable and it truly blocks out the sun.</li>
            <li>Pretty much completely blocks out light.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants a sleep mask!</li>
            <li>The mask is exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to light when trying to sleep, and this sleep eye mask works well for me.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have that velcro adjustment, and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is the first face mask I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>Mask gets really hot, I wake up sweating</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;why are you still wearing that?&amp;#34; LOL!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE, does exactly what I needed...</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife to replace an old and tattered one that she had gotten free on one of our airline flights.</li>
            <li>Eye masks are a must have for me, since I need total darkness to be able to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>Even try it to nap in the office ;-)</li>
            <li>Thanks David!</li>
            <li>Now, I tend to have somewhat of a bigger head than most and for that reason alone</li>
            <li>I trust it will allow him to have many hours of deep sleep!    </li>
            <li>Much better than several others we have tried.</li>
            <li>It completely consumes your face so that not a bit of light enters.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to light when I am sleeping</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This mask will definitely make sleeping on an airplane much more</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face hot and it weighs almost nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks David!</li>
            <li>There is a well-designed nose flap that keeps direct light from sneaking in around the nose.  </li>
            <li>The eye mask fits well and is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I live with a grand mother who cannot hear so everyone has to speak loudly when they speak to her.</li>
            <li>It blocks out light more than my previous two.</li>
            <li>They were small but fit comfortably and blocked out all the light.</li>
            <li>Although a bit snug, it is comfortable enough where I was able to drift right into a deep sleep on my six hour flight to sunny San Diego.</li>
            <li>I tried to use them during my most recent air travel experience, and they did not cancel noise much at all.  </li>
            <li>my silicone plugs are far, far better.  </li>
            <li>The contoured shape of the earplugs make it easier to insert them far enough into the ear canal to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure until about the third night of it happening, and I woke up to huge purple marks on my white sheets,</li>
            <li>I do have to mention that I am a female with a medium-sized head, and I think the headband would be much more efficient if it were adjustable, to fit larger heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re trying out this combination for upcoming trips, this combo is a quick and easy way to check it out for not much</li>
            <li>sleep mask is well designed, comfortable and really cuts out all the light, which isn&#x27;t the case with other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>can easily stick the set in you jeans pocket, so it&#x27;s convenient for travel, or if you work the 3rd shift to help block out family noises during your sleep time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so great when I need it to be dark and quiet!</li>
            <li>But I give these a strong recommend to buy because they are simply the cat&#x27;s pajamas.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t open package w/ear plugs, but they are always welcome at home or when traveling to tone down sounds.  </li>
            <li>So use it at home or during the trip, so you can actually aisle yourself from bothersome noise and wake up like new to enjoy your day!  </li>
            <li>you put it on and it fits perfect, the clothe used is very soft, so you don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at any time while wearing it; also the material used</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for short-term use, such as an hour or two, but after longer use the tightness of the headband makes it</li>
            <li>Clever!</li>
            <li>The mask itself is huge, so it isn&#x27;t well suited for smaller heads.</li>
            <li>I really like the Davids been here</li>
            <li>If this is somethings that really is going to bother you then look at the $10+</li>
            <li>I just started a job where I need to do night shifts and this really helped me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a big nose and when wearing it, it let light into my eyes, seeping in from the bottom of the mask by the nostril area.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely will recommend it.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, and does the job really well.</li>
            <li>and even though the ear plugs don&#x27;t block out all sound they muffle it enough to let you sleep.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;added nose ridge\\&quot; is simply an extra piece of cheap material that adds nothing to the mask.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>They are totally silent and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price.</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast, and it came as described.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like the way it felt on my eyes after a whole nights sleep.</li>
            <li>This is the lightest eye mask I have ever put on that still solidly blocks out all light.  </li>
            <li>and I worry about the elastic wearing out too fast.  </li>
            <li>These two items now sit on the table beside my bed where they are ready to be used for my daytime nap.  </li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll and is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a very versatile product, also the ear plugs that come with</li>
            <li>and you really need to get some quality sleep.</li>
            <li>If you really want to sleep, buy yourself some silicone earplugs at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>The earplugs didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She keeps the sound low</li>
            <li>There not too much to say about this on.</li>
            <li>I put the wide elastic over the top of my ears because it rubbed otherwise, but my husband has no problem with this.  </li>
            <li>They compress the eyes and don&#x27;t block enough light.</li>
            <li>And, you don&#x27;t want to push these too much into the canal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this sleep mask for my husband, who likes absolute darkness at night.</li>
            <li>And, to be fair, I have never posted a negative review like this before.  </li>
            <li>kit is very useful as well for those people like me, for whom it&#x27;s difficult to fall asleep in bright bedrooms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summation: if you need a cheap eye mask for short term use, have a small nose and can tolerate some light and noise while you sleep, this is a fine set for the money.</li>
            <li>but it covers more of it than any other sleep mask I have ever had.</li>
            <li>and my eyes don&#x27;t rub against the fabric which I&#x27;ve read in many other reviews of these sleep masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this eye mask - I am prone to migraine headaches and when I lie down during the day, I like to block out as much light as possible.</li>
            <li>Very light and thin, easy to pack with us on our trip among many other items ...</li>
            <li>The fabric and padding are both dark enough to block out bright sunlight in an all-white room.  </li>
            <li>Elastic strap way too large for normal heads.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s cut differently than most (has a little nose ridge that helps block out all of the light).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The eye mask does indeed also \\&quot;cancel\\&quot; light but not completely.</li>
            <li>It is broad, has just the right tension and no Velcro clips to fiddle with and grab/damage the covers or anything else.</li>
            <li>After that first week the strap became loose fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Last trip, this mask and ear plugs made  a huge difference in my ability to sleep in a room directly across from the nursing station.  </li>
            <li>love it for just being at home, but i definitely plan to use them on my next vaca!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t return it since I bought it mainly for the eye mask.</li>
            <li>It is also kind of rough feeling, and the velcro in the back would stick to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Would not work for most men, probably only for smaller women.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a problem inherent to these particular earplugs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also extremely soft and has a nice wide strap so you can barely feel it when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>There is an extra, small piece of fabric that fits over the bridge of the nose, to block out even more light.</li>
            <li>The ear plugs block noise well, but became less pliable and less effective more quickly than other types.  </li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>The ear plugs are of high quality and come in a plastic storage case.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, except that it is pretty tight.  </li>
            <li>...guess the elastic was too tight, and they normally didn&#x27;t even block out all the light!  </li>
            <li>I was hoping the ear plugs would reduce the noise level a little better than they were.</li>
            <li>The earplugs are unnecessary--would rather buy a multi-pack of better quality ones somewhere else and save a little on the eye mask.</li>
            <li>Admit I was surprised at how much I really like them.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of light at the bottom of the mask slipping in regardless of</li>
            <li>will definitely get my money&#x27;s worth and some out of this Sleep Mask Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure why this has such good reviews.</li>
            <li>Another useful, solid product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost more than a few foam earplugs over the years, and there&#x27;s always a moment of \\&quot;ick\\&quot; from putting something that&#x27;s been sitting at the bottom of your travel bag into your ear, so the case is helpful.  </li>
            <li>The nose fitting can be turned up or down to fit your nose, I like it up, my wife likes it down.</li>
            <li>Most travel eye masks tend to be either too tight on my head or simply just don&#x27;t contour to my face enough to keep all of the light out.</li>
            <li>As I listed in my heading, these are definitely items I wanted to use right away and not wait for a trip to take advantage of them.  </li>
            <li>The extra padding on the mask helps me fall right to sleep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if I turn it upside down and pull it up more on my forehead, it tends not to press on my eyes, although then it lets in a little light.</li>
            <li>To much material and expense are involved in the literature and packaging, not very green when a simple paper bag would work fine, especially for a $3.00 product.</li>
            <li>I was given this item free of charge due to a contest that was being promoted on David&#x27;s Been Here travel site.</li>
            <li>The strap is thicker than other ones and keeps the mask securely on my head.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this product is well worth the money if you&#x27;re interested in getting quality sleep on your next flight.</li>
            <li>It will not protect your ears from any type of live rounds, but then again, it never claimed to.  </li>
            <li>(As opposed to a new but not serviceable Boeing 787 Dreamliner.)</li>
            <li>It looks it would do job well enough, if it would only fit</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally the mask doesn&#x27;t have any way to wrap around the nose well, so the mask would constantly slip upwards and let a lot of light bleed in to the point where the mask was essentially useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only real grip is that the strap puts a bit too much pressure on my ears.  </li>
            <li>It also tries to cut out light coming through the nose but doesn&#x27;t completely.  </li>
            <li>Enough to cover up light - not put you in entire darkness though.</li>
            <li>They come in a cute little plastic case just large enough to contain them.</li>
            <li>The bridge of the nose is always a trouble spot, as most masks let in light since the fabric won&#x27;t sit down completely on the skin and follow the curves.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra and get a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>I have several other Davidsbeenhere products (which I love).  </li>
            <li>Maybe other people who don&#x27;t need total darkness will find this product acceptable, but I needed something more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty standard.</li>
            <li>I was able to be active the next day on my client site.</li>
            <li>However, I realized, if I pull the mask down, then it blocks out the light from the bottom.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t block light coming from the nose bridge and that was a let down.</li>
            <li>The Eye Mask is thick enough that you won&#x27;t see any light, which is helped with a unique &#x60;nose ridge&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>While most people buy these for long plane rides, they can be especially helpful for hotel sleeping in rowdy towns like New Orleans, or Key West.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t usually have to use the ear plugs) and it works really well to block out the screen light for me.</li>
            <li>but they still wouldn&#x27;t fit and they&#x27;re not soft enough.</li>
            <li>ears are odd shaped and I could not get the ear plugs to fit at all.</li>
            <li>The black fabric of this mask is ultra-soft and comfortable for travel-weary</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve actually gotten better sleep even when the room is dark to begin with.</li>
            <li>The material is comfortable and its not too tight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, and they changed the strap so it&#x27;s not as tight.</li>
            <li>I consider this purchase to be a smart one as this is for an essential item</li>
            <li>Yes a little light sneaks through the bottom  </li>
            <li>Although it came a little thinner than what I had in mind, I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The soft, lightweight mask is well-designed, with the shape cupping the face and a flap to prevent light-leakage from the bottom, but I found it too small/tight for my large male noggin (XL hat size).</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be clear, my one star review has nothing at all to do with the ear plugs that are the included with the mask.  </li>
            <li>normally just where my sunglasses to cut out the light, because past sleep eye masks hurt after awhile</li>
            <li>Not to mention the mask is very hot to sleep in due to material that doesn&#x27;t breath well.</li>
            <li>Also two toddlers in the home who are constantly loud.</li>
            <li>It is not as soft as the microfiber I have for the home</li>
            <li>I think for what it offers, it should be cheaper.</li>
            <li>I work third shift and really needed to find something to help me sleep.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my Mom that has trouble sleeping when any light comes in the room.  </li>
            <li>The material is an extremely soft polyester which makes it seem like I&#x27;m not even wearing anything at all.</li>
            <li>it needs to have something that molds over your nose so it blocks it out completely.</li>
            <li>Ear Plugs are a soft spongy fabric.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen concise directions on how to correctly insert foam</li>
            <li>I was surprised at this</li>
            <li>test: on an old but serviceable Boeing 767 jetliner.</li>
            <li>The fabric is soft and it fits snug and stays where you want it.</li>
            <li>buy this if you have to use the last few holes on an adjustable baseball-cap fitting, ie, if you have a bigger-than-average head.</li>
            <li>My only complaint was the strong chemical smell when I first opened it,after it aired out for a couple days</li>
            <li>The earplugs were an added bonus, I do not typically use earplugs but on my most recent trip I remembered that I had them and popped them in on the plane when there was a crying baby over my shoulder....</li>
            <li>The nose flap allows light to come under the (very thin) eye mask and the light wakes me up.</li>
            <li>The mask is barely big enough to cover the eyes from top to bottom; you just have to pull it down a little to make it cancel out the light seeping through at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Other masks I have use elastic cording which doesn&#x27;t work very well or for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it to be super dark when I&#x27;m going to sleep</li>
            <li>plugs.\\&quot;  Traditionally noise canceling technology is some sort of active device that in some way processes and negates sound to cancel it out.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You might be able to get it to work properly with some manual alterations or if your head is rather small, but I would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The least little bit of light and/or sound can give me a migraine.  </li>
            <li>The ear plugs are uncomfortable and do not conform to my ear canal to adequately block out sound.  </li>
            <li>This doent fit its too small</li>
            <li>I could feel everything when I blinked my eyes, and there was a small spot where the light would get in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not completely dark, but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ear plugs muffle out sound a little, but does not totally cut it out.  </li>
            <li>The ear plugs are on par with other ear plugs, nothing more or less.  </li>
            <li>I just flew back from Miami to Boston with my new Davidsbeenhere Eye Mask</li>
            <li>The blindfold is thick, has a nose flap, and allows complete light blockage.</li>
            <li>I have had other eye masks in the past that weren&#x27;t really that soft or that comfortable around your head.  </li>
            <li>There is a slight gap below the nose where a minor line a light still leaks in.</li>
            <li>It does let a little light in but that&#x27;s of minor concern to me.  </li>
            <li>My head is smaller than my husband&#x27;s, so if we were to share it, he&#x27;d have that elastic stretched out too much for me to keep using it too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The earplugs are generic foam cylinders in a clear plastic case.</li>
            <li>I replaced an old worn out eye mask with this one and have mixed feelings.  </li>
            <li>and I never really thought much of them.</li>
            <li>Now that I am working midnights regularly and have been using it frequently for daytime sleeping, I have been having some problems.  </li>
            <li>elastic band is nice and thick and (mostly) keeps the mask in place without cutting off circulation.</li>
            <li>It is small to medium (I know that I&#x27;m lucky).</li>
            <li>Although this sleep mask is decent as far as quality, the non-adjustable head strap is too loose, so if you have a smaller head, it will likely move and fall off during the night.  </li>
            <li>really helped me on a recent trip to Africa when I was facing two long flights back to back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the strip that goes across the nose bridge is pretty short, making it difficult to get a snug fit across the face.  </li>
            <li>This mask is not adjustable and the elastic is too tight to not be aware of it intermittently during the night.</li>
            <li>When I put on the mask, light still crept in at the bottom (no good).  </li>
            <li>This sleep mask totally does the job and is much cheaper than other options on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It fits snug to my head which my old one never did because the elastic was horribly stretched out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used worse eye masks, but also better, though the \\&quot;better\\&quot; are also more expensive.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s comfortable - Has a very slight cushion and also a thick, not thin, band.  </li>
            <li>The strap has no adjustment and was too tight for me (although I do have a relatively large head).</li>
            <li>am not a fan of the earplugs since my ear canal is quite small and these were difficult to mold and fit in comfortably in my ear.</li>
            <li>I live in a noisy condo complex and these really help to shut out the world and let you sleep.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that the non-adjustable elastic strap may be a bit tight if one has a large head or lots of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-adjustable, and a little too tight of a fit on me.</li>

            <li> an the ear plugs are still working great.  </li>
            <li> great products by Davidsbeenhere:</li>

            <li> comes in handy!</li>

            <li> Works great! :)</li>
            <li> Quality and Materials are of good quality and you cannot get a better one for the money!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> They are brightly colored which advertises to fellow travelers that you need some &#x60;alone time&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a good value.</li>
            <li> The earplugs are good quality, but wear out after a while.</li>
            <li> I get a good nights rest.</li>
            <li> It blocks the light perfectly, and the ears plug is a plus.</li>
            <li> and I loved that the suggested item, when I was searching for this, was fuzzy handcuffs...</li>
            <li> They are light weight and the head band on them are just perfect.</li>
            <li> It blocks out the sun or lights so that is good.</li>
            <li> Awesome material and comfortable.</li>

            <li> Comfortable to wear and great material for the money!</li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> Overall, its an excellent product at a great price!</li>
            <li> But it also does a very good job of blocking out all light.</li>
            <li> Keeps light very good away</li>
            <li> I knocked off a star because the mask has a very potent plastic smell.</li>
            <li> This Product is great for more than just travel, that&#x27;s for sure!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The eye mask is great though :-)</li>
            <li> and I also have a luggage electronic scale and this is a great adage to the line :))</li>
            <li> I can see where this item would be ideal for people who need to sleep during daylight hours and need something to keep the light out.  </li>
            <li> This is a very comfortable eye mask!</li>
            <li> The Sleep eye mask is great for getting rest during travel, it works well because it&#x27;s comfortable!</li>
            <li> Both are a good price and nice quality.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I also love that it comes with ear plugs too!</li>
            <li> As an avid traveler, I can confirm that these earplugs and this eye mask are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I was the lucky recipient of this incredible companion.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable and the polyester feels good.  </li>
            <li> the mask keeps out light and works great</li>
            <li> these are great if you have nocturnal housemates, neighbors, or blinds that don&#x27;t shut out the light.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t has to use it for that purpose yet, but I tried it on and fit great.</li>
            <li> the eye mask fits comfortably and works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ear plugs that come with this also come in a nice carrying case which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that they include ear plugs is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The included ear plugs come in a nice plastic case.</li>
            <li> They are fairly effective, but I prefer a softer material.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mask which helps me sleep during the day since I work nights.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s incredibly handy.</li>
            <li> The plugs do have a nice case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product kindly supplied for review by &#x27;Davidsbeenhere&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It has that manufactured rubbery B.O. kind of smell.  </li>
            <li> nice product.</li>
            <li> This one is padded, well constructed, and it&#x27;s so nice that if you leave it somewhere you&#x27;ll kick yourself and go buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ear plugs are the foam kind, like  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: in exchange for an honest opinion/review the company gave me the product.</li>
            <li> I was given this product in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> Wearing these is like having your own room on the plane.</li>
            <li> blocks out all the light, is comfortable, and is good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> ; material does not conform to your face so there is a great deal of light coming in from the top and bottom of the mask.</li>
            <li> meaning that they are the best you can purchase - the kind construction workers use to protect their eardrums from loud noise.  </li>
            <li> This makes it nice to be able to slip them in your purse and have them handy</li>
            <li> worked great on my 15 hour flight to Taipei  -- very effective at blocking out all the light, and a comfortable fit</li>
            <li> it is comfortable and the ear plugs are really good.</li>
            <li> But good for it&#x27;s soul purpose of blocking out light.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised with Davidsbeenhere Travel Sleep Kit that also included a pair of ear plugs, perfect for cancelling aircraft noise.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t believe David&#x27;s Been Here had any more tricks up his sleeve, until I was introduced to this Sleep Eye Mask with bonus ear plugs.</li>
            <li> He also liked the added feature of the nose ridge; it did its job in keeping that sneaky light out!</li>
            <li> But this product will be good for me even when there is no migraine; just when I want to cut out the light and/or sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My house gets plenty of sunlight so having a good eye mask is important.</li>
            <li> While it does stay in place and block out light fairly well, I find that it cuts into my ears after awhile.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on the eyes!</li>
            <li> Great covers and a really well made and handy product.</li>
            <li> I was worried I might get a headache from wearing it, but really it fits beautifully.</li>
            <li> Mask and ear plugs are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Overrall, it was very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> it are very comfortable for your ears.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly, arrived intact, and is of good quality.</li>
            <li> The ear plugs are easy to put in and come with their own case.</li>
            <li> I read the package that the items came in, I noticed that it said that the &amp;#34;Sleeping Kit packs away into a handy carrying case for easy storage...</li>
            <li> - you can tell that David&#x27;s products are smartly designed, coming from an experienced traveler.</li>
            <li> mask works better than many.</li>
            <li> If I wanted something more ergonomically correct for covering my eyes, I might suggest looking for *just* an eye mask and then picking up ear plugs in bulk.</li>
            <li> I am throwing the pair away that I bought, and will use something else until I can find a better product.</li>
            <li> This works much better for his daytime sleep than the hat pulled over his eyes</li>
            <li> Love that it also came with ear plugs.  </li>
            <li> This blocks the light out on the bottom for me (try it)!  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;Lewis N. Clark Comfort eye mask&amp;#34; is must better.</li>
            <li> The free ear plugs are a nice accessory.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because for one I love the satin feel of the face mask on my skin.</li>
            <li> so I can rest or sleep better.</li>
            <li> We used it and enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> For the price I couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it&#x27;ll stretch out a bit more over time.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad I discovered this trick before I wrote the review.  </li>
            <li> Comfy, fits nicely and comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask itself does effectively block out light.</li>
            <li> An adjustable band would be better.</li>
            <li> have had many eye masks of all makes, fabric and shapes.</li>
            <li> so cant wait to buy one again :)</li>
            <li> It blocks out most of the light and the earplugs are a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t help you with that kid kicking your seat or somebody eating a bologna sandwich next to you, but it&#x27;s the best out there for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for more convenience traveling.  </li>
            <li> I received this eye mask and ear plus from the seller for free in exchange for my honest review.  </li>
            <li> Would gladly recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a sleeping mask.</li>
            <li> I thought the eye mask would of been of better quality.  </li>
            <li> At night, I just hear everything in my head amplified: the blood pulsating in my ear, my hair rubbing against the pillow, the sound of my own breathing.</li>
            <li> I will save them for more deafening</li>
            <li> I used it nightly as my wife insists on watching tv most of the night.  </li>
            <li> The eye mask does a good job of blocking out light and is comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> (this has happened to me too many times).  </li>
            <li> I own two other sleep masks and this mask works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The eye mask is very comfortable and easy to slip on.  </li>
            <li> and with our television in our bedroom, it&#x27;s pretty bright and interrupts my sleep.</li>
            <li> It keeps cool and doesn&#x27;t warm my face up</li>
            <li> Works great when new.</li>
            <li> It works, but I wish the nose was more contoured so the mask would block more light.</li>
            <li> ok.... fussy to fit in and just kept surrounding noise muffled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bucks but cheap product indeed!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to buy something in the range of 10$ or more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great so far</li>
            <li> The DBH sleep mask is so much better than the cotton ones because it&#x27;s so light weight.</li>
            <li> I have bought tons of eye masks, and most don&#x27;t seem to block out all of the light.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the mask is worth the $11 -- buy it and then acquire your own earplugs for peace anywhere.</li>
            <li> The item was provided complimentary in exchange for this honest review.</li>
            <li> But for the everyday person who either at home, on a metro commute, or in an airplane or in a noisy hotel when traveling then this very comfortable mask is one of the best.</li>
            <li> And after the migraine is there, I sure don&#x27;t want anymore light and/or sound.  </li>
            <li> The mask cuts most light and fits mostly comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this mask do a great job of keeping light out of view, it also is very comfortable and light-weight.</li>
            <li> Good for occasional use, but get a better quality one if you need to use it more often than twice a month.</li>
            <li> but some light will peak through the nose part...but other than that its great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be honest - at first</li>
            <li> and i think it looks cool too :))</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say my head is of average size, and the elastic band fits perfectly around my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that the mask (for me) fits fine.  </li>
            <li> it was fine.</li>
            <li> I used it on the train and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with my purchase and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Stretches out easily and light comes through underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try &amp; it has helped tremendously!</li>
            <li> Overall, he thought it was the most comfortable and effective sleep eye mask that he has ever used!</li>
            <li> It fit the petite GF just fine, though.</li>
            <li> It also lets in a little bit of light around my face if not adjusted perfectly so as soon as I move</li>
            <li> This eye mask is great for traveling or simply anytime you want to cancel out the light and sleep.</li>
            <li> : Free</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but just note that for $4 you aren&#x27;t getting a mask that blocks out 100% of the light.  </li>
            <li> It blocks out light while being low-profile.  </li>
            <li> And also just as important</li>
            <li> The mask itself looks and feels cheap, but does the job.</li>
            <li> 90% of light is blocked out, but the nose does not conform and leaks a lot.</li>
            <li> so it allows the mask to fit closer to the cheekbones and keep the light out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap and arrive on time, does it job.</li>
            <li> It does a gret job of blocking out all of the light</li>
            <li> It was comfortable and it always stayed on.  </li>
            <li> It was cheap, looked like it did the job, and was Prime eligible.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and keeps out the light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really comfortable to use</li>
            <li> It kept the light out (when there was movement in the room)</li>
            <li> The mask doesn&#x27;t block any light around the nose, even though the product description indicates \\&quot;added nose ridge blocks out all light\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Even if the nose ridge worked the way it was intended it wouldn&#x27;t matter, because you can see light THROUGH the cheap material this mask is made of.  </li>
            <li> stars for light blocking and material comfort; three stars for the headband.</li>
            <li> The eye mask is made of a light material</li>
            <li> One, it doesn&#x27;t block the light that enters at the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li> In addition, the ear plugs are great--comfortable, work well, and fit well.  </li>
            <li> and now she wants one of her own</li>
            <li> Unless you are photophobic and can&#x27;t bear even the slightest amount of light when you wish to sleep then this mask is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> Another thoughtful idea from Davisbeenhere.  </li>
            <li> This would definitely fit the bill for that.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it, it doesn&#x27;t conform to your face and therefore doesn&#x27;t block light...</li>
            <li> eye mask has an additional amount of material over the nose area that prevents  light from peeking in.  </li>
            <li> The Davidsbeenhere eye mask is one that doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Fortunately noise isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mold to the face and light still gets in.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> so I am always looking for ways to keep the light out.  </li>
            <li> The material is also comfortable against my face.  </li>
            <li> really enjoy the DBH product line</li>
            <li> I found it to be cheap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t block the light from around the nose.</li>
            <li> I do like the fit of the mask</li>
            <li> I can still see light at the bottom of the mask when i put it on.</li>
            <li> The Travel Sleep Kit provides a light cancelling eye mask, and a set of noise cancelling Ear Plugs.  </li>
            <li> Before taking David Hoffman&#x27;s Travel Sleep Kit (\\&quot;light cancelling eye mask\\&quot; and \\&quot;noise cancelling ear</li>
            <li> This is important as the nose is often a source of light intrusion.</li>
            <li> I have put them in my passport container and look forward to light free sleep whenever I need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its flush against your face to keep all of the light out....</li>
            <li> earplugs work to block out the sound of airplane engines and noisy travelers.</li>
            <li> seriously, this mask is perfect if you want to be able to sleep when it&#x27;s still light out.</li>
            <li> I very rarely will rate anything one star</li>
            <li> Perfectly fine, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> This is a cool kit that consists of a super high quality eye mask and a pair of really good ear</li>
            <li> The strap is nice and wide, it&#x27;s comfortable, it effectively blocks out light, and it doesn&#x27;t slip off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited when the eye mask and ear plugs arrived.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> The mask was a nice fit when I first for the first week.  </li>
            <li> I have a rather large head (I wear size 8-1/2 hats), and many eye masks don&#x27;t fit me well.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for air travel where sleeping conditions can be less than ideal.</li>
            <li> but i really love this one and its nice and big and lots of room for the eyes and lightweight</li>
            <li> eye pillow is super comfy and blocks at all the light...</li>
            <li> /&gt;PRO:  Good enough light coverage</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how many freebie eye covers I have had from airlines and NONE of them ever really worked, either they did not close out the light or the straps</li>
            <li> I wore it with the room lights full on and outside in bright sunshine and it blocks out the light</li>
            <li> I like this eye mask, but it&#x27;s nothing special.  </li>
            <li> The earplugs, however are nothing special.</li>
            <li> The sleep mask in this kit isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> I thought I would solve this by getting a sleep mask and of course turned right to Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought two right away!</li>
            <li> The combo of items in this kit work fairly well, but they won&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> The material is very &amp;#34;plastic like&amp;#34; and does not have an appealing touch on your face.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different eye masks and most of them have not done the job of keeping the light out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of trying to block out light by putting a pillow over my head in my too-bright bedroom, this investment was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I loved the eye mask, I not only used for sleep but used on the kids for pin the tail on the donkey type games.</li>
            <li> included ear plugs are a nice foam material which definitely reduce noise and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> The nose piece effectively blocked out the light better than other products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to wear with the elastic strap and fabric is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This eye mask did its job beyond expectations - it blocked out almost all of the light and the headband fit just right around my head, providing comfort and peaceful slumber.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found the old one I was replacing which was much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> My roommate in college is always coming in an hour to two hours after me and the sleep mask is super helpful.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a tiny nose flap that helps block light coming in from below which was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can find a better mask for the same price.</li>
            <li> I really like the eye mask because its not only great for traveling but also to be used at home...</li>
            <li> I am sure guys or gals with short hair might do better with this.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this eye mask is very comfortable and has served me well so far!</li>
            <li> Overall a pretty good value.  </li>
            <li> Super comfy mask, blocks out the light really well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it was light and easy for me to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I often take a good day rest in the day if I did not sleep well the previous night.... and the mask keeps out plenty of light.  </li>
            <li> The material is soft and feels very comfortable on my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great little gift to leave for house guests that stay over.  </li>
            <li> Great little kit when you are traveling</li>
            <li> Good elastic, not too tight and the mask itself is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is my first sleeping mask and I was looking for something that would block light and comfortable to wear at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Works very well at keeping out the light.  </li>
            <li> The eye mask doesn&#x27;t fit very well either and slides up.</li>
            <li> It also shuts out light very</li>
            <li> This eye mask blocks out all light and works really well.</li>
            <li> The earplugs don&#x27;t fit me and doesn&#x27;t block out noise very well.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice eye mask.</li>
            <li> [It was fun reviewing this product.</li>
            <li> It fit my head okay, but I know elastic well enough</li>
            <li> You can still hear with them, so they are safe, but it helps block the majority of the loud sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kit is worth it for the sleep mask.</li>
            <li> Buying one of these was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Unless for traveling I can&#x27;t see them being useful.</li>
            <li> The ear plugs are just the standard squishy kind.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not hot or itchy and effectively cancels light, also the elastic band is the right size so it won&#x27;t give you a headache from being too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other good point is the strap.</li>
            <li> Right in my ear.)  </li>
            <li> It keeps light out pretty darn well, but it is really floppy.  </li>
            <li> For the first time I had an eye cover that really kept out all the light.</li>
            <li> The main reason is that 1) it accomplishes its mission in that it blocks out almost all light (depending on how you adjust it), 2) it doesn&#x27;t keep you awake with the feeling that you&#x27;ve been blindfolded, and 3)</li>
            <li> Comfortable and nice and black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frequent travelers (especially international ones) likely already have a collection of eye masks, but if you don&#x27;t, or if you don&#x27;t have a favorite mask, this kit is a nice one.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the kit does have a nice little plastic container to put the plugs into, so that should help keep them a bit cleaner for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective at keeping out all ambient light - no light leaks near the edges or at the bridge of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s comfortable, and blocks enough light for him to rest easier.  </li>
            <li> That makes it important to fit in some dream time whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> Generally the extra flap of material over the nose is effective for blocking out additional light that might sneak in, unless the mask shifts while I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li> However, the ear plugs are too soft &amp; squishy &amp; wouldn&#x27;t fit right in my ears.</li>
            <li> The mask allows total darkness and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> the product overall was very cheap</li>
            <li> The elastic strap stretches out very fast, within three weeks.</li>
            <li> This mask has an extra piece of fabric there, so it&#x27;s better than others.</li>
            <li> and they work exactly how they should.</li>
            <li> The material is so soft and comfortable and it truly blocks out the sun.</li>
            <li> Pretty much completely blocks out light.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants a sleep mask!</li>
            <li> The mask is exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to light when trying to sleep, and this sleep eye mask works well for me.  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have that velcro adjustment, and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the first face mask I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> Mask gets really hot, I wake up sweating</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;why are you still wearing that?&amp;#34; LOL!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE, does exactly what I needed...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife to replace an old and tattered one that she had gotten free on one of our airline flights.</li>
            <li> Eye masks are a must have for me, since I need total darkness to be able to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Even try it to nap in the office ;-)</li>
            <li> Thanks David!</li>
            <li> Now, I tend to have somewhat of a bigger head than most and for that reason alone</li>
            <li> I trust it will allow him to have many hours of deep sleep!    </li>
            <li> Much better than several others we have tried.</li>
            <li> It completely consumes your face so that not a bit of light enters.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to light when I am sleeping</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This mask will definitely make sleeping on an airplane much more</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face hot and it weighs almost nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks David!</li>
            <li> There is a well-designed nose flap that keeps direct light from sneaking in around the nose.  </li>
            <li> The eye mask fits well and is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I live with a grand mother who cannot hear so everyone has to speak loudly when they speak to her.</li>
            <li> It blocks out light more than my previous two.</li>
            <li> They were small but fit comfortably and blocked out all the light.</li>
            <li> Although a bit snug, it is comfortable enough where I was able to drift right into a deep sleep on my six hour flight to sunny San Diego.</li>
            <li> I tried to use them during my most recent air travel experience, and they did not cancel noise much at all.  </li>
            <li> my silicone plugs are far, far better.  </li>
            <li> The contoured shape of the earplugs make it easier to insert them far enough into the ear canal to be effective.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure until about the third night of it happening, and I woke up to huge purple marks on my white sheets,</li>
            <li> I do have to mention that I am a female with a medium-sized head, and I think the headband would be much more efficient if it were adjustable, to fit larger heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re trying out this combination for upcoming trips, this combo is a quick and easy way to check it out for not much</li>
            <li> sleep mask is well designed, comfortable and really cuts out all the light, which isn&#x27;t the case with other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> can easily stick the set in you jeans pocket, so it&#x27;s convenient for travel, or if you work the 3rd shift to help block out family noises during your sleep time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so great when I need it to be dark and quiet!</li>
            <li> But I give these a strong recommend to buy because they are simply the cat&#x27;s pajamas.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t open package w/ear plugs, but they are always welcome at home or when traveling to tone down sounds.  </li>
            <li> So use it at home or during the trip, so you can actually aisle yourself from bothersome noise and wake up like new to enjoy your day!  </li>
            <li> you put it on and it fits perfect, the clothe used is very soft, so you don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at any time while wearing it; also the material used</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for short-term use, such as an hour or two, but after longer use the tightness of the headband makes it</li>
            <li> Clever!</li>
            <li> The mask itself is huge, so it isn&#x27;t well suited for smaller heads.</li>
            <li> I really like the Davids been here</li>
            <li> If this is somethings that really is going to bother you then look at the $10+</li>
            <li> I just started a job where I need to do night shifts and this really helped me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a big nose and when wearing it, it let light into my eyes, seeping in from the bottom of the mask by the nostril area.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely will recommend it.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and does the job really well.</li>
            <li> and even though the ear plugs don&#x27;t block out all sound they muffle it enough to let you sleep.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;added nose ridge\\&quot; is simply an extra piece of cheap material that adds nothing to the mask.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> They are totally silent and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price.</li>
            <li> It was shipped fast, and it came as described.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the way it felt on my eyes after a whole nights sleep.</li>
            <li> This is the lightest eye mask I have ever put on that still solidly blocks out all light.  </li>
            <li> and I worry about the elastic wearing out too fast.  </li>
            <li> These two items now sit on the table beside my bed where they are ready to be used for my daytime nap.  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll and is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a very versatile product, also the ear plugs that come with</li>
            <li> and you really need to get some quality sleep.</li>
            <li> If you really want to sleep, buy yourself some silicone earplugs at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> The earplugs didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She keeps the sound low</li>
            <li> There not too much to say about this on.</li>
            <li> I put the wide elastic over the top of my ears because it rubbed otherwise, but my husband has no problem with this.  </li>
            <li> They compress the eyes and don&#x27;t block enough light.</li>
            <li> And, you don&#x27;t want to push these too much into the canal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this sleep mask for my husband, who likes absolute darkness at night.</li>
            <li> And, to be fair, I have never posted a negative review like this before.  </li>
            <li> kit is very useful as well for those people like me, for whom it&#x27;s difficult to fall asleep in bright bedrooms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summation: if you need a cheap eye mask for short term use, have a small nose and can tolerate some light and noise while you sleep, this is a fine set for the money.</li>
            <li> but it covers more of it than any other sleep mask I have ever had.</li>
            <li> and my eyes don&#x27;t rub against the fabric which I&#x27;ve read in many other reviews of these sleep masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this eye mask - I am prone to migraine headaches and when I lie down during the day, I like to block out as much light as possible.</li>
            <li> Very light and thin, easy to pack with us on our trip among many other items ...</li>
            <li> The fabric and padding are both dark enough to block out bright sunlight in an all-white room.  </li>
            <li> Elastic strap way too large for normal heads.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s cut differently than most (has a little nose ridge that helps block out all of the light).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eye mask does indeed also \\&quot;cancel\\&quot; light but not completely.</li>
            <li> It is broad, has just the right tension and no Velcro clips to fiddle with and grab/damage the covers or anything else.</li>
            <li> After that first week the strap became loose fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Last trip, this mask and ear plugs made  a huge difference in my ability to sleep in a room directly across from the nursing station.  </li>
            <li> love it for just being at home, but i definitely plan to use them on my next vaca!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t return it since I bought it mainly for the eye mask.</li>
            <li> It is also kind of rough feeling, and the velcro in the back would stick to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Would not work for most men, probably only for smaller women.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a problem inherent to these particular earplugs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely soft and has a nice wide strap so you can barely feel it when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> There is an extra, small piece of fabric that fits over the bridge of the nose, to block out even more light.</li>
            <li> The ear plugs block noise well, but became less pliable and less effective more quickly than other types.  </li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> The ear plugs are of high quality and come in a plastic storage case.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable, except that it is pretty tight.  </li>
            <li> ...guess the elastic was too tight, and they normally didn&#x27;t even block out all the light!  </li>
            <li> I was hoping the ear plugs would reduce the noise level a little better than they were.</li>
            <li> The earplugs are unnecessary--would rather buy a multi-pack of better quality ones somewhere else and save a little on the eye mask.</li>
            <li> Admit I was surprised at how much I really like them.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of light at the bottom of the mask slipping in regardless of</li>
            <li> will definitely get my money&#x27;s worth and some out of this Sleep Mask Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why this has such good reviews.</li>
            <li> Another useful, solid product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost more than a few foam earplugs over the years, and there&#x27;s always a moment of \\&quot;ick\\&quot; from putting something that&#x27;s been sitting at the bottom of your travel bag into your ear, so the case is helpful.  </li>
            <li> The nose fitting can be turned up or down to fit your nose, I like it up, my wife likes it down.</li>
            <li> Most travel eye masks tend to be either too tight on my head or simply just don&#x27;t contour to my face enough to keep all of the light out.</li>
            <li> As I listed in my heading, these are definitely items I wanted to use right away and not wait for a trip to take advantage of them.  </li>
            <li> The extra padding on the mask helps me fall right to sleep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if I turn it upside down and pull it up more on my forehead, it tends not to press on my eyes, although then it lets in a little light.</li>
            <li> To much material and expense are involved in the literature and packaging, not very green when a simple paper bag would work fine, especially for a $3.00 product.</li>
            <li> I was given this item free of charge due to a contest that was being promoted on David&#x27;s Been Here travel site.</li>
            <li> The strap is thicker than other ones and keeps the mask securely on my head.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this product is well worth the money if you&#x27;re interested in getting quality sleep on your next flight.</li>
            <li> It will not protect your ears from any type of live rounds, but then again, it never claimed to.  </li>
            <li> (As opposed to a new but not serviceable Boeing 787 Dreamliner.)</li>
            <li> It looks it would do job well enough, if it would only fit</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally the mask doesn&#x27;t have any way to wrap around the nose well, so the mask would constantly slip upwards and let a lot of light bleed in to the point where the mask was essentially useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only real grip is that the strap puts a bit too much pressure on my ears.  </li>
            <li> It also tries to cut out light coming through the nose but doesn&#x27;t completely.  </li>
            <li> Enough to cover up light - not put you in entire darkness though.</li>
            <li> They come in a cute little plastic case just large enough to contain them.</li>
            <li> The bridge of the nose is always a trouble spot, as most masks let in light since the fabric won&#x27;t sit down completely on the skin and follow the curves.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra and get a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I have several other Davidsbeenhere products (which I love).  </li>
            <li> Maybe other people who don&#x27;t need total darkness will find this product acceptable, but I needed something more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty standard.</li>
            <li> I was able to be active the next day on my client site.</li>
            <li> However, I realized, if I pull the mask down, then it blocks out the light from the bottom.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t block light coming from the nose bridge and that was a let down.</li>
            <li> The Eye Mask is thick enough that you won&#x27;t see any light, which is helped with a unique &#x60;nose ridge&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> While most people buy these for long plane rides, they can be especially helpful for hotel sleeping in rowdy towns like New Orleans, or Key West.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t usually have to use the ear plugs) and it works really well to block out the screen light for me.</li>
            <li> but they still wouldn&#x27;t fit and they&#x27;re not soft enough.</li>
            <li> ears are odd shaped and I could not get the ear plugs to fit at all.</li>
            <li> The black fabric of this mask is ultra-soft and comfortable for travel-weary</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve actually gotten better sleep even when the room is dark to begin with.</li>
            <li> The material is comfortable and its not too tight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, and they changed the strap so it&#x27;s not as tight.</li>
            <li> I consider this purchase to be a smart one as this is for an essential item</li>
            <li> Yes a little light sneaks through the bottom  </li>
            <li> Although it came a little thinner than what I had in mind, I still enjoy it.</li>
            <li> The soft, lightweight mask is well-designed, with the shape cupping the face and a flap to prevent light-leakage from the bottom, but I found it too small/tight for my large male noggin (XL hat size).</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be clear, my one star review has nothing at all to do with the ear plugs that are the included with the mask.  </li>
            <li> normally just where my sunglasses to cut out the light, because past sleep eye masks hurt after awhile</li>
            <li> Not to mention the mask is very hot to sleep in due to material that doesn&#x27;t breath well.</li>
            <li> Also two toddlers in the home who are constantly loud.</li>
            <li> It is not as soft as the microfiber I have for the home</li>
            <li> I think for what it offers, it should be cheaper.</li>
            <li> I work third shift and really needed to find something to help me sleep.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my Mom that has trouble sleeping when any light comes in the room.  </li>
            <li> The material is an extremely soft polyester which makes it seem like I&#x27;m not even wearing anything at all.</li>
            <li> it needs to have something that molds over your nose so it blocks it out completely.</li>
            <li> Ear Plugs are a soft spongy fabric.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen concise directions on how to correctly insert foam</li>
            <li> I was surprised at this</li>
            <li> test: on an old but serviceable Boeing 767 jetliner.</li>
            <li> The fabric is soft and it fits snug and stays where you want it.</li>
            <li> buy this if you have to use the last few holes on an adjustable baseball-cap fitting, ie, if you have a bigger-than-average head.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the strong chemical smell when I first opened it,after it aired out for a couple days</li>
            <li> The earplugs were an added bonus, I do not typically use earplugs but on my most recent trip I remembered that I had them and popped them in on the plane when there was a crying baby over my shoulder....</li>
            <li> The nose flap allows light to come under the (very thin) eye mask and the light wakes me up.</li>
            <li> The mask is barely big enough to cover the eyes from top to bottom; you just have to pull it down a little to make it cancel out the light seeping through at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Other masks I have use elastic cording which doesn&#x27;t work very well or for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it to be super dark when I&#x27;m going to sleep</li>
            <li> plugs.\\&quot;  Traditionally noise canceling technology is some sort of active device that in some way processes and negates sound to cancel it out.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You might be able to get it to work properly with some manual alterations or if your head is rather small, but I would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The least little bit of light and/or sound can give me a migraine.  </li>
            <li> The ear plugs are uncomfortable and do not conform to my ear canal to adequately block out sound.  </li>
            <li> This doent fit its too small</li>
            <li> I could feel everything when I blinked my eyes, and there was a small spot where the light would get in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not completely dark, but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ear plugs muffle out sound a little, but does not totally cut it out.  </li>
            <li> The ear plugs are on par with other ear plugs, nothing more or less.  </li>
            <li> I just flew back from Miami to Boston with my new Davidsbeenhere Eye Mask</li>
            <li> The blindfold is thick, has a nose flap, and allows complete light blockage.</li>
            <li> I have had other eye masks in the past that weren&#x27;t really that soft or that comfortable around your head.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight gap below the nose where a minor line a light still leaks in.</li>
            <li> It does let a little light in but that&#x27;s of minor concern to me.  </li>
            <li> My head is smaller than my husband&#x27;s, so if we were to share it, he&#x27;d have that elastic stretched out too much for me to keep using it too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The earplugs are generic foam cylinders in a clear plastic case.</li>
            <li> I replaced an old worn out eye mask with this one and have mixed feelings.  </li>
            <li> and I never really thought much of them.</li>
            <li> Now that I am working midnights regularly and have been using it frequently for daytime sleeping, I have been having some problems.  </li>
            <li> elastic band is nice and thick and (mostly) keeps the mask in place without cutting off circulation.</li>
            <li> It is small to medium (I know that I&#x27;m lucky).</li>
            <li> Although this sleep mask is decent as far as quality, the non-adjustable head strap is too loose, so if you have a smaller head, it will likely move and fall off during the night.  </li>
            <li> really helped me on a recent trip to Africa when I was facing two long flights back to back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the strip that goes across the nose bridge is pretty short, making it difficult to get a snug fit across the face.  </li>
            <li> This mask is not adjustable and the elastic is too tight to not be aware of it intermittently during the night.</li>
            <li> When I put on the mask, light still crept in at the bottom (no good).  </li>
            <li> This sleep mask totally does the job and is much cheaper than other options on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It fits snug to my head which my old one never did because the elastic was horribly stretched out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used worse eye masks, but also better, though the \\&quot;better\\&quot; are also more expensive.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s comfortable - Has a very slight cushion and also a thick, not thin, band.  </li>
            <li> The strap has no adjustment and was too tight for me (although I do have a relatively large head).</li>
            <li> am not a fan of the earplugs since my ear canal is quite small and these were difficult to mold and fit in comfortably in my ear.</li>
            <li> I live in a noisy condo complex and these really help to shut out the world and let you sleep.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that the non-adjustable elastic strap may be a bit tight if one has a large head or lots of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-adjustable, and a little too tight of a fit on me.</li>
            <li> I always have sleepless nights due to the loud next door neighbors, and with this and the included ear plugs, I can finally get some sleep.</li>
            <li> I looked around a little bit, reading reviews here and there and finally came upon this particular mask.</li>
            <li> little light sneaks through the front of the mask, but very little.  </li>
            <li> The elastic is too tight for my normal size head.</li>
            <li> whether you need a mask to assure you are getting rest before a trip, or for use in the journey to your destination, or for use in those hotels that may be very near the action part of your destination city and therefore a bit on the late night noise side, then this combo eye mask and earplug set is a nifty addendum to your travel preparation and enjoyment.  </li>
            <li> So just to start off, I go to bed pretty late</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how it withstands wear, since some reviews have said it doesn&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
            <li> Minor problem: it can stretch out after a year or so of constant use.</li>
            <li> The mask is soft and the elastic is just tight enough around my head.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect them to last very long.</li>
            <li> For $4.00 you can&#x27;t really go wrong if you want a simple product that will help you block out 99% of the light</li>
            <li> I can report that I couldn&#x27;t see anything and could only hear the distant hum of approaching Armageddon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other brands with a thick band often have velcro that helps fasten it in the back, and although that is helpful to adjust, that large velcro bump can poke into the back of your head.  </li>
            <li> with these small downfalls, I do recommend this product highly.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the most disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for a long airplane trip.  </li>
            <li> The elastic in this eye mask stretched out to the point where it falls off my face after just a handful of uses.  </li>
            <li> After a couple months of use, the elastic is stretched out.</li>
            <li> so I can sleep on long drives, and put one away in my DBH travel bag.</li>
            <li> Davidsbeenhere Hanging Travel Toiletry Cosmetics Bag Kit, Grey]]  ....</li>
            <li> Must have for any long trip.</li>
            <li> One is that they come in a small hard case to keep them clean and easy-to-find--</li>
            <li> (I regularly sleep with an eye mask and ear plugs due to babies).</li>
            <li> The only other thing I would add is why not include cleaning instructions with the item or the packaging?  </li>
            <li> I sleep next to a wall that has a heat pump on the other side.  </li>
            <li> The other is the directions on the outside packaging.  </li>
            <li> My husband gets dry eye overnight.</li>
            <li> It has everything from a toothbrush, lotion, dry soap, eye masks and ear plugs.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the fabric isn&#x27;t as soft as I would like</li>
            <li> How can you beat this: dark and quiet all at once!</li>
            <li> My blackout curtains just didn&#x27;t get my room dark enough.</li>
            <li> Synthetic fabric, mask shape loosely fits, no adjustable strap...</li>
            <li> I am constantly waking throughout the night with this half way up my eyes and it just does not want to stay in place.  </li>
            <li> But in any case, there is no sturdy material in the middle of the eye part to keep the elastic from bending it in half.</li>
            <li> She really finds them comfortable but was disappointed that the earplugs were missing from the packaging.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend these except for perhaps a single use on an airplane or perhaps a round-trip on an airplane, then throw them away!</li>
            <li> Not only did it feel a bit too tight but there wasn&#x27;t anything preventing it from putting pressure on the eyes themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The band is elastic and so tight than anyone with a head larger than a child will get a headache from wearing the mask.  </li>
            <li> There is no sort of cup or detent to keep the mast away from your eyes when you have the mask on and the mask pulls so tight on your face that your eyes will physically hurt within seconds of putting the mask on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tight enough so that</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and this is a lot less expensive than other similar products.  </li>
            <li> Wish the portion that blocked light from around the nose wasn&#x27;t so awkward, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> It is an awkward fit.  </li>
            <li> The ear plugs work as wellas can be expected to so over all I give this item four stars</li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars instead of lower because at this price it is probably what I should have expected</li>
            <li> At $10 I probably should have expected this.  </li>
            <li> These ear plugs are not a replacement for any type of military ear</li>
            <li> They are not really noise canceling.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that my husband tells me it&#x27;s very tight and puts pressure on his head and eyes which will hurt if he has a headache.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin, light-weight sleep mask with decent materials.</li>
            <li> This little \\&quot;triick\\&quot; of pulling down the mask seems so small and simple, but it is a big deal indeed, because I almost deducted a star because of it.  </li>
            <li> plugs\\&quot;) into real combat behind the thin walls and misshapen draperies in on-the-road Motel 6&#x27;s, I tried them out in my not entirely quiet condo last night.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to other migraine sufferers (as well as all other people).  </li>
            <li> ear plugs are just like any other plugs.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit difficult to breath ;)</li>
            <li> Not too tight or loose.</li>
            <li> It is not too tight and not too loose.  </li>
            <li> The eye mask is just very small and as someone who actually needs a mask to block light so that I can sleep, I found it disappointing.</li>
            <li> The strap has a wide elastic band that will stretch but not feel tight when used.  </li>
            <li> previous sleep mask was a cottony material and it trapped so much heat and weight which made it uncomfortable to use for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> The mask is dark and fits well.</li>
            <li> I need my room dark.</li>
            <li> only complaint is about the head band.</li>
            <li> have decided this eye mask is more annoying for me.  </li>
            <li> it is way to small for the average male, it was very tight and uncomfortable to wear and my head is not abnormally large, the ear plugs lasted two uses and now will not expand</li>
            <li> but ear plugs sometimes fall down from ears.</li>
            <li> I had to cut them down</li>
            <li> I was given this for a flight from LAX to Melbourne last week and was a bit dubious as to whether this would be yet another failure.</li>
            <li> Pop in the ear plugs, put on the eye mask and forget about crying babies and other airplane noise...</li>
            <li> licking your finger slightly and putting it in your ear before inserting the rolled up ear plug to expand.</li>
            <li> it is not longer pitch black.</li>
            <li> I am a disabled, 64 year old woman with relatively poor health.  </li>
            <li> These are less substantial than the disposable ones you get from hotels.</li>
            <li> I narrowed down my options to a few and purchased this one because of its reviews and its price.</li>
            <li> The elastic was initially to tight but after about two days it started to loosen up.</li>
            <li> The strap around my head is so tight, the mask presses on my eyeballs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too tight either</li>
            <li> so it felt tight, and the mask did not seal well across the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> Elastic too tight for all but the smallest heads.</li>
            <li> It is not too tight so it doesn&#x27;t create any tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sewed up a little of the slack in the band</li>
            <li> (I have another mask that has little pillows on the lower inside of the mask) or make the nose flap</li>
            <li> and shes usually complaining about discomfort from other products</li>
            <li> The ear plus come in a darling little plastic case.  </li>
            <li> They come in a convenient little plastic case.  </li>
            <li> I tried them on and they feel like all other earplugs I&#x27;ve worn in the past.</li>
            <li> I used them for a little while, but I don&#x27;t like using earplugs to sleep in.</li>
            <li> These are poorly made of extremely low quality materials.</li>
            <li> Will order again if it stretches out in a few months.</li>
            <li> So, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never considered using an eye mask for the fear that it would never fit me.</li>
            <li> I travel a few times a year to visit my family.</li>
            <li> If your a person who needs no light while sleeping then this is the Eye Mask for you.</li>
            <li> For years I couldn&#x27;t sleep because of the annoying light (the sun?)</li>
            <li> I hate the eye masks they give you on airplanes, and this one actually allowed me to sleep through my whole flight.</li>
            <li> I have also been having a hard time with my eyes upon awakening due to the pressure against my eyes while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Conversely, the earplugs, though, are not very effective.  </li>
            <li> When I did manage to get them in, they were not very effective in canceling out the noise.</li>
            <li> The earplug is a little bit of too hard to plug in the ear.</li>
            <li> Then I would have had to come back and change my review, and explain how I was wrong, and just eat crow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will be worn daily (night shifter) and I don&#x27;t want to ruin it by using the wrong detergent, etc.</li>
            <li> and I use mine everyday!</li>
            <li> The earplugs come in a small plastic case to keep them from being lost in your suitcase</li>
            <li> Now, if David could only do something about the person in the seat behind who repeatedly kicks my seat!</li>
            <li> I actually wear it so that the strap doesn&#x27;t go behind the lobe because that was worse.  </li>
            <li> product works especially well if you have an annoying person sitting next to you that is chatting you up.  </li>
            <li> Just when I thought I didn&#x27;t require anything else to make my long hours on a flight somewhat bearable, I was proved wrong.</li>
            <li> They are a bit too hard for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Travel can be hard on your sleep rhythm.  </li>
            <li> But at least I&#x27;ve salvaged some use from an item I&#x27;d otherwise toss out as junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the earplugs are terrible and don&#x27;t even stay in and when they do they do not block sound</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on flights with infants who spend the entire flight screaming, and while I sympathize with the parents who were desperately trying every trick in the book to get him to sleep, for the passengers getting headaches, it wasn&#x27;t fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that it wears out and loses elasticity over time.</li>
            <li> I work late nights and sleep during the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay for sleeping through a flight!</li>
            <li> When I put it on to rest, It felt tight and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It would be hard to design a worse sleep mask.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product does not fit the bill.</li>
            <li> There is the awkward little holes by my nose</li>
            <li> I had no idea where they came from, but the markings became worse and worse over time.  </li>
            <li> might be just as bad as wearing the mask for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS: The thin strap will become uncomfortable after a couple of hours or so.  </li>
            <li> These ear plugs are as noise canceling as sticking a wad of silly putty in each ear.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need uncomfortable &#x60;noise cancelling headphones&#x27; with these.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a eye mask to sleep with before and was worried that it would be uncomfortable and not allow me to sleep with something on my face.</li>
            <li> I found it to be scratchy and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> at all the product was very poor</li>
            <li> They might do if you are desperate but they leave a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> How wrong I was!</li>
            <li> it was very uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> that sounds really bad).</li>
            <li> It is just that bad.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put those bad boys in until after take-off.</li>
            <li> That was a bad dream.</li>
            <li> I am completely disappointed in the mask.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I felt disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but this was very disappointing</li>
            <li> I almost even hate to donate it.</li>
            <li> The mask is horrible.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is the smell.  </li>

            <li> Another \\&quot;try it and tell me what you think\\&quot; item from Davidsbeenhere.com... the Sleep Eye Mask with Ear Plugs. I consider myself an expert on ear plugs, as I just can&#x27;t fall asleep without them now. The combo of items in this kit work fairly well, but they won&#x27;t last forever. To maintain a level of quiet (and cleanliness), you&#x27;ll end up having to replace the earplugs at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask works better than many. The bridge of the nose is always a trouble spot, as most masks let in light since the fabric won&#x27;t sit down completely on the skin and follow the curves. This mask has an extra piece of fabric there, so it&#x27;s better than others. It&#x27;s still not completely dark, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ear plugs are solid and expand out well to block out noises. I always recommend (I know this sounds gross) licking your finger slightly and putting it in your ear before inserting the rolled up ear plug to expand. It helps the insertion process (yeah... that sounds really bad). I&#x27;ve found that after using earplugs for a couple of weeks, they start to accumulate some degree of ear wax and dirt, plus they don&#x27;t have the same responsiveness in filling the ear canal. Therefore, expect that you&#x27;ll be replacing the ear plugs after a dozen or so uses. Fortunately, the kit does have a nice little plastic container to put the plugs into, so that should help keep them a bit cleaner for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this sleeping mask and ear plug kit does what it sets out to do. If I wanted something more ergonomically correct for covering my eyes, I might suggest looking for *just* an eye mask and then picking up ear plugs in bulk. But if you&#x27;re trying out this combination for upcoming trips, this combo is a quick and easy way to check it out for not much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Marketing&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li> I ordered these to help me sleep, after bringing a pair home off of the airplane and finding that they help. The elastic was initially to tight but after about two days it started to loosen up. At the same time it started to loosen up, it started to leave a purple mark on my pillow. I have to think it&#x27;s the oil from my skin interacting with the Elastic. I wasn&#x27;t sure until about the third night of it happening, and I woke up to huge purple marks on my white sheets, that will not come out of my sheets. I am throwing the pair away that I bought, and will use something else until I can find a better product. I do not recommend these except for perhaps a single use on an airplane or perhaps a round-trip on an airplane, then throw them away!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who works nights and must sleep during daylight hours.  He says it&#x27;s comfortable, and blocks enough light for him to rest easier.  It also came with a set of earplugs (which he hasn&#x27;t used).  Would probably be great for travel.  Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how it withstands wear, since some reviews have said it doesn&#x27;t hold up.  But for now it&#x27;s working great for us - and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I purchase this for air travel where sleeping conditions can be less than ideal. I tested the mask and ear plugs out during a nap and they work exactly how they should. I knocked off a star because the mask has a very potent plastic smell. I&#x27;m airing it out now hoping the smell goes away before my next trip!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend does shift work. This works much better for his daytime sleep than the hat pulled over his eyes her used to try to sleep with.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a long airplane trip.  Love that it also came with ear plugs.  Product is nicely made and very happy.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  works well.  Arrived quickly and this is a lot less expensive than other similar products.  would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> great price but stretches out after a while. I bought one from the dollar tree and it lasted longer and was cheaper.</li>
            <li> The strap around my head is so tight, the mask presses on my eyeballs. I have a fat(big)head, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if I turn it upside down and pull it up more on my forehead, it tends not to press on my eyes, although then it lets in a little light. But at least I&#x27;ve salvaged some use from an item I&#x27;d otherwise toss out as junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this if you have to use the last few holes on an adjustable baseball-cap fitting, ie, if you have a bigger-than-average head.</li>
            <li> Great product,  excellent price. Next time I&#x27;ll purchase several. Can&#x27;t open package w/ear plugs, but they are always welcome at home or when traveling to tone down sounds.  Admit I was surprised at how much I really like them. Washes well. Recommend highly. Fits my average/small head.</li>
            <li> The material is so soft and comfortable and it truly blocks out the sun. It keeps cool and doesn&#x27;t warm my face up and it takes the shape of my face as well when I sleep. Overall, its an excellent product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I really like the Davids been here Sleep eye Mask. I have not used the ear plugs yet. My roommate in college is always coming in an hour to two hours after me and the sleep mask is super helpful. Pretty much completely blocks out light. There is the awkward little holes by my nose but it covers more of it than any other sleep mask I have ever had. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a sleep mask!</li>
            <li> This is a great little gift to leave for house guests that stay over.  Mask and ear plugs are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because the headband is not adjustable. I guess it&#x27;s one size fits all?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the mask (for me) fits fine.  Yes a little light sneaks through the bottom  But the trick I figured out is to FLIP the nose piece up and under.  This blocks the light out on the bottom for me (try it)!  In addition, the mask it&#x27;s too tight either and my eyes don&#x27;t rub against the fabric which I&#x27;ve read in many other reviews of these sleep masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little light sneaks through the front of the mask, but very little.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but just note that for $4 you aren&#x27;t getting a mask that blocks out 100% of the light.  If this is somethings that really is going to bother you then look at the $10+ face masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ear plugs that come with this also come in a nice carrying case which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with these small downfalls, I do recommend this product highly.  For $4.00 you can&#x27;t really go wrong if you want a simple product that will help you block out 99% of the light so you can nap/sleep.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra and get a higher quality product. These are poorly made of extremely low quality materials. The material is very &amp;#34;plastic like&amp;#34; and does not have an appealing touch on your face. The &amp;#34;plastic like&amp;#34; material does not conform to your face so there is a great deal of light coming in from the top and bottom of the mask. Not to mention the mask is very hot to sleep in due to material that doesn&#x27;t breath well. Not something I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly, arrived intact, and is of good quality. The mask is exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased the mask at the urging of the opthamologist. My husband gets dry eye overnight. For that usage, the mask is not quite snug enough and would slip during sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I sewed up a little of the slack in the band and it works perfect.</li>
            <li> worked great on my 15 hour flight to Taipei  -- very effective at blocking out all the light, and a comfortable fit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to light when trying to sleep, and this sleep eye mask works well for me.  It blocks out light while being low-profile.  And also just as important, it&#x27;s comfortable - Has a very slight cushion and also a thick, not thin, band.  Other brands with a thick band often have velcro that helps fasten it in the back, and although that is helpful to adjust, that large velcro bump can poke into the back of your head.  This one doesn&#x27;t have that velcro adjustment, and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like the set. The mask is dark and fits well. No problems with the ear plugs. I would recommend it as a good value.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because I wanted both earplug and eye-musk not to get awake during sleeping. But I always find me not wear them when I get up in the morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin, light-weight sleep mask with decent materials. Although it came a little thinner than what I had in mind, I still enjoy it. Great for the price!</li>
            <li> My sister ordered this for me as I currently work night shifts in the PICU and sleep during the day. Not only does this mask do a great job of keeping light out of view, it also is very comfortable and light-weight. I would suggest it!</li>
            <li> This Product is great for more than just travel, that&#x27;s for sure!&lt;br /&gt;If you share a room, apartment, apartment building, hostel, WHATEVER: this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it for just being at home, but i definitely plan to use them on my next vaca!</li>
            <li> best one i have found.  i have ordered over 5 masks.  none of them have worked.  this one was perfect.  blocks out all the light, is comfortable, and is good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> The mask itself looks and feels cheap, but does the job. 90% of light is blocked out, but the nose does not conform and leaks a lot. The earplugs are good quality, but wear out after a while. The mask itself is huge, so it isn&#x27;t well suited for smaller heads. Good for occasional use, but get a better quality one if you need to use it more often than twice a month.</li>
            <li> It hurt between on ears. It don&#x27;t block the all lights. I need my room dark. It make me sleep. I won&#x27;t recommended. It the one it for only for mens. The &#x27;Lewis N. Clark Comfort eye mask&amp;#34; is must better.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like, or what I think needs to be fixed/changed about the eye mask:&lt;br /&gt;The nose flap needs to be a bit larger. I do not have a big nose. It is small to medium (I know that I&#x27;m lucky). The nose flap allows light to come under the (very thin) eye mask and the light wakes me up. Either add padding at the bottom of the mask (I have another mask that has little pillows on the lower inside of the mask) or make the nose flap so it allows the mask to fit closer to the cheekbones and keep the light out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like:&lt;br /&gt;The elastic band is nice and thick and (mostly) keeps the mask in place without cutting off circulation. Other masks I have use elastic cording which doesn&#x27;t work very well or for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ear Plugs: ok.... fussy to fit in and just kept surrounding noise muffled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summation: if you need a cheap eye mask for short term use, have a small nose and can tolerate some light and noise while you sleep, this is a fine set for the money.</li>
            <li> Cheap and arrive on time, does it job. Came with a pair of earplugs, but one of the pair seems to have dirt/mold that can&#x27;t be removed, not going to risk it and put something like that in my ear. Didn&#x27;t return it since I bought it mainly for the eye mask.</li>
            <li> Great product. My only complaint was the strong chemical smell when I first opened it,after it aired out for a couple days it was fine.</li>
            <li> the mask keeps out light and works great but the earplugs are terrible and don&#x27;t even stay in and when they do they do not block sound</li>
            <li> I use this mask from time to time. It works, but I wish the nose was more contoured so the mask would block more light. The material feels like nylon, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. The strap flexes well and applies just enough pressure to hold the mask. The free ear plugs are a nice accessory.</li>
            <li> I used it on the train and it worked just fine. Would definitely recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because for one I love the satin feel of the face mask on my skin. It does a gret job of blocking out all of the light so I can rest or sleep better. The ear plugs work as wellas can be expected to so over all I give this item four stars, wait I take that back im giving it five stars factoring in the price, out standing compaired to all the others.</li>
            <li> This product gets a three because the ear plugs did not reduce the noise level. I live with a grand mother who cannot hear so everyone has to speak loudly when they speak to her. Also two toddlers in the home who are constantly loud. I was hoping the ear plugs would reduce the noise level a little better than they were. The eye mask is great though :-)</li>
            <li> My advice to marketing is eliminate the packaging.  To much material and expense are involved in the literature and packaging, not very green when a simple paper bag would work fine, especially for a $3.00 product.</li>
            <li> I have a suitcase always packed to accompany family member to the hospital.  Last trip, this mask and ear plugs made  a huge difference in my ability to sleep in a room directly across from the nursing station.  I&#x27;ll take them anytime I travel on plane or train, and get another set for home.</li>
            <li> I like this eye mask, but it&#x27;s nothing special.  It&#x27;s basic and does the job.  It keeps light out pretty darn well, but it is really floppy.  Wish the portion that blocked light from around the nose wasn&#x27;t so awkward, but it does the job.  The elastic could be a bit tighter.  Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> This is the first face mask I&#x27;ve ever bought and I love it! I just started a job where I need to do night shifts and this really helped me. It was comfortable and it always stayed on.  Great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> So just to start off, I go to bed pretty late and my girlfriend goes to bed even later and with our television in our bedroom, it&#x27;s pretty bright and interrupts my sleep. I thought I would solve this by getting a sleep mask and of course turned right to Amazon! I looked around a little bit, reading reviews here and there and finally came upon this particular mask. It was cheap, looked like it did the job, and was Prime eligible. Ever since I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve actually gotten better sleep even when the room is dark to begin with. The mask allows total darkness and is very comfortable. There&#x27;s a tiny nose flap that helps block light coming in from below which was a nice touch. Haven&#x27;t used the ear plugs but they seemed standard. Overall, very happy with my purchase and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> It is an awkward fit.  I don&#x27;t have a big nose and when wearing it, it let light into my eyes, seeping in from the bottom of the mask by the nostril area.  It is also kind of rough feeling, and the velcro in the back would stick to my hair.  I almost even hate to donate it. Trash?</li>
            <li> This doent fit its too small</li>
            <li> Elastic strap way too large for normal heads. WIll need to alter elastic to use this product.</li>
            <li> The elastic band is made for larger heads and there is no way to adjust it. I gave this 2 stars because I basically can&#x27;t use this product since my head isn&#x27;t big enough. It looks it would do job well enough, if it would only fit</li>
            <li> We used it and enjoyed it.  Very light and thin, easy to pack with us on our trip among many other items ...</li>
            <li> I use this mask at night to help me sleep.  It does a wonderful job.  I get a good nights rest.</li>
            <li> This mask is not adjustable and the elastic is too tight to not be aware of it intermittently during the night. The ear plugs are uncomfortable and do not conform to my ear canal to adequately block out sound.  I gave 3 stars instead of lower because at this price it is probably what I should have expected but I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li> How can you beat this: dark and quiet all at once! these are great if you have nocturnal housemates, neighbors, or blinds that don&#x27;t shut out the light. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask for my headache days. I haven&#x27;t has to use it for that purpose yet, but I tried it on and fit great. Not too tight or loose. It blocks the light perfectly, and the ears plug is a plus. I absolutely will recommend it. Thinking to buy another one for my hubby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student with a roommate who stays up with her computer on all night. I sleep with this thing on almost every night (I don&#x27;t usually have to use the ear plugs) and it works really well to block out the screen light for me. I also use it on the weekends when I sleep in- I can&#x27;t even tell when the sun is up!</li>
            <li> Comfortable and keeps out the light. For the price I couldnt ask for more. Will order again if it stretches out in a few months.</li>
            <li> Ear plugs were to big and would not stay in ear.  Mask gets really hot, I wake up sweating and I sleep with air conditioner and ceiling fan on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really comfortable to use but ear plugs sometimes fall down from ears. I recommend this product to anyone who sleeps with someone who snores.</li>
            <li> Elastic band stretches out.  Works great when new.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and does the job really well. The fact that they include ear plugs is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work (and the affordable price)!</li>
            <li> Synthetic fabric, mask shape loosely fits, no adjustable strap...&lt;br /&gt;Few bucks but cheap product indeed!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to buy something in the range of 10$ or more.</li>
            <li> I like it to be super dark when I&#x27;m going to sleep and this sleep mask is perfect. Good elastic, not too tight and the mask itself is nice and soft. I bought two right away! One as a back up that I keep in my travel bag. I have also thrown it in the wash with my delicates, and it has come out like new.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely get my money&#x27;s worth and some out of this Sleep Mask Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> When I tried using this sleep mask it was very uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t work that well. The strap has no adjustment and was too tight for me (although I do have a relatively large head). Not only did it feel a bit too tight but there wasn&#x27;t anything preventing it from putting pressure on the eyes themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally the mask doesn&#x27;t have any way to wrap around the nose well, so the mask would constantly slip upwards and let a lot of light bleed in to the point where the mask was essentially useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be able to get it to work properly with some manual alterations or if your head is rather small, but I would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Works very well at keeping out the light.  Minor problem: it can stretch out after a year or so of constant use.</li>
            <li> great! but some light will peak through the nose part...but other than that its great! I would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> The ear plugs were so big I had to cut them down but they still wouldn&#x27;t fit and they&#x27;re not soft enough. The eye mask doesn&#x27;t fit very well either and slides up. So, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Super comfy mask, blocks out the light really well. I was worried I might get a headache from wearing it, but really it fits beautifully. In fact I pushed the mask up on to my head (like a head band) when I woke up this morning, and totally forgot it was there till my husband was like...&amp;#34;why are you still wearing that?&amp;#34; LOL!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE, does exactly what I needed... and I loved that the suggested item, when I was searching for this, was fuzzy handcuffs...mmm that&#x27;s not why I needed the sleep mask, but whatever :D</li>
            <li> I love this product. I always have sleepless nights due to the loud next door neighbors, and with this and the included ear plugs, I can finally get some sleep. Thank you David!</li>
            <li> I received this eye mask as a freebie to test and review.  I have several other Davidsbeenhere products (which I love).  Once I received the product I removed it from the package to look it over.  The two things I noticed immediately is the softness of the material and the strap.  The strap has a wide elastic band that will stretch but not feel tight when used.  I have had other eye masks in the past that weren&#x27;t really that soft or that comfortable around your head.  I travel a lot and will share rooms with others in my group.  I used this mask for a recent trip and between the mask and ear plugs it was perfect.  It kept the light out (when there was movement in the room) and even though the ear plugs don&#x27;t block out all sound they muffle it enough to let you sleep.  The ear plugs are easy to put in and come with their own case.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t travel without it. it is comfortable and the ear plugs are really good. it was a great investment.</li>
            <li> the eye mask fits comfortably and works great. The earplugs were an added bonus, I do not typically use earplugs but on my most recent trip I remembered that I had them and popped them in on the plane when there was a crying baby over my shoulder....in turn I ended up sleeping like a baby! definitely recommend this product package. comes in handy! I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The quality of this mask is embarrassing.  At $10 I probably should have expected this.  The mask doesn&#x27;t block any light around the nose, even though the product description indicates \\&quot;added nose ridge blocks out all light\\&quot;.  The \\&quot;added nose ridge\\&quot; is simply an extra piece of cheap material that adds nothing to the mask.  Even if the nose ridge worked the way it was intended it wouldn&#x27;t matter, because you can see light THROUGH the cheap material this mask is made of.  Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife to replace an old and tattered one that she had gotten free on one of our airline flights. She really finds them comfortable but was disappointed that the earplugs were missing from the packaging. They are light weight and the head band on them are just perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple face mask so my hubby can sleep while I read this was the best deal and got ear plugs out of it haha. It blocks out the sun or lights so that is good. Only thing is that my husband tells me it&#x27;s very tight and puts pressure on his head and eyes which will hurt if he has a headache. Maybe if it had adjustable straps? But good for it&#x27;s soul purpose of blocking out light.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice eye mask. The material is soft and feels very comfortable on my eyes. It&#x27;s very effective at keeping out all ambient light - no light leaks near the edges or at the bridge of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is about the head band. It&#x27;s non-adjustable, and a little too tight of a fit on me. It&#x27;s fine for short-term use, such as an hour or two, but after longer use the tightness of the headband makes it uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included ear plugs come in a nice plastic case. They are fairly effective, but I prefer a softer material. They are a bit too hard for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for light blocking and material comfort; three stars for the headband. Four stars overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[The product was provided by the manufacturer for review]</li>
            <li> Eye masks are a must have for me, since I need total darkness to be able to fall asleep. I was happily surprised with Davidsbeenhere Travel Sleep Kit that also included a pair of ear plugs, perfect for cancelling aircraft noise. Clever! This is the perfect combination to rest at ease during a flight. The eye mask is made of a light material so it&#x27;s not hot or itchy and effectively cancels light, also the elastic band is the right size so it won&#x27;t give you a headache from being too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is very useful as well for those people like me, for whom it&#x27;s difficult to fall asleep in bright bedrooms. So use it at home or during the trip, so you can actually aisle yourself from bothersome noise and wake up like new to enjoy your day!  Even try it to nap in the office ;-)</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mask which helps me sleep during the day since I work nights.  It does let a little light in but that&#x27;s of minor concern to me.  My only real grip is that the strap puts a bit too much pressure on my ears.  I actually wear it so that the strap doesn&#x27;t go behind the lobe because that was worse.  All that said, it may just need to be that way to keep it from coming off during sleep.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and hopefully it&#x27;ll stretch out a bit more over time.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and nice and black. Thanks David! Always count on your products. I just used this on my last trip to Spain</li>
            <li> This eye mask is great for traveling or simply anytime you want to cancel out the light and sleep. Awesome material and comfortable. The ones I have had before make my face itch, the DBH eye mask does not, it&#x27;s ideal!</li>
            <li> Just when I thought I didn&#x27;t require anything else to make my long hours on a flight somewhat bearable, I was proved wrong. I honestly didn&#x27;t believe David&#x27;s Been Here had any more tricks up his sleeve, until I was introduced to this Sleep Eye Mask with bonus ear plugs. Now, I tend to have somewhat of a bigger head than most and for that reason alone I&#x27;ve never considered using an eye mask for the fear that it would never fit me. Although a bit snug, it is comfortable enough where I was able to drift right into a deep sleep on my six hour flight to sunny San Diego. When used with the ear plugs, they made for the perfect recipe for a soothing, rejuvenating nap. I plan on using these later on next month when I have my wife drive some of the way to our annual Florida vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I was given this item free of charge due to a contest that was being promoted on David&#x27;s Been Here travel site. I was the lucky recipient of this incredible companion.</li>
            <li> The eye mask is a joke.  The band is elastic and so tight than anyone with a head larger than a child will get a headache from wearing the mask.  There is no sort of cup or detent to keep the mast away from your eyes when you have the mask on and the mask pulls so tight on your face that your eyes will physically hurt within seconds of putting the mask on.  There is no way to fall asleep while wearing this thing, short of a savage blow to the head.  But with a blow to the head you wouldn&#x27;t need the mask and the headache might be just as bad as wearing the mask for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t order the mask for its included ear plugs, but these things are the icing on the cake.  The packaging calls them \\&quot;noise canceling ear plugs.\\&quot;  Traditionally noise canceling technology is some sort of active device that in some way processes and negates sound to cancel it out.  These ear plugs are as noise canceling as sticking a wad of silly putty in each ear.  There is no trick to them.  By \\&quot;noise canceling\\&quot; they are trying to put a marketing term on foam ear plugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, my one star review has nothing at all to do with the ear plugs that are the included with the mask.  The mask is horrible.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  You will regret it.  And, to be fair, I have never posted a negative review like this before.  It is just that bad.</li>
            <li> This is my first sleeping mask and I was looking for something that would block light and comfortable to wear at a decent price. I narrowed down my options to a few and purchased this one because of its reviews and its price. I am completely disappointed in the mask. One, it doesn&#x27;t block the light that enters at the bridge of your nose. I knew that it would be a challenge finding a mask that would do so and thought this was the way to go since the picture shows a piece of material in that area. Again, after reading some reviews I never ran across someone complaining about this issue, so I didn&#x27;t think it would be one. Second, the strap of the mask is positioned where it would have to lay over your ears in order to wear it. I wore this mask one time and woke up in pain because of this. I did not want to deal with these issues again, so I am refraining from wearing it ever again. I&#x27;m sure you can find a better mask for the same price.</li>
            <li> I only wear a mask in the morning when the sun comes up and I need an extra hour of sleep.  In just six months time though the bottom stitching has come apart and the mask is falling apart.  I am not too impressed with the quality.  It also lets in a little bit of light around my face if not adjusted perfectly so as soon as I move it is not longer pitch black.</li>
            <li> My husband is the person in our household who is a sleep eye mask wearer. So I asked him to &#x60;test drive&#x27; this mask - while he was asleep!! He had a glowing review this morning! He loved the comfortability of the fabric and the elastic band. He also liked the added feature of the nose ridge; it did its job in keeping that sneaky light out! The only &#x60;constructive criticism&#x27; he had was that he thinks the eye mask should have a fabric strap with a Velcro closure, as elastic has a tendency to stretch. Overall, he thought it was the most comfortable and effective sleep eye mask that he has ever used! I trust it will allow him to have many hours of deep sleep!

            <li> DBH (DavidsBeenHere) Travel Sleep Kit comes with a light-cancelling eye mask and noise-cancelling ear plugs (2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is a travel product, it can also be used at home.  I tried it out.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be honest - at first, I thought I was going to have to deduct a star.  Here&#x27;s why:  When I put on the mask, light still crept in at the bottom (no good).  However, I realized, if I pull the mask down, then it blocks out the light from the bottom.  The mask is barely big enough to cover the eyes from top to bottom; you just have to pull it down a little to make it cancel out the light seeping through at the bottom.  This little \\&quot;triick\\&quot; of pulling down the mask seems so small and simple, but it is a big deal indeed, because I almost deducted a star because of it.  I am glad I discovered this trick before I wrote the review.  Then I would have had to come back and change my review, and explain how I was wrong, and just eat crow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the ear plugs:  The ear plugs muffle out sound a little, but does not totally cut it out.  It will not protect your ears from any type of live rounds, but then again, it never claimed to.  These ear plugs are not a replacement for any type of military ear plugs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is especially good for me, because I am a migraine sufferer.  The least little bit of light and/or sound can give me a migraine.  And after the migraine is there, I sure don&#x27;t want anymore light and/or sound.  I recommend this product to other migraine sufferers (as well as all other people).  But this product will be good for me even when there is no migraine; just when I want to cut out the light and/or sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product, and I will continue to use it both at home and on travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Travel Product turned into Migraine \\&quot;Remedy/Medicine\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> Sleep will be greatly enhanced by this product. The blindfold is thick, has a nose flap, and allows complete light blockage. The quality is superior. My only criticism is that the non-adjustable elastic strap may be a bit tight if one has a large head or lots of hair. The ear plugs are of high quality and come in a plastic storage case. I use the mask at home when I take naps. [It was fun reviewing this product. No one can accuse you of sleeping on the job.]</li>
            <li> The mask works just as it should.  In addition, the ear plugs are great--comfortable, work well, and fit well.  Both are a good price and nice quality.</li>
            <li> Comfy, fits nicely and comfortable. Much better than several others we have tried. We have not used the ear pugs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for about four bucks. Maybe that should have been a signal. I used it maybe twice. The eye mask is just very small and as someone who actually needs a mask to block light so that I can sleep, I found it disappointing. Maybe other people who don&#x27;t need total darkness will find this product acceptable, but I needed something more.</li>
            <li> The David&#x27;s Been Here  Sleep Eye Mask comes with ear plugs. That&#x27;s incredibly handy. I&#x27;ve been on flights with infants who spend the entire flight screaming, and while I sympathize with the parents who were desperately trying every trick in the book to get him to sleep, for the passengers getting headaches, it wasn&#x27;t fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself does effectively block out light. I was impressed. The elastic band is the one thing that I would change. It fit my head okay, but I know elastic well enough that it wears out and loses elasticity over time. My head is smaller than my husband&#x27;s, so if we were to share it, he&#x27;d have that elastic stretched out too much for me to keep using it too. An adjustable band would be better.</li>
            <li> I travel a few times a year to visit my family. I always prepare what I have termed my &amp;#34;airplane survival kit&amp;#34;. It has everything from a toothbrush, lotion, dry soap, eye masks and ear plugs. When I received these items (from the DBH for the purpose of a review), I was happy to see if it was time to replace my eye mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many eye masks of all makes, fabric and shapes. Well, I have replaced my eye mask in my kit with DBH&#x27;s. It blocks out light more than my previous two. It is not as soft as the microfiber I have for the home but,it gets the job done. It doesn&#x27;t block light coming from the nose bridge and that was a let down. Overrall, it was very comfortable to wear. But, I do wish it was adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ear plugs are just like any other plugs. They are not really noise canceling. They are just regular plugs. Stick in your ear and your are done. The plugs do have a nice case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I read the package that the items came in, I noticed that it said that the &amp;#34;Sleeping Kit packs away into a handy carrying case for easy storage...&amp;#34; Well, I did not see any carrying case included in these items.</li>
            <li> I have a Travel pillow from DavidsBeenHere product line and I also have a luggage electronic scale and this is a great adage to the line :)) I have an eye mask and its not that great but i really love this one and its nice and big and lots of room for the eyes and lightweight and i think it looks cool too :)) Bought one for my mom and shes usually complaining about discomfort from other products but with this one she didnt. She loves it too and I let her borrow it and now she wants one of her own so cant wait to buy one again :) great work david!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;follow me on twitter ya&#x27;ll @TheeDanielR</li>
            <li> I really like the eye mask because its not only great for traveling but also to be used at home... The material is comfortable and its not too tight.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask so that I can sleep while my roommate studies.  It blocks out most of the light and the earplugs are a nice bonus.  The only downside: it puts moderate pressure on the eyes, but what sleep mask doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> Unless you are photophobic and can&#x27;t bear even the slightest amount of light when you wish to sleep then this mask is probably not for you. But for the everyday person who either at home, on a metro commute, or in an airplane or in a noisy hotel when traveling then this very comfortable mask is one of the best. The main reason is that 1) it accomplishes its mission in that it blocks out almost all light (depending on how you adjust it), 2) it doesn&#x27;t keep you awake with the feeling that you&#x27;ve been blindfolded, and 3) it comes with those terrific brand of malleable earplugs that with the heat of your fingers  compress so that when the plugs are introduced into the external auditory canals they conform the to channel and block out all but the loudest of noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whether you need a mask to assure you are getting rest before a trip, or for use in the journey to your destination, or for use in those hotels that may be very near the action part of your destination city and therefore a bit on the late night noise side, then this combo eye mask and earplug set is a nifty addendum to your travel preparation and enjoyment.  Another thoughtful idea from Davisbeenhere.  Grady Harp, November 12</li>
            <li> This kit is invaluable and a bargain.  The Eye Mask is thick enough that you won&#x27;t see any light, which is helped with a unique &#x60;nose ridge&#x27;.  It is very comfortable and the polyester feels good.  The ear plugs are construction grade - meaning that they are the best you can purchase - the kind construction workers use to protect their eardrums from loud noise.  You won&#x27;t need uncomfortable &#x60;noise cancelling headphones&#x27; with these.  They are totally silent and comfortable.  That noisy plane will disappear.  They can&#x27;t help you with that kid kicking your seat or somebody eating a bologna sandwich next to you, but it&#x27;s the best out there for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the [[ASIN:B008J4D1FU Davidsbeenhere: Travel Passport Neck Wallet Pouch]] for more convenience traveling.  Product kindly supplied for review by &#x27;Davidsbeenhere&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Stretches out easily and light comes through underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had tons of eye masks over the years.  This is one of the most disappointing.  It is comfortable, except that it is pretty tight.  Would not work for most men, probably only for smaller women.  The worst part is the smell.  It has that manufactured rubbery B.O. kind of smell.  The earplugs are unnecessary--would rather buy a multi-pack of better quality ones somewhere else and save a little on the eye mask.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat them for the price. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price. They were small but fit comfortably and blocked out all the light. I slept great and will stock up on these.</li>
            <li> It was shipped fast, and it came as described. I just don&#x27;t like the way it felt on my eyes after a whole nights sleep.</li>
            <li> I replaced an old worn out eye mask with this one and have mixed feelings.  It fits snug to my head which my old one never did because the elastic was horribly stretched out.  My only complaint is the fabric isn&#x27;t as soft as I would like and I can hear my eyelashes rub against it when they flutter.  It also tries to cut out light coming through the nose but doesn&#x27;t completely.  I still like it and it does what I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---- update 12/31/12----&lt;br /&gt;I have decided this eye mask is more annoying for me.  I am constantly waking throughout the night with this half way up my eyes and it just does not want to stay in place.  I think part of the problem being my hair moving.  I am sure guys or gals with short hair might do better with this.  In the future I am going to look for a different eye mask.</li>
            <li> Why do airplanes always forget the ear plugs? I suppose they assume everyone is plugged in jamming to some tunes, sometimes I just want peace and quiet.  This is the lightest eye mask I have ever put on that still solidly blocks out all light.  The ear plugs are on par with other ear plugs, nothing more or less.  I wish the strap was adjustable on this eye mask and I worry about the elastic wearing out too fast.  It&#x27;s been great so far but I have only been using it for about two weeks (I regularly sleep with an eye mask and ear plugs due to babies).</li>
            <li> I thought this product did one thing I&#x27;ve had problems with before. The nose piece effectively blocked out the light better than other products I&#x27;ve tried over the years. The ear plugs were a great bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice product.</li>
            <li> I received this eye mask and ear plus from the seller for free in exchange for my honest review.  As I listed in my heading, these are definitely items I wanted to use right away and not wait for a trip to take advantage of them.  The eye mask is very comfortable and easy to slip on.  I can see where this item would be ideal for people who need to sleep during daylight hours and need something to keep the light out.  This would definitely fit the bill for that.  I am a disabled, 64 year old woman with relatively poor health.  I often take naps during the day and am frequently annoyed by light and noises in the house that keep on even though I am trying to rest.  These two items now sit on the table beside my bed where they are ready to be used for my daytime nap.  The ear plus come in a darling little plastic case.  This makes it nice to be able to slip them in your purse and have them handy anytime.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for my ranking of a \\&quot;4\\&quot; is the price.  I feel that it should be priced at around $7.  Just my opinion.  But I give these a strong recommend to buy because they are simply the cat&#x27;s pajamas.  LOL!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it, it doesn&#x27;t conform to your face and therefore doesn&#x27;t block light... Isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s supposed to do?</li>
            <li> This is a cool kit that consists of a super high quality eye mask and a pair of really good ear plugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye mask has an additional amount of material over the nose area that prevents  light from peeking in.  This one is padded, well constructed, and it&#x27;s so nice that if you leave it somewhere you&#x27;ll kick yourself and go buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ear plugs are the foam kind, like  you would  use at the gun range.  They come in a convenient little plastic case.  They are brightly colored which advertises to fellow travelers that you need some &#x60;alone time&#x27;.  You can still hear with them, so they are safe, but it helps block the majority of the loud sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{For instance: I use mine when I  feed my parrots.  (My Macaw loves to wait until I&#x27;m next to her cages before she screeches  \\&quot;MOMMYY!!!!  AFLAC!!!\\&quot;  Right in my ear.)  Soooooooo...... ear plugs have a practical use too besides travel.}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily stick the set in you jeans pocket, so it&#x27;s convenient for travel, or if you work the 3rd shift to help block out family noises during your sleep time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: in exchange for an honest opinion/review the company gave me the product.</li>
            <li> I have a rather large head (I wear size 8-1/2 hats), and many eye masks don&#x27;t fit me well. The Davidsbeenhere eye mask is one that doesn&#x27;t fit. The elastic is not adjustable so it felt tight, and the mask did not seal well across the bridge of my nose. I&#x27;ve used worse eye masks, but also better, though the \\&quot;better\\&quot; are also more expensive. If you have a larger head, you may want to look elsewhere, otherwise this set may work well for you. Davidsbeenhere sent me this set and asked me to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earplugs are generic foam cylinders in a clear plastic case. Perfectly fine, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I work at night &amp; needed help sleeping during the day. My blackout curtains just didn&#x27;t get my room dark enough. so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try &amp; it has helped tremendously! However, the ear plugs are too soft &amp; squishy &amp; wouldn&#x27;t fit right in my ears. Fortunately noise isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable.  It also shuts out light very we&#x27;ll and is very sturdy.  It&#x27;s definitely not going to fall apart anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Nothing Fancy and it is 100% functional. Would gladly recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a sleeping mask.</li>
            <li> I purchased the eye mask with earplugs for my husband and I to use on our 20+ hour flight to Australia.  They worked great and came in a convenient travel case.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask totally does the job and is much cheaper than other options on Amazon. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> The elastic in this eye mask stretched out to the point where it falls off my face after just a handful of uses.  I threw these out and got these instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WNX21Y/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> I very rarely will rate anything one star but this was very disappointing the product overall was very cheap it is way to small for the average male, it was very tight and uncomfortable to wear and my head is not abnormally large, the ear plugs lasted two uses and now will not expand at all the product was very poor</li>
            <li> The elastic strap stretches out very fast, within three weeks. It doesn&#x27;t mold to the face and light still gets in. If you move your head to turn over, the mask moves away from the face and you&#x27;ll need to readjust it.</li>
            <li> After a couple months of use, the elastic is stretched out. And no I don&#x27;t have a fat head!</li>
            <li> the eye mask, it&#x27;s wonderful. you put it on and it fits perfect, the clothe used is very soft, so you don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at any time while wearing it; also the material used it&#x27;s easy to clean. You can use this mask anywhere, not only while traveling, you can used it at home to relax, at work if you have break to close your eyes and don&#x27;t want to be bother by the lights or glare. I think it&#x27;s a very versatile product, also the ear plugs that come with it are very comfortable for your ears. I am very pleased with this product, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> If your a person who needs no light while sleeping then this is the Eye Mask for you. It completely consumes your face so that not a bit of light enters. I just used it on my recent trip to Central America and I even used it in my hotel room to sleep. It was perfect and I think its a must for people who like sleep mask. Great job David!</li>
            <li> There is a slight gap below the nose where a minor line a light still leaks in. Otherwise, it does its job.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to light when I am sleeping so I am always looking for ways to keep the light out.  I have tried so many different eye masks and most of them have not done the job of keeping the light out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is different.  The strap is thicker than other ones and keeps the mask securely on my head.  It is not too tight and not too loose.  The material is also comfortable against my face.  This is now my go to eye mask while I am traveling.</li>
            <li> Enough to cover up light - not put you in entire darkness though. The earplug is a little bit of too hard to plug in the ear.</li>
            <li> Great little kit when you are traveling and you really need to get some quality sleep. Pop in the ear plugs, put on the eye mask and forget about crying babies and other airplane noise...&lt;br /&gt;This really helped me on a recent trip to Africa when I was facing two long flights back to back.&lt;br /&gt;The sleep mask is well designed, comfortable and really cuts out all the light, which isn&#x27;t the case with other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the DBH product line - you can tell that David&#x27;s products are smartly designed, coming from an experienced traveler. Great job David !</li>
            <li> This eye mask blocks out all light and works really well. I also love that it comes with ear plugs too!</li>
            <li> Not sure why this has such good reviews. I found it to be cheap. The elastic is too tight for my normal size head. But in any case, there is no sturdy material in the middle of the eye part to keep the elastic from bending it in half. So the result is that you feel elastic on your eyes. And it didn&#x27;t conform that well to the shape of my face. I think for what it offers, it should be cheaper.</li>
            <li> These are less substantial than the disposable ones you get from hotels. They might do if you are desperate but they leave a lot to be desired. Don&#x27;t expect them to last very long.</li>
            <li> Although this sleep mask is decent as far as quality, the non-adjustable head strap is too loose, so if you have a smaller head, it will likely move and fall off during the night.  Also, the strip that goes across the nose bridge is pretty short, making it difficult to get a snug fit across the face.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning, and it was the best price I could find online.  Quality is good and I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The included earplugs sucked. But the mask itself was very comfortable and fits excellently. If you really want to sleep, buy yourself some silicone earplugs at the drugstore. Just don&#x27;t put those bad boys in until after take-off.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Elastic too tight for all but the smallest heads. Doesn&#x27;t block the light from around the nose. It would be hard to design a worse sleep mask.</li>
            <li> I was given this product in exchange for an honest review.  I travel a ton and normally just where my sunglasses to cut out the light, because past sleep eye masks hurt after awhile...guess the elastic was too tight, and they normally didn&#x27;t even block out all the light!  The DBH sleep eye pillow is super comfy and blocks at all the light...the addition of ear plugs is awesome!  Try buying this in the airport at this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works especially well if you have an annoying person sitting next to you that is chatting you up.  Just but on the eye mask and ear plugs and they will get the hint.</li>
            <li> The Sleep Eye Mask does well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The ear plugs are as pictured, but technically ARE NOT noise cancelling.  Yes, I&#x27;m being picky.  The only other thing I would add is why not include cleaning instructions with the item or the packaging?  This will be worn daily (night shifter) and I don&#x27;t want to ruin it by using the wrong detergent, etc.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when the eye mask and ear plugs arrived.  When I opened the box, I felt disappointed.  I thought the eye mask would of been of better quality.  When I put it on to rest, It felt tight and uncomfortable.  I could feel everything when I blinked my eyes, and there was a small spot where the light would get in.  I work third shift and really needed to find something to help me sleep.  Unfortunately, this product does not fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I trust the customer reviews I find here on Amazon to select good quality products.  I found that this one was misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:  Good enough light coverage&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The thin strap will become uncomfortable after a couple of hours or so.  The earplugs didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to block out light by putting a pillow over my head in my too-bright bedroom, this investment was worth every penny.  The mask is soft and the elastic is just tight enough around my head.  Generally the extra flap of material over the nose is effective for blocking out additional light that might sneak in, unless the mask shifts while I&#x27;m sleeping.  The fabric and padding are both dark enough to block out bright sunlight in an all-white room.  Conversely, the earplugs, though, are not very effective.  I tried to use them during my most recent air travel experience, and they did not cancel noise much at all.  They&#x27;re just foam -- my silicone plugs are far, far better.  Nevertheless, the mask is worth the $11 -- buy it and then acquire your own earplugs for peace anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love this eye mask - I am prone to migraine headaches and when I lie down during the day, I like to block out as much light as possible. My house gets plenty of sunlight so having a good eye mask is important. This eye mask did its job beyond expectations - it blocked out almost all of the light and the headband fit just right around my head, providing comfort and peaceful slumber. I do have to mention that I am a female with a medium-sized head, and I think the headband would be much more efficient if it were adjustable, to fit larger heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the earplugs since my ear canal is quite small and these were difficult to mold and fit in comfortably in my ear. When I did manage to get them in, they were not very effective in canceling out the noise. For the affordable price though, I think the eye mask is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I own two other sleep masks and this mask works wonderfully. I wore it all night. The strap is nice and wide, it&#x27;s comfortable, it effectively blocks out light, and it doesn&#x27;t slip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earplugs are the foam variety. They come in a cute little plastic case just large enough to contain them. I tried them on and they feel like all other earplugs I&#x27;ve worn in the past. I used them for a little while, but I don&#x27;t like using earplugs to sleep in. At night, I just hear everything in my head amplified: the blood pulsating in my ear, my hair rubbing against the pillow, the sound of my own breathing. This isn&#x27;t a problem inherent to these particular earplugs. All earplugs cause this problem for me. I will save them for more deafening situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is worth it for the sleep mask. I wore it with the room lights full on and outside in bright sunshine and it blocks out the light very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by David&#x27;s Been Here.</li>
            <li> I sleep next to a wall that has a heat pump on the other side.  The ear plugs work great.  I haven&#x27;t used the sleep mask yet, but I know I will.</li>
            <li> I loved the eye mask, I not only used for sleep but used on the kids for pin the tail on the donkey type games. Works great! :)</li>
            <li> It helped me to sleep well on my red-eye flight. I was able to be active the next day on my client site. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I cant sleep without this! It is so great when I need it to be dark and quiet! Quality and Materials are of good quality and you cannot get a better one for the money!! It is very comfortable to wear with the elastic strap and fabric is smooth and soft. I consider this purchase to be a smart one as this is for an essential item and I use mine everyday!</li>
            <li> Not every sleep mask out there is equal...like this one...which is head and shoulders ABOVE equal. Put it on and happily slip into the darkest of Nirvanas!</li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear and great material for the money! Really great buy! I love it so much! It&#x27;s easy on the eyes! And I come from a person who wears night gear.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a review about this one because I have never owned an eye mask until now. This is a very comfortable eye mask! I remember playing with airline eye masks when I would travel as a kid and I never really thought much of them. I think they&#x27;ve been around since the Roman Republic or something. Anyway, this eye mask is very comfortable and has served me well so far!</li>
            <li> The mask was a nice fit when I first for the first week.  After that first week the strap became loose fairly quickly.  I used it nightly as my wife insists on watching tv most of the night.  She keeps the sound low an the ear plugs are still working great.  I have (well my daughter has) sewn pleats in the side of the strap twice now and it continues to loosen.  I do like the fit of the mask and I may have my daughter replace the strap.</li>
            <li> There not too much to say about this on. It&#x27;s simple. I work late nights and sleep during the day. I&#x27;ve never used a eye mask to sleep with before and was worried that it would be uncomfortable and not allow me to sleep with something on my face. I was pleasantly surprised that it was light and easy for me to sleep in. It stays on all night for me. The ear plugs were just a bonus for me. I live in a noisy condo complex and these really help to shut out the world and let you sleep.</li>
            <li> Bought for my Mom that has trouble sleeping when any light comes in the room.  She has no complaints. Good Product.</li>
            <li> I found it to be scratchy and uncomfortable.  I tried it twice and that was it.  Luckily I found the old one I was replacing which was much more comfortable.  I&#x27;m not using this one.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is awesome. The material is an extremely soft polyester which makes it seem like I&#x27;m not even wearing anything at all. But it also does a very good job of blocking out all light. This mask will definitely make sleeping on an airplane much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say my head is of average size, and the elastic band fits perfectly around my head. It is not too tight so it doesn&#x27;t create any tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous sleep mask was a cottony material and it trapped so much heat and weight which made it uncomfortable to use for long periods of time. The DBH sleep mask is so much better than the cotton ones because it&#x27;s so light weight. It doesn&#x27;t make my face hot and it weighs almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included ear plugs are a nice foam material which definitely reduce noise and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have bought tons of eye masks, and most don&#x27;t seem to block out all of the light. This one does. I think it&#x27;s cut differently than most (has a little nose ridge that helps block out all of the light). It&#x27;s also extremely soft and has a nice wide strap so you can barely feel it when it&#x27;s on. I bought two and now I have one for the car so I can sleep on long drives, and put one away in my DBH travel bag. Thanks David! Another useful, solid product.</li>
            <li> Travel can be hard on your sleep rhythm.  That makes it important to fit in some dream time whenever possible.  The eye mask does a good job of blocking out light and is comfortable to sleep in.  There is a well-designed nose flap that keeps direct light from sneaking in around the nose.  The earplugs come in a small plastic case to keep them from being lost in your suitcase (this has happened to me too many times).  The contoured shape of the earplugs make it easier to insert them far enough into the ear canal to be effective.  While most people buy these for long plane rides, they can be especially helpful for hotel sleeping in rowdy towns like New Orleans, or Key West.  The item was provided complimentary in exchange for this honest review.</li>
            <li> This mask changed me life!! For years I couldn&#x27;t sleep because of the annoying light (the sun?) shining through the hole in my cave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No seriously, this mask is perfect if you want to be able to sleep when it&#x27;s still light out. It&#x27;s comfortable, and they changed the strap so it&#x27;s not as tight. It&#x27;s quite snug. Like a beautiful head-glove.</li>
            <li> The mask cuts most light and fits mostly comfortably.  I put the wide elastic over the top of my ears because it rubbed otherwise, but my husband has no problem with this.  The ear plugs block noise well, but became less pliable and less effective more quickly than other types.  Overall a pretty good value.  The mask is holding up well after several months.</li>
            <li> They compress the eyes and don&#x27;t block enough light.</li>
            <li> I can still see light at the bottom of the mask when i put it on. it needs to have something that molds over your nose so it blocks it out completely. The earplugs don&#x27;t fit me and doesn&#x27;t block out noise very well.</li>
            <li> The Travel Sleep Kit provides a light cancelling eye mask, and a set of noise cancelling Ear Plugs.  I often take a good day rest in the day if I did not sleep well the previous night.... and the mask keeps out plenty of light.  So, if you need it for a flight, it will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ear Plugs are a soft spongy fabric.  But, you would need to push these well into the ear canal to eliminate noise from the outside.  And, you don&#x27;t want to push these too much into the canal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are designed by trusted travel expert David Hoffman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other great products by Davidsbeenhere: [[ASIN:B006YC5L16 Davidsbeenhere Inflatable Travel Pillow with Cloth Cover]] and [[ASIN:B008PUJBJS Davidsbeenhere Hanging Travel Toiletry Cosmetics Bag Kit, Grey]]  ....Rizzo</li>
            <li> The soft, lightweight mask is well-designed, with the shape cupping the face and a flap to prevent light-leakage from the bottom, but I found it too small/tight for my large male noggin (XL hat size). It fit the petite GF just fine, though. Rolled up, the mask is tiny-- just tuck it in your travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earplugs are simple foam ones, with two noteworthy differences.  One is that they come in a small hard case to keep them clean and easy-to-find-- I&#x27;ve lost more than a few foam earplugs over the years, and there&#x27;s always a moment of \\&quot;ick\\&quot; from putting something that&#x27;s been sitting at the bottom of your travel bag into your ear, so the case is helpful.  The other is the directions on the outside packaging.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen concise directions on how to correctly insert foam earplugs-- if you haven&#x27;t either, make a point of reading the label on this package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frequent travelers (especially international ones) likely already have a collection of eye masks, but if you don&#x27;t, or if you don&#x27;t have a favorite mask, this kit is a nice one.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> After using this product a number of times, I began noticing purple marks on my pillow.  I had no idea where they came from, but the markings became worse and worse over time.  I then looked inside the plastic packaging that the mask came in and it had purple dye all over it too.  The mask was never washed or misused in any way; I simply pulled it out of the package and started using it.  I now have a couple of stained pillowcases and bed sheet because of this mask.</li>
            <li> Before taking David Hoffman&#x27;s Travel Sleep Kit (\\&quot;light cancelling eye mask\\&quot; and \\&quot;noise cancelling ear plugs\\&quot;) into real combat behind the thin walls and misshapen draperies in on-the-road Motel 6&#x27;s, I tried them out in my not entirely quiet condo last night. I can report that I couldn&#x27;t see anything and could only hear the distant hum of approaching Armageddon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, wait! That was a bad dream. Whew! So, bottom line, I slept well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, remember to remove eye mask before going to the bathroom otherwise you might walk into a door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice the \\&quot;noise cancelling\\&quot; claim on the ear plugs. I was surprised at this but they did actually cancel noise a bit like the Bose noise cancelling headphones do. For me it got calmer and quieter but my breath became a bit of a roar and I could count my heart rate just by lying there and listening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye mask does indeed also \\&quot;cancel\\&quot; light but not completely. There is a bit of light at the bottom of the mask slipping in regardless of which way I turn it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next test: on an old but serviceable Boeing 767 jetliner. (As opposed to a new but not serviceable Boeing 787 Dreamliner.) Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dennis Littrell, author of \\&quot;The World Is Not as We Think It Is</li>
            <li> I bought this mask in the fall of 2012 since I was going to be having nursing clinicals on midnights.  Now that I am working midnights regularly and have been using it frequently for daytime sleeping, I have been having some problems.  While it does stay in place and block out light fairly well, I find that it cuts into my ears after awhile.  I have also been having a hard time with my eyes upon awakening due to the pressure against my eyes while sleeping.  Using it regulary, the problem seems to be compounding.  I am concerned that it is going to damage my eyes.  I guess I&#x27;ll be looking for a different mask.</li>
            <li> Keeps light very good away but it&#x27;s a bit difficult to breath ;)</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how many freebie eye covers I have had from airlines and NONE of them ever really worked, either they did not close out the light or the straps had a variety of issues. I was given this for a flight from LAX to Melbourne last week and was a bit dubious as to whether this would be yet another failure. How wrong I was! It turned out to be excellent. For the first time I had an eye cover that really kept out all the light. The nose fitting can be turned up or down to fit your nose, I like it up, my wife likes it down. This is important as the nose is often a source of light intrusion. Not here though. The other good point is the strap. It is broad, has just the right tension and no Velcro clips to fiddle with and grab/damage the covers or anything else. I have put them in my passport container and look forward to light free sleep whenever I need it.&lt;br /&gt;My ears are odd shaped and I could not get the ear plugs to fit at all. I never have! I tried these covers with a pair of noise exclusion headphones however and that was heaven. Great covers and a really well made and handy product.</li>
            <li> Most travel eye masks tend to be either too tight on my head or simply just don&#x27;t contour to my face enough to keep all of the light out. I just flew back from Miami to Boston with my new Davidsbeenhere Eye Mask and I was really impressed with how well I slept with this thing on. Overall, this product is well worth the money if you&#x27;re interested in getting quality sleep on your next flight.</li>
            <li> Buying one of these was well worth it. I hate the eye masks they give you on airplanes, and this one actually allowed me to sleep through my whole flight. The extra padding on the mask helps me fall right to sleep. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for sleeping through a flight!</li>
            <li> The Sleep eye mask is great for getting rest during travel, it works well because it&#x27;s comfortable! It&#x27;s tight enough so that its flush against your face to keep all of the light out....I&#x27;ve been using it every night for sleeping.</li>
            <li> The fabric is soft and it fits snug and stays where you want it. Must have for any long trip.</li>
            <li> As an avid traveler, I can confirm that these earplugs and this eye mask are wonderful! The eye mask fits well and is soft and comfortable. There is an extra, small piece of fabric that fits over the bridge of the nose, to block out even more light. The black fabric of this mask is ultra-soft and comfortable for travel-weary eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earplugs work to block out the sound of airplane engines and noisy travelers. Wearing these is like having your own room on the plane. Now, if David could only do something about the person in the seat behind who repeatedly kicks my seat!</li>
            <li> I bought this sleep mask for my husband, who likes absolute darkness at night. I don&#x27;t. He loves it. The earplugs, however are nothing special. Unless for traveling I can&#x27;t see them being useful.</li>
            <li> I always carry a sleep mask with me when I travel by airplane. The sleep mask in this kit isn&#x27;t anything special. It&#x27;s pretty standard. It didn&#x27;t keep all of the light out of my eyes but it kept enough out that it would work for me (if I&#x27;m tired, I can sleep just about anywhere). Some people may like that the product comes with ear plugs but seeing as how I sleep really deeply, I probably will not use the ear plugs. The ear plugs are just the standard squishy kind.</li>
