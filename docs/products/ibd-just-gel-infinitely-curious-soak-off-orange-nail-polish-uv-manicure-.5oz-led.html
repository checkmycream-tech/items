            <li>I love the color!</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll need to do atleast 3 coats to get a real nice color, but this color stays very well</li>
            <li>it is firmer than the others allowing you to apply very smooth even layers.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you have doubts listen my advice. :)</li>
            <li>and I received many complements on the color.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the brush applicator on this polish..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite spring/summer color.</li>
            <li>I worried that because of the lower end price the quality would not be as good but in my opinion it is the most consistent of all the brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super bright orange and glows in uv/black light.</li>
            <li>It is actually a fun and vibrant color which is great for the spring or summer months.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old daughter chose this color which appeared bright on the website.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t fit my needs</li>
            <li>Cures in 2 minutes with a 32 watt UV light.</li>
            <li>Thanks! :)</li>
            <li>Sephora is my second favorite Gel polish, wish they would offer more colors!</li>
            <li>It would be a great Summer color that would compliment a dark tan.  </li>
            <li>I am wearing it much more frequently than I had originally anticipated</li>
            <li>But for Winter - be prepared for your fingers to be the first thing people notice about you!  </li>
            <li>IBD just gel is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been satisfied with every ibd gel I&#x27;ve purchased so far.</li>
            <li>You can get right up to your cuticle without extra polish globbing up and touching it.</li>
            <li>It is more sheer than creamy color</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend, I got many compliments with this color.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>First time I have tried this brand....</li>
            <li>People are so silly :D</li>
            <li>and I love that IBD sells regular nail polish that matches the gel</li>
            <li>for nails the tips rub off a bit, not exactly a chip but not as nice as gelish and opi brands.</li>
            <li>and is lasting longer so far of any kind I have tried..... Will be repurchased.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it&#x27;s a bit much for just any day wear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 coats covers very well.  </li>
            <li>Shows off a tan really well.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a neon orange, this is very neon orange.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to aply and it really is a long lasting and shiny mail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>But covered decent with two coats.</li>
            <li>Glows in black light.</li>
            <li>Goes on kind of thin, watery.</li>
            <li>The color is a little on the sheer side and required extra coats for full opacity.  </li>
            <li>Polished clumped up and ran all over never buy this product hard to work with its true</li>

            <li> definitely a summer or spring color it does glow under blue lights or black loghts.</li>
            <li> I use 3 coats of this polish when I want a solid finish, and 2 coats if I want a slightly transparent look.</li>
            <li> Having to apply several coats makes the polish thick and then causes it to remove from nail easier and not last as long.</li>
            <li> The bad review on this saying it was clumpy obviously didn&#x27;t understand you have to cure this polish with a light.</li>

            <li> Infinitely Curious is a creamy neon orange.</li>
            <li> Color was brighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Just Gel applies, wears, and removes as well as other UV/LED gel polish brands.</li>
            <li> IBD Gel can be used with led or uv nail dryers and is half the price of other gels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the color of a safety vest that glows in the dark when headlights hit it at night - -</li>
            <li> Only thing I wish is that the polish was a little thicker because two thick coats and you can still see your nail a bit under neath.</li>
            <li> I have used almost every brand of Gel Polish..drug store brands, Sephora, OPI, Gelish, and Shellac to name a few.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of orange but this color exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Product is very thin.</li>

            <li> Product is very thin. Having to apply several coats makes the polish thick and then causes it to remove from nail easier and not last as long.</li>
            <li> Polished clumped up and ran all over never buy this product hard to work with its true you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> IBD just Gel works great and this is so bright and perfect for tanned toes :) If you are looking for a bright fun color this is for you!!!</li>
            <li> I knew this was going to be bright, but it&#x27;s obnoxiously orange. I like it, but it&#x27;s a bit much for just any day wear. It has a tendency to peal up too.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter chose this color which appeared bright on the website.  The color is even brighter in person.  It is actually a fun and vibrant color which is great for the spring or summer months.  I would recommend for anyone who likes bright colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a  preschool teacher, so I have to wash my hands several times, That makes my manicure awful in two days; so I decided to buy this brand of gel nail polish to do it by myself, I&#x27;m very happy beause it&#x27;s very easy to aply and it really is a long lasting and shiny mail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Dont think about it and just buy it!!! I use it with the Royal UV lamp.</li>
            <li> Very bright orange definitely a summer or spring color it does glow under blue lights or black loghts. It is more sheer than creamy color so you&#x27;ll need to do atleast 3 coats to get a real nice color, but this color stays very well I didn&#x27;t chip some of the paint until day 12 and I pick at a lot things(wrappers, cans etc.) Which all can cause chipping and peeling prematurely. Definitely recommend, I got many compliments with this color.</li>
            <li> Love it. Is the same as on the pic. Extremely bright and soo perfect.  Just the way I expected.  If you have doubts listen my advice. :)</li>
            <li> Love the color! Shipping was fast! Would def buy from seller again! Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> Very bright, very cute!</li>
            <li> This color is a bright, bright orange!  It would be a great Summer color that would compliment a dark tan.  But for Winter - be prepared for your fingers to be the first thing people notice about you!  LOL  Say psychedelic orange! It&#x27;s about the color of a safety vest that glows in the dark when headlights hit it at night - - I kid you not!  But I had to give it 5 stars because it is a beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 coats covers very well.  IBD Gel can be used with led or uv nail dryers and is half the price of other gels.</li>
            <li> SO bright!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Glows in black light. Would be great for ravers. ...&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t fit my needs but I can see using for nail art on my niece&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I used this last night to do my nails and I love it! This color is so bright it glows in the LED machine. I bought it so that when I went go clubs my nails would glow under blacklight. Only thing I wish is that the polish was a little thicker because two thick coats and you can still see your nail a bit under neath. Still a gorgeous color though!!</li>
            <li> This is a great gel polish... First time I have tried this brand.... Great color and is lasting longer so far of any kind I have tried..... Will be repurchased.</li>
            <li> I never heard of this brand but it worked well and I received many complements on the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of orange but this color exceeded my expectations.  The color is almost neon and looks great during the warmer months.  I am wearing it much more frequently than I had originally anticipated</li>
            <li> Looks like construction orange. Nice and bright. Tons of compliments. Shows off a tan really well. Product is GREAT!!! Applies well. Cures in 2 minutes with a 32 watt UV light.</li>
            <li> I have used almost every brand of Gel Polish..drug store brands, Sephora, OPI, Gelish, and Shellac to name a few. IBD just gel is by far my favorite. I worried that because of the lower end price the quality would not be as good but in my opinion it is the most consistent of all the brands.

The bad review on this saying it was clumpy obviously didn&#x27;t understand you have to cure this polish with a light. People are so silly :D</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this purchase. I love the color! It&#x27;s super bright orange and glows in uv/black light. Goes on evenly and stays on great. I&#x27;ve been satisfied with every ibd gel I&#x27;ve purchased so far. Great for summer!</li>
            <li> Awesome Bright orange. Perfect for Summer</li>
            <li> Infinitely Curious is a creamy neon orange. The color is a little on the sheer side and required extra coats for full opacity.  IBD Just Gel applies, wears, and removes as well as other UV/LED gel polish brands. This is my go-to brand for gel polish and I love that IBD sells regular nail polish that matches the gel colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cured using Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp.</li>
            <li> Color was brighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a neon orange, this is very neon orange. I didn&#x27;t love it on, but it will be a perfect color once Halloween rolls around.</li>
            <li> Great product!  This works just as well for me as the more expensive gel polishes.  I cannot tell any difference in wear when applied properly.</li>
            <li> Goes on kind of thin, watery. But covered decent with two coats. Could probably use a third coat, but wasn&#x27;t necessary! Would recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> for toes, this polish is great. for nails the tips rub off a bit, not exactly a chip but not as nice as gelish and opi brands.</li>
