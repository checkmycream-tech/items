            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I just re-ordered because to be honest</li>
            <li>I bought it to get rid of my acne, this cleanser works very good, exfoliates my skin very well.</li>
            <li>in any problem areas, but to be honest, I am in love with the wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I still love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the cleanser</li>
            <li>Recently, more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE how this cleanser cleans your skin without the stripping effect.</li>
            <li>I have used a TON of cleansers throughout my lifetime, and most of them strip my skin.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, I use a foundation or a concealer to hide my pimples when I go out, but since this cleanser blends them in with my skin-</li>
            <li>I also find that I need to put on more hand lotion as well.</li>
            <li>its shipping is always free!</li>
            <li>God Bless :)</li>
            <li>In the problem areas I still get breakouts if I don&#x27;t wash with it more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My skin &amp; complexion have NEVER been better.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this has an excellent rating on EWG - skin deep.  </li>
            <li>I still buy this product to use once a week to renew skin and keep skin clean!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been acne free for 2 years now :)</li>
            <li>AHA&#x27;s are more effective on my acne prone skin if I use a lotion or cream, something that has time to soak into my skin and really get to work.</li>
            <li>I can tell this product does a deeper clean on my face then most others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have not come across anything as PURE &amp; EFFECTIVE as this line of products.</li>
            <li>A free sample of the BHA serum was including with shipment, which I have been using as a spot treatment, before moisturizing; it seems to be working well.</li>
            <li>I hope that we all become more conscious of toxins in our skin care, &amp; I&#x27;m very thankful to EWG for creating a great database.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing, my face looks smooth and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Still worth it, forces me to moisturize and my skin is thanking me!</li>
            <li>skin is a million times better, I almost look pretty.</li>
            <li>Very nice, good clean ingredients, no strong smell, seems to leave skin gentle cleaned.</li>
            <li>Not much scent to speak of, just lots of great cleansing.  </li>
            <li>The gentle you wash/treat your face, your skin will reacts better.</li>
            <li>that are not half as effective.</li>
            <li>This is the best product ever and the only facial wash I will ever use!</li>
            <li>Hope this helped &amp; may you find success in finding the right answers on your skin care needs!</li>
            <li>Rubs on clear and then very lightly lathers before you rinse.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that all the ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li>They are not that red anymore and kind of sink into my skin-</li>
            <li>Well I bought this wash, hoping that because it was natural it might be better.</li>
            <li>but worth the results</li>
            <li>She has been using it a few weeks now and it has helped clean it up some, hopefully with more time it will get even better.</li>
            <li>It delivers just the right amount of glycolic acid</li>
            <li>so much I went ahead and ordered the rest of the set (daily enzyme peel, balancing mist and sea kelp moisturizer) and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>After a week or so you will be surprised at the huge difference it makes.</li>
            <li>I love the product and even bought a second bottle.  </li>
            <li>and if you get too much sun exposure w.o using sunblock your skin will suffer!</li>
            <li>All i can say it does work when you use it consistently and use the regime of the book.</li>
            <li>First I start off by lathering the product in my palm, then massaging it in circles on my cheeks, then I do it on my nose, forehead, and finish up my whole face.</li>
            <li>So far so good, even ordered other products that go with it.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t that great, but that hardly matters when it works so well!</li>
            <li>This face wash really helped.  </li>
            <li>This AHA wash is very drying, so you MUST moisturize after.</li>
            <li>cause if you use it too much</li>
            <li>my situation got intense after a dosage increase.</li>
            <li>The cleanser was very gentle on my skin and very soft.</li>
            <li>I would love to try their other products!</li>
            <li>With the AHA facial wash, along with the rest of the acne series (daily enzyme peel, elderberry mist, &amp; BHA serum), I have been able to suppress my outbreaks.  </li>
            <li>Experienced a slight flareup of acne, however, I realize this is normal with a change in products, and the blemishes are not serious as previously.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this is due to the AHA&#x27;s or what, but my color just isn&#x27;t the best (especially compared to after using their Bio-active cleanser).</li>
            <li>This was a whim purchase, as I normally have to smell a beauty product before buying.</li>
            <li>This is very drying, not suitable for adult acne, you will break out more.</li>
            <li>Brightens the complexion, clears pores, and seems to be slightly beginning to improve fine lines.</li>
            <li>I sent this face wash back after the first wash.  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of the so called &amp;#34;plaque build-up&amp;#34; in your pores and will make your skin so soft and balanced.  </li>
            <li>As natural as I wanna go, but essentials oils also breaking me out.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s natural with</li>
            <li>And it truly is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>All natural and does the job.</li>
            <li>Note that if you use near the eyes - do not get too close - the more delicate skin may puff up for a day or two and have some roughness until the skin rebuilds -</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product because of its simple ingredients, but it left my skin extremely dry and red.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light blue gel cleanser that has a slight tingle to it (which means its working).</li>
            <li>I have noticed my 52 yr old skin is much clearer without being too dry.</li>
            <li>I used this product every night for a few weeks, and I continued to break out on top of developing extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;AHA started to make my skin super sensitive and was just to harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I also use tea tree oil after the wash every single night religiously, pure undiluted Tea Tree oil  </li>
            <li>I suffer from severe acne but at the same time have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After the use of this product, I continue with my Daily Botanical Enzyme Peel also from Be Natural Organics for exfoliation of my skin.</li>
            <li>and then it goes down just to come back right</li>
            <li>I think it smells great and its not something I have gotten sick of yet.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, however this cleanser is much too harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t treat adult acne like teen acne, different!</li>
            <li>so my face does not dry out or become irritated, yet it dissolves dirt and opens pores.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly sticky but soaks in fast.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a night lotion for trouble spots (as the glycolic moisturizers currently on the market are full of other chems I want to avoid).</li>

            <li> Yes to, other natural products and nothing.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product a long time ago and should have updated it a while back.</li>

            <li> I wash my face with it 2 times a day, no matter how tired I am, you do need to be constant with it, and after 2-3 days you can see the first results.</li>
            <li> I am now currently using once a week with my other cleaner, to help lighten sun damage on my skin.</li>
            <li> Compared to other Glycolic Acid products this is the cheapest you will find that will actually do the job for you!</li>
            <li> Compared to other Glycolic Acid products this is the cheapest you will find that will actually do the job for you!</li>
            <li> I have tried all sort of different regimens and products with little to no improvement.</li>
            <li> Just a little squirt on your facial brush</li>
            <li> and this product has definitely help out to combat making it dissapear at least 80%, only using the wash and nothing else!</li>
            <li> and I attribute them partially to this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy the burning sensation it left on my face during cleansing.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand because they have the 10 % glycolic but none of the chemical junk other brands add in.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from a breakout due to a change in medication.  </li>
            <li> I reduced my use to every other day and that has corrected the problem.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I chose this brand because they have the 10 % glycolic but none of the chemical junk other brands add in. It works great as a wash, very mildly scented. Rubs on clear and then very lightly lathers before you rinse. I also use it as a night lotion for trouble spots (as the glycolic moisturizers currently on the market are full of other chems I want to avoid). It is slightly sticky but soaks in fast. I am also using it to fade a sun spot on my collar bone and it works. Brightens the complexion, clears pores, and seems to be slightly beginning to improve fine lines. Note that if you use near the eyes - do not get too close - the more delicate skin may puff up for a day or two and have some roughness until the skin rebuilds - don&#x27;t try it there if you have a big event the next day...My skin has now adjusted and I don&#x27;t get that reaction anymore, just the benefits. This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I was suffering from a breakout due to a change in medication.  This face wash really helped.  It dried up the breakout, but also caused some pretty dry skin.  I reduced my use to every other day and that has corrected the problem.  I love the product and even bought a second bottle.  Follow up with a good moisturizer and you should not have any problems.The smell isn&#x27;t that great, but that hardly matters when it works so well! I would love to try their other products!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product because of its simple ingredients, but it left my skin extremely dry and red.  I suffer from severe acne but at the same time have very sensitive skin.  I used this product every night for a few weeks, and I continued to break out on top of developing extremely dry skin.  I also have eczema on my hands and this product just worsened the eczema, something that I have never had happen with any face wash.  The redness on my face and eczema spots improved a few days after I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> I was searching for product for my daughters skin that would help with her acne. Read reviews on product and decided to give it a try.  So far so good, even ordered other products that go with it. She has been using it a few weeks now and it has helped clean it up some, hopefully with more time it will get even better.</li>
            <li> Used one time and completely dried out my skin. I am now currently using once a week with my other cleaner, to help lighten sun damage on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is cleanser is amazing!  It delivers just the right amount of glycolic acid so my face does not dry out or become irritated, yet it dissolves dirt and opens pores.  It makes my skin smoother and feel great.  I also love the fact that all the ingredients are natural.  I will definitely purchase this face wash again.</li>
            <li> This was a whim purchase, as I normally have to smell a beauty product before buying. I was impressed at first use. It&#x27;s a light blue gel cleanser that has a slight tingle to it (which means its working). I think it smells great and its not something I have gotten sick of yet. The fact that the ingredient list is minimalist and organic is icing on the cake. I was using Neutrogena 2% salicylic acid wash before this and now I will never go back. The reason why I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because my face tends to look a little blotchy after using. Not sure if this is due to the AHA&#x27;s or what, but my color just isn&#x27;t the best (especially compared to after using their Bio-active cleanser). AHA&#x27;s are more effective on my acne prone skin if I use a lotion or cream, something that has time to soak into my skin and really get to work. Nevertheless, I still love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I can tell this product does a deeper clean on my face then most others I have tried. I&#x27;ve been happy so far and it&#x27;s a good value. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I bought this as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; just because I needed a cleanser. It stayed in my cabinet for weeks until another cleanser ran out and I started back on Obaji. I used this cleanser (instead of the Objai cleanser) with the O regimen and it is amazing. I can see it working on my skin and feel it tingling my skin. I have been getting some compliments lately and I attribute them partially to this cleanser.Will definitely order again and again! I have tried other AHA&#x27;s that are not half as effective. This is excellent.</li>
            <li> Very nice, good clean ingredients, no strong smell, seems to leave skin gentle cleaned.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product, after one week all my cysts and pimples went away and never came back. It gets rid of the so called &amp;#34;plaque build-up&amp;#34; in your pores and will make your skin so soft and balanced.  A+  I use this product once a day at night time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial cleanser for several weeks and I am very pleased with the results. I have noticed my 52 yr old skin is much clearer without being too dry. I enjoyed the cleanser so much I went ahead and ordered the rest of the set (daily enzyme peel, balancing mist and sea kelp moisturizer) and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Have been using this face wash 2x/day for a little over one week. Noticed results almost immediately - reduction in pore size, clearer pores, smoother skin.  Recently, more even skin tone.  Experienced a slight flareup of acne, however, I realize this is normal with a change in products, and the blemishes are not serious as previously.  A free sample of the BHA serum was including with shipment, which I have been using as a spot treatment, before moisturizing; it seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I bought it to get rid of my acne, this cleanser works very good, exfoliates my skin very well. I started getting acne all over my back and this product has definitely help out to combat making it dissapear at least 80%, only using the wash and nothing else!</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever and the only facial wash I will ever use! It has a great smell and the ingredients are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> This is very drying, not suitable for adult acne, you will break out more. I use it as a hand soap now and also drying out my hands. I won&#x27;t put it in a trash, but I will still use it as a hand soap every other days. I&#x27;m 34 and still breaking out due to hormonal and adrenal fatigue (insomnia). You have to be very careful with adult acne. The gentle you wash/treat your face, your skin will reacts better. You can&#x27;t treat adult acne like teen acne, different! As natural as I wanna go, but essentials oils also breaking me out. So, watch out acne prone skin, don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s natural with essentials oils won&#x27;t break you out. The acne might not show up 2  or 3 months later. On their ingredients, they did not state what&#x27;s the essentials oils, warning!!! If you have acne, I suggest you to look up on Dr James Fulton book and VIVANT skincare. I learnt that my skin needs to be treated with chemical ingredients still.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE how this cleanser cleans your skin without the stripping effect. I have used a TON of cleansers throughout my lifetime, and most of them strip my skin. This one on the other hand does not, which is an added bonus to its other effects it has on my skin! First I start off by lathering the product in my palm, then massaging it in circles on my cheeks, then I do it on my nose, forehead, and finish up my whole face. The cleanser was very gentle on my skin and very soft. I have oily skin and am prone to pimples and breakouts often. My pimples are often red, and what I noticed after I rinsed out the product is that they are calmer. They are not that red anymore and kind of sink into my skin- which therefore makes them less noticeable. After the use of this product, I continue with my Daily Botanical Enzyme Peel also from Be Natural Organics for exfoliation of my skin. That exfoliator does a great job of canceling out my blackheads on my nose. Most of the time, I use a foundation or a concealer to hide my pimples when I go out, but since this cleanser blends them in with my skin- I did not have to. Therefore, this cleanser is actually saving me money! I hope that after a couple uses of it, my pimples will go away for a while! Compared to other Glycolic Acid products this is the cheapest you will find that will actually do the job for you!</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing!! I have had hormonal acne since puberty that only ever went away with birth control pills. Now that I am off the pills the acne has returned! I have tried all sort of different regimens and products with little to no improvement. This stuff started working in 12 hours! I immediately noticed the bumps on my forehead going away and slowly saw the scars from previous pimples healing. Only 4 days in and my skin is completely different! I use this wash morning and night and follow with an organic facial moisturizer. This AHA wash is very drying, so you MUST moisturize after. I also find that I need to put on more hand lotion as well. Still worth it, forces me to moisturize and my skin is thanking me! LOVE!</li>
            <li> Great product perfect transaction</li>
            <li> Just a little squirt on your facial brush and you&#x27;re well on your way to creamy, sudsy heaven!  Not much scent to speak of, just lots of great cleansing.  After rinsing, my face looks smooth and squeaky clean.  I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Compared to other Glycolic Acid products this is the cheapest you will find that will actually do the job for you! I suffered from acne after my pregnancy with my son ...it was so bad I didn&#x27;t even want to leave the house!! I did&#x27;nt have money to pay for a dermetologist so I did some research and I bought a book called \\&quot;Acne Cures\\&quot; btw this book REALY WORKS I&#x27;ve been acne free for 2 years now :) but one of the products needed is Glycolic Acid 10%! And this was the product I ended up buying plus its shipping is always free! I still buy this product to use once a week to renew skin and keep skin clean! I recommend this product for those who suffer from acne but you MUST KNOW how to use it cause if you use it too much and if you get too much sun exposure w.o using sunblock your skin will suffer! I recommend the book if you have skin problems to better educate yourself on this! Hope this helped &amp; may you find success in finding the right answers on your skin care needs! God Bless :)</li>
            <li> This is a miracle in a bottle. I have a connective tissue disorder ( Lupus and other illnesses), my medications like&lt;br /&gt;Prednisone and others make me break out terribly, and I am not talking adolescent acne, I mean awful to God cystic like acne which grows inside my skin for weeks and then it goes down just to come back right away.&lt;br /&gt;Well my situation got intense after a dosage increase. I was desperate, so I bought Neutrogena, Clear Skin, Yes to, other natural products and nothing. I then bought myself a 70% Glycolic Acid which brought out the ugliest deepest acne, and peeled it but I kept breaking out, because nothing was treating the problem. Well I bought this wash, hoping that because it was natural it might be better. Well, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a million times better, I almost look pretty. My pores shrank a lot in the non-problem areas. In the problem areas I still get breakouts if I don&#x27;t wash with it more than 2 days.  I use the glycolic peel to get rid of the awful breakouts when I get some of the huge ones, along with the wash to make sure they go away. I also use tea tree oil after the wash every single night religiously, pure undiluted Tea Tree oil  in any problem areas, but to be honest, I am in love with the wash.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit harsh, yes, but if you have awful problematic skin, then this is your product. I love it and I just re-ordered because to be honest, I can&#x27;t imagine having the awful breakouts all over again. I wash my face with it 2 times a day, no matter how tired I am, you do need to be constant with it, and after 2-3 days you can see the first results. After a week or so you will be surprised at the huge difference it makes. Plus, it smells delicious, I don&#x27;t know exactly which plant it is , but it smells great!. And it truly is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Exellent product.  I have had monthly acne outbreaks over the years.  With the AHA facial wash, along with the rest of the acne series (daily enzyme peel, elderberry mist, &amp; BHA serum), I have been able to suppress my outbreaks.  My skin &amp; complexion have NEVER been better.  I went to a 20 year reunion, where my friends said that I was the only one who looked 10 years YOUNGER!  I love the fact that this has an excellent rating on EWG - skin deep.  I hope that we all become more conscious of toxins in our skin care, &amp; I&#x27;m very thankful to EWG for creating a great database.  I have been using this product line now for ~ 4 months.  I have not come across anything as PURE &amp; EFFECTIVE as this line of products.</li>
            <li> I got this and used it accordingly to the The Acne Cure Book by Terry J. Dubro and, Brenda D. Adderly. All i can say it does work when you use it consistently and use the regime of the book. it is difficult to follow though but worth the results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;AHA started to make my skin super sensitive and was just to harsh on my skin. I stopped using this product a long time ago and should have updated it a while back. My apologie.</li>
            <li> I like that it seems to keep my acne down but it does dry my skin out a little but since you need to use moisturizer anyway that is not a problem for me. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this!  All natural and does the job.</li>
            <li> I sent this face wash back after the first wash.  I do not have sensitive skin, however this cleanser is much too harsh on my skin.  I did not enjoy the burning sensation it left on my face during cleansing.</li>
