            <li>The liquid version works great when you apply it every day.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>One thing that the package insert says is that THE ROLL ON HAS A HIGHER STRENGTH INGREDIENT IN IT!!!!!</li>
            <li>and honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the dryness of my pits!</li>
            <li>Good value on Amazon</li>
            <li>Works fairly descent under my prosthetic leg.</li>
            <li>Product is good.</li>
            <li>I did that once or twice, but the good news is that after washing the discoloration went away.  </li>
            <li>We ordered this thinking it would be a good replacement.  </li>
            <li>Love it..!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tricky, kind of like a used car</li>
            <li>I also purchased the AM stick and it smells really nice for daytime use.</li>
            <li>This is nice as a deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, THE BEST anti-perspirant that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>works good but wish they would make a clear kind!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never sweat again. :)</li>
            <li>Love this product introduced to me by my podiatrist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been clinically told I have hyperhydrosis, but it sure feels like I do.  </li>
            <li>and they feel it works better, as well.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes in a 4-pack.</li>
            <li>Buying the 4-pack online, better deal.  </li>
            <li>I love this more then the roll on</li>
            <li>Oh and make sure you do have another deodorant to put on in the morning, for &amp;#34;good smelling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I thought for sure all was loss until I stumbled upon this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best deodorant in the market, and I have tried all.</li>
            <li>job if you don&#x27;t sweat much during the day, but as soon as you spend time in the gym or do a lot of rigorous activity, it won&#x27;t be very effective.</li>
            <li>If I used 8 or so to cover my whole pit, it was more effective, but the itching was too severe then to make it usable</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who needs prescription strength anti-perspirant in the first place buy the roll-on instead.</li>
            <li>then I am fine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how happy I would be with it until I&#x27;d been using it for over a month, since it didn&#x27;t seem to be working for a long time.</li>
            <li>This stick works great, months later!</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Glad that I was able to find this on Amazon for much cheaper than CVS...</li>
            <li>This is a nice filler if you run out of the liquid roll on, but if you just use the solid, it is not as effective as an anti-perspirant as the liquid version.  </li>
            <li>Most of the store-bought deodorants (Right Guard, Degree, etc) do an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Well worth it though!</li>
            <li>My son needed more Drysol as he was getting married and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune going to the doctor just for a prescription for Drysol.  </li>
            <li>I find the solid is best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better than Certain Dri -- and I know.</li>
            <li>It is also alot more gentle than the roll on which irritated my skin</li>
            <li>After years of trying different deodorants/antiperspirants, I have finally found the perfect combination to manage my embarrassing sweaty armpits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>they also make a super absorbent foot powder and a foot treatment system for those of us who suffer from ecessive sweating of the feet...</li>
            <li>I buy in the 4-pack and consider myself lucky.</li>
            <li>He had used a handful of other ones and had no idea there was something more effective that could help him.</li>
            <li>Works the very first time you use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i cannot say enough good about these products and their manufacturer - they help make life a lot easier for folks like me who perspire waaaay too much!</li>
            <li>Hope others find some success with this too.</li>
            <li>works incredibly well no more sweat stain!</li>
            <li>I tried Certain Dri Roll-On, but found just 1-2 strokes wasn&#x27;t effective enough for me.</li>
            <li>This approach paired up with a Thompson Tee (new company that makes t-shirts with sew-in sweat guards under the armpits that are WAY more comfortable than any other sweat guards I have used (tried a bunch) - gotta search it on Google) for those more intense circumstances where my hyperhidrosis may act up, has been a bullet proof solution for me.</li>
            <li>I tried the roll-on kind of this brand, applied at night only, but it tingled &amp; burned too much.</li>
            <li>My husband and son love this solid vesion of Certain-Dri Anti-Perspirant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to wear shirts that I couldn&#x27;t even consider earlier.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, use it every night.</li>
            <li>It definitely meets my expectations, but make sure you do apply it at night.  </li>
            <li>I first bought the liquid</li>
            <li>Most commercial brands - stick, roll-on or spray (who uses spray anymore, anyway???)</li>
            <li>- anyway, most of them never last through the end of the day, let alone for two or three days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After receiving this product and used the first night it worked.</li>
            <li>My day consist of zumba first thing in the morning, running errands</li>
            <li>This product does exactly as it states without burning like the liquid type of this brand.  </li>
            <li>I tried many different varieties, including those made for men.  </li>
            <li>Recently my body decided it doesn&#x27;t want to not stink when I&#x27;m wearing a tank top.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the solid, not the roll on, which is like acid.  </li>
            <li>It was better than regular over the counter stuff but can&#x27;t be compared to the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all of the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; hyped products, but only spent more money on products that weren&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li>Used it since then &amp; no more sweating feet &amp; makes my feet smell good.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a number of years and am always impressed at how dry I stay, even after spending time at the gym or walking through the city in a full suit dragging a suitcase behind me.</li>
            <li>Though I did try and make sure I was totally dry, there were a couple of times where I missed a spot and the product did burn my underarms.  </li>
            <li>Certain Dri does.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to do that since I started using Certain Dri</li>
            <li>For me it doesnt work as well as roll-on certain dri.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the liquid product every other night without problem, but the solid version isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>cause my pits itched too much).</li>
            <li>but this really works.  </li>
            <li>The roll on version of this is very Drying</li>
            <li>really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the rollon that seems to be the only product available in stores.</li>
            <li>He sweats so much during the night, plus playing sports.</li>
            <li>anti perspirant REALLY does what it says...</li>
            <li>company makes an AM antiperspirant for those who like putting on their deodorant/antiperspirant in the mornings, but there&#x27;s no difference, really.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered there are really two classes of deodorants/</li>
            <li>I tried all the most expensive and popular  brands on the market, none of them worked.  </li>
            <li>Also, no need to use it everyday for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I purchased a 4 pack of this solid and received a good deal , alas it was not such a good thing.</li>
            <li>As I started getting older my body chemistry changed, my deodorants stopped working for me.  </li>
            <li>This one was recommended highly by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, it was so relieving to enjoy a day without wet underarms and am looking forward to being normal again...</li>
            <li>it also makes a \\&quot;freshener\\&quot; product, for thosse who want a fresh smell with a solid stick...</li>
            <li>, I initially tried the roll-on and was told by my doctor&#x27;s nurse to make sure that my underarms were completely dry before applying or this product would &amp;#34;burn.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>product really works, especially when paired with certain dri AM.</li>
            <li>and he would have to live with it.</li>
            <li>I like Certain Dri deodorant in general, but I prefer stick deodorants.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me be prepared to put lotion just in case of irritation!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Only works if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li>I have overactive sweat glands and it forces me to always wear dark clothing because if I wear anything light you better believe at least one person will point out that I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li>in combination with the Certain Dri Solid.</li>
            <li>the Certain Dri Solid provides a bit of relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use certain dri (solid) nightly before bed.</li>
            <li>Gotta be Certain Dri solid!</li>
            <li>Certain Dri is the only anti-perspirant that works for me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all the deodorants out there - and being a woman, I need the clear ones when I&#x27;m wearing a tank.</li>
            <li>And none of the clear ones work for me.</li>
            <li>This combination is working for me, sometimes I&#x27;m still surprised when I lift my arm and find no swamp pit.</li>
            <li>I developed under arm odor problem no matter what brand I used.</li>
            <li>I switched to Tom&#x27;s Natural and that worked for awhile, but, eventually failed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has 100% fixed everything.</li>
            <li>Before bed, I use 2-4 strokes of the Certain Dri Roll-On, then leave it for just a bit to dry, and then use 4-6 swipes of the Certain Dri Solid anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep him pretty dry, he no longer smells like he live in a locker room...</li>
            <li>I am an axillary hyperhidrosis sufferer (some excessive sweating of the pits) and in a quest for some relief tried almost all types of anti-perspirant available.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase the roll on, but I thought I&#x27;d give the solid a try this time around.</li>
            <li>Reached a strange time in my life where normal Anti Perspirant stopped working.</li>
            <li>So I gave up on Certain Dri Roll-On and tried other approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>still no relief on other approaches, I came back to Certain Dri Roll-On, BUT</li>
            <li>but it really works and keeps me dry all day long.</li>
            <li>The trick is to put the roll-on first and lay down with your arms back that way it can seep into your pores and after a couple of minutes put the solid on.</li>

            <li> I first bought the liquid</li>
            <li> Most commercial brands - stick, roll-on or spray (who uses spray anymore, anyway???)</li>
            <li> - anyway, most of them never last through the end of the day, let alone for two or three days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After receiving this product and used the first night it worked.</li>
            <li> My day consist of zumba first thing in the morning, running errands</li>
            <li> This product does exactly as it states without burning like the liquid type of this brand.  </li>
            <li> I tried many different varieties, including those made for men.  </li>
            <li> Recently my body decided it doesn&#x27;t want to not stink when I&#x27;m wearing a tank top.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get the solid, not the roll on, which is like acid.  </li>
            <li> It was better than regular over the counter stuff but can&#x27;t be compared to the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; hyped products, but only spent more money on products that weren&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li> Used it since then &amp; no more sweating feet &amp; makes my feet smell good.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a number of years and am always impressed at how dry I stay, even after spending time at the gym or walking through the city in a full suit dragging a suitcase behind me.</li>
            <li> Though I did try and make sure I was totally dry, there were a couple of times where I missed a spot and the product did burn my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Certain Dri does.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to do that since I started using Certain Dri</li>
            <li> For me it doesnt work as well as roll-on certain dri.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the liquid product every other night without problem, but the solid version isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> cause my pits itched too much).</li>
            <li> but this really works.  </li>
            <li> The roll on version of this is very Drying</li>
            <li> really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like the rollon that seems to be the only product available in stores.</li>
            <li> He sweats so much during the night, plus playing sports.</li>
            <li> anti perspirant REALLY does what it says...</li>
            <li> company makes an AM antiperspirant for those who like putting on their deodorant/antiperspirant in the mornings, but there&#x27;s no difference, really.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered there are really two classes of deodorants/</li>
            <li> I tried all the most expensive and popular  brands on the market, none of them worked.  </li>
            <li> Also, no need to use it everyday for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased a 4 pack of this solid and received a good deal , alas it was not such a good thing.</li>
            <li> As I started getting older my body chemistry changed, my deodorants stopped working for me.  </li>
            <li> This one was recommended highly by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , it was so relieving to enjoy a day without wet underarms and am looking forward to being normal again...</li>
            <li> it also makes a \\&quot;freshener\\&quot; product, for thosse who want a fresh smell with a solid stick...</li>
            <li> , I initially tried the roll-on and was told by my doctor&#x27;s nurse to make sure that my underarms were completely dry before applying or this product would &amp;#34;burn.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> product really works, especially when paired with certain dri AM.</li>
            <li> and he would have to live with it.</li>
            <li> I like Certain Dri deodorant in general, but I prefer stick deodorants.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me be prepared to put lotion just in case of irritation!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Only works if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I have overactive sweat glands and it forces me to always wear dark clothing because if I wear anything light you better believe at least one person will point out that I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li> in combination with the Certain Dri Solid.</li>
            <li> the Certain Dri Solid provides a bit of relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use certain dri (solid) nightly before bed.</li>
            <li> Gotta be Certain Dri solid!</li>
            <li> Certain Dri is the only anti-perspirant that works for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the deodorants out there - and being a woman, I need the clear ones when I&#x27;m wearing a tank.</li>
            <li> And none of the clear ones work for me.</li>
            <li> This combination is working for me, sometimes I&#x27;m still surprised when I lift my arm and find no swamp pit.</li>
            <li> I developed under arm odor problem no matter what brand I used.</li>
            <li> I switched to Tom&#x27;s Natural and that worked for awhile, but, eventually failed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has 100% fixed everything.</li>
            <li> Before bed, I use 2-4 strokes of the Certain Dri Roll-On, then leave it for just a bit to dry, and then use 4-6 swipes of the Certain Dri Solid anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep him pretty dry, he no longer smells like he live in a locker room...</li>
            <li> I am an axillary hyperhidrosis sufferer (some excessive sweating of the pits) and in a quest for some relief tried almost all types of anti-perspirant available.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the roll on, but I thought I&#x27;d give the solid a try this time around.</li>
            <li> Reached a strange time in my life where normal Anti Perspirant stopped working.</li>
            <li> So I gave up on Certain Dri Roll-On and tried other approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> still no relief on other approaches, I came back to Certain Dri Roll-On, BUT</li>
            <li> but it really works and keeps me dry all day long.</li>
            <li> The trick is to put the roll-on first and lay down with your arms back that way it can seep into your pores and after a couple of minutes put the solid on.</li>
            <li> The liquids make me break out and cause nasty rashes.. the solid, on the other hand, is comfortable and effective.  </li>
            <li> armpits are FINALLY dry (85-90% reduced or more) after having tried at least 10 other anti-perspirant options (including prescription ones) with no success.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t dry totally if you put it on in the morning, and then it can get on your clothes, which will discolor them.  </li>
            <li> Works well, and I actually like that I still sweat (just a normal amount instead of excessively)</li>
            <li> He sweats excessively and this really helps keep him dry.</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time finding an Anti Perspirant that really works well.  </li>
            <li> The solid is harder to find than the roll-on...</li>
            <li> My child has hyperhidrosis and she has used the roll on for a while , but she wanted to try the solid because the roll on was to wet.</li>
            <li> Completely stops the sweating in just a few days of using it.  </li>
            <li> The only other allergy I&#x27;ve had is to scented detergent.</li>
            <li> Keeps them dry.  </li>
            <li> The roll on you have to wait until your pits dry after rolling it on.</li>
            <li> Goes on dry.</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly powerful enough to combat my raging sweat glands.  </li>
            <li> This solid would break off and go everywhere , what a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I feel all that good about pasting whatever the heck chemical is in this onto my pits, but I&#x27;m too sick of sweat dripping from my armpits to care anymore.</li>
            <li> A little while later I started developing a rash.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This solved all my problems related to excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> , the only small issue I have found, it&#x27;s that I still sweat just a bit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the local department stores only carry the roll-on types, and Walgreens was out of the solid bar the other day (</li>
            <li> Have tried other clinical strength deodorants</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of deodorants and other anti-perspirants out there, including the supposedly ironclad &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; ones, and none of them works as well as this.</li>
            <li> I even bought one for my neighbor, which is weird, but shows how crazy good it works.</li>
            <li> Second, give it at least a month, if not two, for it to fully work.</li>
            <li> really, just uncomfortable at all...</li>
            <li> other product has worked even a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It may irritate your skin slightly.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that will work without a prescription, seriously.</li>
            <li> Half the battle is remembering to put it on at night.</li>
            <li> I would sweat when I was still, hot, or cold.</li>
            <li> I was going to wear because I would be a sweaty mess by the time I got to work.</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m too cold, too hot, nervous, anxious....</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I have found this product few years ago when at menopause</li>
            <li> Not cute.  </li>
            <li> I complained about sweating feet &amp; he prescribed this product.  </li>
            <li> At least I haven&#x27;t found anything cheaper.</li>
            <li> Has to be the solid bar though, the roll-on makes my underarms itch so bad</li>
            <li> and I just sweat like crazy and have wet underarms</li>
            <li> I was a disgusting sweaty mess for the last 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who suffers from some form of hyperhydrosis.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s uncomfortable!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, the product seemed to be working.</li>
            <li> So awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not nearly powerful enough to combat my raging sweat glands.  If you&#x27;re the kind of person who needs prescription strength anti-perspirant in the first place buy the roll-on instead.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never sweat again. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product introduced to me by my podiatrist.  I complained about sweating feet &amp; he prescribed this product.  Used it since then &amp; no more sweating feet &amp; makes my feet smell good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been clinically told I have hyperhydrosis, but it sure feels like I do.  Armpit sweat in the summer, check.  Armpit sweat in the winter, check.  Armpit sweat while driving my car or typing at the computer, check.  I&#x27;m not sure I feel all that good about pasting whatever the heck chemical is in this onto my pits, but I&#x27;m too sick of sweat dripping from my armpits to care anymore.</li>
            <li> Great product if you sweat uncontrollably.  I use it in conjunction with the morning product as well, and it controls my sweat like nothing else has before.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; hyped products, but only spent more money on products that weren&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li> My husband and son love this solid vesion of Certain-Dri Anti-Perspirant. They said it doesn&#x27;t sting like the liquid product does and they feel it works better, as well. If you get it on your clothing, it does wash off in the laundry.</li>
            <li> It works! My husband sweats a lot. I don&#x27;t sweat like he does so I just thought that was the way it was and he would have to live with it. I read online about this product and purchased it. He used it and said OMG this is the best deodorant I have ever used. He had no idea there was a product that could actually help him. He had used a handful of other ones and had no idea there was something more effective that could help him.</li>
            <li> I like Certain Dri deodorant in general, but I prefer stick deodorants. This one works perfectly. And I like that it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
            <li> This product works, but you have to use it every night. It may irritate your skin slightly. I have found if it does irritate, I just skip a day then I am fine. Love that it comes in a 4-pack.</li>
            <li> I am an axillary hyperhidrosis sufferer (some excessive sweating of the pits) and in a quest for some relief tried almost all types of anti-perspirant available. I tried Certain Dri Roll-On, but found just 1-2 strokes wasn&#x27;t effective enough for me. If I used 8 or so to cover my whole pit, it was more effective, but the itching was too severe then to make it usable (basically couldn&#x27;t fall asleep cause my pits itched too much). So I gave up on Certain Dri Roll-On and tried other approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With still no relief on other approaches, I came back to Certain Dri Roll-On, BUT in combination with the Certain Dri Solid. Before bed, I use 2-4 strokes of the Certain Dri Roll-On, then leave it for just a bit to dry, and then use 4-6 swipes of the Certain Dri Solid anti-perspirant. With only 2-4 strokes of the Roll-On it&#x27;s not as itchy, and even if it is a bit, I find the Certain Dri Solid provides a bit of relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My armpits are FINALLY dry (85-90% reduced or more) after having tried at least 10 other anti-perspirant options (including prescription ones) with no success. This approach paired up with a Thompson Tee (new company that makes t-shirts with sew-in sweat guards under the armpits that are WAY more comfortable than any other sweat guards I have used (tried a bunch) - gotta search it on Google) for those more intense circumstances where my hyperhidrosis may act up, has been a bullet proof solution for me. Hope others find some success with this too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it but this really works.  I&#x27;m able to wear shirts that I couldn&#x27;t even consider earlier.  I use this at night as directed and I use the roll on one night a week,  but be careful with the roll on if you have sensitive skin.  Then in the morning I use the AM roll on.  This combination is working for me, sometimes I&#x27;m still surprised when I lift my arm and find no swamp pit. Lol</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with excess sweating.  I have gone to the doctors and haven&#x27;t found anything to cure it.  Certain Dri does.  I can only use the solid but it really works and keeps me dry all day long.</li>
            <li> Works for me....best product I have found to cure wettness</li>
            <li> works incredibly well no more sweat stain! Great value, I think this is probably the cheapest per ounce you can get. At least I haven&#x27;t found anything cheaper.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve struggled finding a product that will eliminate underarm odor, this is the product for you. It works even when you stop using it for a couple of days. The solid is harder to find than the roll-on...I find the solid is best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different deodorants/antiperspirants, I have finally found the perfect combination to manage my embarrassing sweaty armpits.&lt;br /&gt;I use certain dri (solid) nightly before bed. For me it is necessary to use the solid rather than the roll on. The roll on burns and irritates my skin whereas the solid does not do that.&lt;br /&gt;This product really works, especially when paired with certain dri AM.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY deodorant that WORKS for me. As I started getting older my body chemistry changed, my deodorants stopped working for me.  I tried all the most expensive and popular  brands on the market, none of them worked.  Glad that I was able to find this on Amazon for much cheaper than CVS...</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that will work without a prescription, seriously. I have overactive sweat glands and it forces me to always wear dark clothing because if I wear anything light you better believe at least one person will point out that I&#x27;m sweating. It&#x27;s a bit tricky, kind of like a used car but with the solid combined with the roll-on I figured it out. The trick is to put the roll-on first and lay down with your arms back that way it can seep into your pores and after a couple of minutes put the solid on. If you have sensitive skin like me be prepared to put lotion just in case of irritation! It sounds like a lot of effort but when you have tried everything and are leaning towards botox this seems like no effort, hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This solved all my problems related to excessive sweating. A must have for anyone who suffers from some form of hyperhydrosis. Works the very first time you use it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this. He sweats excessively and this really helps keep him dry. There are different ones for the night and morning time and when he uses them faithfully he notices results.</li>
            <li> The roll on version of this is very Drying so I was advised to try the &amp;#34;milder&amp;#34; solid. Just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is the brand I&#x27;ll wear.</li>
            <li> Works well, and I actually like that I still sweat (just a normal amount instead of excessively) so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m totally screwing up my body chemistry</li>
            <li> I bought this product to deal with the sweltering DC summer. I am a sweater. After about a week of use, the pits were noticeably dryer. A little while later I started developing a rash. The only other allergy I&#x27;ve had is to scented detergent.It&#x27;s too bad, the product seemed to be working.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Works great. Good value on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is the only deo I can use.  Great price, fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I tried, and it works perfect!, the only small issue I have found, it&#x27;s that I still sweat just a bit. Which is unconfortable to me, but comparing with the rainy sweat I use to have, It does stop excesive sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works fairly descent under my prosthetic leg.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I have found this product few years ago when at menopause I developed under arm odor problem no matter what brand I used. This product saved me.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Has to be the solid bar though, the roll-on makes my underarms itch so bad it&#x27;s uncomfortable!  Unfortunately, the local department stores only carry the roll-on types, and Walgreens was out of the solid bar the other day (and they charge over $8 for one!).  Buying the 4-pack online, better deal.  Have tried other clinical strength deodorants and they just do not work, period.  Gotta be Certain Dri solid!</li>
            <li> Reached a strange time in my life where normal Anti Perspirant stopped working. I switched to Tom&#x27;s Natural and that worked for awhile, but, eventually failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended by a friend but I didn&#x27;t like the rollon that seems to be the only product available in stores. This stick works great, months later!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more expensive than what I always use, SpeedStick, and has the very same. Product is good. It&#x27;s just me who can&#x27;t find a solution for perspiration.</li>
            <li> Husband and son loves the deodorant.  Keeps them dry.  Great smell.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Worked for my grandson!</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the roll on, but I thought I&#x27;d give the solid a try this time around. The roll on you have to wait until your pits dry after rolling it on. With the solid, swipe it on and go. I love this more then the roll on and honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the dryness of my pits! Recommend to the users who don&#x27;t like to wait around!!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and will never go back to the liquid version again. Why? Because I haven&#x27;t had irritated skin ONCE since switching! The liquid stuff always left me with burning, itchy skin. But the solid doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things that will help you adjust to using this product. First, use it every night. I was able to use the liquid product every other night without problem, but the solid version isn&#x27;t as strong. Second, give it at least a month, if not two, for it to fully work. I wasn&#x27;t sure how happy I would be with it until I&#x27;d been using it for over a month, since it didn&#x27;t seem to be working for a long time. But I&#x27;m very happy with how it has been going for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff has made my teenage son&#x27;s life heaven.  He sweats so much during the night, plus playing sports. Not only does it keep him pretty dry, he no longer smells like he live in a locker room...lol.  Excellent stuff.</li>
            <li> One thing that the package insert says is that THE ROLL ON HAS A HIGHER STRENGTH INGREDIENT IN IT!!!!! I am not a roll on fan, but will be trying it next time. Half the battle is remembering to put it on at night. After reading the package insert I am assuming you can&#x27;t use it after shaving because it closes pores (ingrown hairs) so that&#x27;s a bit of a bummer. Well worth it though! I was a disgusting sweaty mess for the last 20 yrs. Stayed away from colored shirts and constantly considered sweating with every clothing purchase. So awful. I would sweat when I was still, hot, or cold. This has 100% fixed everything. really really happy. There are days when I will feel a bit of moistness under my arm, but it would never show on my shirt. Wow!  I also purchased the AM stick and it smells really nice for daytime use. So my recommendation is based on the combination of the two. This is a miracle worker 100% the only thing I have ever bought that I feel that way about. I even bought one for my neighbor, which is weird, but shows how crazy good it works.</li>
            <li> It definitely meets my expectations, but make sure you do apply it at night.  It won&#x27;t dry totally if you put it on in the morning, and then it can get on your clothes, which will discolor them.  I did that once or twice, but the good news is that after washing the discoloration went away.  Oh and make sure you do have another deodorant to put on in the morning, for &amp;#34;good smelling&amp;#34; purposes.</li>
            <li> I first bought the liquid but it itched a bit. Changed to this one and can&#x27;t belive the results!!! Love it..! Hope it keeps working as a miracle!</li>
            <li> I thought for sure all was loss until I stumbled upon this product.  It works! It works! it WORKS!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Only works if you use it consistently. It has a lasting effect that builds up. It is not at all like regular antiperspirant. If you miss a couple days, it will stop working</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time finding an Anti Perspirant that really works well.  Most commercial brands - stick, roll-on or spray (who uses spray anymore, anyway???) - anyway, most of them never last through the end of the day, let alone for two or three days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This anti perspirant REALLY does what it says... and if you follow the instructions, and apply at bedtime, you&#x27;ll find that you don&#x27;t need to apply deodorant/anti-perspirant every day anymore - even though you shower every day! This product shrinks pores and constricts glands and vessels that cause perspiration, and it lasts!!!!! it is even water-proof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company makes an AM antiperspirant for those who like putting on their deodorant/antiperspirant in the mornings, but there&#x27;s no difference, really.  it also makes a \\&quot;freshener\\&quot; product, for thosse who want a fresh smell with a solid stick... they also make a super absorbent foot powder and a foot treatment system for those of us who suffer from ecessive sweating of the feet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i cannot say enough good about these products and their manufacturer - they help make life a lot easier for folks like me who perspire waaaay too much!</li>
            <li> Goes on dry. Keeps you dry.  This is the only anti perspirant I use now.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My son needed more Drysol as he was getting married and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune going to the doctor just for a prescription for Drysol.  We ordered this thinking it would be a good replacement.  It was better than regular over the counter stuff but can&#x27;t be compared to the real deal.  Didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> wow!!!s my 3rd year suffering from sweaty armpits, I tried everything even prescription solids from Dr., nothing worked. After receiving this product and used the first night it worked. My day consist of zumba first thing in the morning, running errands and I just sweat like crazy and have wet underarms, it was so relieving to enjoy a day without wet underarms and am looking forward to being normal again...</li>
            <li> This product does exactly as it states without burning like the liquid type of this brand.  Also, no need to use it everyday for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered there are really two classes of deodorants/anti-perspirants: off-the-shelf stuff, and Certain-Dri. Most of the store-bought deodorants (Right Guard, Degree, etc) do an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; job if you don&#x27;t sweat much during the day, but as soon as you spend time in the gym or do a lot of rigorous activity, it won&#x27;t be very effective. Certain-Dri works on different principles and ACTUALLY WORKS. I have been using it for a number of years and am always impressed at how dry I stay, even after spending time at the gym or walking through the city in a full suit dragging a suitcase behind me.</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-perspirant I ever used.  After my son was born, the deodorant I had used for years no longer worked with my changed body chemistry.  I tried many different varieties, including those made for men.  Nothing worked.  This one was recommended highly by my dermatologist.  It did the trick!  One word of caution, I initially tried the roll-on and was told by my doctor&#x27;s nurse to make sure that my underarms were completely dry before applying or this product would &amp;#34;burn.&amp;#34;  Though I did try and make sure I was totally dry, there were a couple of times where I missed a spot and the product did burn my underarms.  I prefer a solid anyway and could only find the roll-on at my drugstore.  I order the solid on-line all the time.  It works just as well and does so without the pain.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> works good but wish they would make a clear kind! the white shows up on t shirts. o well, i would tell a friend to buy this.</li>
            <li> I sweat alot and have had problems with BO. This product works great at stopping the odor and reducing the sweat. It is also alot more gentle than the roll on which irritated my skin</li>
            <li> This is, by far, THE BEST anti-perspirant that I&#x27;ve ever used. Don&#x27;t even need to use it every day! You apply it at night, just before you go to bed. It works by closing the pores under your arms so that you don&#x27;t perspire there.</li>
            <li> My child has hyperhidrosis and she has used the roll on for a while , but she wanted to try the solid because the roll on was to wet. I purchased a 4 pack of this solid and received a good deal , alas it was not such a good thing. Each solid promptly snapped off only after two or three uses. This solid would break off and go everywhere , what a mess. My daughter also seems to feel the solid doesn&#x27;t work as well as the roll on. Contacting the company to receive a refund or exchange. Stick with the roll on. Would not recommend this to anyone. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I meant to order the liquid version as that is what I always have used.  The liquid version works great when you apply it every day. This is a nice filler if you run out of the liquid roll on, but if you just use the solid, it is not as effective as an anti-perspirant as the liquid version.  This is nice as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is the best antiperspirant I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My armpits get quite sweaty...when I&#x27;m too cold, too hot, nervous, anxious....really, just uncomfortable at all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says 72 hours of protection but I begin to sweat mid second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other product has worked even a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri is the only anti-perspirant that works for me.  The liquids make me break out and cause nasty rashes.. the solid, on the other hand, is comfortable and effective.  I buy in the 4-pack and consider myself lucky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but I prefer the roll on version</li>
            <li> Nothing works better than Certain Dri -- and I know. I&#x27;ve used it for years, and it has solved all my perspiration problems. I swear by it.</li>
            <li> Recently my body decided it doesn&#x27;t want to not stink when I&#x27;m wearing a tank top. I have tried all the deodorants out there - and being a woman, I need the clear ones when I&#x27;m wearing a tank. And none of the clear ones work for me. I&#x27;m not a profuse sweater or anything, just when I&#x27;m wearing tanks I stink by lunch. Not cute.  I tried the roll-on kind of this brand, applied at night only, but it tingled &amp; burned too much. I was told to try this solid --- MIRACLE WORKER! I apply it every day, like regular deodorant. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; but it certainly isn&#x27;t white either. I wear it with tank tops &amp; have no problems - no stink &amp; no white marks! LOVE LOVE LOVE. Had to stock up here since I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anywhere!</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant /anti-perspirant there is out there! I tried all kinds of deodorants and other anti-perspirants out there, including the supposedly ironclad &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; ones, and none of them works as well as this. In the summers, I had gotten in the habit of wearing a &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; shirt on my commute and bringing the shirt I was going to wear because I would be a sweaty mess by the time I got to work. I haven&#x27;t had to do that since I started using Certain Dri and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> For me it doesnt work as well as roll-on certain dri. Great delivery time!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Completely stops the sweating in just a few days of using it.  I also tried the foot product and it is also excellent.  Very happy I purchased this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get the solid, not the roll on, which is like acid.  This product worked where none before it did.  Believe he hype!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best deodorant in the market, and I have tried all. Love it!!</li>
