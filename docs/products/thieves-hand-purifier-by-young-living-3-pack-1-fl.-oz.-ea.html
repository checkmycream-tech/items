            <li>I love thieves oil for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Like the smell, but wish it smelled more like Thieves oil.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and just love it.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s been on my hands for a couple of minutes, the unpleasantness evaporates and the residual effect is pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>I am strongly against using antibacterial soaps and hand purifiers.  </li>
            <li>Bying it through Amazon is cheap and easy.</li>
            <li>I have used the lozenges for a few years and I have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li>hand cleaner is based on it, and I have been happy using it for the last year or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and super gentle.</li>
            <li>First, I love Thieves Oil and Thieves Household Cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would smell nice and function like normal hand sanitizers do.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is a great natural alternative to other toxic hand sanitizers.  </li>
            <li>Best product ever to clean effectively when unable to wash.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and hands don&#x27;t dry out!!</li>
            <li>It works great without the chemicals of other products.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance was pleasant and I didn&#x27;t have the drying out problem like I do with other hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>works, non sticky after it dries,  no flu all winter, smells great, doesn&#x27;t dry out hands like the mainly alcohol comprised brands.</li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s worth it since it works.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and that it isn&#x27;t alcohol, that it is a natural product....</li>
            <li>Love this sanitizer, an all natural way to kill germs and bacteria.</li>
            <li>His cute little fingers have been healthy since the first night we used it.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I used the hand purifier.</li>
            <li>I love using this instead of using all of the harsh soaps filled with chemicals at work or when I am out and about.</li>
            <li>but it cost too much for the size.</li>
            <li>I love it and would not buy any other hand purifier,</li>
            <li>I have used theives for a few years now, this is the first tiem I have used the sanitizer and love it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>The procut is fine but the small Amount isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>Under normal conditions, I prefer to wash my hands with non-antibacterial soap and water.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it unless YL comes out with a new non-clumping formula.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely hooked on it!</li>
            <li>I also use Thieves cleaning products instead of bleach and other chemicals to clean my house.</li>
            <li>Doctors did tests but had no idea why it was reoccurring (probably just too busy to care that much about my son to do research) but Theives worked instantly.</li>
            <li>This is a natural way to prevent spreading germs.</li>
            <li>It is so soft on hands , not oily, and smells so good&lt;</li>
            <li>This product is thick more like gel that coats the your hands, but not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I have used Thieves oil blend for a long time, and have found it very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and any of their other products!</li>

            <li> So looking forward to using this and giving it to my daughters who are very careful and sanitize regularly when out in public.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands</li>
            <li> The thieves works well and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very much product for the money you pay.</li>
            <li> Little, clearly visible, small clumps of the product.</li>
            <li> Another downfall is the price in comparison to other hand sanitizer a that you can get for waaaaaay cheaper.</li>
            <li> Containers are small, but you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> This are like any other ones, but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes the peppermint in it make my hands burn a little.</li>
            <li> And not just a few clumps.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> But on those occasions where that is not available, I use this product.  </li>
            <li> I am in the medical field and in contact with lots of germs and have managed to avoid getting sick this winter because of proper disinfecting.</li>
            <li> Plus the bottles are small.</li>
            <li> I rated it 4 stars only because I thought it was a bit expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with it either...</li>
            <li> It smells like toothpaste and balls up into nasty little sticky filth balls if you rub for too long.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m afraid to use because I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it.  </li>
            <li> That said, the combination of Thieves/denatured alcohol is initially unpleasant, according to my nose anyway.  </li>
            <li> So I was all for it.........until I realized that it clumps up on your hands in a very disgusting manner.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;ll help protect you from the any of those nasty bugs out there.</li>
            <li> That was horrible.</li>

            <li> works, non sticky after it dries,  no flu all winter, smells great, doesn&#x27;t dry out hands like the mainly alcohol comprised brands. Will continue to repurchase!</li>
            <li> First, I love Thieves Oil and Thieves Household Cleaner.  That said, the combination of Thieves/denatured alcohol is initially unpleasant, according to my nose anyway.  Once it&#x27;s been on my hands for a couple of minutes, the unpleasantness evaporates and the residual effect is pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now and I&#x27;m completely hooked on it! It&#x27;s the best hand sanitizer available and it smells amazing. Every time I use it someone remarks on how good it smells.  I gave this out as stocking-stuffers for Christmas and everyone loved them.  It&#x27;s great to have in your bag, car, or desk!

            <li> This is a natural way to prevent spreading germs. Gave each of my family members one in their stocking for Christmas. I also use Thieves cleaning products instead of bleach and other chemicals to clean my house.</li>
            <li> ok. I love theives oil. And this product smells good and is kind of silky. So I was all for it.........until I realized that it clumps up on your hands in a very disgusting manner. Little, clearly visible, small clumps of the product. And not just a few clumps. If they could change the formulation, keep the silky and theives power, and fix the clumping issue, this product would be my fav hand sanitizer. Another downfall is the price in comparison to other hand sanitizer a that you can get for waaaaaay cheaper. Plus the bottles are small. But I think it&#x27;s worth it since it works. It&#x27;s just gross. I don&#x27;t recommend it unless YL comes out with a new non-clumping formula.</li>
            <li> These are so handy for traveling or to share with others to sample it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Love the smell, love that it is not alcohol based and doesn&#x27;t kill the good bacteria.  Just started using so still testing the effectiveness of reducing germs/illness.</li>
            <li> Great product and it works well. Great Seller</li>
            <li> Works wonderful! Great smell and hands don&#x27;t dry out!!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and that it isn&#x27;t alcohol, that it is a natural product....good size to carry in the purse.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I rated it 4 stars only because I thought it was a bit expensive for me.</li>

            <li> Excellent Product and great price</li>
            <li> Best product ever to clean effectively when unable to wash.  Keep this bottle in purse, on my medication cart at work ( I am a nurse ) and in the car.  Also use all of the Thieves products to keep my family healthy.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would smell nice and function like normal hand sanitizers do. I was incorrect. It smells like toothpaste and balls up into nasty little sticky filth balls if you rub for too long. I work retail &amp; so got it for myself and my 6th grade daughter. She got &amp;#34;grossed out&amp;#34; and will not use it.  I&#x27;m not very happy with it either... but it kills the germs...</li>
            <li> So looking forward to using this and giving it to my daughters who are very careful and sanitize regularly when out in public.</li>
            <li> great service, great product.  thank you.</li>
            <li> I love using this instead of using all of the harsh soaps filled with chemicals at work or when I am out and about.</li>
            <li> It is so soft on hands , not oily, and smells so good&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands I love it and would not buy any other hand purifier,</li>
            <li> Pleasant smelling and kind to hands for repeated use. Containers are small, but you only need a little bit. Very good quality product.</li>
            <li> I have used the lozenges for a few years and I have been very happy with them. This was the first time I used the hand purifier. The fragrance was pleasant and I didn&#x27;t have the drying out problem like I do with other hand sanitizers.</li>

            <li> I have this product fromYoung Living.  This stuff isn&#x27;t Thieves.  It&#x27;s a knock off that I&#x27;m afraid to use because I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells good and is a great natural alternative to other toxic hand sanitizers.  It is the only brand I use for myself and my family.  Bying it through Amazon is cheap and easy.</li>
            <li> the VERY best hand sanitizer out there.  no lingering yucky feeling on your hands and the smell is Thieves!! can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I like it but it cost too much for the size. Smells good and does the trick but it&#x27;s not very much product for the money you pay.</li>
            <li> The THIEVES product line not only cleans almost everything beautifully, it just smells so good I often don&#x27;t wear any perfume if I&#x27;m using the hand purifier! The history of this product is also very interesting - just Google it!</li>
            <li> I love using this product!  Under normal conditions, I prefer to wash my hands with non-antibacterial soap and water.  But on those occasions where that is not available, I use this product.  I am strongly against using antibacterial soaps and hand purifiers.  I believe that this trend has contributed to the development of the \\&quot;superbugs\\&quot; that are resistant to antibiotics.  So this product is perfect for me and my family!</li>
            <li> I love thieves oil for cleaning.  When I saw the hand purifier I wanted to try it and glad I did!  It does have a herbal smell which I think is nice.  I even diffuse concentrated thieves oil in my home to disinfect.  I am in the medical field and in contact with lots of germs and have managed to avoid getting sick this winter because of proper disinfecting.</li>
            <li> Another great product without carcinogens.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Purell alternative.  I am very happy with this product.  It smells great too!  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This product is thick more like gel that coats the your hands, but not sticky at all. Like the smell, but wish it smelled more like Thieves oil.</li>
            <li> Tiny tiny bottles. The procut is fine but the small Amount isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this sanitizer, an all natural way to kill germs and bacteria. I keep one in my car, and one on my desk at work.</li>
            <li> Love thieves and this smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Wonderful to having on hand.  A safe, natural germ killer with a very pleasant scent.  Keep one in my purse, one in my truck &amp; one at work.</li>
            <li> I love this product. However, I only received 1 of these hand sanitizes when I was suppose to receive 3</li>
            <li> A wonderful aroma and a very pleasant overall feeling of well being after applying this hand purifier. It&#x27;s a must have.Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and just love it. It is not drying like the alcohol hand sanitizers I use to use.</li>
            <li> My son kept getting hang nails infected. Over a period of 6 months. We soaked his hands every night before bed and they just kept coming back. We had to go to the doctors office and emergency room 3 times to get it lanced open. He is 3. That was horrible. Then a friend gave me this and I put it on his hands before bed every night for a week and whenever I saw him with another hangnail. His cute little fingers have been healthy since the first night we used it. I have no idea what made that happen. Doctors did tests but had no idea why it was reoccurring (probably just too busy to care that much about my son to do research) but Theives worked instantly.This stuff is amazing and super gentle. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I have used theives for a few years now, this is the first tiem I have used the sanitizer and love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product -- smells great and is safer than the other hand purification products</li>
            <li> I like these as a alternative to traditional alcohol purifiers.  The thieves works well and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.  Plus the smell is great.</li>
