            <li>No clumping how good is that.  </li>
            <li>good:  </li>
            <li>If that isn&#x27;t a problem for you, you might not find it as good a value as I do.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush, the length it gives my lashes.</li>
            <li>Iconic Overcurl gives my lashes curl, height, and definition.  </li>
            <li>So if you are like me and have to struggle to get and keep a curl, you will love this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about a million mascaras in my life and this is one of my top five.</li>
            <li>My favorite Mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascarra.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recomend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Iconic Overcurl lives up to all the hype.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My lashes look very long and perfectly curled and stay that way all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s once a day coverage is all you need, removes easily.</li>
            <li>Just as described, quick delivery!</li>
            <li>For me, however, it&#x27;s still well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and fresh!  </li>
            <li>The formula is just great--it never flakes or smudges, and just washes right out (even right out the shower I don&#x27;t have raccoon eyes).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only mascara that gives my lashes lasting curl, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>I love Dior makeup, especially mascaras.</li>
            <li>This mascara is pretty much waterproof -</li>
            <li>I wondered if it was real Dior.</li>
            <li>Well, Dior also promises that this is a supper voluminizing mascara, and I don&#x27;t think it does a whole lot in that department.</li>
            <li>Still, overall, it&#x27;s quite fabulous.</li>
            <li>It cost to much though.</li>
            <li>I wear it in Las Vegas to the pool and it has never ran, but also comes off super easy with facewipes and doesnt leave leftover black residue in your eyes (or eye buggers).</li>
            <li>Best mascara ever, I mean it!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the new Lancome products nearly as much.</li>
            <li>I seriously do not know how my lashes have survived before this.</li>
            <li>Dried out too quickly!!</li>
            <li>and it looks normal.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra $$</li>
            <li>Certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to the Dior name, dried out very quickly and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I buy a new one every six months or so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a day look-- like going to work in a professional setting-- because it creates a long, volumized, but natural look--with a little lift.</li>
            <li>Also, the brush was different from other tubes of Iconic</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and cannot use mascara from the drug stores, this does not make my eyes itch</li>
            <li>and so far it has not flaked.</li>
            <li>I am giving this five stars because I do indeed love it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it could not be improved.&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;To get a heavier, longer lash look (more false lash looking), I use it with a different brush (I save and sanitize brushes that I like), in this case, the one for &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; --which had a lousy formula but a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> but you would never know it because they are pale and flat, and eyelash curlers do absolutely nothing for me.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s dark but never gets racoony or flaky.  </li>
            <li> I got it, it took me aback that it came in a little plastic bag instead of the official Dior box.</li>
            <li> but it can get a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> and now I like it a lot for everyday.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes, it weirdly seems to clump on the outside where you screw the brush into the holder.</li>
            <li> Before this mascara, I always had to put on several coats for a pathetic little curl that didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> one complaint:  </li>
            <li> People will ask me if I even have mascara on, it&#x27;s that subtle, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was not a great bargain, but without Prime another seller was charging a $10 shipping fee, so what the hey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This mascara is amazing.  No clumping how good is that.  I get lots of compliments whenever I am wearing it.</li>
            <li> Only mascara that doesn&#x27;t smear under my eyes.  Arrived fast and fresh!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes look awesome! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara to replace my Lancome Definicals Pro with the CURVED brush for 1 year. I didn&#x27;t like the new Lancome products nearly as much. This is great stuff. I love the brush, the length it gives my lashes. I have sensitive eyes and cannot use mascara from the drug stores, this does not make my eyes itch and so far it has not flaked.</li>
            <li> Dried out too quickly!!</li>
            <li> I am giving this five stars because I do indeed love it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it could not be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:  It&#x27;s the only mascara that gives my lashes lasting curl, and it looks great.  I have long lashes but you would never know it because they are pale and flat, and eyelash curlers do absolutely nothing for me.  Iconic Overcurl gives my lashes curl, height, and definition.  It&#x27;s dark but never gets racoony or flaky.  I can look at my eyes hours after application and they still look great. Before this mascara, I always had to put on several coats for a pathetic little curl that didn&#x27;t last. It&#x27;s one of those game-changers that takes a few seconds to make you look so much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint:  While it doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes, it weirdly seems to clump on the outside where you screw the brush into the holder. It dries out and needs to be replaced faster than I would like, considering the price. For me, however, it&#x27;s still well worth it.  So if you are like me and have to struggle to get and keep a curl, you will love this.  If that isn&#x27;t a problem for you, you might not find it as good a value as I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a million mascaras in my life and this is one of my top five. Top five in a million ain&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> My favorite Mascara. I buy a new one every six months or so and it works great!</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever, I mean it!!!</li>
            <li> I love Dior makeup, especially mascaras. I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to drive to Nordstrom just to get some, so I ordered this with Prime. The price was not a great bargain, but without Prime another seller was charging a $10 shipping fee, so what the hey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, it took me aback that it came in a little plastic bag instead of the official Dior box. I wondered if it was real Dior. Also, the brush was different from other tubes of Iconic I had used before. I almost sent it back because the brush wasn&#x27;t giving me the results I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a learning curve, I got the hang of it and now I like it a lot for everyday. The formula is just great--it never flakes or smudges, and just washes right out (even right out the shower I don&#x27;t have raccoon eyes). It&#x27;s good for a day look-- like going to work in a professional setting-- because it creates a long, volumized, but natural look--with a little lift. People will ask me if I even have mascara on, it&#x27;s that subtle, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a heavier, longer lash look (more false lash looking), I use it with a different brush (I save and sanitize brushes that I like), in this case, the one for &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; --which had a lousy formula but a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every mascara out there, but Diorshow is in a class by itself.  Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!  My lashes look long, lean and curled, with no clumps- ever.</li>
            <li> I love this mascarra. I seriously do not know how my lashes have survived before this. I love this product and would recomend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great Mascara!  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use anything else. It&#x27;s once a day coverage is all you need, removes easily.</li>
            <li> Just as described, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Dior mascaras are awesome. Iconic Overcurl lives up to all the hype. Even without an eyelash curler, you will notice a definite curl to your lashes that stays in place all day. Why only four stars? Well, Dior also promises that this is a supper voluminizing mascara, and I don&#x27;t think it does a whole lot in that department. Still, overall, it&#x27;s quite fabulous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused.  Great masacara BUT it came out of the box and in a plastic baggy.  The wording on the masacra was rubbed off as if it was used or rolling around in a bag or something.  I checked the wand and the consistancy of the mascara and it looks normal.  go figure.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. Certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to the Dior name, dried out very quickly and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I used to only wear Maybelline, but recently noticied black flakes in my eyes or when I wash my face at night I would get black chunks leftover which worried me. This mascara is pretty much waterproof - I wear it in Las Vegas to the pool and it has never ran, but also comes off super easy with facewipes and doesnt leave leftover black residue in your eyes (or eye buggers). It&#x27;s lengthening and curling. I add a tiny bit of water towards the end to make the tube last longer. Worth the extra $$</li>
            <li> Plumps up lashes beautifully. It cost to much though.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  There is no need for an eyelash curler which is great because I hate using one.  My lashes look very long and perfectly curled and stay that way all day.  This is definitely the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Had to return it because it wasn&#x27;t waterproof. Flaky.</li>
            <li> Great mascara but it can get a little clumpy.</li>
    </ol>
