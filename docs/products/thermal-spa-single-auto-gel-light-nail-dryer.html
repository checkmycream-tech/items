            <li>I have bought this and am very pleased with using it solely for Shellac.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this gel dryer.</li>
            <li>After researching all the uv light boxes for gel nail polish and having been a salon client for so many years, this one brand seemed to be the best.</li>
            <li>great light works very good for nails , the light helps cure finger nail polish in a couple of minutes .  </li>
            <li>I do shellac every two weeks at home and LOVE it!</li>

            <li>not the 1 minute that I need the most!</li>

            <li>Easy to assemble, easy to use, great price, great quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to working with the gel polish, but the light works great every time.</li>
            <li>This was as nice as the one in the salon.</li>
            <li>This was also the brand used in the nice salon that I go to</li>
            <li>i would recomend this light to anyone looking for a wonderful light for their nails</li>
            <li>I would have liked a timer of 10 seconds instead of just 1, 2 or 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I bought this to do my own at home \\&quot;shellac\\&quot; manicures.  </li>
            <li>After getting a couple shellac manicures I decided to invest in my own home manicure set up and this light works great for doing your own nails.</li>
            <li>I bought this to do my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>Would be better with a fan, but over it was good.  </li>
            <li>I thought for the price of $25.00, that I should look into doing my own nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done my own nails and my friends nails hundreds of times and no issues to report.</li>
            <li>It work wonderfully with the Gelish product and is a decent size to storage.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and works every time.</li>
            <li>Item was packaged well, with all 4 light bulbs, very easy to install the light bulbs and wa-lah - good to go!</li>
            <li>i got this light when i went to nail school and loved it so of corse</li>
            <li>The important part is to have a good seal at the edge of the nail to prevent lifting and peeling.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps someone who is in search for a good affordable light.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this lamp in hopes that I would be able to do my own nails at home.  </li>
            <li>The bulb replacement indicator would have been nice, but I imagine that when my bulbs burn out I&#x27;ll be able to see that they&#x27;re not on anymore.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>So returns not as easy as they say!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the Automatic Gel UV Light Nail Dryer.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s the additional cost of the higher priced one and someday I may decide to spend that kind of money, but for a 2 minute curing this light is great.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome ad the price was such a deal.</li>
            <li>I really liked this light.  </li>
            <li>I do love this lamp</li>
            <li>Like it better than the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; lamp.</li>
            <li>It costs a bit more</li>
            <li>It has a 2/3/5 minute timer on the top.</li>
            <li>Love the CND shellac polishes too.  </li>
            <li>And on top of that they charged me RE STOCK FEE afound</li>
            <li>The top coat is cured for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Applied the top coat and cured for 2 min  </li>
            <li>I like to be able to paint my nails with Shellac myself.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I did</li>
            <li>And she bought it too :)</li>
            <li>If the bulbs die, I will get rid of this and buy a better product.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>This UV light does the trick!</li>
            <li>Love the 3 time settings..2, 3, and 5.</li>
            <li>I had fallen in love with gel and went to sallys to but some.</li>
            <li>Effectively, they could not click in to place and make the electrical connection required to light up.</li>
            <li>My hand fits perfectly in there and can even put my other hand on top of one</li>
            <li>I just received my light 2 days after I ordered it :).</li>
            <li>Make sure to swipe the nail&#x27;s free edge and remove any shellac that gets under the nail or on the skin before curing.  </li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to move around the table as you are polishing someone&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li>Easy set up &amp; use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>cures every kind of gel very fast</li>
            <li>Fits one hand or foot just fine and has 2/3/5 minute timers.</li>
            <li>Their directions say to use 99%, but the 70% worked just fine for me.</li>
            <li>This UV light works just fine.</li>
            <li>Automatic Gel Uv Light Nail Dryer</li>
            <li>Please let everyone you know that this type of UV light does not work on OPI Gel nails.</li>
            <li>How do I know what to order and is it available through Amazon?</li>
            <li>Great item overall.</li>
            <li>This light is a joke if you&#x27;re looking to use with OPI soak off gels.  </li>
            <li>I am no UV light authority</li>
            <li>I purchased this light to use with CND Shellac nail system.  </li>
            <li>that has nothing to do with the light.</li>
            <li>I bought this uv light because of the reviews I read here.  </li>
            <li>I will probably return the lamp because the 1 min timer is so important to the services that I offer.</li>
            <li>Overall, great item.</li>
            <li>This UV light worked once before it stopped.</li>
            <li>I just have one bulb that I&#x27;ve always had to re secure every time.</li>
            <li>and easy to clean also.</li>
            <li>Curing them under the light for 30 seconds each hand.  </li>
            <li>I think the important thing is to do this with the lint free cloth.</li>
            <li>I also purchased gloves to protect my skin from the UV light.</li>
            <li>I bought this uv light to cure CND Shellac.</li>
            <li>I ordered this Thermal Spa Gel UV Light Nail Dryer (36 Watts) for curing shellac nail polish.</li>
            <li>The bulbs do not stay securely in the unit.  </li>
            <li>The light came with bulb and it does have a time which is helpful.</li>
            <li>I started doing my own nails at home when I just couldn&#x27;t stand wasting so much money to get my nails done.</li>
            <li>Just received it, used it once, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I did a test, it also works great with other polish, I used OPI with a shellac top coat.</li>
            <li>but I did leave it on for a bit and put my hand in and felt the warmth so I am pretty sure it will be fine.</li>
            <li>If you can polish your own nails, I highly recommend this unit.  </li>
            <li>Probably all lamps this size are created about equal, but what I love about this one is the handle on top!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Def worth it!</li>
            <li>She was so excited until tonight.  </li>
            <li>Isopropyl Alcohol will help clean up any excees shellac.  </li>
            <li>They are instructive and encouraging and I have gleaned a few good ideas to use in my own process.  </li>
            <li>the price is right!</li>
            <li>I love it thanks</li>
            <li>Just as powerful as CND&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li>It has paid for itself MANY times over considering how much they charge at the salons($30+)each visit.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipping was awesome as usual!</li>
            <li>Works so well and quick.</li>
            <li>I liked that both hands can fit inside it at the same time</li>
            <li>This unit dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>The machine look exactly as the one in the pic and also is working super fine ...</li>
            <li>The Shellac cured quickly under this lamp.</li>
            <li>It came on as before but quickly turned off.</li>
            <li>I bought this Automatic Gel UV Light Nail Dryer and when I tried to use it, it worked for the first 10 seconds then was intermittent there after.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and cannot live without it when I am doing my gel manicures.</li>
            <li>After purchasing and using the Thermal Spa lamp, I realized that it&#x27;s really not that hot, so the fan is kind of a luxury more than a necessity.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the CND lamp is just as good, if not better, but this one gets the job done for the right price.  </li>
            <li>I have spent hours looking for a good UV light with a reasonable price to use on the OPI soak off Gel</li>
            <li>I expect to do my own shellac manicure soon; just waiting for the \\&quot;Negligee\\&quot; color to arrive (the last item I need).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll spend the same amount of money in 2-3 months as you will on setting up your own home manicure kit.</li>
            <li>Better off getting a different UV light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>Light didn&#x27;t work properly and most the time wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li>Then I used the scrub fresh to disinfect and dehydrate the nails.</li>
            <li>I invested in several bottles of shellac polish and do my own nails ALL THE TIME.</li>
            <li>You have to install the lights but they snap right in, couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of shopping around to find the right UV Lamp to do CND Shellac manicures at home.  </li>
            <li>Timer was right on.</li>
            <li>I recently had my first Shellac manicure and immediately came home to purchase my own products.</li>
            <li>I also used this light to help dry regular polish and it did a great job.</li>
            <li>If you are into the new gel or shellac style manicures to grow your own nails long and strong</li>
            <li>it takes more than 5 minutes to dry your gel, i am planning buying the opi light to see if it does the work</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift 2 years ago as my wife likes to do her nails quite frequently, and always had to just let them air dry (for hours).&lt;br /&gt;According to her it works great</li>
            <li>Maybe because one of the bulbs wasn&#x27;t working or maybe because it isn&#x27;t any good, my nails never dried properly.  </li>
            <li>it actually worked just fine!  </li>
            <li>I ended up not using it very much and gave it away.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working because after each curing time I would touch my nail</li>
            <li>Only drawback I&#x27;ve found with the machine is the the start button on the top</li>
            <li>I wonder if the seller is aware of this because they don&#x27;t have a link rate the seller.</li>
            <li>When I received the unit the box \\&quot;said\\&quot;  1 min, 2 min and 3 minute timers, but the actual light has 2 min, 3 min and 5 min.!  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what my salon uses.  </li>
            <li>First I prepared my nails as they state on the CND Shellac wesite (removing cuticles, etc.)  </li>
            <li>The last step was to apply the top coat.</li>
            <li>Following the Shellac directions I then wiped the top coat off with a microfiber cloth soaked in 70% isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li>Turned it on when first purchased.</li>
            <li>My first instinct was to buy CND&#x27;s lamp, but for almost $100 more than this lamp, it was hard to convince myself that it would be that much better.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was strong enough to have the same effect as the ones in a nail salon.</li>
            <li>It is pretty large in size though so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Amazon customer but usually do not bother with writing reviews.</li>
            <li>I love shallac because it lasts so long.</li>
            <li>Two of the 4 bulb sockets (the top ones) were so loose, that even with the provided brackets the bulbs would not stay in the sockets.</li>
            <li>It ok not that fast to dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;i did finally use it and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>This might be a good UV light in General, but it is NO GOOD on the OPI soak off gels.</li>
            <li>so how do I really know it&#x27;s not working...</li>
            <li>Machine works very well for my use (Gel curing).</li>
            <li>hope to buy another one real soon.</li>
            <li>Just like in a real Nail Salon.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and does the job - well.</li>
            <li>On a second time I tryed to use this UV light lamps wouldn&#x27;t work at all or only one lamp would light up.</li>
            <li>After i tryed to return it the Blue Planet woldn&#x27;t sent me a free return barcode or anything like it as it says on amazon.com return policy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve saved so much money doing my our gel manicures and pedicures.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lamp!</li>
            <li>you can paint your whole hand(or foot) put it in there</li>
            <li>This works very well and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is very roomy.</li>
            <li>It came very promptly -</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...</li>
            <li>Well, I purchased this UV light dryer and the Gelish basic starter kit.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions very closely that came with the Gel kit.  </li>
            <li>The reviews are very helpful.</li>
            <li>very disapointing had planned a day of vacation with daughter to do nail and pamper ourselfs.</li>
            <li>AS I HAVE SAID I AM VERY DISAPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This is the second one of these I have owned, and so far I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>I also like how small it is so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my apt.  </li>
            <li>I had been searching for a long time for a light with all these features including the 1 min, 2 min and 3 min timers.  </li>
            <li>I let it cool off and tried again, but only one bulb worked.</li>
            <li>item is MUCH larger and seems more like a double sized one.</li>
            <li>The main differences that I saw were that the CND lamp had a fan, a finger separating tray, a bulb replacement indicator and a programmable timer.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001BNLDQA Automatic Gel Uv Light Nail Dryer Par418 Single]]</li>
            <li>Gel Cleanser and Anti UV Gloves highly recommended too.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t extremely expensive, but it&#x27;s a great machine.</li>
            <li>this is great for curing fake nails.</li>
            <li>The thing I really like about Shellac is that there is no need to remove the nails natural shine</li>
            <li>and I can even fit both sets of toes in if I&#x27;m really careful.</li>
            <li>when I was finished I used 91% alcohol on a round cotton pad to remove the tacky top coat and wouldn&#x27;t you  know -</li>
            <li>I had read a review where the reviewer had warned the buying public that the dryer had malfuctioned right after the purchase</li>
            <li>I am new to Gel nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy they worked with me but not happy I had to go through it not working and sending it back.  </li>
            <li>She left very large margins on the three sides of my nails, near the cuticles.  </li>
            <li>A longer cord would have been nice, but it definitely was not worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I bought this UV light instead of CND&#x27;s in order to save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li>it is professional grade light/dryer.  </li>
            <li>and as she was getting ready to apply her second coat the dryer just turned off!!!!!</li>
            <li>The manufacturer is geared toward professional nail spas</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t justify spending over twice as much for the same thing from CND.</li>
            <li>Having just the one unit obviously requires twice as much time which I don&#x27;t always have.</li>
            <li>I usually run an additional 3-5 minutes on the last (top) coat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave feedback, but tend to make purchasing decision based on the feedback I read, so I thought I should do it on this product since it&#x27;s a big investment.    </li>
            <li>I have pretty wide feet</li>
            <li>Quickly rinsed off my hand and inspected, expecting to stem the flow of blood and, WOW!, only a slight mark on the shellac</li>
            <li>this unit isnt cheap in price and one would think it would last a little longer than just 3 uses.</li>
            <li>It works very well to dry fingernail polish.  </li>
            <li>Seriously why would anyone pay full price for the CND nail lamp when this is almost exactly the same!?!?</li>
            <li>but you could only fit a few fingers under hers.</li>
            <li>From Amazon, I ordered this light and every single product recommended (Scrub Fresh, acid-free primer, lint-free cloths, CND base coat and top coat, Negligee color, 99% alcohol, Solar Oil, etc.    </li>
            <li>I have a very professional looking french manicure as a result.  </li>
            <li>And then it costs a lot to send it back to get it fixed.</li>
            <li>When I got this the size surprised me, it was bigger</li>
            <li>I used the Negligee because I like the natural french look.</li>
            <li>This is a nice feature that I failed to notice when ordering.</li>
            <li>The bulbs are difficult to install because you have to line up the prongs exactly with the holes, and it is a pretty tight fit trying to get your hand in there to do this.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see a need for the other two really.</li>
            <li>And it does get a little hot once your hand is in there but tolerable.</li>
            <li>The lamp was exactly as descried, but the box it came in said a little different.</li>
            <li>We went out and spent $$ on new gel polishes since she wanted to use the dryer for the THIRD TIME  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very satisfied with this gel dryer.</li>
            <li> After researching all the uv light boxes for gel nail polish and having been a salon client for so many years, this one brand seemed to be the best.</li>
            <li> great light works very good for nails , the light helps cure finger nail polish in a couple of minutes .  </li>
            <li> I do shellac every two weeks at home and LOVE it!</li>

            <li> not the 1 minute that I need the most!</li>

            <li> Easy to assemble, easy to use, great price, great quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to working with the gel polish, but the light works great every time.</li>
            <li> This was as nice as the one in the salon.</li>
            <li> This was also the brand used in the nice salon that I go to</li>
            <li> i would recomend this light to anyone looking for a wonderful light for their nails</li>
            <li> I would have liked a timer of 10 seconds instead of just 1, 2 or 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do my own at home \\&quot;shellac\\&quot; manicures.  </li>
            <li> After getting a couple shellac manicures I decided to invest in my own home manicure set up and this light works great for doing your own nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li> Would be better with a fan, but over it was good.  </li>
            <li> I thought for the price of $25.00, that I should look into doing my own nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my own nails and my friends nails hundreds of times and no issues to report.</li>
            <li> It work wonderfully with the Gelish product and is a decent size to storage.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and works every time.</li>
            <li> Item was packaged well, with all 4 light bulbs, very easy to install the light bulbs and wa-lah - good to go!</li>
            <li> i got this light when i went to nail school and loved it so of corse</li>
            <li> The important part is to have a good seal at the edge of the nail to prevent lifting and peeling.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone who is in search for a good affordable light.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this lamp in hopes that I would be able to do my own nails at home.  </li>
            <li> The bulb replacement indicator would have been nice, but I imagine that when my bulbs burn out I&#x27;ll be able to see that they&#x27;re not on anymore.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> So returns not as easy as they say!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Automatic Gel UV Light Nail Dryer.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s the additional cost of the higher priced one and someday I may decide to spend that kind of money, but for a 2 minute curing this light is great.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome ad the price was such a deal.</li>
            <li> I really liked this light.  </li>
            <li> I do love this lamp</li>
            <li> Like it better than the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; lamp.</li>
            <li> It costs a bit more</li>
            <li> It has a 2/3/5 minute timer on the top.</li>
            <li> Love the CND shellac polishes too.  </li>
            <li> And on top of that they charged me RE STOCK FEE afound</li>
            <li> The top coat is cured for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Applied the top coat and cured for 2 min  </li>
            <li> I like to be able to paint my nails with Shellac myself.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I did</li>
            <li> And she bought it too :)</li>
            <li> If the bulbs die, I will get rid of this and buy a better product.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> This UV light does the trick!</li>
            <li> Love the 3 time settings..2, 3, and 5.</li>
            <li> I had fallen in love with gel and went to sallys to but some.</li>
            <li> Effectively, they could not click in to place and make the electrical connection required to light up.</li>
            <li> My hand fits perfectly in there and can even put my other hand on top of one</li>
            <li> I just received my light 2 days after I ordered it :).</li>
            <li> Make sure to swipe the nail&#x27;s free edge and remove any shellac that gets under the nail or on the skin before curing.  </li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to move around the table as you are polishing someone&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li> Easy set up &amp; use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> cures every kind of gel very fast</li>
            <li> Fits one hand or foot just fine and has 2/3/5 minute timers.</li>
            <li> Their directions say to use 99%, but the 70% worked just fine for me.</li>
            <li> This UV light works just fine.</li>
            <li> Automatic Gel Uv Light Nail Dryer</li>
            <li> Please let everyone you know that this type of UV light does not work on OPI Gel nails.</li>
            <li> How do I know what to order and is it available through Amazon?</li>
            <li> Great item overall.</li>
            <li> This light is a joke if you&#x27;re looking to use with OPI soak off gels.  </li>
            <li> I am no UV light authority</li>
            <li> I purchased this light to use with CND Shellac nail system.  </li>
            <li> that has nothing to do with the light.</li>
            <li> I bought this uv light because of the reviews I read here.  </li>
            <li> I will probably return the lamp because the 1 min timer is so important to the services that I offer.</li>
            <li> Overall, great item.</li>
            <li> This UV light worked once before it stopped.</li>
            <li> I just have one bulb that I&#x27;ve always had to re secure every time.</li>
            <li> and easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> Curing them under the light for 30 seconds each hand.  </li>
            <li> I think the important thing is to do this with the lint free cloth.</li>
            <li> I also purchased gloves to protect my skin from the UV light.</li>
            <li> I bought this uv light to cure CND Shellac.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Thermal Spa Gel UV Light Nail Dryer (36 Watts) for curing shellac nail polish.</li>
            <li> The bulbs do not stay securely in the unit.  </li>
            <li> The light came with bulb and it does have a time which is helpful.</li>
            <li> I started doing my own nails at home when I just couldn&#x27;t stand wasting so much money to get my nails done.</li>
            <li> Just received it, used it once, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I did a test, it also works great with other polish, I used OPI with a shellac top coat.</li>
            <li> but I did leave it on for a bit and put my hand in and felt the warmth so I am pretty sure it will be fine.</li>
            <li> If you can polish your own nails, I highly recommend this unit.  </li>
            <li> Probably all lamps this size are created about equal, but what I love about this one is the handle on top!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Def worth it!</li>
            <li> She was so excited until tonight.  </li>
            <li> Isopropyl Alcohol will help clean up any excees shellac.  </li>
            <li> They are instructive and encouraging and I have gleaned a few good ideas to use in my own process.  </li>
            <li> the price is right!</li>
            <li> I love it thanks</li>
            <li> Just as powerful as CND&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li> It has paid for itself MANY times over considering how much they charge at the salons($30+)each visit.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipping was awesome as usual!</li>
            <li> Works so well and quick.</li>
            <li> I liked that both hands can fit inside it at the same time</li>
            <li> This unit dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> The machine look exactly as the one in the pic and also is working super fine ...</li>
            <li> The Shellac cured quickly under this lamp.</li>
            <li> It came on as before but quickly turned off.</li>
            <li> I bought this Automatic Gel UV Light Nail Dryer and when I tried to use it, it worked for the first 10 seconds then was intermittent there after.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and cannot live without it when I am doing my gel manicures.</li>
            <li> After purchasing and using the Thermal Spa lamp, I realized that it&#x27;s really not that hot, so the fan is kind of a luxury more than a necessity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the CND lamp is just as good, if not better, but this one gets the job done for the right price.  </li>
            <li> I have spent hours looking for a good UV light with a reasonable price to use on the OPI soak off Gel</li>
            <li> I expect to do my own shellac manicure soon; just waiting for the \\&quot;Negligee\\&quot; color to arrive (the last item I need).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll spend the same amount of money in 2-3 months as you will on setting up your own home manicure kit.</li>
            <li> Better off getting a different UV light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Light didn&#x27;t work properly and most the time wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> Then I used the scrub fresh to disinfect and dehydrate the nails.</li>
            <li> I invested in several bottles of shellac polish and do my own nails ALL THE TIME.</li>
            <li> You have to install the lights but they snap right in, couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of shopping around to find the right UV Lamp to do CND Shellac manicures at home.  </li>
            <li> Timer was right on.</li>
            <li> I recently had my first Shellac manicure and immediately came home to purchase my own products.</li>
            <li> I also used this light to help dry regular polish and it did a great job.</li>
            <li> If you are into the new gel or shellac style manicures to grow your own nails long and strong</li>
            <li> it takes more than 5 minutes to dry your gel, i am planning buying the opi light to see if it does the work</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift 2 years ago as my wife likes to do her nails quite frequently, and always had to just let them air dry (for hours).&lt;br /&gt;According to her it works great</li>
            <li> Maybe because one of the bulbs wasn&#x27;t working or maybe because it isn&#x27;t any good, my nails never dried properly.  </li>
            <li> it actually worked just fine!  </li>
            <li> I ended up not using it very much and gave it away.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working because after each curing time I would touch my nail</li>
            <li> Only drawback I&#x27;ve found with the machine is the the start button on the top</li>
            <li> I wonder if the seller is aware of this because they don&#x27;t have a link rate the seller.</li>
            <li> When I received the unit the box \\&quot;said\\&quot;  1 min, 2 min and 3 minute timers, but the actual light has 2 min, 3 min and 5 min.!  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what my salon uses.  </li>
            <li> First I prepared my nails as they state on the CND Shellac wesite (removing cuticles, etc.)  </li>
            <li> The last step was to apply the top coat.</li>
            <li> Following the Shellac directions I then wiped the top coat off with a microfiber cloth soaked in 70% isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> Turned it on when first purchased.</li>
            <li> My first instinct was to buy CND&#x27;s lamp, but for almost $100 more than this lamp, it was hard to convince myself that it would be that much better.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was strong enough to have the same effect as the ones in a nail salon.</li>
            <li> It is pretty large in size though so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Amazon customer but usually do not bother with writing reviews.</li>
            <li> I love shallac because it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> Two of the 4 bulb sockets (the top ones) were so loose, that even with the provided brackets the bulbs would not stay in the sockets.</li>
            <li> It ok not that fast to dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;i did finally use it and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> This might be a good UV light in General, but it is NO GOOD on the OPI soak off gels.</li>
            <li> so how do I really know it&#x27;s not working...</li>
            <li> Machine works very well for my use (Gel curing).</li>
            <li> hope to buy another one real soon.</li>
            <li> Just like in a real Nail Salon.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and does the job - well.</li>
            <li> On a second time I tryed to use this UV light lamps wouldn&#x27;t work at all or only one lamp would light up.</li>
            <li> After i tryed to return it the Blue Planet woldn&#x27;t sent me a free return barcode or anything like it as it says on amazon.com return policy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved so much money doing my our gel manicures and pedicures.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lamp!</li>
            <li> you can paint your whole hand(or foot) put it in there</li>
            <li> This works very well and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is very roomy.</li>
            <li> It came very promptly -</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased this UV light dryer and the Gelish basic starter kit.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions very closely that came with the Gel kit.  </li>
            <li> The reviews are very helpful.</li>
            <li> very disapointing had planned a day of vacation with daughter to do nail and pamper ourselfs.</li>
            <li> AS I HAVE SAID I AM VERY DISAPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have owned, and so far I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> I also like how small it is so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my apt.  </li>
            <li> I had been searching for a long time for a light with all these features including the 1 min, 2 min and 3 min timers.  </li>
            <li> I let it cool off and tried again, but only one bulb worked.</li>
            <li> item is MUCH larger and seems more like a double sized one.</li>
            <li> The main differences that I saw were that the CND lamp had a fan, a finger separating tray, a bulb replacement indicator and a programmable timer.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001BNLDQA Automatic Gel Uv Light Nail Dryer Par418 Single]]</li>
            <li> Gel Cleanser and Anti UV Gloves highly recommended too.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t extremely expensive, but it&#x27;s a great machine.</li>
            <li> this is great for curing fake nails.</li>
            <li> The thing I really like about Shellac is that there is no need to remove the nails natural shine</li>
            <li> and I can even fit both sets of toes in if I&#x27;m really careful.</li>
            <li> when I was finished I used 91% alcohol on a round cotton pad to remove the tacky top coat and wouldn&#x27;t you  know -</li>
            <li> I had read a review where the reviewer had warned the buying public that the dryer had malfuctioned right after the purchase</li>
            <li> I am new to Gel nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy they worked with me but not happy I had to go through it not working and sending it back.  </li>
            <li> She left very large margins on the three sides of my nails, near the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> A longer cord would have been nice, but it definitely was not worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this UV light instead of CND&#x27;s in order to save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> it is professional grade light/dryer.  </li>
            <li> and as she was getting ready to apply her second coat the dryer just turned off!!!!!</li>
            <li> The manufacturer is geared toward professional nail spas</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t justify spending over twice as much for the same thing from CND.</li>
            <li> Having just the one unit obviously requires twice as much time which I don&#x27;t always have.</li>
            <li> I usually run an additional 3-5 minutes on the last (top) coat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave feedback, but tend to make purchasing decision based on the feedback I read, so I thought I should do it on this product since it&#x27;s a big investment.    </li>
            <li> I have pretty wide feet</li>
            <li> Quickly rinsed off my hand and inspected, expecting to stem the flow of blood and, WOW!, only a slight mark on the shellac</li>
            <li> this unit isnt cheap in price and one would think it would last a little longer than just 3 uses.</li>
            <li> It works very well to dry fingernail polish.  </li>
            <li> Seriously why would anyone pay full price for the CND nail lamp when this is almost exactly the same!?!?</li>
            <li> but you could only fit a few fingers under hers.</li>
            <li> From Amazon, I ordered this light and every single product recommended (Scrub Fresh, acid-free primer, lint-free cloths, CND base coat and top coat, Negligee color, 99% alcohol, Solar Oil, etc.    </li>
            <li> I have a very professional looking french manicure as a result.  </li>
            <li> And then it costs a lot to send it back to get it fixed.</li>
            <li> When I got this the size surprised me, it was bigger</li>
            <li> I used the Negligee because I like the natural french look.</li>
            <li> This is a nice feature that I failed to notice when ordering.</li>
            <li> The bulbs are difficult to install because you have to line up the prongs exactly with the holes, and it is a pretty tight fit trying to get your hand in there to do this.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see a need for the other two really.</li>
            <li> And it does get a little hot once your hand is in there but tolerable.</li>
            <li> The lamp was exactly as descried, but the box it came in said a little different.</li>
            <li> We went out and spent $$ on new gel polishes since she wanted to use the dryer for the THIRD TIME  </li>
            <li> I regret having purchased this product and will really take into account negative reviews in the future as there is definitely truth to them.</li>
            <li> Lights are long lasting, has been almost a year</li>
            <li> They are constantly going off, so I am wondering how long these will be functional.  </li>
            <li> It was a little more of a challenge to get a thin coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this would help my wife having itchy red fingers with dry scaley&lt;</li>
            <li> I also use it to quickly dry my neice&#x27;s nails when I am giving them a regular nail polish manicure.</li>
            <li> I had a shellac manicure at a salon and carefully observed the entire process so I could do it myself.</li>
            <li> I also did an extensive on-line research on other brands and models of UV lights, before I purchased this unit.  </li>
            <li> do dry both hands at once.</li>
            <li> Par418 Single]].</li>
            <li> As far as the programmable timer, I just use the timer on my cell phone for the base coat (10 to 30 sec) and use the built-in 2 min timer for the color and top coats.  </li>
            <li> The tray is unnecessary as well, since it&#x27;s really not that hard to set your hand down without your fingers touching.  </li>
            <li> it doesn´t really dry, and i leave it twice longer than other lamps.</li>
            <li> and it would still feel wet or tacky.  </li>
            <li> They are saying that the darker colors of Shellac are harder to cure, I haven&#x27;t tried those yet.  </li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> Thought the design of this item was very nifty, but the poor construction and/or parts made it trash.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how thick this product was.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 3 mins per coat to dry.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not using a file anywhere on the nails (other than to shape them).  </li>
            <li> When I removed my hand I assumed that the final layer would be hard and cured, but it was tacky like the rest of the coats.  </li>
            <li> I think if anyone leaves negative feedback they&#x27;re probably not doing the last step in the CND Shellac manicure which is using the alcohol or remove the tacky surface.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is</li>
            <li> After the base coat, color, sparkles and finally a top coat I realized that when I would get a Shellac manicure at the salon that I never touched my nails between coats</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter along with the base coat and top coat.  </li>
            <li> with any other product, except this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s this devise or the gel, but it doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> The 2 hand dryer cuts down about half of the time if you are applying shellac.  </li>
            <li> I expected to be wearing a bandage for a week after this experience, as has happened in the past.</li>
            <li> What a mess it leaves you with.  </li>
            <li> It is not bright enough and took 20 times turning it on to make it work.</li>
            <li> It dried my nails well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and do my nails</li>
            <li> I wish I had moved on and bought a different product as after six months of use, the dryer is just broken.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on a few ladies saying that it worked with CND Shellac.</li>
            <li> Once Iwas done wiping down the nails they were hard and shinny.</li>
            <li> I usually use a 1 and 2 minute timer for my gelish but 2 minutes will work.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go past 2 minutes so</li>
            <li> my oldest daughter gave this Thermal Spa to my youngest daughter as a xmas gift this past December.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about durability, but it seems to be well built.</li>
            <li> I had them done professionally a few times and was not very happy with the job the nail tech did.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t push too hard or it will bend the prongs.  </li>
            <li> But this situation warranted a BIG DISAPPOINTING  REVIEW.....</li>
            <li> Too late to return.</li>
            <li> Low product quality, was used only 3 times for 3 minutes each time, and now no longer works.&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift for my wife, I am very disappointed, after bringing the product to service</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to press (must be pressed hard to activate machine start).</li>
            <li> Applied the base coat and cured for 30 sec (you can probably do 10 sec.  </li>
            <li> m ore often use or longer time exposure .. not wise.  </li>
            <li> Cutting veggies with a sharp kitchen knife, I accidentically cut my thumb.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with it and do not sugest buying it.</li>
            <li> Weird,</li>
            <li> ~1/week (because I get bored of the color, not because it&#x27;s peeling)</li>
            <li> WE ARE NOT HAPPY CAMPERS!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to say but it did not do the job at all.</li>
            <li> Again a very thin coat after vigorously shaking.</li>
            <li> Just as well as the expensive CND dryer, and it has a timer!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this!</li>
            <li> After the nails are prepared I used the base coat, applying a very thin coat after shaking vigorously for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I do feel bad for my manicurist</li>
            <li> very unhappy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Even though the base is cured, it will still feel tacky)  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but this is a horrible purchase for the OPI gel line.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just received it, used it once, so far so good.</li>
            <li> This works just like the nail dryers in the spa. Very easy to use and works every time. I&#x27;ve saved lots of money doing my nails myself with this product.</li>
            <li> Works so well and quick. I tried others from Sally and there not as good. This product is awesome ad the price was such a deal.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have owned, and so far I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea for anyone who likes to do their nails.  It&#x27;s perfect for drying your nails quickly so you can avoid messing them up.</li>
            <li> I have two of these (I have two homes) I use it to cure the shallac on my nails. I love shallac because it lasts so long. This dryer works like it&#x27;s supposed to. I have had no problems with it. [[ASIN:B001BNLDQA Automatic Gel Uv Light Nail Dryer Par418 Single]].</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Automatic Gel UV Light Nail Dryer.  Some of the dryers you can purchase have only 9 watts -- this one has 36 watts.</li>
            <li> This might be a good UV light in General, but it is NO GOOD on the OPI soak off gels. I have spent hours looking for a good UV light with a reasonable price to use on the OPI soak off Gel and no one will help with any information. Please let everyone you know that this type of UV light does not work on OPI Gel nails.</li>
            <li> I really liked this light.  It dried my nails well. I liked that both hands can fit inside it at the same time so you can shellac them both at once and not have to go back and forth.  It comes with a power cord and three replaceable bulbs.  It also is pre-programmed to run for two or three minutes, so you don&#x27;t need to set a timer.  This was as nice as the one in the salon.</li>
            <li> While the lamp seems to work well, it did not ship with 4 bulbs (only 2) when I went looking for replacement bulbs, none are listed with the product. How do I know what to order and is it available through Amazon? Does it matter if it&#x27;s UV-A, or UV-B - who knows?</li>
            <li> I had a shellac manicure at a salon and carefully observed the entire process so I could do it myself. From Amazon, I ordered this light and every single product recommended (Scrub Fresh, acid-free primer, lint-free cloths, CND base coat and top coat, Negligee color, 99% alcohol, Solar Oil, etc.    Aside from the aesthetic appeal of beautiful nails and the ease and efficiency of doing it myself, I had an experience that thoroughly convinced me about the shellac manicure: Cutting veggies with a sharp kitchen knife, I accidentically cut my thumb. Quickly rinsed off my hand and inspected, expecting to stem the flow of blood and, WOW!, only a slight mark on the shellac -- my thumb was not cut at all! This system creates a very strong surface! I expected to be wearing a bandage for a week after this experience, as has happened in the past. Not only was my thumb unharmed, the knife mark did not even ruin my manicure!  I expect to do my own shellac manicure soon; just waiting for the \\&quot;Negligee\\&quot; color to arrive (the last item I need). Will follow the instructions to the letter and report back with a review.   I appreciate the various reviews of the items in this CND Shellac system. They are instructive and encouraging and I have gleaned a few good ideas to use in my own process.  Thank you to all reviewers!</li>
            <li> After researching all the uv light boxes for gel nail polish and having been a salon client for so many years, this one brand seemed to be the best. This was also the brand used in the nice salon that I go to and now I can do my own manicures at home!</li>
            <li> I bought this UV light instead of CND&#x27;s in order to save a few bucks.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working because after each curing time I would touch my nail and it would still feel wet or tacky.  After the base coat, color, sparkles and finally a top coat I realized that when I would get a Shellac manicure at the salon that I never touched my nails between coats so how do I really know it&#x27;s not working... when I was finished I used 91% alcohol on a round cotton pad to remove the tacky top coat and wouldn&#x27;t you  know - it actually worked just fine!  I think if anyone leaves negative feedback they&#x27;re probably not doing the last step in the CND Shellac manicure which is using the alcohol or remove the tacky surface. This UV light works just fine.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. Machine works very well for my use (Gel curing). Only drawback I&#x27;ve found with the machine is the the start button on the top o the machine. It is a little difficult to press (must be pressed hard to activate machine start). Great item overall.</li>
            <li> Seriously why would anyone pay full price for the CND nail lamp when this is almost exactly the same!?!? Great lamp! I do shellac every two weeks at home and LOVE it! I did read some reviews about the box and the lamp having different info. That did happen to me. The lamp was exactly as descried, but the box it came in said a little different. Weird, but i got what i ordered and that&#x27;s all i care about.  Amazon shipping was awesome as usual!</li>
            <li> Works great with shellac nail polish.  I did a test, it also works great with other polish, I used OPI with a shellac top coat.</li>
            <li> I do love this lamp the only issue I have is the ad says it has a 1,2,3, minute timer and the box says the same thing. The item itself has a 2,3, and 5 minute timer. I wonder if the seller is aware of this because they don&#x27;t have a link rate the seller. Hmmmm. I usually use a 1 and 2 minute timer for my gelish but 2 minutes will work. You can&#x27;t overcure but you undercure. I just wished the item shown was the item I received.</li>
            <li> great light works very good for nails , the light helps cure finger nail polish in a couple of minutes .  the price was great , cant beat it. hope to buy another one real soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp for use with the Axxium Starter Kit.  It works great! Just like in a real Nail Salon. You have to install the lights but they snap right in, couldn&#x27;t be easier. Great buy, don&#x27;t hesitate....</li>
            <li> Great lamp so for, used it once but love it.Like it better than the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; lamp. I scrubbed my bathroom, no chips &amp; still shiney!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use to set CND Shellac UV polish.  Works great!  Just as well as the expensive CND dryer, and it has a timer!</li>
            <li> great light!  i now own two of them ,one in each home! i would recomend this light to anyone looking for a wonderful light for their nails</li>
            <li> ITEM NOT AS DESCRIBED!!   Description claims that this is a 36 watt lamp- box says 45 watts but there are three 18 watt bulbs you must use (totaling 54 watts).     Item description also claims there are 1, 2, and 3 minute timers. This item has only 2 and 3 minute timers or continuous.     It also does not appear to look like the picture... item is MUCH larger and seems more like a double sized one.</li>
            <li> This light is a joke if you&#x27;re looking to use with OPI soak off gels.  The product NEVER cures even after an HOUR!!! What a mess it leaves you with.  I am no UV light authority but this is a horrible purchase for the OPI gel line.</li>
            <li> A UV lamp is a UV lamp.  Probably all lamps this size are created about equal, but what I love about this one is the handle on top!  It makes it so easy to move around the table as you are polishing someone&#x27;s nails.  I would have liked a timer of 10 seconds instead of just 1, 2 or 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this Automatic Gel UV Light Nail Dryer and when I tried to use it, it worked for the first 10 seconds then was intermittent there after.  Then, it didn&#x27;t work at all anymore after that.  I guess there was a short or something in it.  I contacted the company and sent it back on their dime, and they refunded my cost.  I&#x27;m happy they worked with me but not happy I had to go through it not working and sending it back.  I would not recommend buying this.  If you are shellacking your nails, you should buy the CND UV Nail Dryer.  It costs a bit more but it&#x27;s reliable.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT value ....it is professional grade light/dryer.  I am using the gel nail polish and it cures it perfect!!  There are others on the market for 2 and 3 times this price that aren&#x27;t as good!  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this light to use with CND Shellac nail system.  It works great!  It has a 2/3/5 minute timer on the top. This is a nice feature that I failed to notice when ordering. It is reasonably priced and does the job - well. If you are using this with the Shellac system remember to follow all instructions about finishing the manicure - use isopropal alcohol at the end and the tackiness will go away - that has nothing to do with the light.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do my own at home \\&quot;shellac\\&quot; manicures.  Love it!  Was inexpensive and works great!  It is pretty large in size though so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this uv light because of the reviews I read here.  I had been searching for a long time for a light with all these features including the 1 min, 2 min and 3 min timers.  When I received the unit the box \\&quot;said\\&quot;  1 min, 2 min and 3 minute timers, but the actual light has 2 min, 3 min and 5 min.!  not the 1 minute that I need the most! I will probably return the lamp because the 1 min timer is so important to the services that I offer.</li>
            <li> I tried the light with CND shellac product and it works great!  Love the CND shellac polishes too.  They are saying that the darker colors of Shellac are harder to cure, I haven&#x27;t tried those yet.  I will let you know how it works when I use the darker colors.</li>
            <li> I bought it for home use.  It works great for me. The price was right and I am happy with it. [[ASIN:B001BNLDQA Automatic Gel Uv Light Nail Dryer Par418 Single]]</li>
            <li> After getting a couple shellac manicures I decided to invest in my own home manicure set up and this light works great for doing your own nails. Fits one hand or foot just fine and has 2/3/5 minute timers. I won&#x27;t go past 2 minutes so don&#x27;t see a need for the other two really. Item was packaged well, with all 4 light bulbs, very easy to install the light bulbs and wa-lah - good to go! I just could not see spending over $150 on one of these lights for home use so bought this one. It works the same as the one at my local salon with one exception - no fan. Maybe that&#x27;s the additional cost of the higher priced one and someday I may decide to spend that kind of money, but for a 2 minute curing this light is great. If you are into the new gel or shellac style manicures to grow your own nails long and strong it&#x27;s worth the investment! You&#x27;ll spend the same amount of money in 2-3 months as you will on setting up your own home manicure kit. I do feel bad for my manicurist so I&#x27;ll probably still go see her for pedicures!</li>
            <li> On a second time I tryed to use this UV light lamps wouldn&#x27;t work at all or only one lamp would light up. After i tryed to return it the Blue Planet woldn&#x27;t sent me a free return barcode or anything like it as it says on amazon.com return policy. And on top of that they charged me RE STOCK FEE afound 25 dollars witch they subtracted from my refund! So returns not as easy as they say!</li>
            <li> This nail dryer does it&#x27;s job perfectly! It wasn&#x27;t extremely expensive, but it&#x27;s a great machine. It&#x27;s like a mini tanning bed. Easy set up &amp; use. It has 3 different timing options to choose from and cuts off after the time you choose. I can now so gel nails from home instead of paying $30 at a salon.</li>
            <li> very unhappy with this purchase it takes more than 5 minutes to dry your gel, i am planning buying the opi light to see if it does the work</li>
            <li> It blew all bulbs at once and after replacing all bulbs at a cost of $50.00 it still does not work.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do my own gel nails at home. It was a geat price. It only fits one hand or foot at a time. And it does get a little hot once your hand is in there but tolerable. Overall, great item.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my salon uses.  I&#x27;ve saved so much money doing my our gel manicures and pedicures.  I highly recommend this lamp!</li>
            <li> Works good. I usually run an additional 3-5 minutes on the last (top) coat. This seems to provide the best cure.</li>
            <li> One of the bulbs wasn&#x27;t working when it came.  I didn&#x27;t feel like returning it so I kept it.  Maybe because one of the bulbs wasn&#x27;t working or maybe because it isn&#x27;t any good, my nails never dried properly.  I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This UV light worked once before it stopped. Very disappointed. And then it costs a lot to send it back to get it fixed. Better off getting a different UV light. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received my light 2 days after I ordered it :). It came with the 4 bulbs and once I installed them and plugged it in it worked perfectly. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I did leave it on for a bit and put my hand in and felt the warmth so I am pretty sure it will be fine. Also in the direction booklet it says that it is covered by a 1 year warranty, you just have to cover the $14 shipping &amp; handling.. so that makes me feel better! It&#x27;s definitely worth the price and I am happy with my purchase &amp; seller. I got mine from loveotc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-update-&lt;br /&gt;i did finally use it and it worked just fine. i am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Had mine for over a year now and it still works great. I just have one bulb that I&#x27;ve always had to re secure every time.</li>
            <li> When I got this the size surprised me, it was bigger then I expected. I guess because my friend had one that was much smaller but you could only fit a few fingers under hers. This worked perfectly! you can paint your whole hand(or foot) put it in there and bam beautiful nails. Definatley saves on time. Lights worked great and now my nails will always be beautiful!</li>
            <li> Works great with shellac. Def worth it! The 2 hand dryer cuts down about half of the time if you are applying shellac.  This dryer works just as good as the CND dryer which is $150.</li>
            <li> This unit dries quickly.  I had a problem with one of the bulbs and after some discussion with AJChoice, they sent me a replacement bulb.  I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> It works very well to dry fingernail polish.  I got it to see if&lt;br /&gt;this would help my wife having itchy red fingers with dry scaley&lt;br /&gt;skin.  Twice a week 2-3 minutes, gone.  Check with your doctor.&lt;br /&gt;Also m ore often use or longer time exposure .. not wise.  Again&lt;br /&gt;ask the doctor.</li>
            <li> then there was smoke! I turned it off immediatly! I let it cool off and tried again, but only one bulb worked. 3 of the 4 bulbs just stopped working. I will be sending it back!</li>
            <li> Low product quality, was used only 3 times for 3 minutes each time, and now no longer works.&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift for my wife, I am very disappointed, after bringing the product to service said the lights were burned.&lt;br /&gt;Try with any other product, except this one!</li>
            <li> this is great for curing fake nails. im really happy with this product. would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Light didn&#x27;t work properly and most the time wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. DO MOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s this devise or the gel, but it doesn&#x27;t dry. Not in 3 minutes, not in 3 hours!</li>
            <li> i got this light when i went to nail school and loved it so of corse i had to find me another one and did so on here very happy with it and love that there is diff times on it very easy to use. and easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> I use this for my CND brisa lite gel nails.  This works very well and the price is right! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully for curing my gel (Shellac and CND) manis and pedis.  It has an on off switch and 3 settings.  I use the 2 minute setting to cure each layer and it always turns out perfectly!  I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and do my nails ~1/week (because I get bored of the color, not because it&#x27;s peeling) and I haven&#x27;t needed to replace the bulbs yet!  I&#x27;ve also allowed friends to use when they come over and they want to do a regular polish.  It works well for that applications too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and cannot live without it when I am doing my gel manicures. I also use it to quickly dry my neice&#x27;s nails when I am giving them a regular nail polish manicure. My hand fits perfectly in there and can even put my other hand on top of one do dry both hands at once. It is very roomy. I have had this product for about 2 years now and have yet had to replace any bulbs.</li>
            <li> I had read a review where the reviewer had warned the buying public that the dryer had malfuctioned right after the purchase but I decided to just give the product the benefit of the doubt. I wish I had moved on and bought a different product as after six months of use, the dryer is just broken. I regret having purchased this product and will really take into account negative reviews in the future as there is definitely truth to them. Caveat emptor - buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave feedback, but tend to make purchasing decision based on the feedback I read, so I thought I should do it on this product since it&#x27;s a big investment.    I purchased this product based on a few ladies saying that it worked with CND Shellac. I recently had my first Shellac manicure and immediately came home to purchase my own products. After all, if you can paint your nails you can do this. I figure after about 5 polish changes I&#x27;ll have my money back, plus I don&#x27;t have to find time to make it to the salon.    Here&#x27;s what I did for Shellac:  First I prepared my nails as they state on the CND Shellac wesite (removing cuticles, etc.)  Then I used the scrub fresh to disinfect and dehydrate the nails. The thing I really like about Shellac is that there is no need to remove the nails natural shine so you&#x27;re not using a file anywhere on the nails (other than to shape them).  After the nails are prepared I used the base coat, applying a very thin coat after shaking vigorously for 2 minutes. Curing them under the light for 30 seconds each hand.  The next step was the color. I used the Negligee because I like the natural french look. Again a very thin coat after vigorously shaking. Cure for 2 minutes under the lights. Then repeat for two coats of color. It did find that each layer remained sticky.  The last step was to apply the top coat. I was surprised at how thick this product was. It was a little more of a challenge to get a thin coat. The important part is to have a good seal at the edge of the nail to prevent lifting and peeling. The top coat is cured for 2 minutes. When I removed my hand I assumed that the final layer would be hard and cured, but it was tacky like the rest of the coats.  Following the Shellac directions I then wiped the top coat off with a microfiber cloth soaked in 70% isopropyl alcohol. Their directions say to use 99%, but the 70% worked just fine for me. I think the important thing is to do this with the lint free cloth. Once Iwas done wiping down the nails they were hard and shinny. Something in the alcohol must finish the curing process.   I finished by applying a vitamin E oil to my cuticle. Washed hands and done.    I also used this light to help dry regular polish and it did a great job.</li>
            <li> it doesn´t really dry, and i leave it twice longer than other lamps. too bulky</li>
            <li> some bulbs dont work its a piece of junk. im thinking of returning it. i do not like it a</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter along with the base coat and top coat.  She used it immediately after installing the bulbs and she loved it!  Her nails look great.</li>
            <li> This lamps definetely does work with shellac products, it cures them well. My only complaint is that timer buttons are2, 3, or 5 minutes instead or 1,2 or 4 as stated in box. But you could turn it off sooner if you like</li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone who is in search for a good affordable light.  I have bought this and am very pleased with using it solely for Shellac.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lamp in hopes that I would be able to do my own nails at home.  It came very promptly - but without the bulbs!  So, if you want a UV lamp that actually works, look elsewhere...</li>
            <li> I did a lot of shopping around to find the right UV Lamp to do CND Shellac manicures at home.  My first instinct was to buy CND&#x27;s lamp, but for almost $100 more than this lamp, it was hard to convince myself that it would be that much better.  The main differences that I saw were that the CND lamp had a fan, a finger separating tray, a bulb replacement indicator and a programmable timer.  After purchasing and using the Thermal Spa lamp, I realized that it&#x27;s really not that hot, so the fan is kind of a luxury more than a necessity.  The tray is unnecessary as well, since it&#x27;s really not that hard to set your hand down without your fingers touching.  The bulb replacement indicator would have been nice, but I imagine that when my bulbs burn out I&#x27;ll be able to see that they&#x27;re not on anymore.  As far as the programmable timer, I just use the timer on my cell phone for the base coat (10 to 30 sec) and use the built-in 2 min timer for the color and top coats.  A longer cord would have been nice, but it definitely was not worth the extra money.  I also like how small it is so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my apt.  The lights are placed perfectly to hit the top and sides of the nails.  I also received four 9 watt bulbs with the lamp so I did not need to order those separately.  Here is what I did:  Pushed back my cuticles and filed my nails to shape  Cleaned the nails with 91% Isopropyl Alcohol  Applied the base coat and cured for 30 sec (you can probably do 10 sec.  Even though the base is cured, it will still feel tacky)  Applied the color coat and cured for 2 min  Applied the second color coat and cured for 2 min  Applied the top coat and cured for 2 min  Wiped the nails with 91% Isopropyl Alcohol to remove the tackiness  Make sure to swipe the nail&#x27;s free edge and remove any shellac that gets under the nail or on the skin before curing.  Isopropyl Alcohol will help clean up any excees shellac.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this lamp.  I&#x27;m sure the CND lamp is just as good, if not better, but this one gets the job done for the right price.  Happy shellacking!</li>
            <li> I like to be able to paint my nails with Shellac myself.  It saves me time and money.  I also purchased gloves to protect my skin from the UV light.</li>
            <li> cures every kind of gel very fast it is big enough for feet also. Lights are long lasting, has been almost a year and it is working perfectly</li>
            <li> Would be better with a fan, but over it was good.  I ended up not using it very much and gave it away.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery... The machine look exactly as the one in the pic and also is working super fine ... I&#x27;m very happy with my machine I love it thanks</li>
            <li> my oldest daughter gave this Thermal Spa to my youngest daughter as a xmas gift this past December.  since then she has used it on a couple of occassions when home from college and it has worked well.  She was so excited until tonight.  We went out and spent $$ on new gel polishes since she wanted to use the dryer for the THIRD TIME  and as she was getting ready to apply her second coat the dryer just turned off!!!!! the look on my babies face was heart wrenching!!!.  HOW  could this dryer just DIE ON THE THIRD USE!!!!!! WE ARE NOT HAPPY CAMPERS!!!!!!  I am a loyal Amazon customer but usually do not bother with writing reviews. But this situation warranted a BIG DISAPPOINTING  REVIEW.....this unit isnt cheap in price and one would think it would last a little longer than just 3 uses.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say but it did not do the job at all. It is not bright enough and took 20 times turning it on to make it work. Not happy at all with it and do not sugest buying it.</li>
            <li> Have used for several months. I do gel nails every 2-3 weeks. Built great, works well and good price. Very satisfied with this gel dryer.</li>
            <li> I am new to Gel nails.  I had them done professionally a few times and was not very happy with the job the nail tech did.  She left very large margins on the three sides of my nails, near the cuticles.  I thought for the price of $25.00, that I should look into doing my own nails.  Well, I purchased this UV light dryer and the Gelish basic starter kit.  I did a french manicure on myself three weeks ago (and it is still presentable)!  My friends and family all want me to do their nails now.  This UV light works great!  I am very happy with it.  I followed the directions very closely that came with the Gel kit.  I have a very professional looking french manicure as a result.  If you can polish your own nails, I highly recommend this unit.  I also did an extensive on-line research on other brands and models of UV lights, before I purchased this unit.  I am glad that I did and I along with many others are very satisfied consumers!</li>
            <li> I bought this uv light to cure CND Shellac. It works great. Just as powerful as CND&#x27;s light. I am not sure about durability, but it seems to be well built. The manufacturer is geared toward professional nail spas so I am hoping it will stand the test of time. The Shellac cured quickly under this lamp. I can&#x27;t justify spending over twice as much for the same thing from CND. Worked for mani and pedi. Timer was right on. Remember that you need to rub off the sticky residue with alcohol when you are done to bring out shellac&#x27;s shine and take away the tackiness.</li>
            <li> This unit is perfect for UV Gel nails and will save you $100&#x27;s of dollars a year in salon trips. It takes less than 3 mins per coat to dry. Gel Cleanser and Anti UV Gloves highly recommended too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Thermal Spa Gel UV Light Nail Dryer (36 Watts) for curing shellac nail polish. Not ever taking any cosmetology classes I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was strong enough to have the same effect as the ones in a nail salon. However, it does work! I invested in several bottles of shellac polish and do my own nails ALL THE TIME. It has paid for itself MANY times over considering how much they charge at the salons($30+)each visit. Have had it for a couple years now and all of the bulbs are still working and have no problems with it. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Turned it on when first purchased. Then didn&#x27;t use it for 5 months. It came on as before but quickly turned off. I readjusted bulbs, etc. Never worked again. Too late to return. Buy another product.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble, easy to use, great price, great quality. No complaints here!! I would reccommend this to anyone. In fact, I did! And she bought it too :)</li>
            <li> It ok not that fast to dry</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Works great.  Saving lots of money over having nails done.  Using cotton gloves with sunscreen to protect hands.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift 2 years ago as my wife likes to do her nails quite frequently, and always had to just let them air dry (for hours).&lt;br /&gt;According to her it works great and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to cure gel/shellac nails.  When it arrived, there were NO instructions.  I plugged it in and nothing happened.  Looking through the box again, I found the bulbs in a cardboard sleeve in the bottom of the box.  (I had thought that was merely extra packing.)  The bulbs are difficult to install because you have to line up the prongs exactly with the holes, and it is a pretty tight fit trying to get your hand in there to do this.  You can&#x27;t push too hard or it will bend the prongs.  The bulbs do not stay securely in the unit.  They are constantly going off, so I am wondering how long these will be functional.  If the bulbs die, I will get rid of this and buy a better product.  Although it did the job perfectly for the one time I have used it, I would not buy this unit again.</li>
            <li> The unit works well.  I bought it for doing gel manicures at home.  Having just the one unit obviously requires twice as much time which I don&#x27;t always have.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I purched it because of another person&#x27;s review and have not been disapointed.  The reviews are very helpful.</li>
            <li> The light came with bulb and it does have a time which is helpful. It work wonderfully with the Gelish product and is a decent size to storage. I like that you can dettach the power cord from the dryer.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this! I am not a pro nail tech by any means, but I like to do my nails myself. This UV light does the trick! I&#x27;m still getting used to working with the gel polish, but the light works great every time. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my do-it-myself at home gelish manis and regualr pedis! I have pretty wide feet and I can even fit both sets of toes in if I&#x27;m really careful. Love the 3 time settings..2, 3, and 5.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. Great product that works as advertised. I&#x27;ve done my own nails and my friends nails hundreds of times and no issues to report. Great buy.</li>
            <li> read instructions. put bulbs in as instructed only thing that worked was the flashing lights for time selections.  very disapointing had planned a day of vacation with daughter to do nail and pamper ourselfs. AS I HAVE SAID I AM VERY DISAPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. EXPECT BETTER FROM AMAZON.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I started doing my own nails at home when I just couldn&#x27;t stand wasting so much money to get my nails done. I had fallen in love with gel and went to sallys to but some. Buying a uv off line was cheeper than buying one in stores. This uv works wonderfully and i would recommend the seller and product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thought the design of this item was very nifty, but the poor construction and/or parts made it trash. Two of the 4 bulb sockets (the top ones) were so loose, that even with the provided brackets the bulbs would not stay in the sockets. Effectively, they could not click in to place and make the electrical connection required to light up. Product returned.</li>
