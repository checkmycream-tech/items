            <li>It made my skin so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when a good sized bottle of this stuff came to me in the mail.</li>
            <li>This works just as well removes all the wax and just glides on the skin easy to wash it off with mild soap and water.</li>
            <li>It is nothing special.</li>

            <li>I really recommend it for anyone prone to irritation from shaving.</li>

            <li>Even the blue colour is natural!</li>
            <li>actually said no thanks the first time.</li>
            <li>The spray bottle design delivers a light, even mist, so it also lasts quite a long time - I &#x27;ve been using mine after every shave/wax/laser treatment for over a month, and the bottle is hardly gone.  </li>
            <li>My husband has very thick fast growing facial hair and has recently been getting razor burn and a very irritated neck from constantly shaving.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin, so stayed away from harsh chemical hair removers due to redness &amp; rash; I couldn&#x27;t go out several days after waxing because of the red marks.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It works wonders to remove &amp; break down my deodorant since my deodorant is quite waterproof &amp; it ends up smearing all over my body and leaving a nasty residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I use azulene oil after waxing to get rid of any wax residue. This worked as intended.</li>
            <li> This product is my 4th so far. I like the fact it smooth the skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product so I could wax my legs and bikini area with as little pain as possible. I&#x27;m not a big fan of pain, but I am a huge fan of waxing as it lasts longer for me than shaving does. A little goes a long way for me and I apply small areas to my legs and bikini areas prior to waxing. I don&#x27;t see where it keeps the hairs from growing, but it does make ingrown hairs a thing of the past for me.</li>
            <li> I use this product after waxing with MOOM SUGAR WAX and I put this on every night and it keeps me from getting ingrown hairs and red dots.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Quickly calms and soothes freshly shaved/depilitated/waxed skin. Eliminates redness and soreness. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an oil/lotion to apply after body shaving. Haven&#x27;t found a great product yet. I bought this based primarily on reviews. After using it for weeks now...I can not write a high review. It is nothing special. It is oily. I have not noticed any reduced redness/bumps/ingrown hairs. It is too expensive...for nothing new.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I ran out of Azulene oil t remove wax post waxing. This works just as well removes all the wax and just glides on the skin easy to wash it off with mild soap and water.</li>
            <li> i love that is doesn&#x27;t smell bad! or like weird chemicals!  works pretty good.. its soothing after waxing.. would recommend:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It takes off all the wax that was left behind and leaves my skin smooth for days.</li>
            <li> Halfway through this in a quick amount of time.  It has not helped yet....</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Its natural &amp; works.  I use 4 to sprays per leg.  2 sprays bikini line  2 under arm.</li>
            <li> Have used this oil a long time and love it, it soothes burn from waxing or shaving</li>
            <li> Like the product but the top was loose in the box and about a third of the product had leaked out.</li>
            <li> For me, whether you use Parissa waxes or not (but if you don&#x27;t, you really should!) you should also use this Azulene Oil. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since I started waxing a few years ago and I love it! There&#x27;s no weird smell because it doesn&#x27;t have weird chemicals in it, it&#x27;s a natural product! I did some research and it turns out that the reason it&#x27;s so calming is because it&#x27;s made from the chamomile plant. Even the blue colour is natural! It&#x27;s just what happens during the process. It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I use it all the time--even for tasks like taking a sticky tag off a product! It just removes stickyness well, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Great. I am happy with the results so far and plan to continue using it! The spray bottle makes it easier to apply with less mess.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> My laser hair removal place uses that aloe vera in a bottle and that stuff causes me to be more inflamed than using nothing at all.  This azulene oil is the best.  Keeps the inflammation and itching down and I think helps my legs heal faster post treatment.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff. It is perfect for preventing razor burn and makes my skin feel great after shaving. I cannot shave without this stuff anymore. My husband has very thick fast growing facial hair and has recently been getting razor burn and a very irritated neck from constantly shaving. He is in the military and must have a clean shaven face at all times. Well his hair grows so fast that he literally has to shave twice a day as to not get in trouble with the military. I told him about this stuff I always use after shaving and he was skeptical. actually said no thanks the first time. I finally got him to put it on his neck after shaving and now he asks for it. This stuff is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This works OK, not perfect. But it&#x27;s pretty good. I would try a different product next time, but not throwing it out either.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t actually sure how much 2 oz was, and was a little worried that it might not be much at all. I was pleasantly surprised when a good sized bottle of this stuff came to me in the mail. Azulene oil is great after waxing to help soothe irritated spots. Glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Turns yours skin dark but really slows down the growth of hair. Perfect for bikini lines. One spray goes a long way. One spritz can even cover an entire leg.</li>
            <li> Parissa&#x27;s azulene oil is of much better quality than what usually comes in waxing kits. The spray bottle makes it easier to apply with less mess.</li>
            <li> Light and convenient for spraying on. I am happy with the results so far &amp; plan to continue using it!</li>
            <li> If you wax you must have this in handy. Works better than baby oil or vaseline. I use i all the time, since i wax everything armpits, legs, bikinis, etc. however do not use it for intimate parts such as in a brazilian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps, it&#x27;s soothing and helps not to have ingrown hairs. it&#x27;s a litlle greasy but it washes right off, i recommend leaving it on for at least half hour.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so stayed away from harsh chemical hair removers due to redness &amp; rash; I couldn&#x27;t go out several days after waxing because of the red marks. Azulene is so soothing, no burning or tingling. I reapply many times on my face after hair removal, and my skin looks and feels great. Let it soak in first, then reapply. I have recommended to all my friends. If you are in the beauty/cosmetic industry you would already know about it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I&#x27;m allergic to nickle, the main metal in most razors. This oil is the ONLY thing that prevents me from getting razor burn, dry patches, or itchiness after shaving. A little goes a long way, and this little bottle lasted me about a year. I really recommend it for anyone prone to irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly after I shave to prevent ingrown hair and to remove my deodorant everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders to remove &amp; break down my deodorant since my deodorant is quite waterproof &amp; it ends up smearing all over my body and leaving a nasty residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well to remove excess wax after waxing.</li>
            <li> This is designed to sooth your skin and discourage hair regrowth after tweezing, epilation or shaving.  It works and is readily absorbed into the skin.  Compared to some other products it is fairly inexpensive.  Based on Camomile extract and some other compounds.  It is blue in color but does not stain.</li>
            <li> This product has a really nice, non-greasy feel and light floral smell.  The spray bottle design delivers a light, even mist, so it also lasts quite a long time - I &#x27;ve been using mine after every shave/wax/laser treatment for over a month, and the bottle is hardly gone.  Although I saw a reduction in the amount of ingrown hairs (I am VERY, VERY prone to them), it certainly didn&#x27;t eliminate them.  All in all, I would suggest this product, especially for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Great product. I  use this to remove makeup since I don&#x27;t use soap or any other cleanser on my face.</li>
            <li> when I was waxing I loved this product.  It made my skin so silky smooth.  I loved touching my skin after using it.</li>
