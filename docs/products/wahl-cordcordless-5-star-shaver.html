            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Top of the line Remington and two Norelco&#x27;s in my life time.</li>
            <li>After using this for about a month, I still like it much better than the Braun that I had.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because I should&#x27;ve known better.</li>
            <li>outstanding if you save your head, this is the one</li>
            <li>My son &amp; I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S GREAT AND REALLY, REALLY HELP ME WITH MY FACE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll enjoy the close shaves and keep my Braun handy for trimming.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Gives you a great, smooth shave and is easy, convenient &amp; quick to use.</li>
            <li>smh and so easy</li>
            <li>Nice first time cut.</li>
            <li>Wahl is the best men&#x27;s electric razor in terms of value hands down.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly fine and meet all my expectations.  </li>
            <li>In the cheap, plastic-y housing, the vibration is obnoxious.</li>
            <li>Appears to be a good buy, please with results thus far</li>
            <li>So far this is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Very powerful shaver.</li>
            <li>These are not the original.</li>
            <li>The original have a blade on the rear to trim with.</li>
            <li>Gets my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>NO BUMPS CLEAN SHAVER</li>
            <li>Would recommend to African American men as an excellent grooming tool.</li>
            <li>Excellent razor, and for the price is impossible to find an electric razor with this kind od closeness.</li>
            <li>Does not shave as good as a wet razor</li>
            <li>Too powerful, in fact.</li>
            <li>Shave clean though there was initial reaction of my skin but got better with consistent use.</li>
            <li>love it so easy to shave now with out the mess of hair all over the sink.....</li>
            <li>Shaves really close!</li>
            <li>It is a little noisy, but I tolerate it for that kind of shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves closer than my old Braun, using large cutters and a powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Battery life is also very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaver does not cut well around chin and jaw, it takes several passes to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Fiance absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Using the super close foil you have to learn to just barely touch your skin surface.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd Wahl Shaver,and I&#x27;m sure it will not be my last.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>Not only did it not work very well</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It took me weeks to clear up razor bumps that I got from only two uses of this.</li>
            <li>The only CON is: It&#x27;s louder than the old one and doesn&#x27;t have a side burn trimmer, which none of them compare to scissors.</li>

            <li> The shaver is loud compared to other units.</li>
            <li> As long as they continue to be made here in the U.S.A. ,I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> If beard is to long shaver will not cut.</li>
            <li> Unless, you bare down on your skin.</li>
            <li> had to return the product my husband started using them for about ten or so minutes they were cutting fine</li>
            <li> It gives you a sharp pain and doesn&#x27;t get all facial hair.</li>
            <li> Does not cut as close as expected , I still have to use depilatory or other alternative for spots that are missed using this product.</li>
            <li> Updated 4/26/2015, after 50 uses the foils are worn thru which are sharp and cuts skin.</li>
            <li> , I like to square off my sideburns every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Now, since everybody&#x27;s skin is different, I can&#x27;t recommend/not recommend this shaver, but if you suffer from razor bumps (or potential razor bumps), I&#x27;d suggest that you think very hard before purchasing this..........</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s made in America and is a lot less $$ in the unit and parts.</li>
            <li> I had to figure out the black plate on front of unit,, is a slide on and off switch.</li>
            <li> Left hairs uncut and the foil chipped after third use.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My beard is heavy, and I can shave twice aday.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t trim clean for crap.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday, sometimes twice a day and after two days I can see hair growth on my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> My son used it the first time, and was left with a lot of bumps and horrible irritation on his face.</li>
            <li> Be very careful using this product!!!</li>
            <li> ive wasted my money...and there is no good custumer service.</li>
            <li> , it caused serious inflammation bumps on my neck.</li>
            <li> it no good</li>
            <li> Really bad product,it shaves uneven and irritates skin when i try to shave unfinished places...</li>
            <li> and i just have a month with it its really sad tha</li>
            <li> then all of asudden they just quit cutting altogether</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad shaver</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed about how inferior quality of it.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it had to buy another for a family member.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. It gives you a sharp pain and doesn&#x27;t get all facial hair. It takes a lot longer with Wahl cord to shave rather then razer. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are not the original. The original have a blade on the rear to trim with.</li>
            <li> Appears to be a good buy, please with results thus far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Top of the line Remington and two Norelco&#x27;s in my life time. None of them gave me as close of a shave as a razor blade. Unless, you bare down on your skin. My beard is heavy, and I can shave twice aday. The Wahl shaver I&#x27;ve used for about 18 years and gave me a shave as close as a blade would. The batteries gave out as well as the cord. I&#x27;ve gone through 3 blades &amp; 4 foils which come in different thickness. Using the super close foil you have to learn to just barely touch your skin surface. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll distroy the foil and your skin. The only CON is: It&#x27;s louder than the old one and doesn&#x27;t have a side burn trimmer, which none of them compare to scissors. Plus it&#x27;s made in America and is a lot less $$ in the unit and parts.</li>
            <li> After using this for about a month, I still like it much better than the Braun that I had.  The shaves are closer and the wider head enables me to shave faster.  Keeping the touch light on the face provides the best shave.  I still keep my Braun around for the trimmer which is the only feature this shaver lacks.  Battery life is also very good.&lt;br /&gt;  Pamela&#x27;s husband</li>
            <li> Gets my skin super smooth. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Shaver does not cut as close as I thought, when it does it takes several passes.</li>
            <li> This gave me the worst breakout of razor bumps on my bald head that I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because I should&#x27;ve known better. I normally only use electric clippers to shave my head. But I bought this because I wanted a closer, &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; look. That was a mistake. It took me weeks to clear up razor bumps that I got from only two uses of this. Now, since everybody&#x27;s skin is different, I can&#x27;t recommend/not recommend this shaver, but if you suffer from razor bumps (or potential razor bumps), I&#x27;d suggest that you think very hard before purchasing this..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;either that or stock up on the warm rags and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t trim clean for crap. Don&#x27;t buy this garbage.</li>
            <li> Best shavers on the planet!</li>
            <li> love it so easy to shave now with out the mess of hair all over the sink.....smh and so easy</li>
            <li> Does not shave as good as a wet razor</li>
            <li> Awesome! Shave clean though there was initial reaction of my skin but got better with consistent use. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I have coarse gray hair for a beard and it does not cut enough. I used it everyday, sometimes twice a day and after two days I can see hair growth on my face! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t find out why it&#x27;s not for sale in CA. My best guess is some restriction on NiCad batteries.</li>
            <li> Close shave&lt;br /&gt;Smooth face no bumps.  Would recommend to African American men as an excellent grooming tool. Buy it! Nice</li>
            <li> outstanding if you save your head, this is the one</li>
            <li> it no good the you need to take this product out of store</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that this shaver would give me a close shave without the irritation. Not only did it not work very well, it caused serious inflammation bumps on my neck. I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad shaver, I&#x27;m just saying it didn&#x27;t work for me. If you have sensitive skin Id probably avoid this one.</li>
            <li> Wahl Cord/Cordless 5 Star Shaver met my expectation to the highest. Thank you</li>
            <li> My son &amp; I love this shaver. Works perfectly fine and meet all my expectations.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Wahl Shaver,and I&#x27;m sure it will not be my last.As long as they continue to be made here in the U.S.A. ,I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Really bad product,it shaves uneven and irritates skin when i try to shave unfinished places...and i just have a month with it its really sad tha ive wasted my money...and there is no good custumer service.</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S GREAT AND REALLY, REALLY HELP ME WITH MY FACE NO BUMPS CLEAN SHAVER</li>
            <li> Good timing on the delivery, the item is what they said it is. It works grate.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  My husband had one over 10 years ago, which he totally wore out.  I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice first time cut. The shaver is loud compared to other units. I had to figure out the black plate on front of unit,, is a slide on and off switch. Good thing my son&#x27;s were not here, they would have said; dah! So far this is a good shaver. Updated 4/26/2015, after 50 uses the foils are worn thru which are sharp and cuts skin. If beard is to long shaver will not cut. Shaver does not cut well around chin and jaw, it takes several passes to get a smooth shave. I&#x27;m not satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> Very powerful shaver. Great battery life.</li>
            <li> Gives you a great, smooth shave and is easy, convenient &amp; quick to use. Doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin &amp; decreases razor bumps. I would recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Received item as described bought it for work, it works great berly had to charge it after having it for 2wks. Im happy with it</li>
            <li> Fiance absolutely loves it. If he is on the go he takes it with him just to freshen up. Great buy!</li>
            <li> How can I give 3 stars but not recommend this shaver? I give it 4 stars for doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do, shave close, and doing it well. But it lacks a trimmer, which is a necessity for me, I like to square off my sideburns every other day or so. It shaves closer than my old Braun, using large cutters and a powerful motor. Too powerful, in fact. In the cheap, plastic-y housing, the vibration is obnoxious. I should return it, but I already tossed the packaging. I&#x27;ll enjoy the close shaves and keep my Braun handy for trimming.</li>
            <li> had to return the product my husband started using them for about ten or so minutes they were cutting fine then all of asudden they just quit cutting altogether so we had to return them and in the process of getting a refund i wish they worked really liked them. should of read all reviews before purchasing</li>
            <li> I bought this wahl cordless and I was disappointed about how inferior quality of it. I couldn&#x27;t finish shaving before it broke into pieces. I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it. My second one within 4 years.</li>
            <li> IT CUTS MY HUSBAND AND SONS FACE WHEN THEY USE IT...</li>
            <li> Love it! Shaves really close!</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, and for the price is impossible to find an electric razor with this kind od closeness. Wahl is the best men&#x27;s electric razor in terms of value hands down. It is a little noisy, but I tolerate it for that kind of shave.</li>
            <li> Works great ! It lasted a good month before I had to plug it in to charge .</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this shaver! Left hairs uncut and the foil chipped after third use. Be very careful using this product!!!</li>
            <li> Does not cut as close as expected , I still have to use depilatory or other alternative for spots that are missed using this product.</li>
            <li> This Shaver did not work at all. My son used it the first time, and was left with a lot of bumps and horrible irritation on his face. It took several weeks for it to go away. The bumps even got infected where they were running; he had to seek medical attention. We will not be ordering this product again, and we do not recommend it to anyone. In fact, we are currently waiting on a refund, which we have been waiting for almost 2 weeks. I wonder if we will ever get the refund.</li>
