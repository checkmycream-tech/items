            <li>Great item!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; drops are the most soothing of all, and Systane&#x27;s are the best.</li>
            <li>The company provided good service</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than eye drops.  </li>
            <li>Love these gel drops better than the ultra drops.</li>
            <li>I have some pretty significant eye issues and these are the best drops I have found (and I have tried LOTS) for day use and also for right before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>Systane is the best over other brands.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery of exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I sleep comfortably and wake up with refreshed eyes.  </li>
            <li>Great eye drops for dry eyes.</li>
            <li>and sometimes once more in the middle of the night at most.  </li>
            <li>I would not have been able to drive with such blurred vision and was fortunate that I didn&#x27;t use the drops right out of the drug store.</li>
            <li>With this product, I can put them in right before bed</li>
            <li>I found the gel drops much more to my liking -- I just apply a drop to my finger and put it in the corner of each eye; the gel does the rest of the work, spreading it evenly over the entire eye.</li>
            <li>good lubrication for my dry eyes but not as good as I expected from the other reviews.</li>
            <li>The drops are effective but are a little sticky feeling at first.</li>
            <li>Much better than Systane Ulta and Systane Balance if you have very dry eyes.</li>
            <li>Anyway this works very well.</li>
            <li>it caused blurred vision, very blurred vision.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have problems during the day with dryness, but have found this to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>gentle, reduces ocular irritation</li>
            <li>Much easier to use drops at a dinner, or a client meeting than having to fool around with the ointment.  </li>
            <li>I find the gel drops are so much better than other drops I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>These drops work great for my dry eyes, which had resulted in sore, red patches at the outside corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my doctor to use Systane Gel during the day and to use the Systan Lubricant Gel Overnight Therapy at night.</li>
            <li>They have a slightly slippery feel to them, but that&#x27;s likely why they&#x27;re effective.  </li>
            <li>My eyes feel so much better than they had in the past.</li>
            <li>:  Causes blurred vision for nearly an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Sight is blurry for a little while, but worth it!</li>
            <li>I have certain ones that I prefer depending on how dry my eyes are.</li>
            <li>These drops really work well for dry eye.</li>
            <li>They do cause temporary blurring, though, so I simply use them right before I go to sleep (without contacts in), and that is enough to have cleared up my dry eye problem throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li>The same gel that soothed also blurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered using the drops at night before retiring to bed and hope that I had no need to see anything clearly for a hour.</li>
            <li>I frequently use this product for dry eyes</li>

            <li> These drops work great for my dry eyes, which had resulted in sore, red patches at the outside corners of my eyes. I wear contacts, so my one negative comment is that neither the packaging or insert indicates whether they can be used while wearing contacts. They do cause temporary blurring, though, so I simply use them right before I go to sleep (without contacts in), and that is enough to have cleared up my dry eye problem throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li> I have the medical diagnosis of Dry Eye. I use these drops at night in lieu of an ointment. The drop is extra thick and soothing.</li>
            <li> Recommend by my eye doctor.  I use these during the day and the eye gel at night.  A lot easier to use than the tube gel which I could never quite get into my eye.  Anyway this works very well.</li>
            <li> These drops really work well for dry eye. Use them all day long.</li>
            <li> No good.  Irritated the eyes very badly.  Need to return</li>
            <li> I find the gel drops are so much better than other drops I&#x27;ve used. My eyes feel so much better than they had in the past. The company provided good service</li>
            <li> good lubrication for my dry eyes but not as good as I expected from the other reviews.</li>
            <li> If severely dry eyes is an issue for you, try these drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel form does make a difference and extended relief is the pay off with these drops.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery of exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I frequently use this product for dry eyes</li>
            <li> Perfect amount of lubrication.</li>
            <li> I have dry eye disease, and this was recommended by the ophthalmologist.  It works well because it is thick, and I use it in conjunction with prescription drops.</li>
            <li> PROs:  Soothes the eyes immediately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:  Causes blurred vision for nearly an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does sooth dry eyes. My eyes felt totally refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it caused blurred vision, very blurred vision. It was like looking through a frosted glass. I waited several minutes hoping that was just a brief reaction to the drops, but it wasn&#x27;t. After 20 minutes I washed my eyes with water. No effect. I would not have been able to drive with such blurred vision and was fortunate that I didn&#x27;t use the drops right out of the drug store. Vision slowly cleared and was back to normal in about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I questioned a pharmacist the next day she suggested I phone Poison Control for guidance. I did not call them because my vision had returned to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will return these eye drops to the store for a refund and buy drops without gel. My uneducated guess is that the &amp;#34;intensive gel shield&amp;#34; adhered to the eye and caused the blurred vision. The same gel that soothed also blurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered using the drops at night before retiring to bed and hope that I had no need to see anything clearly for a hour. However, since accidents and emergencies arrive unscheduled I decided not to risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this review three stars because the product did its job but had a bad side effect.</li>
            <li> These Systane gel drops work well for serious dryness. I am a frequent user of drops of all brands. I have certain ones that I prefer depending on how dry my eyes are. If they are really really dry you want the gel. Just know that a lot of the time they will sting going in no matter what the brand if your eyes are bad off. Just keep pumping it in.&lt;br /&gt;Gel drops will affect your vision for a little bit due to them being so thick.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that the bottle is so small. I mean tiny. A third of an ounce.</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my eye doctor, along with Restasis and Systane Balance, for my chronic, severe, dry eyes.  I use Systane Balance throughout the day and the gel before I go to bed.  It&#x27;s so soothing, I sleep comfortably and wake up with refreshed eyes.  Between the three things I&#x27;ve been using, my eyes are much less dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> Systane are the only drops I&#x27;ve tried that don&#x27;t burn my eyes. I like Ultra for daytime use and Gel Drops for night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them both for several years and tested at least 6-8 different brands</li>
            <li> Simplify my shopping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with eye drops -- they seemed to splash all over the place.  I found the gel drops much more to my liking -- I just apply a drop to my finger and put it in the corner of each eye; the gel does the rest of the work, spreading it evenly over the entire eye.</li>
            <li> Systane gel drops provide relief that a regular eye drop can&#x27;t begin to do. Sight is blurry for a little while, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought these to try at a local drug store.  I wake up several times a night with dry eyes and have to add drops.  With this product, I can put them in right before bed and sometimes once more in the middle of the night at most.  I don&#x27;t have problems during the day with dryness, but have found this to be very helpful.  They have a slightly slippery feel to them, but that&#x27;s likely why they&#x27;re effective.  Unlike some products that leave your eyes stuck together by morning, these have only a minor similar type of effect.  Give them a try with the single package and then switch to the double pack if they&#x27;re helpful to you.</li>
            <li> BEST &amp;#34;OVERNIGHT&amp;#34; EYE DROPS!</li>
            <li> Great eye drops for dry eyes.</li>
            <li> gentle, reduces ocular irritation</li>
            <li> I suffer from extreme dry eye........have PD and cataracts that we have to wait to remove.........the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; drops are the most soothing of all, and Systane&#x27;s are the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the best of all of the eye drops for me.</li>
            <li> I have had severe recurrent corneal erosion and my doctor recommended I use these drops well after surgery was completed and was a way to wean away from muro 128 ointment. The drops are effective but are a little sticky feeling at first. For me I prefer to use a very small dose of the muro instead but if I feel a dry irritation or a potential tear I use this when I am out and about. Much easier to use drops at a dinner, or a client meeting than having to fool around with the ointment.  Bottom line is it works as advertised</li>
            <li> Great item!&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day and have for years,great for dry eye. I find it so convenient to order on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than eye drops.  But pricey.</li>
            <li> Much better than Systane Ulta and Systane Balance if you have very dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I have some pretty significant eye issues and these are the best drops I have found (and I have tried LOTS) for day use and also for right before I go to bed.  They do cloud/blur your vision for a few minutes so don&#x27;t put them in if you are going to try to read, work on the computer, or drive immediately.  Two eye care specialists I see have recommended these drops.</li>
            <li> Love these gel drops better than the ultra drops. Systane is the best over other brands. These actually relief my severe dry eye problem. Highly recommended by my doctor to use Systane Gel during the day and to use the Systan Lubricant Gel Overnight Therapy at night. The only product in the past two years that has worked for me.</li>
