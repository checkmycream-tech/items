            <li>works great!  </li>
            <li>This worked great.  </li>
            <li>works great, this is my go to ridge filler.</li>
            <li>My nails have never been great</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, which is awesome for a mani on the go!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, good.  </li>
            <li>I am SO pleased with it!</li>
            <li>So I am pleased!</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and it arrived in excellent conditions.</li>
            <li>That held up well and still looked good, but I guess I&#x27;m just not a colored nail person because I wasn&#x27;t enjoying the look.</li>
            <li>It surely does the job.</li>
            <li>++ more.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t have the time or patience to apply more than one coat of polish).</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I noticed that my nails were growing out better than they ever have</li>
            <li>smooth, effective product</li>
            <li>Maybe my nail ridges are significantly deeper than most?</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have many true ridges, but I have lots of bumps and dents.</li>
            <li>My nails look neat, well-kept, and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended for disguising the ridges and helping the nails to appear smooth again.</li>
            <li>One of my absolute favorite products by Essie.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The difference in my nails is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>I often use this by itself with clear on top.</li>
            <li>I always love how even my nails look after a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this item, it dries fast, and it really helps as a primer.</li>
            <li>It has a matte finish that really does even out your nails, and dries super fast so that you can start painting your nails!</li>
            <li>I first tried it by using two coats and then finishing with colored polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty decent ridge filler...not as good as I expected from the brand that gets so much &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Maybe my nails are more ridge-y than the average person with this problem, but for $8 I expected much more!</li>
            <li>To Dry For top coat.</li>
            <li>If I just want a pretty classic maincured nail, wear it alone.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t quite clear - has a slight peachy color, but is close enough to a natural look that I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It looks nice alone, too, if you just want a little sheen.</li>
            <li>It really does cover the lines in my fingernails.</li>
            <li>After a few days I tried putting on two coats of polish first, then finishing with the Essie as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I have looked for a product like this a long time to smooth out ridges in a couple of my nails.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice natural sheen to my nails, but does little to nothing to fill my ridges.</li>
            <li>This ridge filler dries quickly, smooths the surface, and works well alone or under other polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look almost made by a professional.</li>
            <li>So I removed the polish completely and tried using just two layers of the Essie.</li>
            <li>Many weeks, I just wear a thick coat of this under Essie</li>
            <li>This is the best filler base coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was done, but there was still a thin layer of the Essie that made my nails look much better than normal.</li>
            <li>The polish, in general, is rated a one star.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a rather soft finish for my fragile nails.  </li>
            <li>I am talking ninety year old woman like deep nail ridges!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no ragged edges or splits, my nails look thick and healthy, and they are so long</li>

            <li> Wow - so smooth that it looked like I had false nails!</li>
            <li> I really love hot this filler base coat make look my nails.</li>
            <li> But it takes FOREVER to dry properly.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite base coat.</li>
            <li> This usually is just enough extra to fill ridges though, because it is finished with 2 coats of polish.</li>
            <li> This product seemed expensive when I decided to try it, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I like this ridge filler base coat much better.</li>
            <li> I typically like the nail polish from this brand, so</li>
            <li> It smudges less and dries faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because I really liked this filler base coat, I have purchased other Essie products (not a good idea).  </li>
            <li> It creates a smooth base for additional layers of polish.</li>
            <li> This base coat helps polish go on smooth, though some of my nudes, like Essie&#x27;s Ballet Slippers, are still streaky.</li>
            <li> Then I paint over with regular nail polish to extend the life of the expensive manicure.</li>
            <li> and I have neither the interest nor the patience to fuss with them, but they&#x27;ve been so bad in the last couple of years due to peeling, breaking and, worst of all, ridges and splitting down into the quick.</li>
            <li> this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> This product is a less than glorified flat base coat.</li>
            <li> Yes, as reported it goes on thin.</li>
            <li> On that nail I used TWO coats of the thin ridge filler, drying well in between coats.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not dry, it gobs itself in corners and looks awful</li>
            <li> I hate to be the outlier, but this product left me disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this as a base coat.</li>
            <li> My nails are mirror smooth...and before even with a reg base coat &amp; 2 OPI color coats</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previous to this, I used Essie&#x27;s protein base coat.</li>
            <li> So I removed the polish with acetone remover, expecting to also remove the Essie base coat.</li>

            <li> Maybe my nail ridges are significantly deeper than most? But I doubt that. This product is a less than glorified flat base coat. I typically like the nail polish from this brand, so this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> works great, this is my go to ridge filler. I often use this by itself with clear on top. two coats will do it.</li>
            <li> I really love hot this filler base coat make look my nails. They look almost made by a professional. The shipping was fast and it arrived in excellent conditions. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover ridges as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this as a base coat. However, doesn&#x27;t work to well to fill ridges.</li>
            <li> It does quite well filling ridges and making the nail primed for polish. But it takes FOREVER to dry properly. If it&#x27;s not dry, it gobs itself in corners and looks awful and you have to start again.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a rather soft finish for my fragile nails.  Otherwise, good.  I like the color.</li>
            <li> works great!  I use it to fill the gap as my salon gel manicure grows out.  Then I paint over with regular nail polish to extend the life of the expensive manicure.</li>
            <li> I do not have any complaints! It dries very quickly, which is awesome for a mani on the go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty decent ridge filler...not as good as I expected from the brand that gets so much &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> because I really liked this filler base coat, I have purchased other Essie products (not a good idea).  The polish, in general, is rated a one star.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite base coat. It has a matte finish that really does even out your nails, and dries super fast so that you can start painting your nails! One of my absolute favorite products by Essie.</li>
            <li> Glides on with ease.  Fills any ridges and dips, and helps make my polish last longer!</li>
            <li> I had read conflicting reviews before I got this filler. I am SO pleased with it! It surely does the job. Yes, as reported it goes on thin. This usually is just enough extra to fill ridges though, because it is finished with 2 coats of polish. On one nail that was damaged as a girl, I have seriously DEEP ridges. I am talking ninety year old woman like deep nail ridges!!  On that nail I used TWO coats of the thin ridge filler, drying well in between coats. It dries in a FLASH! That is all it took! My nails are mirror smooth...and before even with a reg base coat &amp; 2 OPI color coats my ridges were obvious. So I am pleased!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this because of all the positive reviews. I hate to be the outlier, but this product left me disappointed. It gives a nice natural sheen to my nails, but does little to nothing to fill my ridges. If I put 2 coats on, it looks cloudy and white which I don&#x27;t like, and still doesn&#x27;t fill the ridges. Maybe my nails are more ridge-y than the average person with this problem, but for $8 I expected much more!</li>
            <li> This ridge filler dries quickly, smooths the surface, and works well alone or under other polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous to this, I used Essie&#x27;s protein base coat. I like this ridge filler base coat much better. It smudges less and dries faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have many true ridges, but I have lots of bumps and dents. I always love how even my nails look after a professional manicure. This is the closest to that I&#x27;ve gotten on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a minimalist. Many weeks, I just wear a thick coat of this under Essie To Dry For top coat. My nails look neat, well-kept, and smooth. Definitely going to buy again.</li>
            <li> Does the job +++ more. If I just want a pretty classic maincured nail, wear it alone. I can also wear it under a color polish. Its versitile. Well worth the $.</li>
            <li> I read about this product and found it on Amazon. My nails have never been great and I have neither the interest nor the patience to fuss with them, but they&#x27;ve been so bad in the last couple of years due to peeling, breaking and, worst of all, ridges and splitting down into the quick. This product was recommended for disguising the ridges and helping the nails to appear smooth again. I first tried it by using two coats and then finishing with colored polish. Wow - so smooth that it looked like I had false nails! But the polish began to come off after a couple days (I didn&#x27;t have the time or patience to apply more than one coat of polish). So I removed the polish with acetone remover, expecting to also remove the Essie base coat. I thought I was done, but there was still a thin layer of the Essie that made my nails look much better than normal. After a few days I tried putting on two coats of polish first, then finishing with the Essie as a top coat. That held up well and still looked good, but I guess I&#x27;m just not a colored nail person because I wasn&#x27;t enjoying the look. HOWEVER, I noticed that my nails were growing out better than they ever have and I was not dealing with the problems mentioned above. So I removed the polish completely and tried using just two layers of the Essie. It isn&#x27;t quite clear - has a slight peachy color, but is close enough to a natural look that I&#x27;m very happy with it. The difference in my nails is nothing short of amazing. I&#x27;ve had no ragged edges or splits, my nails look thick and healthy, and they are so long that soon I will have to cut them with a clipper. This product seemed expensive when I decided to try it, but it&#x27;s worth it to me. (I also recently switched to using a glass nail file, also found here on Amazon, and that seems to be helping my nails, too.)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this item, it dries fast, and it really helps as a primer. I recommend this item to all nail technicians to have in their tool box.</li>
            <li> smooth, effective product</li>
            <li> This is the best filler base coat I have ever used.  It really does cover the lines in my fingernails.</li>
