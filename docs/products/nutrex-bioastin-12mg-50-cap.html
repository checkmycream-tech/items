    <ol>
            <li> Very few &#x27;supplements&#x27; meet their alleged capabilities...for me, this is an eye-opener, as I did, indeed, experience a surge of sustained energy...</li>
            <li> Good for chronic headaches! It takes 4-6 weeks to help, but it helped me!</li>
            <li> This is the one that is worth your $&#x27;s. Took me 3 different brands but glad I kept looking as I prefer the 12mg 2x daily. Astaxanthin does seem to provide an energy boost and joint relief. Quality company. Quality made. I buy them now 3 or 6 at a clip. research astaxanthin and make sure it is what you want-then be sure and inform your doctor you plan on taking it...as he/she might tell you NOT to take it with a  certain script you may be taking. Also, research the statin drugs and educate yourself as to what vitamins/foods you could eat to get off the statins as one of the side effects is cataracts-sure enough at my last eye exam I was told I have cataracts! I have been on statins (Crestor) for years and I am ticked off on what I am learning about statins! Do your research! Stop being a &#x27;sheeple&#x27;- i did- just a bit to late. Doctors are not gods. They burp/fart, eat junk food, drink, enjoy a doobie, just like the rest of us and we should research the heck out of what they claim we need to take medication wise!!</li>
            <li> Great price for this important supplement.</li>
            <li> I like that it is 12 mg and they have 50 in the bottle. Good price. I have ordered again.</li>
            <li> So far I find this product to be very helpful and it&#x27;s great to only take one pill a day, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It is a great supplement to take to improve your skin.</li>
            <li> a little over two weeks of taking this pill I finally had relief from nerve damage in my head from surgery 2 years ago. also pain from degenerate arthritis has  reduced with no stomach upsets that comes from nsaids .</li>
            <li> I have been taking 4 mgs for a long time, thinking that was the optimal amount, but in this case, more has turned out to be better.  I can definitely see and feel a difference in my skin and my husband, who normally gets sunburn super easily loves that he hasn&#x27;t had sunburn even once since starting this.  He used to lather on the sunscreen even at 5:30 (after work) to swim for a few minutes before dinner, but he doesn&#x27;t have to do that if he&#x27;s taking astaxanthin.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the smaller dose!!</li>
            <li> great, product will probably use it for life, great for joint pain and stiffness</li>
            <li> g&lt;br /&gt;reat product, prompt delivery</li>
            <li> super product.  have been using Bioastin for over ten years.  First as antioxidant, then for pain I had in both shoulders.  Works great, though subtle for first time users. suggest when first using this product, LOAD.  Meaning, take a larger dose every day til you see results, then scale back to a maintenance dose.  Also, haven&#x27;t been sunburned since I stated taking this, and I spend hours in the sun daily, as in surfing for a minimum of 2 hours every time I go, which is often.</li>
            <li> Astaxanthen Is one of the newest immune booster on the market.  My wife and I have had no illness of any kind since we started using it.  I wanted to give a one star rating not for the product but for the supplier.  Amazon would not let 1 star be published.  The charge for shipping one bottle was $10 or 30% of the cost.  Way over value for a few ounces.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt us; but didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference for us, either.  I bought enough for my husband and I to take one/day for 50 days.  We both take Glucosamine/Chondroitin daily.  We&#x27;ll stick with that since it is effective and not so expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and he appreciates only having to take 1 cap a day.  His eyesight has improved noticeably over the course of several months.</li>
            <li> These will make your lips peel off and your gums bleed.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands and this one provides a lot of bang for the buck- MY HDL Cholesterol is up 20% which is great!</li>
            <li> Great product,very good price,fast shipment ,I recommend .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using his product a full 2 months now. I haven&#x27;t notice much differences in any relief from joint pain that I get in the mornings - especially when it&#x27;s cold. As for it helping with the skin and protecting it from the sun like the brochure says it&#x27;s supposed to help - not sure about that either because I definitely feel the heat of the sun on my face when its sunny out.
