            <li>good stuff for rid of gray</li>
            <li>But, it does smell really good and leaves your hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>

            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>This type of hair color works good for me.</li>
            <li>Good price for a good product.</li>
            <li>have used this brand for 10 years and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the competition.  </li>
            <li>That tells me that the quality control is better at Clairol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products and this is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Better gloves are provided in the box.</li>
            <li>Both products have gloves that are throwaways, but between the two, Clairol has a better version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Using Amazon I was able to save $3.00 per box.</li>
            <li>Still my favorite DIY hair coloring kit.</li>
            <li>More of a brown-burgundy.</li>
            <li>Way better than Just For Men.</li>
            <li>Work much much better than Just For Men.</li>
            <li>This product is better than the top brand in hair color for men.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>CLAIROL HAS A FINE PRODUCT BUT HAS MADE THE PRODUCT SCARCE ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was probably for the best as I really started to dig deep into this product and express my displeasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very good result compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>Less than Just for Men and just as good!</li>
            <li>This is true excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn like other more popular brands&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever have to use products for sensitive skin and off the top of my head</li>
            <li>Most others can have a somewhat orange tint after use, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with Natural Instincts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy it until I finally give up on fighting the grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Clairol!</li>
            <li>Much better and longer lasting than &#x27;just for men&#x27; in my opinion</li>
            <li>first use, it works</li>
            <li>Looks more natural than anything else I have tried, even when done professionally.</li>
            <li>HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS CLAIROL GREAT COLOR TREATMENT PRODUCT THAT DISAPPEARED FROM STORES SEVERAL YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li>Most would either start off looking unnatural or look ok but quickly fade to that weird orange-ish color.</li>
            <li>Really became intolerable after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Item as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My greys grow out before it really fades.</li>
            <li>Anything up to that time and the product should work as good as new, and while it won&#x27;t damage your hair, or scalp, anything past that time</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it is rated an extra star is because it is a lot for the money and some people might be willing to accept a sub-standard product if it is better than no product at all as the alternative.</li>
            <li>Better than the other brands.</li>
            <li>I have used many different hair colors in my life but this one is by far the highest quality and natural looking hair color of them all!</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find one on the packaging, I called the Clairol hotline and surprisingly got through to a human being in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>Having said this, some gray being &amp;#34;exposed&amp;#34; is also more natural for a person who looks old enough to have SOME gray hair -</li>
            <li>will not be buying this again, even though I get more for less</li>
            <li>think at the end of the day, here is the main point about this product.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for</li>
            <li>the little shampoo bottle that it comes with in the packaging says its suppose to retain the color more</li>
            <li>it is in a good vs. bad format so people can see what their money is getting them more clearly and in far fewer words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is the main benefit but as with everything, sometimes even the low price does not save the product from itself if it is ineffective vs. the higher priced competition.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not only goes on looking very close to my natural hair color but doesn&#x27;t really fade (I re-apply every two weeks after my haircut).</li>
            <li>Also I notice that quantity of chemicals varies significantly from box to box in other brands.</li>
            <li>Wow something for men!</li>
            <li>You are better off spending your hard earned dollars on treating yourself to a day at the salon.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair color, is very simple to apply and I always let it run longer than specified to cover well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE been using HENNA KING, is natural and no burning nor itching.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural look and ease of use.</li>
            <li>As a counter-point, I will say that even after 20 minutes of direct contact, it did not bother my scalp or burn in any way at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also point out that the skin on my face is nowhere near sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old</li>
            <li>I use it for coloring both facial and head hair in increments (i.e. - not the whole bottle at a time).  </li>
            <li>On top of it all, you don&#x27;t have to use the entire batch in one shot, I have light hair, I only need half, else it&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li>I have used other man hair dye, some much cheaper, but I came back to Clairol because of its consistent quality that you can count on.</li>
            <li>I tried to stick it out and give it time to stay on so that it could get the job done, but you can only sit there with your face on fire and screaming at you for so long, willingly.</li>
            <li>PERFORMED THE 48HR TEST ON ARM AND WAS GOOD,BUT WHEN APPLIED TO BIERD,CAUSED MAJOR BLISTERING WHICH</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m careful, this stuff stays in MUCH longer.  </li>
            <li>but it is pretty close to black</li>
            <li>Other brands have plastic gloves so low quality that they rip appart on the first use.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and in that time I have tried some others, but they all seem less natural looking.</li>
            <li> All things being equal, this never quite got the hair as dark as desired, it didn&#x27;t have a natural look when in direct sunlight, and it began to fade after only a few weeks (maybe 2-3 weeks?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave my hair a little coarse temporarily after using it, but it&#x27;s not that severe and after a few shampoo &amp; conditionings it is pretty much back to normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to JFM, it has a, &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; undertone to the brown it is trying to achieve and not a brown / black undertone as a natural look would have.</li>
            <li> I typically will shampoo my hair every third or fourth day, but will rinse daily in the shower with just water.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and lasts a long time provided that you do not wash your hair every day.  </li>
            <li> the color does not hold as long as advertised and some hairs seem to not color at all.  </li>
            <li> When my hair started going grey a few years ago, I tried several different hair colors.</li>
            <li> Spill a little on a white counter-top and then do the same with the competition and</li>
            <li> I just wish the color lasted as long as advertised and its not close!</li>
            <li> a coupon, I purchased 3 boxes of this product for less money than it costs for me to buy only two of the JFM</li>
            <li> Says that it can also be used for facial hair, but as soon as it went on my beard / mustache and started to sink in, it was burning the skin underneath after just a few moments.</li>
            <li> I always find little drops around and it is difficult to clean them.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than that slop they put on your hair at Supercuts and other salons.</li>
            <li> , I typically buy this in quantity and was curious about the expiration date.</li>
            <li> The first version of this died a sad and long-winded death due to the browser crashing when I hit submit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One minor drawback  is that it is a little bit messy.</li>
            <li> call it dark brown</li>
            <li> simply is not worth</li>
            <li> you want to waste money on this product, and a trip to the salon, with the probability of getting your hair chopped off, then by all means.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Includes additional small bottle of color conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not sure this helps at all, and....</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.  </li>
            <li> Gloves are useless.</li>
            <li> It was awful the hair color is like paint after u take a shower the color still gets off and dirty the blanket or white shirt</li>
            <li> Terrible ....</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is true excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent hair color. It brings a conditioning , which it has good quality. I would recommended it . It is one of the best.</li>
            <li> When my hair started going grey a few years ago, I tried several different hair colors. Revlon, Just for Men, Loreal, etc. Most would either start off looking unnatural or look ok but quickly fade to that weird orange-ish color. This hair color not only goes on looking very close to my natural hair color but doesn&#x27;t really fade (I re-apply every two weeks after my haircut). I leave it on for about 12-13 minutes .  I love it and will continue to buy it until I finally give up on fighting the grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: get some hand lotion and smear it along your hairline. It will keep the color from staining your skin. I like using Vaseline Men. It has a good scent for a man and rinses away without a greasy feel. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair color, is very simple to apply and I always let it run longer than specified to cover well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn like other more popular brands&lt;br /&gt;I use for facial hair</li>
            <li> Terrible .... Bought for my beard .... Doesn&#x27;t work at all .... Went back to &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Itchy and burning face after being applied to my beard.I had to stop using this product after 6 months. I&#x27;VE been using HENNA KING, is natural and no burning nor itching.</li>
            <li> This works as described. I have been using this product for awhile.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the competition.  But I wonder why retailers stop carrying.</li>
            <li> It was awful the hair color is like paint after u take a shower the color still gets off and dirty the blanket or white shirt</li>
            <li> I have used other man hair dye, some much cheaper, but I came back to Clairol because of its consistent quality that you can count on. Other brands have plastic gloves so low quality that they rip appart on the first use. Also I notice that quantity of chemicals varies significantly from box to box in other brands. But Clairol is always the same amount. That tells me that the quality control is better at Clairol.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts!  I tried Just For Men, but it seems to wash out after 2-3 weeks.  If I&#x27;m careful, this stuff stays in MUCH longer.  Thanks Clairol!</li>
            <li> good stuff for rid of gray</li>
            <li> Gloves are useless. The dye went on both my hands.&lt;br /&gt;They call it dark brown but it is pretty close to black</li>
            <li> I have used many different hair colors in my life but this one is by far the highest quality and natural looking hair color of them all! I highly recommend it for it&#x27;s natural look and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products and this is definitely my favorite.  Easy to apply.  Covers well. Last for several weeks.</li>

            <li> PERFORMED THE 48HR TEST ON ARM AND WAS GOOD,BUT WHEN APPLIED TO BIERD,CAUSED MAJOR BLISTERING WHICH I SUFFERED FOR 2 WEEKS.WORSE THAN JUST FOR MEN.DONT BUY ANYTHING THAT COMES WITH GLOVES.IM GOING BACK TO HENNA.SLOWER TO WORK,BUT NO CHEMICALS OR SMELL.</li>
            <li> Wow something for men! Works great. Lasts longer than that slop they put on your hair at Supercuts and other salons. Lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> CLAIROL HAS A FINE PRODUCT BUT HAS MADE THE PRODUCT SCARCE ... HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS CLAIROL GREAT COLOR TREATMENT PRODUCT THAT DISAPPEARED FROM STORES SEVERAL YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li> Does the job and lasts a long time provided that you do not wash your hair every day.  I typically will shampoo my hair every third or fourth day, but will rinse daily in the shower with just water.  Much better and longer lasting than &#x27;just for men&#x27; in my opinion</li>
            <li> The first version of this died a sad and long-winded death due to the browser crashing when I hit submit.&lt;br /&gt;It was probably for the best as I really started to dig deep into this product and express my displeasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here it is in a good vs. bad format so people can see what their money is getting them more clearly and in far fewer words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Compared to JFM, it has a, &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; undertone to the brown it is trying to achieve and not a brown / black undertone as a natural look would have. Spill a little on a white counter-top and then do the same with the competition and you will understand the difference.&lt;br /&gt;2. 15-20 minutes of this product equals a darkness that is not quite as pronounced as what you would achieve with 10 mins of JFM.&lt;br /&gt;3. Says that it can also be used for facial hair, but as soon as it went on my beard / mustache and started to sink in, it was burning the skin underneath after just a few moments. Really became intolerable after 5 minutes. I tried to stick it out and give it time to stay on so that it could get the job done, but you can only sit there with your face on fire and screaming at you for so long, willingly. As a counter-point, I will say that even after 20 minutes of direct contact, it did not bother my scalp or burn in any way at all. I&#x27;d also point out that the skin on my face is nowhere near sensitive. I don&#x27;t ever have to use products for sensitive skin and off the top of my head cannot name another instance when a product irritated my face so it&#x27;s had to have been years since something else had that effect.&lt;br /&gt;4. All things being equal, this never quite got the hair as dark as desired, it didn&#x27;t have a natural look when in direct sunlight, and it began to fade after only a few weeks (maybe 2-3 weeks?) compared to 2+ months for the JFM equivalent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Reusable if you pour it out and mix it externally in a bowl or something similar and then apply from there. Just sealthe remaining portion. JFM does not work like that.&lt;br /&gt;2. Doubles as a facial hair coloring, but see above for cons about this, &amp;#34;perk&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;3. Includes additional small bottle of color conditioner. Not sure this helps at all, and....shouldn&#x27;t the color stay in properly regardless of what conditioner I choose?? But, it does smell really good and leaves your hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;4. Price. That is the main benefit but as with everything, sometimes even the low price does not save the product from itself if it is ineffective vs. the higher priced competition.&lt;br /&gt;5. Better gloves are provided in the box. Both products have gloves that are throwaways, but between the two, Clairol has a better version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think at the end of the day, here is the main point about this product.&lt;br /&gt;With a coupon, I purchased 3 boxes of this product for less money than it costs for me to buy only two of the JFM version.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying this again, even though I get more for less AND it is reusable so I can extend the product.&lt;br /&gt;It simply is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it is rated an extra star is because it is a lot for the money and some people might be willing to accept a sub-standard product if it is better than no product at all as the alternative.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and in that time I have tried some others, but they all seem less natural looking. Most others can have a somewhat orange tint after use, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with Natural Instincts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave my hair a little coarse temporarily after using it, but it&#x27;s not that severe and after a few shampoo &amp; conditionings it is pretty much back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe there is a perfect off the shelf semi-permanent hair color in a box - I haven&#x27;t found it anyway - but this is as close as I have come without trying women&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I typically buy this in quantity and was curious about the expiration date. When I couldn&#x27;t find one on the packaging, I called the Clairol hotline and surprisingly got through to a human being in less than a minute. Amelia at Clairol told me that they don&#x27;t include expiration dates on their hair color, but that it has a shelf life of three years. Anything up to that time and the product should work as good as new, and while it won&#x27;t damage your hair, or scalp, anything past that time and it may not work as effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and like it. Tony</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.  You do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With first use, it works okay.  Second use, it will either melt your hair, transform your lighter hair into much darker hair and destroy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to waste money on this product, and a trip to the salon, with the probability of getting your hair chopped off, then by all means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do warn you.  You are better off spending your hard earned dollars on treating yourself to a day at the salon.</li>
            <li> i was already losing color by the second week and this is more expensive than just for me the little shampoo bottle that it comes with in the packaging says its suppose to retain the color more but i think its a hoax to get your to buy the product i havent seen it do anything.</li>
            <li> A good choice as a hair color. It last up to six weeks</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and I have used this product, and Men&#x27;s Choice before it, for some time now.  I use it for coloring both facial and head hair in increments (i.e. - not the whole bottle at a time).  Though it is not formally recommended for facial hair, the same comments hold:  the color does not hold as long as advertised and some hairs seem to not color at all.  Having said this, some gray being &amp;#34;exposed&amp;#34; is also more natural for a person who looks old enough to have SOME gray hair - I just wish the color lasted as long as advertised and its not close!</li>
            <li> Liked the amount if coverage!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Good price. This type of hair color works good for me. One minor drawback  is that it is a little bit messy. I always find little drops around and it is difficult to clean them.</li>
            <li> Superb product and superb price . Delivery was 3 days and I could not be happier. The local drug stores stopped stocking this product in my area. Using Amazon I was able to save $3.00 per box. Suggest you buy 6 boxes per order and save lots of money.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this brand for 10 years and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite DIY hair coloring kit. I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Not Darkest Brown. More of a brown-burgundy. #BlackDyesBetter.</li>
            <li> Better than the other brands. Last longer, and if it touches your skin, it does not stain for days like the others. On top of it all, you don&#x27;t have to use the entire batch in one shot, I have light hair, I only need half, else it&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> item as described, ship time acceptable..</li>
            <li> Way better than Just For Men. This is as advertised. Works great.</li>
            <li> Good price for a good product. Looks more natural than anything else I have tried, even when done professionally. Had a leak in one of the boxes but it was taken care of no problem.</li>
            <li> It came perfectly packaged and on-time thank-you.  The product exceeded our expectations.</li>
            <li> Work much much better than Just For Men. My greys grow out before it really fades.</li>
            <li> have used this product for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> This product is better than the top brand in hair color for men.</li>
            <li> Deilivered as promissed on time.</li>
            <li> very good result compared to other brands.</li>
