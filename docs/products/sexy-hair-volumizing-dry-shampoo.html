            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>when, in my opinion, it&#x27;s at its best.</li>
            <li>Not too impressed with the product&#x27;s smell... has an aerosol hairspray scent.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for a morning when you dont feel like washing your hair -</li>
            <li>It is great for adding volume and texture!</li>

            <li>What a great product!</li>
            <li>Great Price!</li>
            <li>and Ojon are the best in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>This is the best, and the smell is just like a hair spray.</li>
            <li>It is the best solution for the day in between washings!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also shopped around, this is the best price I&#x27;ve found - and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the service.</li>
            <li>BEST ONE I HAVE USED.</li>
            <li>This is the best volumizing spray / texturizing spray I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>Especially excellent for updo&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>The best spray!</li>
            <li>In addition to prolonging the days between shampooing your hair, this product adds great volume!</li>
            <li>And there is no tint to it, which is awesome for brunettes.</li>
            <li>This product is great!!</li>
            <li>all suggestions are welcome!</li>
            <li>it is great to use to give your hair a change in style, if you are going out for the evening and don&#x27;t have time or want to wash your hair, or just to give your hair a pick me up for the evening, or even midday if you need it!</li>
            <li>This product works incredibly well - hair</li>
            <li>smells so good!  </li>
            <li>It does smell good though!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great for when I am teasing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any clogging on the nozzle.</li>
            <li>Happened to me after using the prodcut ONCE, ..which wasn&#x27;t all that great anyway.  </li>
            <li>product works great, but for the amount of money, I wish I could use it all up.</li>
            <li>But still great quality, great brand.  </li>
            <li>and it was a great price.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It smells great too.</li>
            <li>, however it works so great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Works great for volume and the &#x27;shampoo&#x27; aspect.</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>This works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, i think it smells good</li>
            <li>But, that texture is great for an updo and your hair will hold in the updo much better!  </li>
            <li>and it is very easy to use!</li>
            <li>Gives me good volume without having to do a lot.</li>
            <li>Good for taking pictures, but not for getting close on a date.</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend commented that my hair smelt good.</li>
            <li>It smells really good.  </li>
            <li>And I loved the volume it gave my hair.</li>
            <li>and it does not smell good.</li>
            <li>My good friend is a licensed cosmetologist and has been doing my hair for years.</li>
            <li>I bought it off of here since than, and works just as good as it did at the salon.</li>
            <li>However, I do have to note that I loved the look it gave to my hair</li>
            <li>I loved what I got to use of this product</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>It is kind of pricey without the amazing results of the cheaper varieties (aka Batiste!)</li>
            <li>I think it would be good for use if you have an event and are going to put your hair up, since the dirtier the better!  </li>
            <li>While I love the scent and the product works great</li>
            <li>I would be more happy with it if the product/can wasn&#x27;t faulity.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Told ya - love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Sure!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did use this stuff tho!</li>
            <li>love using this!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it !  </li>
            <li>wish I would have checked the reviews because this has happened to many people!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>, I cant find it at the salon or in stores here, so I will have to be ordering it on here, and make sure I always have it!</li>
            <li>The seller has it listed at a great price and shipped very quickly though</li>
            <li>Doubles as an amazing root boost if oil isn&#x27;t your issue.</li>
            <li>REally amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Its a must have in your beauty arsenal for when you need it, but make sure its a good one.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is not overpowering (by the time I got to work</li>
            <li>This product is very close to a perfect solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard so many good reviews on this and figured i would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I cannot understand why this product has received so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of like a fruity car freshener though.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and they either feel like you have something greasy or powdery in your hair or do not do a good job of behaving like a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I tried running warm water over it to unclog it</li>
            <li>I liked that is was a spray.</li>
            <li>safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>a normal, oil is gone, and my hair looks great!!</li>
            <li>Now, I can go 2 or 3 days and my hair looks better and better each day!  </li>
            <li>I had used this brand&#x27;s hairspray before and liked it OK.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS STILL REALLY FULL LOOKING!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>The first two times I used it, it worked great.</li>
            <li>The spray was ok.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does an okay job getting rid of the grease but also leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>Its more like a baby powder.</li>
            <li>It does help my hair to have more volume.  </li>
            <li>initially this product was GREAT!</li>
            <li>If you are one of those people who&#x27;s hair looks better the day after you wash it, you might like this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Just okay for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have been able to skip a wash day.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I will use it in a pinch if my go to favorite Batiste tropical is out of stock, but I won&#x27;t buy it otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Okay - the sprayer got clogged on me</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product.</li>
            <li>but my hair is going to look a lot healthier too. :)</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing again! :)</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>but I wish I had because I paid alot more at CVS.</li>
            <li>The smell is just okay</li>
            <li>LOVE IT LIFE SAVER</li>
            <li>I would never use it again, my bottle was a gift, glad I&#x27;m not out the $.</li>
            <li>I love the brand</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a great texture with volume that lasts and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I definitely like this one the best.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others, and they just don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>First of all the smell is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>I was expecting more for my money.     </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure it \\&quot;added\\&quot; any that would be there if the oil wasn&#x27;t there.  </li>
            <li>Will order more</li>
            <li>Do I wish it was slightly more affordable?</li>
            <li>What more do you need?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>It was more like spraying hairspray on my head.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried many but none of them hold up like this one</li>
            <li>&amp; i love the texture feeling.</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second can and can now keep my hairdresser happy after she colors my hair and tells me not to wash it every day!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Handles the grease without adding more shine.</li>
            <li>better if you hold the can farther away...if you hold it too close, it will look like you have powder in your hair.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to apply, does not leave residue and it smells nicely, and not too strong.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is great for individuals with dark hair like myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>The first 2 times that I used this product I absolutely LOVED it, but after that the product wouldn&#x27;t spray out of the can.</li>
            <li>I can go two days between washes with this Dry Shampoo and my hair looks great!</li>
            <li>Best volumizing dry shampoo, but</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I have used.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>-- if you&#x27;re a fan of Oribe-style volume and don&#x27;t mind a bit of....stiffness to your strands, this is THE BEST dry shampoo out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>best dry shampoo ever</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I find this dry shampoo to be the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  </li>
            <li>I have found it works best if I spray it in, brush, and then blow dry for 10 seconds or so.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m happy, but I&#x27;ll keep looking to see if I can find something better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel oily at all, my hair looks clean, and has some volume!</li>
            <li>Again, tastes in scent will vary but to me, this is one of the best smelling dry shampoos out there!</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I have used other things in the Sexy Hair line and been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Pros-the product does absorb oil, and smells nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to my hair being silky smooth and able to run my hands through it easily.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair to a bob to make it more managable, but of course now it looks oilier more quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i use it right out of the shower for volume.&lt;br /&gt;it is amazing</li>
            <li>Not a bad price either!</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>It adds alot of volume easily.  </li>
            <li>Takes away the oil, adds volume, easy to style.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--It smells like hairspray, so it can be strong.  </li>
            <li>people complain that the smell is strong, but i like it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does have a strong smell to it.</li>
            <li>I love that this product takes the oil right out of my roots (and believe me, I get oily!)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty amazing for me.</li>
            <li>This is a very good volumizing dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair</li>
            <li>Using dry shampoo is a great way to extend the life of *most types and styles of hair.</li>
            <li>I have medium hair, cut at the collarbone and love wearing it with loose waves, and this works great to get some lift and oomph at the roots and add body to the style.</li>
            <li>I felt that though I had awesome volume, I was sacrificing softness because the texture was a little stiffer, almost as if I had lightly sprayed with hairspray.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the only way I can skip a day between washes!</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>and the scent, though light, still bugged me.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m also available for questions if you have any.</li>
            <li>It works great, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or with a massive hairspray smell.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>The 1/3 of this product that I actually got to use was great, but the sprayer clogged up and stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I want a free replacement sent to me.</li>
            <li>I actually really enjoy using this product:  </li>
            <li>I do spray this lightly to freshen.</li>
            <li>I do find the longer ends of my hair a bit straw and straggly, but if I use a good leave-in spray on moisturizer on the length of my hair (not the roots), then the ends are soft, and the roots are not greasy.  </li>
            <li>When I let it down the morning it has awesome volume and looks freshly washed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li>But if not, this is the stuff that is worth it!  </li>
            <li>I use it often on freshly washed hair because it gives awesome volume for teasing or just a little boost to the roots.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a visible residue, it truly makes me hair look clean.</li>
            <li>This is a great dry shampoo that adds volume and texture.</li>
            <li>Tigi is ok, but seems too light weight to really do any thing.</li>
            <li>It does add a lot of volume, but it doesn&#x27;t really clean like the description says it will.</li>
            <li>Gives volume and texture while being a great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have easily gotten 2-3 days worth of style out of my hair since using this product (without washing)</li>
            <li>It takes the dryness right our and adds tons of volume!</li>
            <li>My hair gets oily fast, and I don&#x27;t want to wash it every day since it is fine and damages easily.  </li>
            <li>As a result, I have so much more volume (working better than hairspray which I barely ever use) looking</li>
            <li>Love the sexy brand as a general rule.  </li>
            <li>Baby powder works better and its much cheaper and doesnt leak after 2 uses.</li>
            <li>Big Sexy did the job, lasted longer and filled the bottle more.  </li>
            <li>it most are part cornstarch, baking soda, oat powder mix in some real cocoa to darken it up a bit.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say how much I love this product, I will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li>and adds dryness, volume, and a light fresh scent</li>
            <li>i just make sure to spray it under hair really well.</li>
            <li>I have super oily hair</li>
            <li>Super delayed shipment.</li>
            <li>I love the big sexy line of products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen reviewers note they don&#x27;t like the fragrance - it is stronger than some but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong and if just feels caked in my hair, even though I don&#x27;t spray much on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>MY MOST FAVORITE DRY SHAMPOO,.</li>
            <li>We are all different and results may vary but I have found this product to be one of the best dry shampoos that I have ever used</li>
            <li>There are many better dry shampoos</li>
            <li>Besides the shipment taking a little while, this product is always great.  </li>
            <li>I felt it worked great, but did make my hair feel a little straw-like as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been told that I smell amazing by numerous people after using this product!).</li>
            <li>My hair has volume and looks fresh again.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price, considering it&#x27;s about $20-$25 at the salon.</li>
            <li>But I think these are worth it because it works so well.</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>So far I really like Oscar Blandi dry shampoo which I used in Spain and was impressed and now Big Sexy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos to take care of my fine and somewhat oily hair.  </li>
            <li>I went two days without washing, sprayed a little in my hair, and had a nice sweaty workout without looking like a grease ball!</li>
            <li>If I wash my hair in the morning I can show signs of oily hair as early as that evening so a product like this, that actually works, saves me time, energy and makes my hair more healthy by not having to wash it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY MAKES MY HAIR FULL....</li>
            <li>I have flat, fine, straight hair that gets super oily looking very quickly.</li>
            <li>Most of the other reviewers are right when they say it changes the texture of your hair/scalp, but I&#x27;m completely fine with that if it will keep the oil at bay.</li>
            <li>Voluminous Dry Shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and so far I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if you do want to use it strictly as a dry shampoo it works amazing.</li>
            <li>I even like its smell, however it runs out way too quickly and it is very pricey if you use it every day.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>Slightly tacky at times, have to brush it out really good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset because it really was a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>But for occasional use when you need it, it does a great job and definitely adds volume too.</li>
            <li>This product also doubles as a volumizer for my super silky straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very very oily if I do not wash it for a day and this product almost removes all of the oily and gives volume.</li>
            <li>Big Sexy wins out purely for a price point and volume.  </li>
            <li>The powder is super fine, it doesn&#x27;t show up gray at all, and it leaves my hair looking fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>I became interested in the product after one of my friends told me about it.</li>
            <li>and I was only able to use the product once.  </li>
            <li>Big Sexy  3.  </li>
            <li>It stops working, with so much more left in the bottle!</li>
            <li>I love this product but now for the second time it stopped working when still 1/4 - 1/3</li>
            <li>My hair looks fresh and it lasts the whole 12 hours of my work shift.</li>
            <li>volume Bumble and Bumble gives the most height (and comes in a variety of colors, not white like all the others), for getting rid of oil, yet not stripping your hair Oscar Blandi (I like the spray vs the powder)</li>
            <li>but I always got more in some spots and not enough in others.     </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>BUT -- if you&#x27;re looking for sexy bedhead, for volume, for that sort of Italian Movie Star \\&quot;JBF\\&quot; hair, this does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells better than hairspray, but definitely has a fragrance.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s almost a better tactic for this stuff -- before bed anticipation of saving time the following morning.....</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I would recommend styling the hair first.</li>
            <li>also for second day hair, if you are in a rush, or for whatever (many)</li>
            <li>It works great, definitely my number one dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The seller I ordered this from was amazing, shipping within 24 hours and at 30% cheaper than any other vendor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and there is no comparison to Big Sexy.</li>
            <li>THE ABSOLUTE BEST DRY SHAMPOO I USE IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li>and I have tried many many different dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>The Product is pretty good is used in small portions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried four or five brands of dry shampoo, include Frederic Fekkai and other top lines, and this one does a nice job of soaking up oil and giving some texture and body at the roots.</li>
            <li>I have tried other dry shampoos and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>But the dry shampoo is a much better product.</li>
            <li>this my favorite dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have used almost every dry shampoo on the market, and this one is just ok for me.  </li>
            <li>I really love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff it keeps my hair volumized  without having to blow it dry every day</li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>i love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have really fine blonde hair and this stuff</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with the extra volume there.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using Big Sexy Hair Volumizing Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium length, blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Most dry shampoos require touch ups during the day - not this one!  </li>
            <li>Other brands of dry shampoo (such as Suave Professionals) have more of a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of dry shampoo- from Bumble &amp; Bumble to Not Your Mother&#x27;s, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice to get a little lift around the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to throw the whole thing out.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t smell the product anymore), and it really mopped up all the oil at my roots.</li>
            <li>I caution that you do not use too much of it, otherwise your hair gets a \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; texture.</li>
            <li>I may order another and just use when I really need the volume.</li>
            <li>Plus it really does help when you maybe should wash your hair.</li>
            <li>Works so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it allowed me to go 1-2 days without washing my hair, which was helpful on days I had to run out the door</li>
            <li>One warning - don&#x27;t use too much or too close or it will be grainy.  </li>
            <li>some of the others are capable of.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost that feeling of having too much hairspray in your hair and not washing it for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really wash every day because it dries the end of my hair out.</li>
            <li>For the price it is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this prodcut.</li>
            <li>It really is very absorbent</li>
            <li>I was very disapointed with it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great volume boost for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue like the cheap brands do.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful when teasing my hair at the roots.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it makes my hair full and so pretty, even second day hair!</li>
            <li>Love the hairspray, but DISLIKE the dry shampoo!!</li>
            <li>It does leave your hair feeling stiff at the roots if you use too much, but overall, it is great for every-other-day hair.  </li>
            <li>Knowing that they could just wash my hair before getting it done, I didn&#x27;t even want to try this stuff at first, mostly because of all the let downs of previous products.</li>
            <li>Will leave a residue if sprayed for too long or too close to the scalp, but that is user error and easily avoidable.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, long hair and no matter how much hair spray</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a list of some other ones I tried that I didn&#x27;t love as much because this one blew them out of the water --</li>
            <li>Nothing else compares in my book and I&#x27;ve tried many other brands.</li>
            <li>Other brands are better.  </li>
            <li>This was a problem with the other sprays I tried, that they needed more thorough applications that were, frankly, almost as tiring as washing my hair would have been.</li>
            <li>in all though I would recommend it over most other waterless shampoos.</li>
            <li>I decently don&#x27;t like the price for as much as you get.</li>
            <li>so as long as no one is running their fingers through my roots, it&#x27;s fine  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not your typical dry shampoo, it does soak up the oils in your hair, volumize and hold very effectively.  </li>
            <li>, it does the trick, and even adds volume that I normally never get with my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>really like the Big Sexy Hair dry spray because I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it</li>
            <li>Its more like a sticky hairspray...and unlike another reviewer, i thought the smell was too strong and not great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of dry shampoos and this is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li>Plus it does fade very quickly and if you spray a little perfume or hair spray it will cover right over it.  </li>
            <li>looks \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and full, without becoming dull and feeling overly \\&quot;coated\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Not as fragrant as other dry shampoos, which is good.</li>
            <li>you first put it on, your hair looks grey but as you brush out or towel your hair, the oil is absorbed and you didnt have to shower.</li>
            <li>no seriously.</li>
            <li>Batiste is the cheapest in price and does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>Does not show up in my dark brown hair and offers a nice volumizing boost with no heavy sticky hairspray feeling.  </li>
            <li>It felt more like hairspray and made my hair stiff and didn&#x27;t add much volume either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, including drug store and high end.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have used most dry shampoos on the market (Oscar Blandi, Ojon, Batiste, Tigi Rockaholic and Bumble and Bumble) and this one is my least favorite of the bunch.  </li>
            <li>In spite of all the advice from my hairdresser, I&#x27;ve never been able to go a day without a wash without greasy strings of flat hair next to my face.  </li>
            <li>In order to skip a day to try and save my color, I started using this product and now I&#x27;m completely hooked!!</li>
            <li>A little more hair spray- esque than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>With this product, one spray in the morning lasts me all day (nearly two days!!).</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how little actual product was needed to get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive or was easier to find.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair feeling very sticky and not that helpful as far as making hair look cleaner.</li>
            <li>definitely didn&#x27;t get that freshly washed feeling or look.</li>
            <li>and it is back to looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>I comb through and use curling iron as I normally would.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, I noticed that my hair was more voluminous.</li>
            <li>To get great results with this dry shampoo, treat it much like liquid shampoo: apply as little as humanly possible (say, 4 to 6 fraction-of-a-second spritzes) and then &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; to distribute evenly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless dry shampoo products and this one is by FAR the only one I&#x27;ve really loved.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it came in a larger size because I feel like I will use it up very quickly.</li>
            <li>The Big Sexy Dry Shampoo does not appear on my hair after I have sprayed it on.</li>
            <li>I tried some \\&quot;refresher\\&quot; products and a couple of dry sprays, but the Big Sexy Hair turned out to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the stiff hair is a deal-breaker then that might be a problem, but for people like me who need something that&#x27;s strong and long-lasting, I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The spray does, as most of the other reviewers have mentioned, make my hair feel stiff afterwards, but my hair looks fine.</li>
            <li>When I received the dry shampoo the bottle felt full and still does</li>
            <li>Nearly all of them I felt that I needed to wash out or re-apply after a couple of days, but usually the Big Sexy Hair will be okay without re-application until I can work up to actually washing my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cant live with out this now.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s time to find a new product--</li>
            <li>I had so much volume on the top of my head that I had a hard time getting the paddle brush through it like the directions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous dry shampoos and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I think it works a little better for blondes or those with light brown hair, because if you don&#x27;t work it in or you spray it too close, there is a little bit of a light-colored residue (as if you&#x27;d put baby powder in your hair).</li>
            <li>I think this product is okay, it works pretty well as a dry shampoo for half a day or so</li>
            <li>It does make your hair have a different texture, kind of stiff.  </li>
            <li>When you first spray it is white.  </li>
            <li>I would buy more and keep as backup for lazy days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other products and I&#x27;ve had multiple problems...way too powdery, runs out way too soon</li>
            <li>I definitely suggest getting a sample sized bottle to try first if you are hesitant about the results just so that you can see how your hair reacts with this product.</li>
            <li>Cleans hair OK, can size is really small.</li>
            <li>and I would oftentimes look forward to the day after shampooing because it actually made my blow out look better the 2nd and 3rd day!</li>
            <li>similar: the Victoria&#x27;s Secret \\&quot;Sexy Hair\\&quot; dry shampoo -- also adds good lift and volume, imparts definite TEXTURE to the hair -- in the vein of Oribe.</li>
            <li>And after applying it, hair feels fresh and dry (not oily).</li>
            <li>I have long hair, but it&#x27;s fine AND flat.  </li>
            <li>A little on the roots on day 2-3, a little more underneath the following day, then up in a messy bun on day 5 -- this gives enough hold to make my ponytails look thicker and stay in place more easily</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and does not hold and looks very flat unless I don&#x27;t wash it for a few days or use something to make it \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I prefer other like the one from suave or even better batist dry shampoo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a huge boost to my spirits to not have to have limp, oily hair anymore, even when I don&#x27;t have the energy to wash it for days on end.</li>
            <li>She recommended this spray product to me after I had given up on my search for a reasonably priced and decent dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>Use sparingly (spray lightly mostly near roots area).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this can for almost a month and so far it hasn&#x27;t been faulty.</li>
            <li>With the Big Sexy Hair, I just spray a few bursts at my roots</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this, and have been using it often, and I will always make sure to have at least an extra bottle for when I run out</li>
            <li>While the product certainly does it&#x27;s job of making my hair feel less oily and making it smell better, I can&#x27;t help but notice that it leaves an odd sort of crunchiness to it that I cannot brush out.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all - in fact</li>
            <li>This is my first dry shampoo, it seems to leave a residue in my hair which I do not like.</li>
            <li>This was my first time experimenting with dry shampoo .</li>
            <li>My hair has a tenancy to become slightly greasy after a full day of work and this product helps prevent any shine around my roots.</li>
            <li>First of all: this is probably NOT well-suited to folks with soft, silky hair who want their second (and third...and fourth) day hair to feel soft and silky and \\&quot;just-washed.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great dry shampoo that works without leaving behind white powder in your hair or on your clothes this is the one to get.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll often mist this on my roots BEFORE bed, and when I wake up, it&#x27;s still as clean and fluffy as the night before</li>
            <li>NOPE, my second can did the same exact thing.     </li>
            <li>I have very soft Asian hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl and when I use this stuff, I have so much volume and the curls really last.  </li>
            <li>I was a little annoyed at how small this product was for the price, but then the first time I used this product it worked great!  </li>
            <li>This product works so well for my hair that I started using it after I wash and dry my hair, just a little on my bangs and the top of my roots.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes it possible to stretch an extra day or two before a full shampoo, but I have found myself starting to use a little on clean hair as I like the extra volume so much.  </li>
            <li>i love dry shampoo and get by a few days without washing and reblowdrying, styling my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few dry shampoos 2x the price of they Sexy Hair brand</li>
            <li>This stuff really doesn&#x27;t work on my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>was paying $16 a can at my local grocery store and was so excited to see this for about 35% less money on Amazon.</li>
            <li>But for the price, you get massive volume, no white powdery mess (remember to shake the can between sprays people), no icky residue, a clean scent and a product that does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>A new essential.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling very tacky and dry.  </li>
            <li>I dye my hair red and as we all know, red washes out very qickly</li>
            <li>just give it a few quick spritz</li>
            <li>Usually scents don&#x27;t bother me but the scent on this one wasn&#x27;t as good as other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I could barely even brush the products out!  </li>
            <li>This stuff not only gets the oil out, but WOW does it add volume!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is similar to hairspray like one person mentioned, but not completely overwhelming like some of the cheap hairspray smell like.</li>
            <li>But then again I only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>Recently had my brothers wedding and with all the running around, I didn&#x27;t have time to completely wash my hair before getting my hair done on the wedding day.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;m too tired to wash my hair for a week or more.</li>
            <li>I tried a few other dry shampoos before this one (Tigi Rockaholic and a beauty store brand) and it&#x27;s my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>Tried hot water and all the typical things, but it still won&#x27;t spray.</li>
            <li>I have medium length wavy blod hair and it is useful for an extra no-wash, but spray it and then let it set for 2 mins before brushing it or you will have a tangly mess.</li>
            <li>Because I have very oily hair and skin, I never thought I could get away with washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>I have had good success with Klorane but hate using any solvents, so I try to use homemade dry shampoo, google</li>
            <li>I also wash at night sometimes, let my hair air dry, and I am able to wake up the next day, spray around my roots, and I have thick hair and body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: If you want soft hair that moves, use as little as you can, and only where your hair is oily.. too much of this stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly new dry shampoo user and this was the second product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>And it also seemed to really weigh my hair down, but that could just be my hair type.    </li>
            <li>Stay away if you don&#x27;t like the feeling of product in your hair, because this is on the gritty-feeling side, but it seriously works wonders and makes day 2 and day 3 hair look volumized and clean.  </li>
            <li>My ratings so far for dry shampoos are as follows:    1.  </li>
            <li>I have long, dark hair that gets greasy the first day after a wash.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine, straight hair that is slightly on the oily side (I have to wash it every day).  </li>
            <li>so there is no real excuse for only a couple uses.</li>
            <li>Just a little of this stuff really helps reduce the oily factor in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I know when using a dry shampoo one cannot expect one&#x27;s hair to fee; legitimately clean, but it is an odd feature I have yet to experience with other</li>
            <li>After I wash and blow dry, I spray the Volumizing Dry Shampoo around the roots at my crown, give it a minute to dry, and then gently comb it through my hair...</li>

            <li> all suggestions are welcome!</li>
            <li> it is great to use to give your hair a change in style, if you are going out for the evening and don&#x27;t have time or want to wash your hair, or just to give your hair a pick me up for the evening, or even midday if you need it!</li>
            <li> This product works incredibly well - hair</li>
            <li> smells so good!  </li>
            <li> It does smell good though!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great for when I am teasing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any clogging on the nozzle.</li>
            <li> Happened to me after using the prodcut ONCE, ..which wasn&#x27;t all that great anyway.  </li>
            <li> product works great, but for the amount of money, I wish I could use it all up.</li>
            <li> But still great quality, great brand.  </li>
            <li> and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> It smells great too.</li>
            <li> , however it works so great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great for volume and the &#x27;shampoo&#x27; aspect.</li>
            <li> lol  </li>
            <li> This works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, i think it smells good</li>
            <li> But, that texture is great for an updo and your hair will hold in the updo much better!  </li>
            <li> and it is very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Gives me good volume without having to do a lot.</li>
            <li> Good for taking pictures, but not for getting close on a date.</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend commented that my hair smelt good.</li>
            <li> It smells really good.  </li>
            <li> And I loved the volume it gave my hair.</li>
            <li> and it does not smell good.</li>
            <li> My good friend is a licensed cosmetologist and has been doing my hair for years.</li>
            <li> I bought it off of here since than, and works just as good as it did at the salon.</li>
            <li> However, I do have to note that I loved the look it gave to my hair</li>
            <li> I loved what I got to use of this product</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> It is kind of pricey without the amazing results of the cheaper varieties (aka Batiste!)</li>
            <li> I think it would be good for use if you have an event and are going to put your hair up, since the dirtier the better!  </li>
            <li> While I love the scent and the product works great</li>
            <li> I would be more happy with it if the product/can wasn&#x27;t faulity.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Told ya - love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>

            <li> love using this!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it !  </li>
            <li> wish I would have checked the reviews because this has happened to many people!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> , I cant find it at the salon or in stores here, so I will have to be ordering it on here, and make sure I always have it!</li>
            <li> The seller has it listed at a great price and shipped very quickly though</li>
            <li> Doubles as an amazing root boost if oil isn&#x27;t your issue.</li>
            <li> REally amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Its a must have in your beauty arsenal for when you need it, but make sure its a good one.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and is not overpowering (by the time I got to work</li>
            <li> This product is very close to a perfect solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard so many good reviews on this and figured i would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why this product has received so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like a fruity car freshener though.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and they either feel like you have something greasy or powdery in your hair or do not do a good job of behaving like a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tried running warm water over it to unclog it</li>
            <li> I liked that is was a spray.</li>
            <li> safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> a normal, oil is gone, and my hair looks great!!</li>
            <li> Now, I can go 2 or 3 days and my hair looks better and better each day!  </li>
            <li> I had used this brand&#x27;s hairspray before and liked it OK.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS STILL REALLY FULL LOOKING!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> The first two times I used it, it worked great.</li>
            <li> The spray was ok.  </li>
            <li> and I love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does an okay job getting rid of the grease but also leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> Its more like a baby powder.</li>
            <li> It does help my hair to have more volume.  </li>
            <li> initially this product was GREAT!</li>
            <li> If you are one of those people who&#x27;s hair looks better the day after you wash it, you might like this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Just okay for me.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I have been able to skip a wash day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I will use it in a pinch if my go to favorite Batiste tropical is out of stock, but I won&#x27;t buy it otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Okay - the sprayer got clogged on me</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> but my hair is going to look a lot healthier too. :)</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing again! :)</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> but I wish I had because I paid alot more at CVS.</li>
            <li> The smell is just okay</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LIFE SAVER</li>
            <li> I would never use it again, my bottle was a gift, glad I&#x27;m not out the $.</li>
            <li> I love the brand</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a great texture with volume that lasts and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this one the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others, and they just don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> First of all the smell is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I was expecting more for my money.     </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not so sure it \\&quot;added\\&quot; any that would be there if the oil wasn&#x27;t there.  </li>
            <li> Will order more</li>
            <li> Do I wish it was slightly more affordable?</li>
            <li> What more do you need?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> It was more like spraying hairspray on my head.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried many but none of them hold up like this one</li>
            <li> &amp; i love the texture feeling.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second can and can now keep my hairdresser happy after she colors my hair and tells me not to wash it every day!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Handles the grease without adding more shine.</li>
            <li> better if you hold the can farther away...if you hold it too close, it will look like you have powder in your hair.</li>
            <li> This one is easy to apply, does not leave residue and it smells nicely, and not too strong.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is great for individuals with dark hair like myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> The first 2 times that I used this product I absolutely LOVED it, but after that the product wouldn&#x27;t spray out of the can.</li>
            <li> I can go two days between washes with this Dry Shampoo and my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> Best volumizing dry shampoo, but</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I have used.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> -- if you&#x27;re a fan of Oribe-style volume and don&#x27;t mind a bit of....stiffness to your strands, this is THE BEST dry shampoo out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> best dry shampoo ever</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I find this dry shampoo to be the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  </li>
            <li> I have found it works best if I spray it in, brush, and then blow dry for 10 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m happy, but I&#x27;ll keep looking to see if I can find something better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel oily at all, my hair looks clean, and has some volume!</li>
            <li> Again, tastes in scent will vary but to me, this is one of the best smelling dry shampoos out there!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I have used other things in the Sexy Hair line and been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Pros-the product does absorb oil, and smells nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to my hair being silky smooth and able to run my hands through it easily.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair to a bob to make it more managable, but of course now it looks oilier more quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use it right out of the shower for volume.&lt;br /&gt;it is amazing</li>
            <li> Not a bad price either!</li>
            <li> Easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> It adds alot of volume easily.  </li>
            <li> Takes away the oil, adds volume, easy to style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--It smells like hairspray, so it can be strong.  </li>
            <li> people complain that the smell is strong, but i like it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a strong smell to it.</li>
            <li> I love that this product takes the oil right out of my roots (and believe me, I get oily!)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty amazing for me.</li>
            <li> This is a very good volumizing dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair</li>
            <li> Using dry shampoo is a great way to extend the life of *most types and styles of hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium hair, cut at the collarbone and love wearing it with loose waves, and this works great to get some lift and oomph at the roots and add body to the style.</li>
            <li> I felt that though I had awesome volume, I was sacrificing softness because the texture was a little stiffer, almost as if I had lightly sprayed with hairspray.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the only way I can skip a day between washes!</li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> and the scent, though light, still bugged me.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m also available for questions if you have any.</li>
            <li> It works great, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or with a massive hairspray smell.</li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> The 1/3 of this product that I actually got to use was great, but the sprayer clogged up and stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I want a free replacement sent to me.</li>
            <li> I actually really enjoy using this product:  </li>
            <li> I do spray this lightly to freshen.</li>
            <li> I do find the longer ends of my hair a bit straw and straggly, but if I use a good leave-in spray on moisturizer on the length of my hair (not the roots), then the ends are soft, and the roots are not greasy.  </li>
            <li> When I let it down the morning it has awesome volume and looks freshly washed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> But if not, this is the stuff that is worth it!  </li>
            <li> I use it often on freshly washed hair because it gives awesome volume for teasing or just a little boost to the roots.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a visible residue, it truly makes me hair look clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo that adds volume and texture.</li>
            <li> Tigi is ok, but seems too light weight to really do any thing.</li>
            <li> It does add a lot of volume, but it doesn&#x27;t really clean like the description says it will.</li>
            <li> Gives volume and texture while being a great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have easily gotten 2-3 days worth of style out of my hair since using this product (without washing)</li>
            <li> It takes the dryness right our and adds tons of volume!</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily fast, and I don&#x27;t want to wash it every day since it is fine and damages easily.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I have so much more volume (working better than hairspray which I barely ever use) looking</li>
            <li> Love the sexy brand as a general rule.  </li>
            <li> Baby powder works better and its much cheaper and doesnt leak after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Big Sexy did the job, lasted longer and filled the bottle more.  </li>
            <li> it most are part cornstarch, baking soda, oat powder mix in some real cocoa to darken it up a bit.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say how much I love this product, I will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> and adds dryness, volume, and a light fresh scent</li>
            <li> i just make sure to spray it under hair really well.</li>
            <li> I have super oily hair</li>
            <li> Super delayed shipment.</li>
            <li> I love the big sexy line of products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviewers note they don&#x27;t like the fragrance - it is stronger than some but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong and if just feels caked in my hair, even though I don&#x27;t spray much on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> MY MOST FAVORITE DRY SHAMPOO,.</li>
            <li> We are all different and results may vary but I have found this product to be one of the best dry shampoos that I have ever used</li>
            <li> There are many better dry shampoos</li>
            <li> Besides the shipment taking a little while, this product is always great.  </li>
            <li> I felt it worked great, but did make my hair feel a little straw-like as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been told that I smell amazing by numerous people after using this product!).</li>
            <li> My hair has volume and looks fresh again.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price, considering it&#x27;s about $20-$25 at the salon.</li>
            <li> But I think these are worth it because it works so well.</li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> So far I really like Oscar Blandi dry shampoo which I used in Spain and was impressed and now Big Sexy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos to take care of my fine and somewhat oily hair.  </li>
            <li> I went two days without washing, sprayed a little in my hair, and had a nice sweaty workout without looking like a grease ball!</li>
            <li> If I wash my hair in the morning I can show signs of oily hair as early as that evening so a product like this, that actually works, saves me time, energy and makes my hair more healthy by not having to wash it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY MAKES MY HAIR FULL....</li>
            <li> I have flat, fine, straight hair that gets super oily looking very quickly.</li>
            <li> Most of the other reviewers are right when they say it changes the texture of your hair/scalp, but I&#x27;m completely fine with that if it will keep the oil at bay.</li>
            <li> Voluminous Dry Shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and so far I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you do want to use it strictly as a dry shampoo it works amazing.</li>
            <li> I even like its smell, however it runs out way too quickly and it is very pricey if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Slightly tacky at times, have to brush it out really good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset because it really was a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> But for occasional use when you need it, it does a great job and definitely adds volume too.</li>
            <li> This product also doubles as a volumizer for my super silky straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very very oily if I do not wash it for a day and this product almost removes all of the oily and gives volume.</li>
            <li> Big Sexy wins out purely for a price point and volume.  </li>
            <li> The powder is super fine, it doesn&#x27;t show up gray at all, and it leaves my hair looking fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> I became interested in the product after one of my friends told me about it.</li>
            <li> and I was only able to use the product once.  </li>
            <li> Big Sexy  3.  </li>
            <li> It stops working, with so much more left in the bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this product but now for the second time it stopped working when still 1/4 - 1/3</li>
            <li> My hair looks fresh and it lasts the whole 12 hours of my work shift.</li>
            <li> volume Bumble and Bumble gives the most height (and comes in a variety of colors, not white like all the others), for getting rid of oil, yet not stripping your hair Oscar Blandi (I like the spray vs the powder)</li>
            <li> but I always got more in some spots and not enough in others.     </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> BUT -- if you&#x27;re looking for sexy bedhead, for volume, for that sort of Italian Movie Star \\&quot;JBF\\&quot; hair, this does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells better than hairspray, but definitely has a fragrance.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s almost a better tactic for this stuff -- before bed anticipation of saving time the following morning.....</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I would recommend styling the hair first.</li>
            <li> also for second day hair, if you are in a rush, or for whatever (many)</li>
            <li> It works great, definitely my number one dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The seller I ordered this from was amazing, shipping within 24 hours and at 30% cheaper than any other vendor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and there is no comparison to Big Sexy.</li>
            <li> THE ABSOLUTE BEST DRY SHAMPOO I USE IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> and I have tried many many different dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> The Product is pretty good is used in small portions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four or five brands of dry shampoo, include Frederic Fekkai and other top lines, and this one does a nice job of soaking up oil and giving some texture and body at the roots.</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> But the dry shampoo is a much better product.</li>
            <li> this my favorite dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have used almost every dry shampoo on the market, and this one is just ok for me.  </li>
            <li> I really love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it keeps my hair volumized  without having to blow it dry every day</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> i love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have really fine blonde hair and this stuff</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fine with the extra volume there.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using Big Sexy Hair Volumizing Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium length, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Most dry shampoos require touch ups during the day - not this one!  </li>
            <li> Other brands of dry shampoo (such as Suave Professionals) have more of a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of dry shampoo- from Bumble &amp; Bumble to Not Your Mother&#x27;s, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice to get a little lift around the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to throw the whole thing out.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t smell the product anymore), and it really mopped up all the oil at my roots.</li>
            <li> I caution that you do not use too much of it, otherwise your hair gets a \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; texture.</li>
            <li> I may order another and just use when I really need the volume.</li>
            <li> Plus it really does help when you maybe should wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Works so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it allowed me to go 1-2 days without washing my hair, which was helpful on days I had to run out the door</li>
            <li> One warning - don&#x27;t use too much or too close or it will be grainy.  </li>
            <li> some of the others are capable of.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost that feeling of having too much hairspray in your hair and not washing it for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really wash every day because it dries the end of my hair out.</li>
            <li> For the price it is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this prodcut.</li>
            <li> It really is very absorbent</li>
            <li> I was very disapointed with it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great volume boost for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue like the cheap brands do.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful when teasing my hair at the roots.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it makes my hair full and so pretty, even second day hair!</li>
            <li> Love the hairspray, but DISLIKE the dry shampoo!!</li>
            <li> It does leave your hair feeling stiff at the roots if you use too much, but overall, it is great for every-other-day hair.  </li>
            <li> Knowing that they could just wash my hair before getting it done, I didn&#x27;t even want to try this stuff at first, mostly because of all the let downs of previous products.</li>
            <li> Will leave a residue if sprayed for too long or too close to the scalp, but that is user error and easily avoidable.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, long hair and no matter how much hair spray</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a list of some other ones I tried that I didn&#x27;t love as much because this one blew them out of the water --</li>
            <li> Nothing else compares in my book and I&#x27;ve tried many other brands.</li>
            <li> Other brands are better.  </li>
            <li> This was a problem with the other sprays I tried, that they needed more thorough applications that were, frankly, almost as tiring as washing my hair would have been.</li>
            <li> in all though I would recommend it over most other waterless shampoos.</li>
            <li> I decently don&#x27;t like the price for as much as you get.</li>
            <li> so as long as no one is running their fingers through my roots, it&#x27;s fine  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not your typical dry shampoo, it does soak up the oils in your hair, volumize and hold very effectively.  </li>
            <li> , it does the trick, and even adds volume that I normally never get with my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> really like the Big Sexy Hair dry spray because I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it</li>
            <li> Its more like a sticky hairspray...and unlike another reviewer, i thought the smell was too strong and not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of dry shampoos and this is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li> Plus it does fade very quickly and if you spray a little perfume or hair spray it will cover right over it.  </li>
            <li> looks \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and full, without becoming dull and feeling overly \\&quot;coated\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not as fragrant as other dry shampoos, which is good.</li>
            <li> you first put it on, your hair looks grey but as you brush out or towel your hair, the oil is absorbed and you didnt have to shower.</li>
            <li> no seriously.</li>
            <li> Batiste is the cheapest in price and does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> Does not show up in my dark brown hair and offers a nice volumizing boost with no heavy sticky hairspray feeling.  </li>
            <li> It felt more like hairspray and made my hair stiff and didn&#x27;t add much volume either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, including drug store and high end.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used most dry shampoos on the market (Oscar Blandi, Ojon, Batiste, Tigi Rockaholic and Bumble and Bumble) and this one is my least favorite of the bunch.  </li>
            <li> In spite of all the advice from my hairdresser, I&#x27;ve never been able to go a day without a wash without greasy strings of flat hair next to my face.  </li>
            <li> In order to skip a day to try and save my color, I started using this product and now I&#x27;m completely hooked!!</li>
            <li> A little more hair spray- esque than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> With this product, one spray in the morning lasts me all day (nearly two days!!).</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how little actual product was needed to get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive or was easier to find.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair feeling very sticky and not that helpful as far as making hair look cleaner.</li>
            <li> definitely didn&#x27;t get that freshly washed feeling or look.</li>
            <li> and it is back to looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> I comb through and use curling iron as I normally would.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, I noticed that my hair was more voluminous.</li>
            <li> To get great results with this dry shampoo, treat it much like liquid shampoo: apply as little as humanly possible (say, 4 to 6 fraction-of-a-second spritzes) and then &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; to distribute evenly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless dry shampoo products and this one is by FAR the only one I&#x27;ve really loved.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it came in a larger size because I feel like I will use it up very quickly.</li>
            <li> The Big Sexy Dry Shampoo does not appear on my hair after I have sprayed it on.</li>
            <li> I tried some \\&quot;refresher\\&quot; products and a couple of dry sprays, but the Big Sexy Hair turned out to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the stiff hair is a deal-breaker then that might be a problem, but for people like me who need something that&#x27;s strong and long-lasting, I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The spray does, as most of the other reviewers have mentioned, make my hair feel stiff afterwards, but my hair looks fine.</li>
            <li> When I received the dry shampoo the bottle felt full and still does</li>
            <li> Nearly all of them I felt that I needed to wash out or re-apply after a couple of days, but usually the Big Sexy Hair will be okay without re-application until I can work up to actually washing my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant live with out this now.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s time to find a new product--</li>
            <li> I had so much volume on the top of my head that I had a hard time getting the paddle brush through it like the directions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous dry shampoos and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I think it works a little better for blondes or those with light brown hair, because if you don&#x27;t work it in or you spray it too close, there is a little bit of a light-colored residue (as if you&#x27;d put baby powder in your hair).</li>
            <li> I think this product is okay, it works pretty well as a dry shampoo for half a day or so</li>
            <li> It does make your hair have a different texture, kind of stiff.  </li>
            <li> When you first spray it is white.  </li>
            <li> I would buy more and keep as backup for lazy days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other products and I&#x27;ve had multiple problems...way too powdery, runs out way too soon</li>
            <li> I definitely suggest getting a sample sized bottle to try first if you are hesitant about the results just so that you can see how your hair reacts with this product.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair OK, can size is really small.</li>
            <li> and I would oftentimes look forward to the day after shampooing because it actually made my blow out look better the 2nd and 3rd day!</li>
            <li> similar: the Victoria&#x27;s Secret \\&quot;Sexy Hair\\&quot; dry shampoo -- also adds good lift and volume, imparts definite TEXTURE to the hair -- in the vein of Oribe.</li>
            <li> And after applying it, hair feels fresh and dry (not oily).</li>
            <li> I have long hair, but it&#x27;s fine AND flat.  </li>
            <li> A little on the roots on day 2-3, a little more underneath the following day, then up in a messy bun on day 5 -- this gives enough hold to make my ponytails look thicker and stay in place more easily</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and does not hold and looks very flat unless I don&#x27;t wash it for a few days or use something to make it \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I prefer other like the one from suave or even better batist dry shampoo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a huge boost to my spirits to not have to have limp, oily hair anymore, even when I don&#x27;t have the energy to wash it for days on end.</li>
            <li> She recommended this spray product to me after I had given up on my search for a reasonably priced and decent dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly (spray lightly mostly near roots area).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this can for almost a month and so far it hasn&#x27;t been faulty.</li>
            <li> With the Big Sexy Hair, I just spray a few bursts at my roots</li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this, and have been using it often, and I will always make sure to have at least an extra bottle for when I run out</li>
            <li> While the product certainly does it&#x27;s job of making my hair feel less oily and making it smell better, I can&#x27;t help but notice that it leaves an odd sort of crunchiness to it that I cannot brush out.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all - in fact</li>
            <li> This is my first dry shampoo, it seems to leave a residue in my hair which I do not like.</li>
            <li> This was my first time experimenting with dry shampoo .</li>
            <li> My hair has a tenancy to become slightly greasy after a full day of work and this product helps prevent any shine around my roots.</li>
            <li> First of all: this is probably NOT well-suited to folks with soft, silky hair who want their second (and third...and fourth) day hair to feel soft and silky and \\&quot;just-washed.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great dry shampoo that works without leaving behind white powder in your hair or on your clothes this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll often mist this on my roots BEFORE bed, and when I wake up, it&#x27;s still as clean and fluffy as the night before</li>
            <li> NOPE, my second can did the same exact thing.     </li>
            <li> I have very soft Asian hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl and when I use this stuff, I have so much volume and the curls really last.  </li>
            <li> I was a little annoyed at how small this product was for the price, but then the first time I used this product it worked great!  </li>
            <li> This product works so well for my hair that I started using it after I wash and dry my hair, just a little on my bangs and the top of my roots.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes it possible to stretch an extra day or two before a full shampoo, but I have found myself starting to use a little on clean hair as I like the extra volume so much.  </li>
            <li> i love dry shampoo and get by a few days without washing and reblowdrying, styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few dry shampoos 2x the price of they Sexy Hair brand</li>
            <li> This stuff really doesn&#x27;t work on my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> was paying $16 a can at my local grocery store and was so excited to see this for about 35% less money on Amazon.</li>
            <li> But for the price, you get massive volume, no white powdery mess (remember to shake the can between sprays people), no icky residue, a clean scent and a product that does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> A new essential.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling very tacky and dry.  </li>
            <li> I dye my hair red and as we all know, red washes out very qickly</li>
            <li> just give it a few quick spritz</li>
            <li> Usually scents don&#x27;t bother me but the scent on this one wasn&#x27;t as good as other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I could barely even brush the products out!  </li>
            <li> This stuff not only gets the oil out, but WOW does it add volume!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is similar to hairspray like one person mentioned, but not completely overwhelming like some of the cheap hairspray smell like.</li>
            <li> But then again I only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> Recently had my brothers wedding and with all the running around, I didn&#x27;t have time to completely wash my hair before getting my hair done on the wedding day.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m too tired to wash my hair for a week or more.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other dry shampoos before this one (Tigi Rockaholic and a beauty store brand) and it&#x27;s my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> Tried hot water and all the typical things, but it still won&#x27;t spray.</li>
            <li> I have medium length wavy blod hair and it is useful for an extra no-wash, but spray it and then let it set for 2 mins before brushing it or you will have a tangly mess.</li>
            <li> Because I have very oily hair and skin, I never thought I could get away with washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I have had good success with Klorane but hate using any solvents, so I try to use homemade dry shampoo, google</li>
            <li> I also wash at night sometimes, let my hair air dry, and I am able to wake up the next day, spray around my roots, and I have thick hair and body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: If you want soft hair that moves, use as little as you can, and only where your hair is oily.. too much of this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly new dry shampoo user and this was the second product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> And it also seemed to really weigh my hair down, but that could just be my hair type.    </li>
            <li> Stay away if you don&#x27;t like the feeling of product in your hair, because this is on the gritty-feeling side, but it seriously works wonders and makes day 2 and day 3 hair look volumized and clean.  </li>
            <li> My ratings so far for dry shampoos are as follows:    1.  </li>
            <li> I have long, dark hair that gets greasy the first day after a wash.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, straight hair that is slightly on the oily side (I have to wash it every day).  </li>
            <li> so there is no real excuse for only a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Just a little of this stuff really helps reduce the oily factor in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I know when using a dry shampoo one cannot expect one&#x27;s hair to fee; legitimately clean, but it is an odd feature I have yet to experience with other</li>
            <li> After I wash and blow dry, I spray the Volumizing Dry Shampoo around the roots at my crown, give it a minute to dry, and then gently comb it through my hair...</li>
            <li> It would be five stars, but it dries out my hair so much making it really stiff in some spots.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply too much or it might make your hair a little grey--</li>
            <li> My stylist suggested this product a few years ago and I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> , I found that this lasted about a third as long as the last brand I tried.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with the Ojon dry shampoo that adds volume and work for second or third day hair as a refreshment.</li>
            <li> I am going back to my sauve keratin infusion dry shampoo thats only $3.</li>
            <li> have no idea why this hasn&#x27;t been fixed yet, and I have even less of an idea why I keep coming back.  </li>
            <li> I use it goes flat after an hour.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> When applied, it does spray a little heavy, but once it dries, hair feel fresh and cleaned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far easier to apply than other dry shampoos in powder form.</li>
            <li> Will not waste my money on any other dry shampoo ever again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos before, but I am completely sold on this stuff.</li>
            <li> This removed all hints of oil, gave my usually flat hair volume and lift, and (something I&#x27;ve never had before) gave it texture, too!</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo I use.</li>
            <li> Helps maintain color with less frequent washings.</li>
            <li> and instead the roots feel quite dry, definitely volumizing.</li>
            <li> and it is a big pain in the butt to wash and dry it every day.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, it doesn&#x27;t clog, no need to shake the spray and there is no white residue, but no-thanks for dirty hair feeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of dry shampoo and this is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of all the dry shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried (around 7 different brands)</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is a novel concept and I&#x27;ll be trying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> and it is definitely mid-range priced to comparable dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Love this product, when your hair is thin and limp it helps to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried less expensive dry shampoos, but they left a white residue on my hair that made it appear as if I had powder in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different dry shampoo&#x27;s and have always come out unhappy.</li>
            <li> Wasted money, I followed the instructions but thought it was not really fitting my hair type and not really making hair look clean after applying.</li>
            <li> you brush it out, the texture of the hair is different, which is expected.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stick around too long</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the instructs and don&#x27;t put a lot on your hair .my hair was still manegable with out all the residue.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long hair either</li>
            <li> It definitely makes your hair look clean...just be careful about spraying it too closely else</li>
            <li> Especially if you do the spray upside down thing and turn your head back up.  </li>
            <li> long as you don&#x27;t expect Oscar Blandi-softness, this stuff wins the dry shampoo game.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel really stiff and un natural.</li>
            <li> I like other Big Sexy Products, but this dry shampoo makes my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> It does work as dry shampoo and it provides a little volume to my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the dry shampoo alot since I only wash my hair every other day or so.</li>
            <li> If I do not wash my hair, the next day it is flat and slightly oily at the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos from the drug store, and they make hair look white!</li>
            <li> I have try other similar Dry Shampoo, but this leaves the hair like using some hold spray.</li>
            <li> I try to not wash my hair daily to keep from stripping my hair from the natural oils which causes it to look dull and break.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go very long without washing it.  </li>
            <li> also have another dry shampoo</li>
            <li> , so dry shampoo may not be for me.</li>
            <li> The principle of \\&quot;dry Shampoo\\&quot; is lost on this product.</li>
            <li> it absorbs the greasiness in my hair and cleans it with a dry look(when</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been meaning to try a dry shampoo for some time when I bought this product.</li>
            <li> and I have used powdered dry shampoos that have seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if an aerosol dry shampoo would work just as well, and this one is just not satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Enter dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> tresemme dry shampoo  5.  </li>
            <li> However, it makes my hair feel dry and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have used Batiste and Garnier Fructise dry shampoos before trying this.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried alot of dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have tried my share of dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I use this product not as a dry shampoo, but as a styling product to give my hair thickness and texture.</li>
            <li> Before I started experimenting with dry shampoo, I would be so embarassed about my hair.</li>
            <li> Amika Un-done Texture spray, Rusk texture spray, Garnier texture spray, Amika dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked about it was the scent and the somewhat gritty feel.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that is kinda thin, so it get&#x27;s greesy FAST.</li>
            <li> I was washing EVERY SINGLE day and having to take 30 minutes to blow it dry and then touch up with the curling iron/flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos that leave a white powder residue and this one is addordable and does not leave a white powdery mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different dry shampoos to cut down on washing my hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost to have it not work after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> it is a complete oil slick.</li>
            <li> The price is tempting but for me it was not worth only one use.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not wonderful, but it&#x27;s not bad either.  </li>
            <li> I have used a couple different brands of dry shampoo because my hair is just too long to wash and dry everyday.</li>
            <li> I did like that my hair didn&#x27;t loose it&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a let down.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dry shampoos before, but I&#x27;ll never leave this one again!</li>
            <li> I have black hair and it leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li> have very thin and fine dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible, actually it&#x27;s quite pleasant, but I&#x27;m just not my preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 8 different dry shampoos and I always go back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a dry shampoo that made my hair so stiff and gross that I cannot even run my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li> Used as directed, it left my hair feeling dry and stiff, couldn&#x27;t get a comb or brush through my hair.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair a little &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; but I only apply to roots</li>
            <li> Then the nozzle plugged up and it only spits out a little bit of the product.</li>
            <li> , just a little bit is enough and it does the work of volume and gets rid of grease</li>
            <li> you have to be careful if you are a burnette tho it does leave a little white in your hair.</li>
            <li> I still like other dry hairsprays/shampoos but cannot afford $40 per can when I go through about a can a month....</li>
            <li> Does not really do its job as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Im cant believe i spent over $20 on these.</li>
            <li> This does not really fix that problem.</li>
            <li> and it only takes a few seconds to apply it.</li>
            <li> This spray will hold a style an extra day but it will be stiff.</li>
            <li> i use it on clean or dirty hair.</li>
            <li> and I find that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use just a tiny bit and then usually don&#x27;t bother brushing it out.  </li>
            <li> Probably every other day tops.  </li>
            <li> I read the description but didn&#x27;t register that it was such a small amount.</li>
            <li> The aerosol smell does fade, but in the meantime it made me want to gag, especially since I have a small bathroom.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also lasts for longer than the other products.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine any other brand not doing that.</li>
            <li> other reasons that you need to use it</li>
            <li> I too thought it was a little tacky feeling and made my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> the spray mechanism has clogged up and ceased spraying anything but dry air a little over halfway through.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few types of other dry shampoos and they do not do this.  </li>
            <li> The 3.4 oz is small and only lasts about a month or less.</li>
            <li> I always felt that other sprays either weighed it down or couldn&#x27;t keep it from getting greasy mid-day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found others either leave hair dull and have a white, powdery residue or are invisible but also appear to do nothing at all.</li>
            <li> it did the opposite, it also made my hair feel hard and</li>
            <li> My other go-to product from this company is the &amp;#34;Powder Play&amp;#34; which adds unbelievable volume (with additional backcombing) to your hair and also works as a dry shampoo in powder form.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cash.</li>
            <li> Spray, wait 2 minutes and brush off&lt;br /&gt;--Works for dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> This one leaves no residue on my dark hair.</li>
            <li> This product was definetely not worth the price</li>
            <li> Not worth the $15 that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> So for the money, its not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that by the end of the day sometimes my scalp itches.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the textural feeling it leaves ...</li>
            <li> it can make your hair gray (if you have dark hair like me).</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have thick dark hair that get&#x27;s oily quickly, especially in the front and bangs.  </li>
            <li> It was really hard to use the flat iron and curling iron after using.</li>
            <li> I went from washing my hair everyday to every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Generally, I spray my roots at night and pull hair half up with a clip.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you could spray this stuff Friday night and go camping all weekend without needing to shampoo or reapply the entire trip.</li>
            <li> Its suppose to make my hair look less oily</li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> I wash my hair about twice a week, use this every non-wash day, and a can lasts a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make y hair feel weird or different but at the same time takes out all the grease!</li>
            <li> and I got less than 10 uses out of it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair about once a week and use this usually on day 3 or 4 to dry up the roots as they get a little oily.</li>
            <li> so this was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> it does not weigh my hair down, or make it greasy/oily looking, or messy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered through experimentation that the less spray I use, the less stiff my hair is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dry shampoo fanatic..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased at least 7 bottles of this product and each and every single time</li>
            <li> I spray a little at the roots in the front and sides of my medium length hair and let it sit while I do makeup and dress, and then brush it out.  </li>
            <li> Even one little spray</li>
            <li> Weighed down my hair, and made it look dirtier than it was to begin with!</li>
            <li> It was a waste.</li>
            <li> Doing this is destroying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tigi rockaholic (don&#x27;t waste your money)  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s worse when you get hair product in a can than when the can doesn&#x27;t work properly</li>
            <li> I have limp hair</li>
            <li> It wears off a few moments after spraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I used a hair dryer and a round brush when I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair and it helps me go a few days between washings.</li>
            <li> just put on a few sprays</li>
            <li> It made my hair so sticky and stiff that I could not stand it.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair stiff and feel chalky.</li>
            <li> It also makes the hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> A dry shampoo that has enough hairspray-like hold in it to grip my hair and not leave it crazy static-y.</li>
            <li> Weighs hair down, makes it look dull.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty bad - comparable to hairspray.</li>
            <li> We all know it is bad to wash your hair daily especially if you use a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> So after trying several different dry shampoos I&#x27;ve got to say this will strip nasty odors and oil out of my hair with less product than any I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> or I was just being lazy.</li>
            <li> I usually spray it on, then flip my hair over my head, give it a shake and run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> I have just reordered plus a small 1 oz can for travel</li>
            <li> Sadly from the 3.4 oz can I only got a couple uses.</li>
            <li> although, day 2 and 3 are days where I usually pin my hair up</li>
            <li> tad expensive for the same function as dove or suave</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use an excessive amount either.</li>
            <li> The can is really small</li>
            <li> I can;t get away without having to wash my hair for a few days!</li>
            <li> Although I love this product and have been using it for some time, I am horribly disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Expensive for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find sometimes</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a bit of oomph on the non-washing day which is hard for me to come by.  </li>
            <li> This leaves a sticky, hard hair spray life residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to brush out and leaves a residue on brunette hair.</li>
            <li> It has been at least 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the day after using this my hair/scalp feels dirty.</li>
            <li> (I had one that ran out of the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; in a week after just a few uses), some smell bad, or they simply do not do what they should.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like the manufacturer of this product pays any attention to its negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> too heavy for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> First off, when I received the can I was very shocked at just how small the can is.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works so well and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either..</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Too bad after using it twice, it was empty.</li>
            <li> I hate to wash it daily because</li>
            <li> It also washes out well, doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue.</li>
            <li> (Also, I have not experienced a defective bottle yet).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s frustrating having a half-emty bottle of product you can&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few dry shampoos and this is the worst of the lot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos and they failed miserably!</li>
            <li> she sent the wrong items and then just disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The seller said they were unable to exchange or replace the product as they were all out.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it left my hair feeling disgusting.</li>
            <li> so it is useless.  </li>
            <li> I gave this 1 star because although I like the product when it works it is completely useless to me if it will not work.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, thin hair (but a lot of it!).</li>
            <li> It was too expensive for it to stop working 1/3 of the way through.</li>
            <li> It was really difficult to comb after using it.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this product was a bust.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling completely disgusting.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos and this was the worst one yet.</li>
            <li> This is the worst dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Crazy expensive for two uses.</li>
            <li> Basically it is just a powder in spray form that absorbs excess oil in dirty hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is alright, I&#x27;m not a fan of artificial scents.</li>
            <li> , this stuff STINKS when you use it.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use 80% of the product because the spray nozzle stopped working!</li>
            <li> It smelled so bad I had a headache</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell :-(.  </li>
            <li> Man am i disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This has t be the worst air product I have ever purchased!  </li>
            <li> It leaves a nasty residue on your hair and no volume at all!</li>
            <li> however, it made my head itch terribly.</li>
            <li> It leaves a horrible residue on the hair.</li>
            <li> It also smells awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was unable to use 80% of the product because the spray nozzle stopped working!</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo. I wash my hair about once a week and use this usually on day 3 or 4 to dry up the roots as they get a little oily. It leaves no flakes or residue. My hair has volume and looks fresh again. Great product!</li>
            <li> For those days you just do not have time to wash your hair, Sex Hair Big Hair Voluminous Dry Shampoo is amazing.  I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and there is no comparison to Big Sexy.</li>
            <li> The spray was ok.  I only got to use it once.  The spray nozzle stopped working even though the spray cap was not clogged.  I had to throw the whole thing out.  It was a waste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this just a couple of weeks and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have another dry shampoo but it does not offer the volume this shampoo does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for when I am teasing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a normal, oil is gone, and my hair looks great!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have fine wavy hair and I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos that leave a white powder residue and this one is addordable and does not leave a white powdery mess.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the only way I can skip a day between washes! I have super oily hair and I have it colored regularly - red of all colors. In order to skip a day to try and save my color, I started using this product and now I&#x27;m completely hooked!! It can be hard to find sometimes so I just ordered 5 cans. Ha! Told ya - love this stuff! It keeps my colorer longer and prevents me from looking oily between washes!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this and I don&#x27;t care for it. The smell is too strong and if just feels caked in my hair, even though I don&#x27;t spray much on. I&#x27;ve tried another brand that I also didn&#x27;t like, so dry shampoo may not be for me.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty bad - comparable to hairspray. It does an okay job getting rid of the grease but also leaves a residue. I also find that my hair becomes tangled which could be caused by the weight of the spray.</li>
            <li> I tried this product twice. The principle of \\&quot;dry Shampoo\\&quot; is lost on this product. Its more like a sticky hairspray...and unlike another reviewer, i thought the smell was too strong and not great. It got to the point where I had to walk outside so i wouldnt have to smell it on myself in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Algemarin. Its more like a baby powder. it absorbs the greasiness in my hair and cleans it with a dry look(when you first put it on, your hair looks grey but as you brush out or towel your hair, the oil is absorbed and you didnt have to shower. i love dry shampoo and get by a few days without washing and reblowdrying, styling my hair. Its a must have in your beauty arsenal for when you need it, but make sure its a good one.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark hair that gets greasy the first day after a wash. I hate to wash it daily because only the roots show signs of dirtiness and I&#x27;d rather not damage my ends-- plus, washing hair daily only further promotes oiliness.    I&#x27;d been meaning to try a dry shampoo for some time when I bought this product. I had used this brand&#x27;s hairspray before and liked it OK. But the dry shampoo is a much better product. It&#x27;s far easier to apply than other dry shampoos in powder form. It seems like a hairspray, but once it settles in, it looks and feel just like an oil absorber. It smells nice and is not overpowering (by the time I got to work I couldn&#x27;t smell the product anymore), and it really mopped up all the oil at my roots. After spraying it on, my hair was restored to the way it looks at the end of wash day-- when, in my opinion, it&#x27;s at its best.</li>
            <li> I have thick dark hair that get&#x27;s oily quickly, especially in the front and bangs.  I was washing EVERY SINGLE day and having to take 30 minutes to blow it dry and then touch up with the curling iron/flat iron.  Just a little of this stuff really helps reduce the oily factor in my hair.  I use just a tiny bit and then usually don&#x27;t bother brushing it out.  You can&#x27;t see it anyway.   It does make your hair have a different texture, kind of stiff.  But, that texture is great for an updo and your hair will hold in the updo much better!  It does help my hair to have more volume.  Especially if you do the spray upside down thing and turn your head back up.  The smell is not wonderful, but it&#x27;s not bad either.  Plus it does fade very quickly and if you spray a little perfume or hair spray it will cover right over it.  The smell is the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of dry shampoo- from Bumble &amp; Bumble to Not Your Mother&#x27;s, and this is by far my favorite. The powder is super fine, it doesn&#x27;t show up gray at all, and it leaves my hair looking fresh all day long. It also washes out well, doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue.</li>
            <li> initially this product was GREAT! I used it twice. The third time I went to use it, the entire can had leaked and there was none left. I bought an additional can thinking I had just got a defective can, NOPE, my second can did the same exact thing.     I wont pay another 10 bucks for 2 uses. Not worth the cash. Baby powder works better and its much cheaper and doesnt leak after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> too heavy for my thin hair.  I use only if absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> I have really fine blonde hair and this stuff just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Threw it out. Basically it is just a powder in spray form that absorbs excess oil in dirty hair. Weighs hair down, makes it look dull. If you are one of those people who&#x27;s hair looks better the day after you wash it, you might like this.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It works wonders and will allow 3-4 days between washings. Only thing is that I wish I would have ordered a bigger bottle. The 3.4 oz is small and only lasts about a month or less.</li>
            <li> I STILL have not heard from this seller.  It has been at least 3 weeks.  He/she sent the wrong items and then just disappeared.  I want my money back!  I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Just okay for me.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to work that well.  User error?</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos and this was the worst one yet. It felt more like hairspray and made my hair stiff and didn&#x27;t add much volume either. definitely didn&#x27;t get that freshly washed feeling or look.</li>
            <li> This spray will hold a style an extra day but it will be stiff. I have medium length wavy blod hair and it is useful for an extra no-wash, but spray it and then let it set for 2 mins before brushing it or you will have a tangly mess. It starts to feel like hairspray build up so you definitely need to wash the next day.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo I use. Although I like the way it feels in my hair, some may not.</li>
            <li> The product worked, my hair had a lot of body after i used it, but the day after I bought it, it started to leak out of the can. I think I used it only about 5 times before the can stoped spreying, although there was still some left in their.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the dry shampoo alot since I only wash my hair every other day or so. The company describes the product as \\&quot;Mineral and clay based...creates volume as it absorbs impurities, excess oil and product build-up. No water necessary. Helps maintain color with less frequent washings. It is a talc-free formula and is invisible and provides UV protection (Source Sexyhair.com)\\&quot;. After using the product my hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all and instead the roots feel quite dry, definitely volumizing. The shampoo sprays out in somewhat of an invisable powder that soaks up the oils in your hair. Remember to vigorously shake the can before every use to ensure the ingredients are properly mixed before application. Use sparingly (spray lightly mostly near roots area). Not too impressed with the product&#x27;s smell... has an aerosol hairspray scent. Other brands of dry shampoo (such as Suave Professionals) have more of a pleasant fragrance. Also, it is mineral and clay based, so it will give your hair a matte appearance - if you want to restore shine back into your hair you can use shine sprays or serums after applying. I hope this review is helpful!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing. I have ever used. I went from washing my hair everyday to every other day.</li>
            <li> Love this. It is perfect for a morning when you dont feel like washing your hair - just give it a few quick spritz and it is back to looking fresh.  I gives volume, texture, and removes any frizz!! Also hides any grease.</li>
            <li> Does not really do its job as I was expecting. My fringe line and part line become oily after a day and I have used powdered dry shampoos that have seemed to do the trick. I wanted to see if an aerosol dry shampoo would work just as well, and this one is just not satisfactory. My hair still looks oily and does not hold style with this product in it. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product but you will save money to buy the larger can</li>
            <li> This product is very close to a perfect solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin and fine dark brown hair.  My scalp is very oily at the end of the day, so I have to wash it everyday. Doing this is destroying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and so far I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good attributes:&lt;br /&gt;--It works. I have been able to skip a wash day. It takes away the oily look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;--Easy to use.  Spray, wait 2 minutes and brush off&lt;br /&gt;--Works for dark brown hair. When you first spray it is white.  When you brush off it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;--Adds a bit of body so the hair isn&#x27;t flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad attributes:&lt;br /&gt;--It smells like hairspray, so it can be strong.  It does go away after about one hour.&lt;br /&gt;--After you brush it out, the texture of the hair is different, which is expected. It feels like you sprayed your hair with hairspray then brushed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m happy, but I&#x27;ll keep looking to see if I can find something better. I haven&#x27;t experienced any clogging on the nozzle. But then again I only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> I think this product is okay, it works pretty well as a dry shampoo for half a day or so but I cannot get over the smell. I almost want to wash my hair just because I&#x27;m not into the way I (my hair) smells when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four or five brands of dry shampoo, include Frederic Fekkai and other top lines, and this one does a nice job of soaking up oil and giving some texture and body at the roots. I think it works a little better for blondes or those with light brown hair, because if you don&#x27;t work it in or you spray it too close, there is a little bit of a light-colored residue (as if you&#x27;d put baby powder in your hair). I&#x27;m blonde though so this isn&#x27;t a problem and this my favorite dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos and this is by far the best.  I absolutely love it.  Not greasy.  Easy to work with.  I comb through and use curling iron as I normally would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dry shampoo fanatic.. no seriously. I&#x27;ve tried them all, including drug store and high end. This one I keep coming back to. I don&#x27;t notice a visible residue, it truly makes me hair look clean. It does make your hair a little &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; but I only apply to roots so I&#x27;m fine with the extra volume there. I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> I have used almost every dry shampoo on the market, and this one is just ok for me.  I will use it in a pinch if my go to favorite Batiste tropical is out of stock, but I won&#x27;t buy it otherwise.  Pros-the product does absorb oil, and smells nice and fresh.  Cons-The texture of my hair afterwards was hideous.  I could barely even brush the products out!  It made my hair so sticky and stiff that I could not stand it.  It definitely does not allow for second day restyling the way others do.  I think it would be good for use if you have an event and are going to put your hair up, since the dirtier the better!  I have never used a dry shampoo that made my hair so stiff and gross that I cannot even run my fingers through it.  It is kind of pricey without the amazing results of the cheaper varieties (aka Batiste!)</li>
            <li> This is a very good volumizing dry shampoo. I even like its smell, however it runs out way too quickly and it is very pricey if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair. I love this stuff. Gives me good volume without having to do a lot. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the day after using this my hair/scalp feels dirty. I try to not wash my hair daily to keep from stripping my hair from the natural oils which causes it to look dull and break.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using Big Sexy Hair Volumizing Dry Shampoo. I became interested in the product after one of my friends told me about it. I have really long hair and it is a big pain in the butt to wash and dry it every day. Also, finals are coming up and I could use the extra thirty minutes or so to review. If I do not wash my hair, the next day it is flat and slightly oily at the scalp. I followed the instructions when I used the product. I caution that you do not use too much of it, otherwise your hair gets a \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; texture. After a few minutes, I noticed that my hair was more voluminous. No one noticed that I had not washed my hair that day. I only wish that it came in a larger size because I feel like I will use it up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Okay - the sprayer got clogged on me and I was only able to use the product once.  The seller said they were unable to exchange or replace the product as they were all out.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few dry shampoos and this is the worst of the lot.  It leaves your hair feeling very tacky and dry.  I threw it away after two uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used to date. I&#x27;ve found others either leave hair dull and have a white, powdery residue or are invisible but also appear to do nothing at all. This product works incredibly well - hair looks \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and full, without becoming dull and feeling overly \\&quot;coated\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve seen reviewers note they don&#x27;t like the fragrance - it is stronger than some but not unpleasant. If you are looking for a great dry shampoo that works without leaving behind white powder in your hair or on your clothes this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos to take care of my fine and somewhat oily hair.  I can&#x27;t go very long without washing it.  Probably every other day tops.  But even on the second day (the day I don&#x27;t wash it) my hair is a tad too oily at the roots for my taste.  Enter dry shampoos.  So far I really like Oscar Blandi dry shampoo which I used in Spain and was impressed and now Big Sexy.  Big Sexy wins out purely for a price point and volume.  I feel like Big Sexy did the job, lasted longer and filled the bottle more.  It gave my hair a bit of oomph on the non-washing day which is hard for me to come by.  The only thing I disliked about it was the scent and the somewhat gritty feel.  Usually scents don&#x27;t bother me but the scent on this one wasn&#x27;t as good as other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  Basically if you have cash to blow, try Oscar Blandi.  But if not, this is the stuff that is worth it!  My ratings so far for dry shampoos are as follows:    1.  Oscar Blandi  2.  Big Sexy  3.  Batiste  4.  tresemme dry shampoo  5.  Tigi rockaholic (don&#x27;t waste your money)  6.  Psssssssst!  (garbage)</li>
            <li> I like other Big Sexy Products, but this dry shampoo makes my hair feel dirty. The smell is ok, it doesn&#x27;t clog, no need to shake the spray and there is no white residue, but no-thanks for dirty hair feeling.  I will stick with the Ojon dry shampoo that adds volume and work for second or third day hair as a refreshment.</li>
            <li> The seller I ordered this from was amazing, shipping within 24 hours and at 30% cheaper than any other vendor. While I love the scent and the product works great, I found that this lasted about a third as long as the last brand I tried.  I may order another and just use when I really need the volume.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a larger size</li>
            <li> Wasted money, I followed the instructions but thought it was not really fitting my hair type and not really making hair look clean after applying.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product. I have fine, straight, long hair and no matter how much hair spray I use it goes flat after an hour. My stylist suggested this product a few years ago and I can&#x27;t live without it! It is great for adding volume and texture! I can go two days between washes with this Dry Shampoo and my hair looks great! Nothing else compares in my book and I&#x27;ve tried many other brands.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo that adds volume and texture. I will always have this product along with a backup in case I run out!</li>
            <li> I really love this dry shampoo. It does leave your hair feeling stiff at the roots if you use too much, but overall, it is great for every-other-day hair.  Worth the investment. I have tried other dry shampoos from the drug store, and they make hair look white! This one leaves no residue on my dark hair.</li>
            <li> Because I have very oily hair and skin, I never thought I could get away with washing my hair every other day. I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos and they failed miserably! But I decided to give this one a try and it works! I&#x27;ve only washed my hair twice this week! I don&#x27;t feel oily at all, my hair looks clean, and has some volume! I only spray it on my roots and then comb the it through my hair. I went two days without washing, sprayed a little in my hair, and had a nice sweaty workout without looking like a grease ball! Yes!!! That&#x27;s pretty amazing for me. Not only will I save time by not washing but my hair is going to look a lot healthier too. :)</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works so well and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either.. I&#x27;ve tried a few dry shampoos 2x the price of they Sexy Hair brand and they do not even come close to working as well as this product. My hair is very very oily if I do not wash it for a day and this product almost removes all of the oily and gives volume. Will be purchasing again! :)</li>
            <li> I use this even if I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair because I like the way it helps me style my hair. Plus it really does help when you maybe should wash your hair. I&#x27;ve been using this can for almost a month and so far it hasn&#x27;t been faulty. It still sprays well.</li>
            <li> Best volumizing dry shampoo, but I don&#x27;t like the smell :-(.  Good for taking pictures, but not for getting close on a date.</li>
            <li> The product works, butthis is my second time buying it because of the spray can.  It stops working, with so much more left in the bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of dry shampoo and this is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I spray my roots at night and pull hair half up with a clip. When I let it down the morning it has awesome volume and looks freshly washed.&lt;br /&gt;If you like to run your fingers through your hair throughout the day &amp; switch your part, you may not like this brand as much.&lt;br /&gt;I try to not handle my hair when diety as it just makes it dirtier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you like it!</li>
            <li> I did not like the way this made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have try other similar Dry Shampoo, but this leaves the hair like using some hold spray. I prefer other like the one from suave or even better batist dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it keeps my hair volumized  without having to blow it dry every day</li>
            <li> I heard so many good reviews on this and figured i would give it a try. I bought the travel size and the regular size. Man am i disappointed. This leaves a sticky, hard hair spray life residue on my hair. Makes my hair feel really stiff and un natural. Im cant believe i spent over $20 on these. I am going back to my sauve keratin infusion dry shampoo thats only $3. Works so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that i do like is the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain that the smell is strong, but i like it. Even my boyfriend commented that my hair smelt good.</li>
            <li> This one works the best!</li>
            <li> Not as fragrant as other dry shampoos, which is good. The scent isn&#x27;t my favorite. When applied, it does spray a little heavy, but once it dries, hair feel fresh and cleaned. Does not come out powdery. For the price, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> To start, I didn&#x27;t order mine from Amazon but I wish I had because I paid alot more at CVS. I have used a couple different brands of dry shampoo because my hair is just too long to wash and dry everyday. The smell is just okay but it doesn&#x27;t stick around too long so that&#x27;s not an issue. However, it makes my hair feel dry and sticky. It does add volume as advertised which is a plus. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again though.</li>
            <li> I have used Batiste and Garnier Fructise dry shampoos before trying this. ABOVE AND BEYOND. I have flat, fine, straight hair that gets super oily looking very quickly. This removed all hints of oil, gave my usually flat hair volume and lift, and (something I&#x27;ve never had before) gave it texture, too! Will leave a residue if sprayed for too long or too close to the scalp, but that is user error and easily avoidable. Seriously, you could spray this stuff Friday night and go camping all weekend without needing to shampoo or reapply the entire trip. Just use a brush or comb (fingertips were not enough for me but maybe people with thicker hair could try that). Such a great product. Will not waste my money on any other dry shampoo ever again. So impressed!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LIFE SAVER THE ABSOLUTE BEST DRY SHAMPOO I USE IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> The CAN DOESN&#x27;T SPRAY PROPERLY... what&#x27;s worse when you get hair product in a can than when the can doesn&#x27;t work properly and you can&#x27;t even use it.  Well, this happens here.  Happened to me after using the prodcut ONCE, ..which wasn&#x27;t all that great anyway.  Other brands are better.  Go for one of them.</li>
            <li> I like the hair spray of this brand. And I&#x27;ve tried alot of dry shampoos. So I wanted to try this one. As long as you follow the instructs and don&#x27;t put a lot on your hair .my hair was still manegable with out all the residue. I decently don&#x27;t like the price for as much as you get. And I have can only do this product once and then I have to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> The first two times I used it, it worked great. Then the nozzle plugged up and it only spits out a little bit of the product. Not worth the cost to have it not work after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I love this product but now for the second time it stopped working when still 1/4 - 1/3 full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works great, but for the amount of money, I wish I could use it all up. Instead I have to trash it.</li>
            <li> It adds alot of volume easily.  It smells really good.  It&#x27;s fast and easy.  It lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s an alternative I use when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it allowed me to go 1-2 days without washing my hair, which was helpful on days I had to run out the door or I was just being lazy. And I loved the volume it gave my hair. My personal preference downsides were the scent and the texture of my hair. I&#x27;m used to my hair being silky smooth and able to run my hands through it easily. I felt that though I had awesome volume, I was sacrificing softness because the texture was a little stiffer, almost as if I had lightly sprayed with hairspray. The scent is alright, I&#x27;m not a fan of artificial scents. I don&#x27;t do perfumes, body sprays, etc. and the scent, though light, still bugged me. It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible, actually it&#x27;s quite pleasant, but I&#x27;m just not my preference. I would buy more and keep as backup for lazy days.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why this product has received so many good reviews. It smells abominable (like chemicals on fire), and the smell does NOT go away. It smelled so bad I had a headache 10 minutes after applying it. Additionally, it left my hair feeling disgusting. I&#x27;ve used dry shampoos before, but I&#x27;ll never leave this one again! Ugh!</li>
            <li> This product was definetely not worth the price and it does not smell good. Its suppose to make my hair look less oily but I feel liek it did the opposite, it also made my hair feel hard and some days I cant even brush thru it, I definetely wouldn&#x27;t buy this product ever again, I only used it twice and ended up giving it to someone who uses this hair brand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long. Way over priced for the size!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A little more hair spray- esque than I was expecting.  But still great quality, great brand.  Smells kind of like a fruity car freshener though.</li>
            <li> Used as directed, it left my hair feeling dry and stiff, couldn&#x27;t get a comb or brush through my hair. I would never use it again, my bottle was a gift, glad I&#x27;m not out the $. I have had good success with Klorane but hate using any solvents, so I try to use homemade dry shampoo, google it most are part cornstarch, baking soda, oat powder mix in some real cocoa to darken it up a bit.</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily fast, and I don&#x27;t want to wash it every day since it is fine and damages easily.  So after trying several different dry shampoos I&#x27;ve got to say this will strip nasty odors and oil out of my hair with less product than any I&#x27;ve tried.  One warning - don&#x27;t use too much or too close or it will be grainy.  I spray a little at the roots in the front and sides of my medium length hair and let it sit while I do makeup and dress, and then brush it out.  It also makes my hair fluffier.  It gives me one or two days before the next shampoo.</li>
            <li> This left my hair still greasy looking.</li>
            <li> Besides the shipment taking a little while, this product is always great.  I love the brand and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Gives my hair a great texture with volume that lasts and I really like the smell. But I know people who don&#x27;t like the smell so if you are picky about smells then maybe smell it at a store before buying online.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t as expensive or was easier to find. Of all the dry shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried (around 7 different brands) I definitely like this one the best.</li>
            <li> It does work as dry shampoo and it provides a little volume to my fine thin hair. It would be five stars, but it dries out my hair so much making it really stiff in some spots.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, i think it smells good and it helps to volumize hair, not just soak up the grease. I usually spray it on, then flip my hair over my head, give it a shake and run my fingers through it. It works great, definitely my number one dry shampoo. I have tried many others, and they just don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I have used.  Adds some volume too</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo.  I tried 3 or 4 brands, and this is the only one I use now.</li>
            <li> What a great product! I have very thick hair and I find that a little bit goes a long way. It takes the dryness right our and adds tons of volume! I&#x27;ve tried numerous dry shampoos and this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;ve purchased it over and over again! Love this stuff! Great Price!</li>
            <li> First of all the smell is AMAZING! My boyfriend is constantly sniffing my hair when I use this. Also, this isn&#x27;t just to take oil and dirt out of your hair to minimize the number of washes. I use it often on freshly washed hair because it gives awesome volume for teasing or just a little boost to the roots. However, if you do want to use it strictly as a dry shampoo it works amazing. My hair looks fresh and it lasts the whole 12 hours of my work shift. It&#x27;s a staple in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other dry shampoos before this one (Tigi Rockaholic and a beauty store brand) and it&#x27;s my favorite so far.  Does not show up in my dark brown hair and offers a nice volumizing boost with no heavy sticky hairspray feeling.  Definitely makes it possible to stretch an extra day or two before a full shampoo, but I have found myself starting to use a little on clean hair as I like the extra volume so much.  I have just reordered plus a small 1 oz can for travel so I guess I am hooked.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast. This dry shampoo is the best on the market. I have limp hair so is my daughter and we have tried all kinds of stuff before. This one is easy to apply, does not leave residue and it smells nicely, and not too strong. I purchased several of those and continue to use only this product from now on. Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I have used most dry shampoos on the market (Oscar Blandi, Ojon, Batiste, Tigi Rockaholic and Bumble and Bumble) and this one is my least favorite of the bunch.  Yes, it got rid of the oil in my hair, but it made my hair almost feel brittle and stripped.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it added extra volume either like some of the others are capable of.  I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the product either.  For volume Bumble and Bumble gives the most height (and comes in a variety of colors, not white like all the others), for getting rid of oil, yet not stripping your hair Oscar Blandi (I like the spray vs the powder) and Ojon are the best in my opinion.  Batiste is the cheapest in price and does a decent job.  Tigi is ok, but seems too light weight to really do any thing.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, but it&#x27;s fine AND flat.  This stuff not only gets the oil out, but WOW does it add volume!  Like, WHOA volume!  It&#x27;s the type of hair you have the morning after your 8,000-bobby-pin-french-twist-up-do you wore as a bridesmaid in your friend&#x27;s wedding.  Yeah, THAT type of volume!  I had so much volume on the top of my head that I had a hard time getting the paddle brush through it like the directions said to do after you spray it and wait 2 minutes.  I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos before, but I am completely sold on this stuff. I hope they never stop making it. And on a side note, I actually like the smell (I know some did not).</li>
            <li> This is my first dry shampoo, it seems to leave a residue in my hair which I do not like. It does add a lot of volume, but it doesn&#x27;t really clean like the description says it will. The seller has it listed at a great price and shipped very quickly though</li>
            <li> Gives volume and texture while being a great dry shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t leave white residue.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. I have used other things in the Sexy Hair line and been very happy with the results. This was definitely a let down.     First off, when I received the can I was very shocked at just how small the can is. I read the description but didn&#x27;t register that it was such a small amount. It&#x27;s about the size of a travel-size can of hairspray. Not worth the $15 that I paid for it. I was expecting more for my money.     Second, this stuff STINKS when you use it. The aerosol smell does fade, but in the meantime it made me want to gag, especially since I have a small bathroom.     Third, for me the product never seemed to come out evenly. Maybe the can was just clogged, I don&#x27;t know, but I always got more in some spots and not enough in others.     Fourth, I do not like the way this made my hair feel. I have very fine hair, but a lot of it. This stuff made my hair feel dirtier that before I put it in. It&#x27;s almost that feeling of having too much hairspray in your hair and not washing it for a couple of days. And it also seemed to really weigh my hair down, but that could just be my hair type.    I have really long hair and I can&#x27;t really wash every day because it dries the end of my hair out. Dry shampoo is a novel concept and I&#x27;ll be trying it again in the future. I just have to say that it won&#x27;t be this brand.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium length, blonde hair. This product is like spraying hairspray onto my roots. While it does remove the oil, if I use this product the only thing I can do is pull my hair back into a ponytail since it is the texture of a helmet. I don&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried my share of dry shampoos. Though this one is pricy; I have oily hair and I can say not only does this do its job but it also restores the volume that I have lost over night.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, straight hair that is slightly on the oily side (I have to wash it every day).  I use this product not as a dry shampoo, but as a styling product to give my hair thickness and texture. After I wash and blow dry, I spray the Volumizing Dry Shampoo around the roots at my crown, give it a minute to dry, and then gently comb it through my hair... Instant body!!!  I also wash at night sometimes, let my hair air dry, and I am able to wake up the next day, spray around my roots, and I have thick hair and body. I&#x27;ve given up my thickening spray and mousse because this one product does the job of both. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried less expensive dry shampoos, but they left a white residue on my hair that made it appear as if I had powder in my hair.  The Big Sexy Dry Shampoo does not appear on my hair after I have sprayed it on. You definitely get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was paying $16 a can at my local grocery store and was so excited to see this for about 35% less money on Amazon. I&#x27;ll be getting it on this website from now on.</li>
            <li> This stuff really doesn&#x27;t work on my fine thin hair. I have to wash my hair everday or it will look greasy. This does not really fix that problem.</li>
            <li> smells so good!  Slightly tacky at times, have to brush it out really good</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel like I have a bunch of last night&#x27;s hairspray in it.  I have tried a few types of other dry shampoos and they do not do this.  I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> When I received the dry shampoo the bottle felt full and still does but when I try to spray it, nothing comes out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly new dry shampoo user and this was the second product I&#x27;ve tried. Just for reference, if I go out after work, I have to wash my hair before otherwise it is a complete oil slick. Most of the other reviewers are right when they say it changes the texture of your hair/scalp, but I&#x27;m completely fine with that if it will keep the oil at bay. The fragrance is similar to hairspray like one person mentioned, but not completely overwhelming like some of the cheap hairspray smell like. It did keep body in my hair but I&#x27;m not so sure it \\&quot;added\\&quot; any that would be there if the oil wasn&#x27;t there.  For the price it is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this prodcut. I dye my hair red and as we all know, red washes out very qickly so I try to avoid washing my hair a lot. This was the solution I had been waiting for. Sadly from the 3.4 oz can I only got a couple uses. So for the money, its not worth it. I can buy 3-4 bottles of shampoo for what this cost me. I would be more happy with it if the product/can wasn&#x27;t faulity. I too thought it was a little tacky feeling and made my hair feel dry. But it did in fact take away the oily shine. I too wosh they sold it on tinited shades. I don&#x27;t have long hair either so there is no real excuse for only a couple uses.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and I have tried many many different dry shampoos. This is the best, and the smell is just like a hair spray. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair white also (so you don&#x27;t need to brush through it). And after applying it, hair feels fresh and dry (not oily).</li>
            <li> Super delayed shipment.</li>
            <li> Works great. The only downside is that it smells like Bubbalicious watermelon gum from the &#x27;80s.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It is the best solution for the day in between washings! I cant live with out this now.  Will order more</li>
            <li> I was a little annoyed at how small this product was for the price, but then the first time I used this product it worked great!  The next time I tried to use this product it would not spray.  I tried everything to make it spray but it will not work.  I sometimes will leak out the sides but it will not spray.  There is still a lot left in the bottle but I cannot get it out so it is useless.  The price is tempting but for me it was not worth only one use.  I gave this 1 star because although I like the product when it works it is completely useless to me if it will not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of dry shampoos and this is by far my favorite product. Do I wish it was slightly more affordable? Sure! But for the price, you get massive volume, no white powdery mess (remember to shake the can between sprays people), no icky residue, a clean scent and a product that does what it says it will do. I&#x27;ve also shopped around, this is the best price I&#x27;ve found - and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the service. Hope this is helpful - I&#x27;m also available for questions if you have any. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This has t be the worst air product I have ever purchased!  It leaves a nasty residue on your hair and no volume at all!</li>
            <li> First of all: this is probably NOT well-suited to folks with soft, silky hair who want their second (and third...and fourth) day hair to feel soft and silky and \\&quot;just-washed.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER -- if you&#x27;re a fan of Oribe-style volume and don&#x27;t mind a bit of....stiffness to your strands, this is THE BEST dry shampoo out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds some lift, it adds a bit of waxiness, it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel like \\&quot;run your fingers through it\\&quot; hair -- BUT -- if you&#x27;re looking for sexy bedhead, for volume, for that sort of Italian Movie Star \\&quot;JBF\\&quot; hair, this does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is.....styling product standard. Smells better than hairspray, but definitely has a fragrance. It wears off a few moments after spraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll often mist this on my roots BEFORE bed, and when I wake up, it&#x27;s still as clean and fluffy as the night before (I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s almost a better tactic for this stuff -- before bed anticipation of saving time the following morning.....).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you don&#x27;t expect Oscar Blandi-softness, this stuff wins the dry shampoo game. I wash my hair every 4-5 days, and this is the product that gets my hair through the week. A little on the roots on day 2-3, a little more underneath the following day, then up in a messy bun on day 5 -- this gives enough hold to make my ponytails look thicker and stay in place more easily (bonus!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very similar: the Victoria&#x27;s Secret \\&quot;Sexy Hair\\&quot; dry shampoo -- also adds good lift and volume, imparts definite TEXTURE to the hair -- in the vein of Oribe.</li>
            <li> I truly can&#x27;t believe that this product has any reviews under 4 stars. I&#x27;ve tried countless dry shampoo products and this one is by FAR the only one I&#x27;ve really loved. We all know it is bad to wash your hair daily especially if you use a hair dryer. If I wash my hair in the morning I can show signs of oily hair as early as that evening so a product like this, that actually works, saves me time, energy and makes my hair more healthy by not having to wash it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other products and I&#x27;ve had multiple problems...way too powdery, runs out way too soon (I had one that ran out of the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; in a week after just a few uses), some smell bad, or they simply do not do what they should. This product works so well for my hair that I started using it after I wash and dry my hair, just a little on my bangs and the top of my roots. As a result, I have so much more volume (working better than hairspray which I barely ever use) looking like I used a hair dryer and a round brush when I didn&#x27;t.  And my hair takes double the time to show signs of oil. I really can&#x27;t say how much I love this product, I will never buy anything else. I&#x27;ve included a photo where I used the product after not washing my hair for a day.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. This product is my go-to.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and washing my hair has become an enormous task. Sometimes I&#x27;m too tired to wash my hair for a week or more. I cut my hair to a bob to make it more managable, but of course now it looks oilier more quickly. Before I started experimenting with dry shampoo, I would be so embarassed about my hair. I tried some \\&quot;refresher\\&quot; products and a couple of dry sprays, but the Big Sexy Hair turned out to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Big Sexy Hair dry spray because I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it and it only takes a few seconds to apply it. This was a problem with the other sprays I tried, that they needed more thorough applications that were, frankly, almost as tiring as washing my hair would have been. With the Big Sexy Hair, I just spray a few bursts at my roots and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also lasts for longer than the other products. Nearly all of them I felt that I needed to wash out or re-apply after a couple of days, but usually the Big Sexy Hair will be okay without re-application until I can work up to actually washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray does, as most of the other reviewers have mentioned, make my hair feel stiff afterwards, but my hair looks fine. I&#x27;ve discovered through experimentation that the less spray I use, the less stiff my hair is. It really is very absorbent and I was surprised at how little actual product was needed to get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the stiff hair is a deal-breaker then that might be a problem, but for people like me who need something that&#x27;s strong and long-lasting, I would certainly recommend it. It&#x27;s been a huge boost to my spirits to not have to have limp, oily hair anymore, even when I don&#x27;t have the energy to wash it for days on end.</li>
            <li> MY MOST FAVORITE DRY SHAMPOO,. BEST ONE I HAVE USED. does not leave that white residue&lt;br /&gt;i use it right out of the shower for volume.&lt;br /&gt;it is amazing</li>
            <li> My good friend is a licensed cosmetologist and has been doing my hair for years. She recommended this spray product to me after I had given up on my search for a reasonably priced and decent dry shampoos. I have medium length, thin hair (but a lot of it!). Using dry shampoo is a great way to extend the life of *most types and styles of hair. We are all different and results may vary but I have found this product to be one of the best dry shampoos that I have ever used and it is definitely mid-range priced to comparable dry shampoos. I have easily gotten 2-3 days worth of style out of my hair since using this product (without washing) although, day 2 and 3 are days where I usually pin my hair up ;) I love that this product takes the oil right out of my roots (and believe me, I get oily!) and adds dryness, volume, and a light fresh scent (I&#x27;ve been told that I smell amazing by numerous people after using this product!). Again, tastes in scent will vary but to me, this is one of the best smelling dry shampoos out there! I definitely suggest getting a sample sized bottle to try first if you are hesitant about the results just so that you can see how your hair reacts with this product. Personally, I&#x27;ve found that it is a life/timesaver!! My other go-to product from this company is the &amp;#34;Powder Play&amp;#34; which adds unbelievable volume (with additional backcombing) to your hair and also works as a dry shampoo in powder form.</li>
            <li> This is the best volumizing spray / texturizing spray I&#x27;ve tried!  Instant volume!  Stay away if you don&#x27;t like the feeling of product in your hair, because this is on the gritty-feeling side, but it seriously works wonders and makes day 2 and day 3 hair look volumized and clean.  Especially excellent for updo&#x27;s! Highly recommend. I have medium hair, cut at the collarbone and love wearing it with loose waves, and this works great to get some lift and oomph at the roots and add body to the style. Here&#x27;s a list of some other ones I tried that I didn&#x27;t love as much because this one blew them out of the water -- Amika Un-done Texture spray, Rusk texture spray, Garnier texture spray, Amika dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Ughhhh...the texture makes your hair feel so gross and caked. I regret buying this. It&#x27;s hard to brush out and leaves a residue on brunette hair.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair OK, can size is really small.</li>
            <li> The Product is pretty good is used in small portions.  The problem is the spray doesn&#x27;t work any longer and there&#x27;s a lot of product still in the bottle.  I could only use it twice.</li>
            <li> best dry shampoo ever, just a little bit is enough and it does the work of volume and gets rid of grease</li>
            <li> the product did not work! Product wound not come out of container. Would not purchase again.I was very disapointed with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It smells great and is great for individuals with dark hair like myself. It smells great too. I just wish it came in a bigger can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 8 different dry shampoos and I always go back to this one.  The smell sort of reminds me of what a grandma would smell like, however it works so great.  I have very soft Asian hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl and when I use this stuff, I have so much volume and the curls really last.  Before I found this stuff, I used to wash my hair every day, which my hairdressers advised me against.  Now, I can go 2 or 3 days and my hair looks better and better each day!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The best spray! It takes the oil away and adds volume. What more do you need?</li>
            <li> I have used many different dry shampoo&#x27;s and have always come out unhappy. Recently had my brothers wedding and with all the running around, I didn&#x27;t have time to completely wash my hair before getting my hair done on the wedding day. I have blonde hair that is kinda thin, so it get&#x27;s greesy FAST. Knowing that they could just wash my hair before getting it done, I didn&#x27;t even want to try this stuff at first, mostly because of all the let downs of previous products. I&#x27;m glad I did use this stuff tho! It&#x27;s worth the price, considering it&#x27;s about $20-$25 at the salon. It works great, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or with a massive hairspray smell. It lasted all day and worked like I thought it should. I bought it off of here since than, and works just as good as it did at the salon. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different dry shampoos to cut down on washing my hair. I always felt that other sprays either weighed it down or couldn&#x27;t keep it from getting greasy mid-day. I love this dry shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all - in fact, it&#x27;s a great volume boost for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> To get great results with this dry shampoo, treat it much like liquid shampoo: apply as little as humanly possible (say, 4 to 6 fraction-of-a-second spritzes) and then &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; to distribute evenly.  I wash my hair about twice a week, use this every non-wash day, and a can lasts a month and a half.  Doubles as an amazing root boost if oil isn&#x27;t your issue.</li>
            <li> The nozzle on the can won&#x27;t work anymore. Tried hot water and all the typical things, but it still won&#x27;t spray. I&#x27;m very upset because it really was a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used. I have tried many and they either feel like you have something greasy or powdery in your hair or do not do a good job of behaving like a shampoo. My only complaint is that by the end of the day sometimes my scalp itches. But for occasional use when you need it, it does a great job and definitely adds volume too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it.  I have oily hair and it helps me go a few days between washings.</li>
            <li> tad expensive for the same function as dove or suave</li>
            <li> Love the sexy brand as a general rule.  I do not like the smell of this product nor the longevity of it.  I did like that my hair didn&#x27;t loose it&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li> I USE WEN FOR MY SHAMPOO....I DON&#x27;T WASH MY HAIR EVERY DAY....I USE THIS ON THE THIRD DAY AND IT REALLY MAKES MY HAIR FULL....ON THE FOUTH DAY I WASH MY HAIR AND IT IS STILL REALLY FULL LOOKING!!</li>
            <li> In addition to prolonging the days between shampooing your hair, this product adds great volume! I felt it worked great, but did make my hair feel a little straw-like as others have mentioned. However, I do have to note that I loved the look it gave to my hair and I would oftentimes look forward to the day after shampooing because it actually made my blow out look better the 2nd and 3rd day!</li>
            <li> I find this dry shampoo to be the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  Yes, it does have a strong smell to it. Yes, it does feel like you have a lot of product in your hair when you touch your hair with your hands. But I think these are worth it because it works so well. My hair gets oily after one day and I have to shampoo it daily to avoid grease. My hair is also on the thinner side. With this product, one spray in the morning lasts me all day (nearly two days!!). Most dry shampoos require touch ups during the day - not this one!  one and done for me. And there is no tint to it, which is awesome for brunettes. I would really recommend this to everyone. Such a great product. (Also, I have not experienced a defective bottle yet).</li>
            <li> The 1/3 of this product that I actually got to use was great, but the sprayer clogged up and stopped working.  I tried running warm water over it to unclog it but that didn&#x27;t work.  I loved what I got to use of this product but I will not buy it again.  It was too expensive for it to stop working 1/3 of the way through.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again. It leaves hair feeling very sticky and not that helpful as far as making hair look cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is the worst dry shampoo I have ever used. It was more like spraying hairspray on my head. It made my hair stiff and feel chalky. I immediately put it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Great product. Too bad after using it twice, it was empty. I didn&#x27;t use an excessive amount either. Crazy expensive for two uses.</li>
            <li> This product is great!! Doesn&#x27;t make y hair feel weird or different but at the same time takes out all the grease! It is totally saving my hair from having to wash it all the time.</li>
            <li> REally amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Takes away the oil, adds volume, easy to style. A new essential.</li>
            <li> FINALLY! A dry shampoo that has enough hairspray-like hold in it to grip my hair and not leave it crazy static-y. I might as well just use baby powder, as well as all the others have worked, but this stuff is GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you want soft hair that moves, use as little as you can, and only where your hair is oily.. too much of this stuff and I can literally style my hair into a mohawk, and it&#x27;ll stay put!</li>
            <li> The first 2 times that I used this product I absolutely LOVED it, but after that the product wouldn&#x27;t spray out of the can. The hole is not clogged and there is still product in the can but it just won&#x27;t spray.</li>
            <li> I liked that is was a spray. It does take away the greasy look, but I don&#x27;t like the way it smells. I would recommend styling the hair first. It was really hard to use the flat iron and curling iron after using. It also makes the hair feel stiff. It was really difficult to comb after using it. I had to fix it with my fingers. The can is really small and I got less than 10 uses out of it. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works great for volume and the &#x27;shampoo&#x27; aspect. Doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue like the cheap brands do. BUT I can&#x27;t handle the texture it gives my hair. Even one little spray and it feels like I washed my hair in chalk. Not worth the money to me. I love the big sexy line of products so this was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> truly helps with volume and grease.  makes hair voluminous and gives an extra day or two w/out shampooing</li>
            <li> This definitely made my hair look not so greasy however, it made my head itch terribly. Almost unbearable. I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used! And I&#x27;ve tried many but none of them hold up like this one</li>
            <li> i love this dry shampoo. i use it on clean or dirty hair. you have to be careful if you are a burnette tho it does leave a little white in your hair. i just make sure to spray it under hair really well. but it gives me volume &amp; i love the texture feeling.</li>
            <li> In spite of all the advice from my hairdresser, I&#x27;ve never been able to go a day without a wash without greasy strings of flat hair next to my face.  That was never gonna happen except on occasional hole-up-at-home weekend days.  Then one day in my salon I saw this on the shelf, and thought \\&quot;what the heck, give it a try!\\&quot;  To my delight, it does the trick, and even adds volume that I normally never get with my fine, straight hair.  Nice to get a little lift around the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the textural feeling it leaves ... so as long as no one is running their fingers through my roots, it&#x27;s fine  lol  I do find the longer ends of my hair a bit straw and straggly, but if I use a good leave-in spray on moisturizer on the length of my hair (not the roots), then the ends are soft, and the roots are not greasy.  All in all, I like it.  I just ordered my second can and can now keep my hairdresser happy after she colors my hair and tells me not to wash it every day!</li>
            <li> love using this!  I can;t get away without having to wash my hair for a few days!</li>
            <li> This was my first time experimenting with dry shampoo . I have no complaints really. It makes my hair feel like straw and takes away the shine but I can&#x27;t imagine any other brand not doing that. It&#x27;s meant to take the oil out and that&#x27;s what it does</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product! My hair has a tenancy to become slightly greasy after a full day of work and this product helps prevent any shine around my roots. This product also doubles as a volumizer for my super silky straight hair. It&#x27;s very helpful when teasing my hair at the roots. Love this product!  Not a bad price either!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply too much or it might make your hair a little grey--just put on a few sprays and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Love it !  This works great. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> While the product certainly does it&#x27;s job of making my hair feel less oily and making it smell better, I can&#x27;t help but notice that it leaves an odd sort of crunchiness to it that I cannot brush out. I know when using a dry shampoo one cannot expect one&#x27;s hair to fee; legitimately clean, but it is an odd feature I have yet to experience with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though I would recommend it over most other waterless shampoos.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this product was a bust. I bought it hoping to find something that lasted all day and didn&#x27;t wear off after a couple hours like baby powder. It did work all day, but after 3 uses, my hair was BREAKING OFF when I brushed it through my hair. Will not be using again.</li>
            <li> I Received a defective bottle. It doesn&#x27;t spray! I want a free replacement sent to me. Please contact me about this.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling completely disgusting.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Fluffs droopy hair up and looks just washed.</li>
            <li> Is anyone out there ?  It doesn&#x27;t seem like the manufacturer of this product pays any attention to its negative reviews.  I actually really enjoy using this product:  Although it&#x27;s not your typical dry shampoo, it does soak up the oils in your hair, volumize and hold very effectively.  The problem is with the spray bottle design.  I&#x27;ve purchased at least 7 bottles of this product and each and every single time the spray mechanism has clogged up and ceased spraying anything but dry air a little over halfway through.  I&#x27;ve even tried holding it under warm-hot water to try and melt/release whatever blockage there is but nothing seems to work and it&#x27;s frustrating having a half-emty bottle of product you can&#x27;t use (but you don&#x27;t throw it away because you&#x27;re hopeful you can figure out a way to fix it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why this hasn&#x27;t been fixed yet, and I have even less of an idea why I keep coming back.  I guess it&#x27;s time to find a new product-- all suggestions are welcome!</li>
            <li> Although I love this product and have been using it for some time, I am horribly disappointed!! I ordered two and the spray nozzle on both do no spray. I was going to ship them back but unfortunately it says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.

            <li> Great product. I do spray this lightly to freshen.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! it makes my hair full and so pretty, even second day hair! and it is very easy to use! it does not weigh my hair down, or make it greasy/oily looking, or messy... I really like this, and have been using it often, and I will always make sure to have at least an extra bottle for when I run out, I cant find it at the salon or in stores here, so I will have to be ordering it on here, and make sure I always have it! it is great to use to give your hair a change in style, if you are going out for the evening and don&#x27;t have time or want to wash your hair, or just to give your hair a pick me up for the evening, or even midday if you need it! also for second day hair, if you are in a rush, or for whatever (many) other reasons that you need to use it, it works wonders! I recommend it to everybody, even guys could use this if they wanted to...</li>
            <li> I use this often and have found it is cheaper to purchase on Amazon rather than at Target (where I used to buy). It definitely makes your hair look clean...just be careful about spraying it too closely else it can make your hair gray (if you have dark hair like me). I have found it works best if I spray it in, brush, and then blow dry for 10 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> Handles the grease without adding more shine. Instead of going 2 days without washing I can go 3 maybe 4 if I push it.</li>
            <li> it leaded, I used it once, and laid it on its side..  all of the product leaded out.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the price. It leaves a horrible residue on the hair. I didn&#x27;t even want to touch my hair because it felt so gross. It also smells awful. There are many better dry shampoos so I suggest you bypass this one!</li>
            <li> Expensive for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> I still like other dry hairsprays/shampoos but cannot afford $40 per can when I go through about a can a month....My hair is very fine and does not hold and looks very flat unless I don&#x27;t wash it for a few days or use something to make it \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;...this gets the job done....better if you hold the can farther away...if you hold it too close, it will look like you have powder in your hair.</li>
            <li> Love the hairspray, but DISLIKE the dry shampoo!! Weighed down my hair, and made it look dirtier than it was to begin with! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product, when your hair is thin and limp it helps to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and it leaves a white residue. It does smell good though! I would not purchase this again</li>
