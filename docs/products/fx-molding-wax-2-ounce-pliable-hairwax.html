            <li>This is a great product and a very good price.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>I use it for rockabilly styles and it makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair wax, I have curly hair, a lot of frizz</li>
            <li>great for holding up hair</li>
            <li>Works great as a mustache wax.</li>
            <li>It does have a lightweight feel but what good is that if it won&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li>It is by far the best product of its kind on the market, and the price is very fair...</li>
            <li>So, I was very glad to find it on Amazon.com and get prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time &amp; very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I have used for years, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores, anymore.  </li>
            <li>I am a minimalist who wants her mane to be perfect, but also wash and wear.</li>
            <li>This wax provides a nice, controlled but semi-natural looking clump effect with a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t do without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>this by far is the best in this price range.</li>
            <li>Good product with nice mild scent</li>
            <li>Generally it works best when applied semi-dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We usually buy it in store for around $4.50, but like many have said this is a great product that outshines even the best salon brands that can cost as much more than $20 even $30.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I&#x27;ve found it here :)</li>
            <li>This stuff works just as well as products that cost 10 times more.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used this stuff for years and have never been able to find a worthwhile substitution.</li>
            <li>and then I run my hands through my hair on top till the height of my neck</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many products and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not terribly vain</li>
            <li>Ok - I love this stuff</li>
            <li>While it says its good for messy and refined styles, I&#x27;ve found that it works best for me</li>
            <li>About to order more.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and in a world where hair care products are ridiculously over priced, this is a great option.</li>
            <li>Washes out considerably easily too.</li>
            <li>Its light and adds volume.</li>
            <li>so we make a habit of checking  before we buy to make sure it&#x27;s the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell, spreads easily in your fingers to put in your hair, and leaves your hair soft when it wears off.</li>
            <li>It also works out amazingly - just rub your hands through your hair, and it&#x27;ll retain a bit of shape AND be soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>(if you&#x27;re getting white flakes from it, you don&#x27;t know how to put in wax - you need to rub it in your palm for maybe 30 seconds to a minute before applying, and I&#x27;m sure there are videos out there that can show you better than I can describe).</li>
            <li>Recommended to anyone Received order fairly quick.</li>
            <li>This is a worthy substitute.</li>
            <li>I keep a short, masculine haircut, and I like to be able to spike it up and also be able to wear it more conservatively.</li>
            <li>If you have fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>Works very well with fine hair -</li>
            <li>This is a great product for making your style stay without making it heavy.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was also surprised that while using this product I could restyle most of the time without have to add any additional product.  </li>
            <li>I will say it doesn&#x27;t have the awesome smell and texture that the other expensive waxes do, but it&#x27;s VERY much a great value.  </li>
            <li>My friend has thrown out J Crew and many other top brands in favor of this.</li>
            <li>I love it, but it&#x27;s becoming harder to find.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair full and clean, and it holds the style I started with while being soft and casual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wax is too hard, but works better after I warm it up a bit.  </li>
            <li>texture is soft and easy to work into the hair.  </li>
            <li>FX wax also tends to last longer than the salon brands making it an even better deal.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair product out there for a man who wants a messy look with short hair that doesn&#x27;t get crusty or look shiny or seem like cement.  </li>
            <li>As for the scent, I find it to be pleasant enough (a bit sweet/fruity), but I only smell the product on my hands.</li>
            <li>and it just doesn&#x27;t really set right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it and was impressed that it held your hair extremely well without being stiff</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find this product in the drugstores, but searched high and low</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much, and it has a subtle pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m finally like the kids with cool hair!  </li>
            <li>It works on wet, dry, or damp, depending on what kind of style you&#x27;re going for, and easily reactivates or restyles by adding a bit of water.</li>
            <li>The wax also has a pleasant, slightly fruity smell, but not overwhelming in the slightest - in fact, it&#x27;s barely there unless you&#x27;re straight up smelling the tub, but it&#x27;s a pleasant surprise to find that it doesn&#x27;t smell like glue or a salon.</li>
            <li>Reallly strong hold for short hair.</li>
            <li>, I combed my hair with a comb with large tooths, and then I run a hair brush</li>
            <li>I also find that I have the most success when I work it in with as little fuss as possible, as it leaves a more natural look.</li>
            <li>Considering this, I would have expected to pay a lot more than I did.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really hold my son&#x27;s hair in place though.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Until I discovered FX products, I was paying 3 to 4 times as much for salon products, and I often used the Bumble and Bumble wax.  </li>
            <li>Too much fuss and</li>
            <li>the whole thing falls apart.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is very noticeable unless someone comes in very closely (hug, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve bought an defective product where the wax has hardened too much</li>
            <li>one bottle lasts over a year but depends i guess on how much you use.  </li>
            <li>It all very well may  depend on the type of hair you have and</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for selling</li>
            <li>Really like how this helps to style my hair.</li>
            <li>Performs as well as products that cost two or three times as much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for people who like to sport mohawks or fauxhawks!</li>
            <li>Overall, it offers an ok hold.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this wax holds up shape reasonably good.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s only with excessive rubbing, and doesn&#x27;t flake with more normal touching of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has really great hold without making your hair feel gross or stiff; it still feels like hair!</li>
            <li>It has a very faint, clean scent, and great hold.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry for 2 reasons: first, it takes time, and, second, I am a klutz who can&#x27;t manage a dryer no matter how many times my stylist shows me.  </li>
            <li>Very good wax that is not too dry nor leaves behind too much residue.</li>
            <li>Having used TiGi, Bumble &amp; Bumble, and loving them, it was hard to try a cheaper version.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but for the price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>this product is great for random hairs to wax down or in general to cover a gelled head to make sure there are no outliers.  </li>
            <li>but we haven&#x27;t had a problem so far!</li>
            <li>This stuff is actually wax unlike most other products that use the name for marketing terms.</li>
            <li>I usually buy 6-7 at a time for fear I won&#x27;t be able to find them anywhere.</li>
            <li>, my hair looks very dry and with super frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a green-colored wax that goes on clear</li>
            <li>but when I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores anymore I was a bit pissed because this product works really well for my hair ( short and unruly).</li>
            <li>While this is not an area closely tracked by many--if any--economists, I can tell you that costs are up more than 100% over the last few years.  </li>
            <li>My short fine hair has always had other ideas, and, whatever I did, it would flatten in no time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to have to find a new hair product that&#x27;s at the same price.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of super stiff gel-like hair.  </li>
            <li>Took a gamble on this small obscure looking green colored wax and boy was I pleased!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat flexible, but still generally holds well.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, and I carry a small container with me in my purse for midday touchups.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never worn my hair longer, and definitely never very long, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if people with longer hair could find uses for it - and for the price, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li>I have fine, flyaway hair, so utilize the product by rubbing a little bit between my palms and then lifting under my hair for body and smoothing down the ends.  </li>
            <li>(so frizzie hair goes down and get straight).</li>

            <li> My short fine hair has always had other ideas, and, whatever I did, it would flatten in no time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to have to find a new hair product that&#x27;s at the same price.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of super stiff gel-like hair.  </li>
            <li> Took a gamble on this small obscure looking green colored wax and boy was I pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat flexible, but still generally holds well.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, and I carry a small container with me in my purse for midday touchups.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn my hair longer, and definitely never very long, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if people with longer hair could find uses for it - and for the price, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> I have fine, flyaway hair, so utilize the product by rubbing a little bit between my palms and then lifting under my hair for body and smoothing down the ends.  </li>
            <li> (so frizzie hair goes down and get straight).</li>
            <li> Works, however if you apply to wet hair it will dry and leave white residue that looks terribly similar to dandruff.</li>
            <li> as long as amazon keeps this stocked</li>
            <li> I spent so long dealing with stuff that wore out, stank, only worked for one type of style, felt sticky</li>
            <li> As I can imagine is the case with any hair wax/gel/spray, if you rub your hair too much after it has dried it will begin to flake a little bit--</li>
            <li> , so, so dry that silicon dont work anymore.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too dry, it&#x27;s harder to control, as my hair defaults to its stubborn directions.</li>
            <li> The product also flakes, and I can see a bunch of white specs after manipulating my hair a little bit.</li>
            <li> The shine is very low, but to polish it up a little you can add a touch of water based pomade.  </li>
            <li> But I still want it all: a full head of hair I can tousle or make neat, hair that never feels full of product or dirty, a product that&#x27;s idiot proof, and something reasonably</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s really not a problem, but it seems like a lot of the stores that used to stock it are no longer doing so.</li>
            <li> Too wet</li>
            <li> This product can make the hair look shiny (after the hair is no longer wet) and reduce the frizz during the day and the use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I updated my review, because now I realize taking your hair with a band while is still wet, it can damage the hair and affect the scalp, so I take that part off.</li>
            <li> and it came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It can be a little hard if you use it on wet hair, but as soon as it dries, you can work it with your hands to make it feel normal again without messing up the style.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and works well with stiff or coarse hair to style in place.</li>
            <li> Had hard time styling my hair, it is not soft on your hands and obviously not on your hair when applying.  </li>
            <li> , where other products do not leave that feeling.</li>
            <li> So what I do is: after washing my hair and getting it dry with a towel, I take little amounts with my fingers and rub this product between my two hands</li>
            <li> helps keep it down and make it look thicker.  </li>
            <li> Over all, I like how this product makes my hair looks, but the hold is not very strong.</li>
            <li> I feel like I paid through the nose (it cost me half as much or less in the store)</li>
            <li> the mess it up.  </li>
            <li> Having hated using styling products for many years I was introduced to this product by a friend who won&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I hated about styling products was the residue it leaves in your hair and was surprised that his left very little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There have been a few times when buying it in store</li>
            <li> 2 ounces ends up being a lot since it takes very little to style your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recommendation is to start with a small amount and rub it between your hands, then tousle your hair from roots to tips.  </li>
            <li> I also used it in the past for a shaggier, wavy hair look.</li>
            <li> I usually buy 3-4 of these things at a time just to keep them on hand for when I run out.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels a bit hard though</li>
            <li> Just a bit allows me to \\&quot;style\\&quot; the front a bit without being greasy and rock hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, but for someone who uses this stuff on a daily basis, it&#x27;s tough to buy the expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased, should have listened to the negative reviews, Used once</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick and curls as it gets longer.</li>
            <li> mine is thick.</li>
            <li> Keeps my thick frizzy hair where I want it.</li>
            <li> speaking to customer service was annoying because i constantly repeated myself.</li>
            <li> and it is very dry :(</li>
            <li> this is what I thought Crew would be like for all the hype around it, and Crew is not only twice as expensive but nasty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and unfortunately can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> too bad i&#x27;m not a kid anymore.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my ugly mug look like a freaking rock star.</li>
            <li> so sO SO ANGRY!!</li>
            <li> which is something I hated about styling products  </li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s a lot of disgusting products out there!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product for making your style stay without making it heavy. I love it, but it&#x27;s becoming harder to find. Thankfully I&#x27;ve found it here :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have used for years, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores, anymore.  Considering this, I would have expected to pay a lot more than I did.</li>
            <li> This was just o.k. It doesn&#x27;t really hold my son&#x27;s hair in place though.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am a minimalist who wants her mane to be perfect, but also wash and wear. My short fine hair has always had other ideas, and, whatever I did, it would flatten in no time. I don&#x27;t blow dry for 2 reasons: first, it takes time, and, second, I am a klutz who can&#x27;t manage a dryer no matter how many times my stylist shows me.  But I still want it all: a full head of hair I can tousle or make neat, hair that never feels full of product or dirty, a product that&#x27;s idiot proof, and something reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I discovered FX products, I was paying 3 to 4 times as much for salon products, and I often used the Bumble and Bumble wax.  Never again. FXMolding Wax is the best product at any price.  It leaves my hair full and clean, and it holds the style I started with while being soft and casual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to start with a small amount and rub it between your hands, then tousle your hair from roots to tips.  I even comb or use a Denman Brush to shape my hair.  It dries quickly, and I carry a small container with me in my purse for midday touchups.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this for years, but Walgreens seems to have stopped stocking their requisite four containers per ordering cycle. I keep a short, masculine haircut, and I like to be able to spike it up and also be able to wear it more conservatively. I spent so long dealing with stuff that wore out, stank, only worked for one type of style, felt sticky - there&#x27;s a lot of disgusting products out there! This is a green-colored wax that goes on clear (if you&#x27;re getting white flakes from it, you don&#x27;t know how to put in wax - you need to rub it in your palm for maybe 30 seconds to a minute before applying, and I&#x27;m sure there are videos out there that can show you better than I can describe). It works on wet, dry, or damp, depending on what kind of style you&#x27;re going for, and easily reactivates or restyles by adding a bit of water. It also works out amazingly - just rub your hands through your hair, and it&#x27;ll retain a bit of shape AND be soft to the touch. You don&#x27;t even have to wash it off at the end of the day (or night) - this is what I thought Crew would be like for all the hype around it, and Crew is not only twice as expensive but nasty! The wax also has a pleasant, slightly fruity smell, but not overwhelming in the slightest - in fact, it&#x27;s barely there unless you&#x27;re straight up smelling the tub, but it&#x27;s a pleasant surprise to find that it doesn&#x27;t smell like glue or a salon. I&#x27;ve never worn my hair longer, and definitely never very long, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if people with longer hair could find uses for it - and for the price, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> Have you seen what&#x27;s happened to the prices of hair goop?  While this is not an area closely tracked by many--if any--economists, I can tell you that costs are up more than 100% over the last few years.  If you have fine, straight hair this stuff is great.  And it&#x27;s just a couple of bucks.  This stuff works just as well as products that cost 10 times more.</li>
            <li> Over all, I like how this product makes my hair looks, but the hold is not very strong. The product also flakes, and I can see a bunch of white specs after manipulating my hair a little bit.</li>
            <li> i never received the product and getting my money back took a while. speaking to customer service was annoying because i constantly repeated myself.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to replace my hair wax that just ran out (have been using L&#x27;Oreal Indestructible Sculpting Wax but can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere). Took a gamble on this small obscure looking green colored wax and boy was I pleased! Holds ur hair in place and gives you the peicey/ faux hawk look. Hair feels a bit hard though but that&#x27;s ok. Washes out considerably easily too.</li>
            <li> This is the best pomade I&#x27;ve used...I use it for rockabilly styles and it makes my hair look great. &#x3D;) The smell isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this stuff for years and have never been able to find a worthwhile substitution. and that&#x27;s really not a problem, but it seems like a lot of the stores that used to stock it are no longer doing so. as long as amazon keeps this stocked i&#x27;ll have no complaints. this stuff is the bomb dot com.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years, and I find it works very well for my style (a messy, semi-spiked-up look). I also used it in the past for a shaggier, wavy hair look. My hair is fairly thick and curls as it gets longer. This wax provides a nice, controlled but semi-natural looking clump effect with a matte finish. It&#x27;s somewhat flexible, but still generally holds well. No crunchiness here! Generally it works best when applied semi-dry. If it&#x27;s too dry, it&#x27;s harder to control, as my hair defaults to its stubborn directions. Too wet and it just doesn&#x27;t really set right. I also find that I have the most success when I work it in with as little fuss as possible, as it leaves a more natural look. Too much fuss and the whole thing falls apart. So, it&#x27;s partly an element of luck, but I have come to accept that. As for the scent, I find it to be pleasant enough (a bit sweet/fruity), but I only smell the product on my hands. I don&#x27;t think it is very noticeable unless someone comes in very closely (hug, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I don&#x27;t actually buy this stuff on here - I get it from my grocery store, but they stopped stocking it. I stocked up last time I bought it, and it looks like they changed the packaging in the meantime. Still, it&#x27;s the same product from the same company and the same size. I may be ordering it here in the future if I can&#x27;t find it anywhere local.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair wax, I have curly hair, a lot of frizz and it is very dry :( , so, so dry that silicon dont work anymore. So what I do is: after washing my hair and getting it dry with a towel, I take little amounts with my fingers and rub this product between my two hands and then I run my hands through my hair on top till the height of my neck, I combed my hair with a comb with large tooths, and then I run a hair brush (so frizzie hair goes down and get straight). This product can make the hair look shiny (after the hair is no longer wet) and reduce the frizz during the day and the use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With out this wax, my hair looks very dry and with super frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2014/11/04: I updated my review, because now I realize taking your hair with a band while is still wet, it can damage the hair and affect the scalp, so I take that part off.</li>
            <li> Having hated using styling products for many years I was introduced to this product by a friend who won&#x27;t use any other brand. I&#x27;ve tried it and was impressed that it held your hair extremely well without being stiff which is something I hated about styling products  The only other thing I hated about styling products was the residue it leaves in your hair and was surprised that his left very little. As I can imagine is the case with any hair wax/gel/spray, if you rub your hair too much after it has dried it will begin to flake a little bit-- but that&#x27;s only with excessive rubbing, and doesn&#x27;t flake with more normal touching of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We usually buy it in store for around $4.50, but like many have said this is a great product that outshines even the best salon brands that can cost as much more than $20 even $30. My friend has thrown out J Crew and many other top brands in favor of this. FX wax also tends to last longer than the salon brands making it an even better deal. 2 ounces ends up being a lot since it takes very little to style your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been a few times when buying it in store we&#x27;ve bought an defective product where the wax has hardened too much so we make a habit of checking  before we buy to make sure it&#x27;s the right consistency. Buying online we were concerned we might get a defective product but we haven&#x27;t had a problem so far!</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find this product in the drugstores, but searched high and low and it is no longer to be found.  So, I was very glad to find it on Amazon.com and get prompt delivery.  I have fine, flyaway hair, so utilize the product by rubbing a little bit between my palms and then lifting under my hair for body and smoothing down the ends.  Great!</li>
            <li> Reallly strong hold for short hair. It does give some shine, but you can always use the blow dryer</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually wax unlike most other products that use the name for marketing terms. Its light and adds volume. Would recommend. Dont let the brand fool you.</li>
            <li> great for holding up hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and in a world where hair care products are ridiculously over priced, this is a great option. I usually buy 6-7 at a time for fear I won&#x27;t be able to find them anywhere.</li>
            <li> Good product with nice mild scent</li>
            <li> this product is great for random hairs to wax down or in general to cover a gelled head to make sure there are no outliers.  one bottle lasts over a year but depends i guess on how much you use.  would buy again</li>
            <li> If you like to style your hair, this is the way to go. The wax does what it tells you to do. I&#x27;ve gone through many products and this by far is the best in this price range. It all very well may  depend on the type of hair you have and mine is thick. So this product may not yield the same results, don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve been using it for years however, Wal Mart stopped carrying it in my area, so I had to resort to ordering it online and it came sooner than expected. Only issue is that it does make your hands feel sticky if you run them through your hair in frustration, as in my case on occassion because im so sO SO ANGRY!!, where other products do not leave that feeling.</li>
            <li> Had hard time styling my hair, it is not soft on your hands and obviously not on your hair when applying.  Threw it away after 2nd usage...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not terribly vain but when I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores anymore I was a bit pissed because this product works really well for my hair ( short and unruly). Just a bit allows me to \\&quot;style\\&quot; the front a bit without being greasy and rock hard. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but for the price it&#x27;s worth a try. Thanks amazon for selling this - u guys officially have everything!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my ugly mug look like a freaking rock star. It molds. And it&#x27;s pliable. &#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li> Ok - I love this stuff and I cannot find it anywhere but Amazon.  I feel like I paid through the nose (it cost me half as much or less in the store) but it was worth it.  This is the best hair product out there for a man who wants a messy look with short hair that doesn&#x27;t get crusty or look shiny or seem like cement.  I like my hair to be flexible.</li>
            <li> Really like how this helps to style my hair.</li>
            <li> Do not like this at all. I read the reviews before I purchased, should have listened to the negative reviews, Used once and if t were not such a hassle I would send it back. I will stick to what I was using. This just not have the hold at all. It does have a lightweight feel but what good is that if it won&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;Do Not Recommend.</li>
            <li> In my never-ending collection of inexpensive hair products (all waxes, pastes, and pomades), I have found this to be one of my favorites. While it says its good for messy and refined styles, I&#x27;ve found that it works best for me the mess it up.  It has a very faint, clean scent, and great hold.  The shine is very low, but to polish it up a little you can add a touch of water based pomade.  I was also surprised that while using this product I could restyle most of the time without have to add any additional product.  This is a great product and a very good price.  Performs as well as products that cost two or three times as much.</li>
            <li> Wax is too hard, but works better after I warm it up a bit.  Overall, it offers an ok hold.</li>
            <li> Good product! Keeps hair style throughout the day. Awesome for any day use. Recommended to anyone Received order fairly quick.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and unfortunately can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Amazon saves the day again!&lt;br /&gt;Product came as advertised with no problems.</li>
            <li> I used a hair wax product called &amp;#34;phat hair&amp;#34; for years, but it looks like they no longer make it. This is a worthy substitute. Has a nice smell, spreads easily in your fingers to put in your hair, and leaves your hair soft when it wears off. Keeps my thick frizzy hair where I want it. The low price is just icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> Works, however if you apply to wet hair it will dry and leave white residue that looks terribly similar to dandruff.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m finally like the kids with cool hair!  too bad i&#x27;m not a kid anymore.</li>
            <li> Only hair product I&#x27;ve used for years.  Perfect.  Puts hair where you want it without it looking like you put anything in it.  Works very well with fine hair - helps keep it down and make it look thicker.  About to order more.  - Chris</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It has really great hold without making your hair feel gross or stiff; it still feels like hair! It can be a little hard if you use it on wet hair, but as soon as it dries, you can work it with your hands to make it feel normal again without messing up the style. You don&#x27;t have to use very much, and it has a subtle pleasant fragrance. Highly recommended for people who like to sport mohawks or fauxhawks!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t do without this stuff.  I am not a fan of super stiff gel-like hair.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, but for someone who uses this stuff on a daily basis, it&#x27;s tough to buy the expensive stuff.  Having used TiGi, Bumble &amp; Bumble, and loving them, it was hard to try a cheaper version.  I will say it doesn&#x27;t have the awesome smell and texture that the other expensive waxes do, but it&#x27;s VERY much a great value.  I usually buy 3-4 of these things at a time just to keep them on hand for when I run out.  I always fear that it&#x27;s going to be discontinued and I&#x27;m going to have to find a new hair product that&#x27;s at the same price.  This is a must have for me.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is soft and easy to work into the hair.  A little goes a long way and works well with stiff or coarse hair to style in place.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this wax holds up shape reasonably good.</li>
            <li> Works great as a mustache wax.</li>
            <li> Very good wax that is not too dry nor leaves behind too much residue. Use after a shower or after wetting hair</li>
            <li> FX molding wax is the bomb! It is by far the best product of its kind on the market, and the price is very fair... Try it an you will be hooked!</li>
