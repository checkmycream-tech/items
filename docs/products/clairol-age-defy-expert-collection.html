            <li>Hair was soft, good conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is thicker than Clairol Nice &amp; Easy, but not terribly thick.  </li>
            <li>did the initial coloring on Tuesday evening, and used the very nice conditioner provided.</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite!</li>
            <li>It felt super creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product left my hair looking very shinny and the color was just beautiful.  </li>
            <li>a BzzAgent, which means I get to try out cool products  </li>
            <li>If they had thrown in some highlights or different tones, the way I get with Nice &amp; Easy, then yes, it would be radiant, youthful color.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Garnier Nutriesse for many years, but decided to try Clairol&#x27;s new product as a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>It may seem like a minor thing, but sturdy, comfortable gloves are very important to me.  </li>
            <li>Full color coverage, super shiny, and super soft.  </li>
            <li>Full color coverage, super shiny, and super soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than my Nice &amp; Easy and the color range is woefully inadequate, so</li>
            <li>Good looking color and lasts much longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My mom has hard to color gray hair, so she got this Age Defy, and she is happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This however doesn&#x27;t last more than 4 weeks, it starts to fade out sooner than it should</li>
            <li>This one was the first one I have received, and I cannot wait to try something else.  </li>
            <li>washed my hands per the directions since they were feeling pretty slicky and put on the gloves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Applied to my hairline/roots first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty.  </li>
            <li>No, I still have some grays showing along the side of my hairline, which is an area I covered first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve colored my hair at home using different kits many times before, for years, and have never had a result like this.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>is put on first, then the dye, then rise and condition.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>I have noticed over the years that many of the companies have replaced sturdy gloves with low quality ones.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and my curls are so manageable and smooth</li>
            <li>- I promised I would come back :)  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and my curls are so manageable and smooth</li>
            <li>- I promised I would come back :)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, not as shiny as my hair usually is after I color with Nice &amp; Easy, but my hair is unbelievably soft.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem with drips at all &amp; since the color was yellow, it was easy to see where I was applying on my brown hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels super soft and smooth, not dry one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about trying a new product when I have been satisfied with my current product, but I am so glad I tried this!  </li>
            <li>really liked the applicator bottle, it felt a little more comfortable than the one I usually use.  </li>
            <li>After drying my hair, I noticed that the grays were somewhat still noticeable, but it actually looked like highlights as opposed to grays, so I was fine with it.</li>
            <li>I am very upset.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend you try this out!</li>
            <li>So this time I decided why not go whole</li>
            <li>would highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you a whole tube of it,</li>
            <li>It makes your hair really shiny, and I also like the serum that you use to help the gray absorbs the color much faster.</li>
            <li>I was nervous at first because it was yellowish most of the time, but did eventually turn dark.  </li>
            <li>of dye is not exceptionally strong, and (very generous amount) of conditioner to be used afterward has an amazing fruity smell</li>
            <li>I have used so many other hair colors over the years, and they have never colored all the gray.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had frizz for most of my life due to wavy hair and</li>
            <li>Shiny soft and grey free still after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>I used the Medium Auburn on my dark brown hair and the result was a beautiful dark auburn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, fast forward to Thursday morning, less than two full days later, and the grays are once again as prominent as they were before I colored on Tuesday.</li>
            <li>Within 4 weeks of putting it on most of my gray hairs I have scattered around my dark hair are showing through.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Color true to what the package showed (this is just on me, though--please see above</li>
            <li>The color is still vibrant, and I think I have found a new product!  </li>
            <li>The color is still vibrant, and I think I have found a new product!  </li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t coarse to begin with, but it is so soft and smooth that I&#x27;d have to say that this product would take care of coarseness for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frizz?  </li>
            <li>I would not consider this product adequate at covering grays, and will not purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li>I left the color on for the full 25 minutes, since I was changing shades, and this was a brand new shade of color to me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% flat, but it sure could use some different colors in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Snapped off the little tab at the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>This product is really amazing because those hard to cover grays on the sides of your head will be colored now.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it does bleed (no matter how much you rinse it) until it dries for the first time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very, very goopy, messy liquid consistency--much more so than any other hair dye I&#x27;ve purchased in the recent past (including Feria and John Freida &amp; Clairol Nice n Easy Foam).</li>
            <li>My hair was softer and less frizzy and I&#x27;m happy to say they gray hair is still missing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very high-quality product with more steps designed to protect hair from damage than other dyes (including a clear &amp;#34;smoothing hair protectant&amp;#34; gel--similar in consistency to clear hair gel (but</li>
            <li>strong, lasting, consistent color that seems to work extremely well in covering grays</li>
            <li>Clairol Expert Collection Pantene AgeDefy is a new hair color that states the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fight</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells, and this did not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the shade that I used (for me) which was Dark Brown, as I like to have more red in my hair, so I will go with Medium Auburn in a few weeks when it is time to color again.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the shade that I used (for me) which was Dark Brown, as I like to have more red in my hair, so I will go with Medium Auburn in a few weeks when it is time to color again.  </li>
            <li>It is supposed to cover gray hair, of which I have a more a small amount on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed out this color, it was significantly less than normal, which I was excited to see.</li>
            <li>If you have coarse white hairs, you will have to leave this on for the full 45 min as suggested.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first color since going to a professional, that my grays are totally gone.</li>
            <li>I rinsed and rinsed until the water was completely clear.</li>
            <li>It covered my sporadic grays really well and the overall color looks really natural.  </li>
            <li>It covers my old lady gray hair.  </li>
            <li>The consistency and quality of this color completely makes up for that.</li>
            <li>From the very beginning it was different.  </li>
            <li>big debate - roots or whole head application?  </li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and combed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li>in all, I gave this product 4 stars for the softness, shine &amp; the fact that the color hasn&#x27;t faded one bit so far.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair so soft and</li>
            <li>and I told her Clairol does the job, it covers up the grays that show up, not to much but enough.</li>
            <li>it also makes the hair look shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found something I really like.</li>
            <li>and this is a true dark brown.  </li>
            <li>Again, the gloves being more durable and thick, let my color soaked gloves hold on to the bottle, and it did not slip.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Hair feels soft and smooth all over afterward, not damaged and dry like some other hair dyes</li>
            <li>This was especially problematic because I was using a dark color, which got all over my floor and facial skin/shoulders, and which I couldn&#x27;t get off easily.</li>
            <li>They gave you a whole tube of it, and you are to use a dollop (the size of a quarter) once a week, and it will last you up until your next color.  </li>
            <li>LAST OVER A MONTH SO FAR</li>
            <li>They are thick, roomy, and easy to get on and off (I remove mine after coloring, and put them back on before rinsing.)&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t judge that, but I can say that my color is still incredibly dark and shiny and usually my color starts to fade a bit after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true, deep, dark brown and when my hair moves, the color changes from looking so intense to a little bit lighter dark brown.  </li>

            <li> I have noticed over the years that many of the companies have replaced sturdy gloves with low quality ones.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and my curls are so manageable and smooth</li>
            <li> - I promised I would come back :)  </li>

            <li> - I promised I would come back :)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, not as shiny as my hair usually is after I color with Nice &amp; Easy, but my hair is unbelievably soft.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with drips at all &amp; since the color was yellow, it was easy to see where I was applying on my brown hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels super soft and smooth, not dry one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about trying a new product when I have been satisfied with my current product, but I am so glad I tried this!  </li>
            <li> really liked the applicator bottle, it felt a little more comfortable than the one I usually use.  </li>
            <li> After drying my hair, I noticed that the grays were somewhat still noticeable, but it actually looked like highlights as opposed to grays, so I was fine with it.</li>
            <li> I am very upset.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend you try this out!</li>
            <li> So this time I decided why not go whole</li>
            <li> would highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It rinsed out very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you a whole tube of it,</li>
            <li> It makes your hair really shiny, and I also like the serum that you use to help the gray absorbs the color much faster.</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first because it was yellowish most of the time, but did eventually turn dark.  </li>
            <li> of dye is not exceptionally strong, and (very generous amount) of conditioner to be used afterward has an amazing fruity smell</li>
            <li> I have used so many other hair colors over the years, and they have never colored all the gray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had frizz for most of my life due to wavy hair and</li>
            <li> Shiny soft and grey free still after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I used the Medium Auburn on my dark brown hair and the result was a beautiful dark auburn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, fast forward to Thursday morning, less than two full days later, and the grays are once again as prominent as they were before I colored on Tuesday.</li>
            <li> Within 4 weeks of putting it on most of my gray hairs I have scattered around my dark hair are showing through.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Color true to what the package showed (this is just on me, though--please see above</li>
            <li> The color is still vibrant, and I think I have found a new product!  </li>
            <li> The color is still vibrant, and I think I have found a new product!  </li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t coarse to begin with, but it is so soft and smooth that I&#x27;d have to say that this product would take care of coarseness for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frizz?  </li>
            <li> I would not consider this product adequate at covering grays, and will not purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I left the color on for the full 25 minutes, since I was changing shades, and this was a brand new shade of color to me.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100% flat, but it sure could use some different colors in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Snapped off the little tab at the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> This product is really amazing because those hard to cover grays on the sides of your head will be colored now.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it does bleed (no matter how much you rinse it) until it dries for the first time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very, very goopy, messy liquid consistency--much more so than any other hair dye I&#x27;ve purchased in the recent past (including Feria and John Freida &amp; Clairol Nice n Easy Foam).</li>
            <li> My hair was softer and less frizzy and I&#x27;m happy to say they gray hair is still missing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very high-quality product with more steps designed to protect hair from damage than other dyes (including a clear &amp;#34;smoothing hair protectant&amp;#34; gel--similar in consistency to clear hair gel (but</li>
            <li> strong, lasting, consistent color that seems to work extremely well in covering grays</li>
            <li> Clairol Expert Collection Pantene AgeDefy is a new hair color that states the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fight</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells, and this did not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the shade that I used (for me) which was Dark Brown, as I like to have more red in my hair, so I will go with Medium Auburn in a few weeks when it is time to color again.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the shade that I used (for me) which was Dark Brown, as I like to have more red in my hair, so I will go with Medium Auburn in a few weeks when it is time to color again.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to cover gray hair, of which I have a more a small amount on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed out this color, it was significantly less than normal, which I was excited to see.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse white hairs, you will have to leave this on for the full 45 min as suggested.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first color since going to a professional, that my grays are totally gone.</li>
            <li> I rinsed and rinsed until the water was completely clear.</li>
            <li> It covered my sporadic grays really well and the overall color looks really natural.  </li>
            <li> It covers my old lady gray hair.  </li>
            <li> The consistency and quality of this color completely makes up for that.</li>
            <li> From the very beginning it was different.  </li>
            <li> big debate - roots or whole head application?  </li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and combed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li> in all, I gave this product 4 stars for the softness, shine &amp; the fact that the color hasn&#x27;t faded one bit so far.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair so soft and</li>
            <li> and I told her Clairol does the job, it covers up the grays that show up, not to much but enough.</li>
            <li> it also makes the hair look shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found something I really like.</li>
            <li> and this is a true dark brown.  </li>
            <li> Again, the gloves being more durable and thick, let my color soaked gloves hold on to the bottle, and it did not slip.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Hair feels soft and smooth all over afterward, not damaged and dry like some other hair dyes</li>
            <li> This was especially problematic because I was using a dark color, which got all over my floor and facial skin/shoulders, and which I couldn&#x27;t get off easily.</li>
            <li> They gave you a whole tube of it, and you are to use a dollop (the size of a quarter) once a week, and it will last you up until your next color.  </li>
            <li> LAST OVER A MONTH SO FAR</li>
            <li> They are thick, roomy, and easy to get on and off (I remove mine after coloring, and put them back on before rinsing.)&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t judge that, but I can say that my color is still incredibly dark and shiny and usually my color starts to fade a bit after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true, deep, dark brown and when my hair moves, the color changes from looking so intense to a little bit lighter dark brown.  </li>
            <li> There was low odor, not necessarily a pleasant scent, but not a bad scent either.  </li>
            <li> When this has happened in the past, I&#x27;ve used pure acetone and had no problem getting it off my skin, but this was a different story.</li>
            <li> I had plenty of hair color to cover all of my hair and didn&#x27;t make my normal mess in the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kudos to Clairol for paying attention to the minor details like the premium gloves and conditioning therapy to last until the next color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kudos to Clairol for paying attention to the minor details like the premium gloves and conditioning therapy to last until the next color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rinsed out so quickly and easily, very little mess.  </li>
            <li> What exactly does this mean?  </li>
            <li> I  received and how it doesn&#x27;t look dry when I go outside.</li>
            <li> Based on the assumption that this product might be stronger than other permanent hair dyes, I gave this product a whirl to achieve a consistent hair color (on my dark brown 1.5&amp;#34; roots similar to the dye color with a few stray grays / lighter brown previously-dyed hair).</li>
            <li> There was enough product to do my entire head of hair although the back felt a little drier than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About my hair: naturally curly, medium brown with a small amount of noticeable grays, and it&#x27;s been 5 months since I last colored my hair.  </li>
            <li> It covers all the grey.</li>
            <li> I have used other post-dye conditioners that have left my hair shinier than this one did, but I&#x27;d use the dye again.</li>
            <li> The mixing of the Activating Creme and Color was similar to any other product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(I will come back and add to this review in a few weeks and report back on whether the color has remained vibrant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The directions show a woman holding the package to her hair and a single drop is coming out.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I checked the tube, since usually the hair color is marked on the tube, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely no problems with the consistency.  </li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> you have had problems with other hair colors not working for grays</li>
            <li> Your usual bottle of developer with the snap off tab, tube of hair color, tube of after color conditioner, regular hair coloring gloves and a foil package of a smoothing pre-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dried my hair and the color is darker than what I&#x27;d like it to be, but I did choose Dark Brown #4</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try a lighter color, since this one came out too dark for me</li>
            <li> I used the 4 dark brown color.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now black.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that choice this time, so I was a little anxious to see what the color looked like.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s sometimes the little things!)</li>
            <li> Usually when I color my hair at home, when I rinse it out, I have a larger-than-shampooing amount of hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I usually go the roots route, but have been disappointed because I don&#x27;t get dark enough color that way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad our local store doesn&#x27;t carry it, so it&#x27;s either Amazon or a store about half an hour away.  </li>
            <li> This might be mitigated to some extent by putting lotion thickly along your hairline so your skin doesn&#x27;t get stained.</li>
            <li> The pre-treatment is a thick gel that is very slick feeling, so you&#x27;re not going to get it out drop by drop.  </li>
            <li> I did start wondering if perhaps I&#x27;d gotten the wrong color</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I usually choose \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;ash\\&quot; to avoid the awful \\&quot;color in the box</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t bad .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing -</li>
            <li> This is the worst product  I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This hair color kit is one of the worst kits I have ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this, it hides  my  greys, and give a nice shine to my  hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for years. This is the worst product  I have ever used. My hair is now black. The color I purchased was medium brown. I am very upset. I should know better. Never again.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse white hairs, you will have to leave this on for the full 45 min as suggested. I had dyed my hair prior and only left it for 30 minutes and the white hairs were a reddish brown and some were still white. I redyed my hair 5 weeks later with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have had problems with other hair colors not working for grays, I highly recommend you try this out! This however doesn&#x27;t last more than 4 weeks, it starts to fade out sooner than it should</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair color.  It covers my old lady gray hair.  The only downside is that it does bleed (no matter how much you rinse it) until it dries for the first time.  Knowing that I just don&#x27;t use any good towels after rinsing it out of my hair.  The consistency and quality of this color completely makes up for that.</li>
            <li> I have used so many other hair colors over the years, and they have never colored all the gray.  This product is really amazing because those hard to cover grays on the sides of your head will be colored now.  If you decide to become a BzzAgent.com  you can go through all the surveys, and receive free products to try.  This one was the first one I have received, and I cannot wait to try something else.  Go out ladies and get this product, and try it for yourself.  You will be AMAZED.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from BzzAgent and I colored my hair about four weeks ago, but I&#x27;ve been waiting to review it because I wanted to see if I would have the problem I do with most at home hair color.  Within 4 weeks of putting it on most of my gray hairs I have scattered around my dark hair are showing through.  But not CLAIROL AGE DEFYING HAIR COLOR!!!  From the very beginning it was different.  My hair was softer and less frizzy and I&#x27;m happy to say they gray hair is still missing.</li>
            <li> Clairol Expert Collection Pantene AgeDefy is a new hair color that states the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fight 7 signs of aging hair.  Look 10 years younger.  Radiant youthful color.  100% gray coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering, like I was, what the 7 signs of aging hair are, Clairol tells us that as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stubborn grays, lackluster color, coarseness, frizz, unruly hair, dryness &amp; breakage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a BzzAgent, which means I get to try out cool products  like this one for free and influence brands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the box?  Your usual bottle of developer with the snap off tab, tube of hair color, tube of after color conditioner, regular hair coloring gloves and a foil package of a smoothing pre-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smoothing pre-treatment states it is to make resistant gray hair hold on to the color. The directions show a woman holding the package to her hair and a single drop is coming out.  The pre-treatment is a thick gel that is very slick feeling, so you&#x27;re not going to get it out drop by drop.  I have beyond my shoulders length hair &amp; I focused along my hairline &amp; roots since the directions state this pre-treatment will help the color stick to gray hair.  There was enough product to do my entire head of hair although the back felt a little drier than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hands per the directions since they were feeling pretty slicky and put on the gloves.  Snapped off the little tab at the top of the bottle.  The color is in a tube, you have to pierce open using the cap of the tube &amp; squeeze it into the developer bottle like a tube of toothpaste.  I had absolutely no problems with the consistency.  It is thicker than Clairol Nice &amp; Easy, but not terribly thick.  The color was yellow.  Shaking the mixture was easy, it blended much more quickly than Nice &amp; Easy does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big debate - roots or whole head application?  I usually go the roots route, but have been disappointed because I don&#x27;t get dark enough color that way.  So this time I decided why not go whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied to my hairline/roots first.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with drips at all &amp; since the color was yellow, it was easy to see where I was applying on my brown hair.  I did start wondering if perhaps I&#x27;d gotten the wrong color &amp; I checked the tube, since usually the hair color is marked on the tube, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I had plenty of hair color to cover all of my hair and didn&#x27;t make my normal mess in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waited.  Got in the shower, applied a bit of water per the directions and lathered my hair.  I have never had a hair color feel like it&#x27;s lathering until today.  It felt super creamy and smooth.  Rinsed out so quickly and easily, very little mess.  I rinsed and rinsed until the water was completely clear. My hair felt soft and combed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dried my hair and the color is darker than what I&#x27;d like it to be, but I did choose Dark Brown #4 and this is a true dark brown.  I usually choose \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;ash\\&quot; to avoid the awful \\&quot;color in the box redness\\&quot; that I can get with drugstore hair color.  I didn&#x27;t have that choice this time, so I was a little anxious to see what the color looked like.  I don&#x27;t see any of that funky red color.  It&#x27;s a true, deep, dark brown and when my hair moves, the color changes from looking so intense to a little bit lighter dark brown.  It&#x27;s pretty.  It&#x27;s shiny, not as shiny as my hair usually is after I color with Nice &amp; Easy, but my hair is unbelievably soft.  Amazingly soft.  It smells good too.  It doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;I just colored my hair at home\\&quot; smell - it just smells clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 years younger?  No.  If I had started out with all gray hair, yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Radiant youthful color?  Not really.  If they had thrown in some highlights or different tones, the way I get with Nice &amp; Easy, then yes, it would be radiant, youthful color.  But this isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not 100% flat, but it sure could use some different colors in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight 7 signs of aging hair?  If I had started out with all gray hair, yes.  Did it cover my stubborn grays?  No, I still have some grays showing along the side of my hairline, which is an area I covered first. I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did AgeDefy conquer lackluster color?  I&#x27;d have to say yes, this did make my color better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about coarseness?  If you have all gray hair, your hair could be coarse.  Some people with gray hair do not have coarse gray hair.  My hair wasn&#x27;t coarse to begin with, but it is so soft and smooth that I&#x27;d have to say that this product would take care of coarseness for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frizz?  Frizz isn&#x27;t just aging hair.  I&#x27;ve had frizz for most of my life due to wavy hair and yes, this took care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unruly hair?  What exactly does this mean?  I think they just threw this one in because they couldn&#x27;t come up with another one and didn&#x27;t want to have 6 signs of aging hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dryness?  My hair feels super soft and smooth, not dry one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakage?  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clairol claims the color lasts 8 weeks.  It hasn&#x27;t been 8 weeks, so I really can&#x27;t judge that, but I can say that my color is still incredibly dark and shiny and usually my color starts to fade a bit after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I gave this product 4 stars for the softness, shine &amp; the fact that the color hasn&#x27;t faded one bit so far.  It&#x27;s more expensive than my Nice &amp; Easy and the color range is woefully inadequate, so I don&#x27;t know if I will switch. I&#x27;d like to try a lighter color, since this one came out too dark for me so I will definitely give this hair color another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> I got this free to try from Bzzagent and will definably buy again. Shiny soft and grey free still after 3 weeks! My hair is softer than before I colored 3 weeks ago! I loved the smell and my hair is still shinier too! Easy to apply and did not drip and run.  I have a new favorite!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD, QUICK DELIVERY AND WORK GREAT LAST OVER A MONTH SO FAR, I ORDERED 5 THOUGH, I LOVE IT, WILL BUY AGAIN WHEN I AM RUNNING OUT</li>
            <li> This hair color kit is one of the worst kits I have ever used. It is supposed to cover gray hair, of which I have a more a small amount on the crown of my head. I followed the directions and timing as the package insert described them to refresh my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the initial coloring on Tuesday evening, and used the very nice conditioner provided. After drying my hair, I noticed that the grays were somewhat still noticeable, but it actually looked like highlights as opposed to grays, so I was fine with it. My hair was shiny, and the color guide on the package accurately reflected my end result. I was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, fast forward to Thursday morning, less than two full days later, and the grays are once again as prominent as they were before I colored on Tuesday. I have used color protecting shampoo each day, but I have never used a coloring kit that lasted such a short period of time. It&#x27;s very disappointing - I&#x27;ve colored my hair at home using different kits many times before, for years, and have never had a result like this. I&#x27;ve always had great success with Clairol brand kits. I would not consider this product adequate at covering grays, and will not purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> great product, loved it</li>
            <li> My mom loved the Nice n Easy Gray Solution, but then they stopped making it and became Age Defy.  My mom has hard to color gray hair, so she got this Age Defy, and she is happy with it.  It&#x27;s too bad our local store doesn&#x27;t carry it, so it&#x27;s either Amazon or a store about half an hour away.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Based on the assumption that this product might be stronger than other permanent hair dyes, I gave this product a whirl to achieve a consistent hair color (on my dark brown 1.5&amp;#34; roots similar to the dye color with a few stray grays / lighter brown previously-dyed hair). Without further adieu, here is a comprehensive list of pros and cons of my experience with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Very high-quality product with more steps designed to protect hair from damage than other dyes (including a clear &amp;#34;smoothing hair protectant&amp;#34; gel--similar in consistency to clear hair gel (but not sticky)--that goes on before coloring)&lt;br /&gt;-Very strong, lasting, consistent color that seems to work extremely well in covering grays&lt;br /&gt;-Hair feels soft and smooth all over afterward, not damaged and dry like some other hair dyes&lt;br /&gt;-Odor of dye is not exceptionally strong, and (very generous amount) of conditioner to be used afterward has an amazing fruity smell&lt;br /&gt;-Color true to what the package showed (this is just on me, though--please see above re: my starting color)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Very, very goopy, messy liquid consistency--much more so than any other hair dye I&#x27;ve purchased in the recent past (including Feria and John Freida &amp; Clairol Nice n Easy Foam). This was especially problematic because I was using a dark color, which got all over my floor and facial skin/shoulders, and which I couldn&#x27;t get off easily. When this has happened in the past, I&#x27;ve used pure acetone and had no problem getting it off my skin, but this was a different story. This might be mitigated to some extent by putting lotion thickly along your hairline so your skin doesn&#x27;t get stained.</li>
            <li> Just rinsed it off and my gray strands are still there. Like I never even colored my hair! What a disappointment. Back to Garnier Nutrisse!</li>
            <li> I used this product today and it covered my gray hair amazingly!!  They are stubborn!!  It&#x27;s the first color since going to a professional, that my grays are totally gone. I got it free to try from BzzAgent and I love it!! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I got to try this dye for free. This dye has more steps than most...a pre-dye conditioner? is put on first, then the dye, then rise and condition.  I was nervous at first because it was yellowish most of the time, but did eventually turn dark.  It covered my sporadic grays really well and the overall color looks really natural.  I took off a star because I didn&#x27;t care for the conditioner.  I have used other post-dye conditioners that have left my hair shinier than this one did, but I&#x27;d use the dye again.</li>
            <li> Good looking color and lasts much longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I used the 4 dark brown color.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out way darker than it was on the box, but I also haven&#x27;t washed it yet.  About my hair: naturally curly, medium brown with a small amount of noticeable grays, and it&#x27;s been 5 months since I last colored my hair.  I only colored it a couple of days ago and haven&#x27;t washed it yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on the staying power.  Usually when I color my hair at home, when I rinse it out, I have a larger-than-shampooing amount of hair loss.  When I rinsed out this color, it was significantly less than normal, which I was excited to see. Hair was soft, good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this through BzzAgent 3 weeks ago. I used it the same day I received it and I really like it. This product left my hair looking very shinny and the color was just beautiful.  I used the Medium Auburn on my dark brown hair and the result was a beautiful dark auburn. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now and the color still looks the same. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> (Please see my additional comments I added 19 days after coloring)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/24/14:  I am a BzzAgent and I tried this product for free.  I have been using Garnier Nutriesse for many years, but decided to try Clairol&#x27;s new product as a BzzAgent.  I was a little nervous about trying a new product when I have been satisfied with my current product, but I am so glad I tried this!  I tried Dark Brown #4.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I was very happy with the quality of the gloves.  It may seem like a minor thing, but sturdy, comfortable gloves are very important to me.  I have noticed over the years that many of the companies have replaced sturdy gloves with low quality ones.  The gloves that come with this product are AWESOME.  They are thick, roomy, and easy to get on and off (I remove mine after coloring, and put them back on before rinsing.)&lt;br /&gt;A \\&quot;Age Defy Smoothing Pre-Treatment\\&quot; comes in the box, and it was great - felt like a serum that just gets worked through your hair and works while you are mixing the color.  I think it made the color adhere better. The mixing of the Activating Creme and Color was similar to any other product.  There was low odor, not necessarily a pleasant scent, but not a bad scent either.  I am very sensitive to smells, and this did not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the applicator bottle, it felt a little more comfortable than the one I usually use.  Again, the gloves being more durable and thick, let my color soaked gloves hold on to the bottle, and it did not slip. (It&#x27;s sometimes the little things!) I left the color on for the full 25 minutes, since I was changing shades, and this was a brand new shade of color to me.  It rinsed out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Another WIN-WIN for Clairol Age Defy was the \\&quot;Pantene Pro-V Colorseal Conditioning Therapy.\\&quot; Anyone that colors their hair will tell you that the conditioner that comes with a box of color is the best stuff on earth - but you can never buy it alone.  Do you know what Clairol did?  They gave you a whole tube of it, and you are to use a dollop (the size of a quarter) once a week, and it will last you up until your next color.  Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;I colored my hair 4 days ago, and I think it turned out great.  Full color coverage, super shiny, and super soft.  I have naturally curly hair, and my curls are so manageable and smooth right now.&lt;br /&gt;Great, great product.  I am glad that I was chosen to try this product so I could tell you all about it!  Kudos to Clairol for paying attention to the minor details like the premium gloves and conditioning therapy to last until the next color.&lt;br /&gt;(I will come back and add to this review in a few weeks and report back on whether the color has remained vibrant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04/08/14 - I promised I would come back :)  So, it has been almost 19 days since I colored my hair.  Still shiny, still soft, and I am still happily using the Conditioning Therapy weekly.  The color is still vibrant, and I think I have found a new product!  I don&#x27;t love the shade that I used (for me) which was Dark Brown, as I like to have more red in my hair, so I will go with Medium Auburn in a few weeks when it is time to color again.  Truly, a quality product!ve you a whole tube of it, and you are to use a dollop (the size of a quarter) once a week, and it will last you up until your next color.

            <li> I tried this product for free from Bzzz Agent. I love it. The smell wasn&#x27;t bad . coverage of gray weeks after there are none in pass in a week could see gray again. Made my hair so soft and no frizzy&#x27;s I would use this product again. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  It covers all the grey. and it smells good on the hair.  I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I told my daughter about Clairol expert Age defy Collection after she noticed how great my hair looks and feels. I  told her I received this item to try and I told her Clairol does the job, it covers up the grays that show up, not to much but enough. it also makes the hair look shiny and soft. I  also told her I love the way it looks when i go out in the sun with the color I  received and how it doesn&#x27;t look dry when I go outside.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found something I really like. It makes your hair really shiny, and I also like the serum that you use to help the gray absorbs the color much faster.</li>
