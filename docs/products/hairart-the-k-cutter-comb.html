            <li>extremely happy with my buy!</li>
            <li>this is the best comb to use.</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>Great hair untangler!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li>If you have 3c, 4a hair the ability of the K-cutter to pull through is great</li>
            <li>This thing works great and does wonders for my beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy camper.  </li>
            <li>The comb itself was great</li>
            <li>but I think this would work great for any hair.</li>
            <li>For my hair at 4 inches its a great detangler.</li>
            <li>But ok!!</li>
            <li>This comb is huge!!</li>
            <li>The combs works best straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice and strong</li>
            <li>This comb needs a better handle.</li>
            <li>They would comb my hair better than anything.  </li>
            <li>I ordered more than one.  </li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more ergonomic if someone else is using it on your hair a la hairstylists etc.</li>
            <li>However, it works just as well as the original!</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>It will make my fro easy to manage...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>but once you get used to it, this pick is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it still holds as strong as ever; I&#x27;ve got really think hair, so that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li>This is great to use on your long afro, it really picks it out fully!</li>
            <li>SUPER LARGE!</li>
            <li>but the handle is not sturdy enough for this kind of hair.</li>
            <li>THE HANDLE OFFERS LEVERAGE, AND THE METAL TEETH PREVENT STATIC.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that easily goes through my wet hair, as my hair is very fine and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I ordered this comb and it was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The first one I bought after my stylist recommended it over 5 years ago</li>
            <li>Far too flexible to be very useful to comb out snarls.</li>
            <li>MY 4 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER HAS WONDERFUL LONG EXTREMELY CURLY HAIR</li>
            <li>I had one of these in the past and loved it but lost it.</li>
            <li>, i have really coarse 4c hair, and it worked fine</li>
            <li>I was absolutely in 7th heaven.  </li>
            <li>Now, though, thanks to Amazon, I am covered for life.</li>
            <li>If you owned one of these in the 70s you will find that this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>for the most part, this product met my expectations; however, the handle was not as sturdy as i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset this never happens to me</li>
            <li>It was just what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;Was shipped very fast&lt;</li>
            <li>The teeth are metal but gentle on the scalp.</li>
            <li>it really got the job done with more ease than I expected.</li>
            <li>My original one had a wooden handle, whereas these are plastic.</li>
            <li>This comb shipped fast and it is high quality....</li>
            <li>The Hairart The K Cutter Comb is exactly what I have been looking for to replace my old rake.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this comb!</li>
            <li>It worked a little better when I held the comb where the teeth were.</li>
            <li>I purchased this comb for my thick hair and my daughter started using and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I guarded the other with my life.  </li>
            <li>i use it mainly to massage my braids underneath my sew ins and my natural clients loooove it.</li>
            <li>I finally found what appeared to be an exact replica</li>
            <li>I really like this comb; the metal teeth are smooth and spaced wide apart so detangling my wet hair is so much easier with this comb than with a plastic one.</li>
            <li>Initially i thought it would buckle but the material is decent.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why the manufacturers wouldn&#x27;t make the handle either round or flat, but it&#x27;s a small annoyance; it doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that this is a great detangling</li>
            <li>, while I love Amazon, you can save yourself a few dollars and pick it up at your local Asian beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>its hard to find this comb in my local beauty supplies but for the most part, this comb is heaven.</li>
            <li>Because I have wiry hair (not curly), years ago when these were popular with the African Americans, I bought a couple and was addicted to them.  </li>
            <li>I can only use this comb for detangling my curly natural hair.</li>
            <li>You do have to hold the handle pretty tightly to make this comb work.</li>
            <li>I was concerned, at first, by this, as they seemed a little flimsy.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the moulded plastic handle could have been finished a bit better, the edges were a bit sharp.  </li>
            <li>Flimsy cheap weak flexible handle.</li>
            <li>I use it on very thick, textured hair at it detangles very easily with less pulling and tugging.</li>

            <li> Not as heavy duty as I remember from from back in the days</li>

            <li> I HAD ONE OF THESE COMBS WHEN I HAD A TIGHT PERM</li>

            <li> I just wish the handle was a little stronger and the teeth was a tad bit sharper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i need a pick with a stiff handle,</li>
            <li> Hold it very very tight or you will drop it.  </li>
            <li> was a gift, seemed anxious to use it</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> The metal teeth are too heavy for the thin handle.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair or hair that needs to be detangled, hold the comb at the area by the teeth.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick</li>
            <li> Not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> No more searching!!</li>
            <li> Alas, a couple of months ago, my one remaining cutter comb disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The handle is weak!</li>
            <li> I desperately searched everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like hard handle 😭!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> You do have to hold the handle pretty tightly to make this comb work.</li>
            <li> If you have 3c, 4a hair the ability of the K-cutter to pull through is great but the handle is not sturdy enough for this kind of hair. You&#x27;re pulling through with the constant thought of will it break on this stroke or the next...</li>
            <li> The metal teeth are too heavy for the thin handle. When I held the comb by the handle I ended up ripping and breaking my hair. It worked a little better when I held the comb where the teeth were. This comb needs a better handle.</li>
            <li> was a gift, seemed anxious to use it</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a pick I lost.  It exceeded my expectations.  It looks the same but the construction is sturdier.  The rounded tapered metal teeth are an improvement over the sharp rough finish on the older picks.</li>
            <li> A bit awkward to hold at first but once you get used to it, this pick is fantastic. I think it&#x27;s been a year since I purchased it and it still holds as strong as ever; I&#x27;ve got really think hair, so that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li> This thing works great and does wonders for my beard.</li>
            <li> Because I have wiry hair (not curly), years ago when these were popular with the African Americans, I bought a couple and was addicted to them.  They would comb my hair better than anything.  Over the years, I lost one on a trip.  I guarded the other with my life.  Periodically I would look on the internet for one but had no luck.  Alas, a couple of months ago, my one remaining cutter comb disappeared.  I thought it had fallen out of my purse at a restaurant.  I desperately searched everywhere.  I searched on the internet and couldn&#x27;t find one to buy.  Periodically I searched and one day these popped up.  Whoo Hoo!!!  I was absolutely in 7th heaven.  I ordered more than one.  I&#x27;m a happy camper.  And the final part of the story?  Last week I opened a drawer and lo and behold, there was the comb I thought I had lost!!  Now, though, thanks to Amazon, I am covered for life.</li>
            <li> If you owned one of these in the 70s you will find that this is the real deal. Very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> This comb is huge!! But ok!!</li>
            <li> for the most part, this product met my expectations; however, the handle was not as sturdy as i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> extremely happy with my buy! overjoyed. it really got the job done with more ease than I expected. thanks!</li>

            <li> I ordered this comb and it was exactly what I was looking for.  My only complaint is the moulded plastic handle could have been finished a bit better, the edges were a bit sharp.  The comb itself was great and I&#x27;ll likely order another next year.</li>
            <li> MY 4 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER HAS WONDERFUL LONG EXTREMELY CURLY HAIR THAT NO REGULAR COMB, BRUSH OR PIK COULD WORK THROUGH WITHOUT HER SUFFERING THROUGH THE PAIN OF PULLED HAIR. I HAD ONE OF THESE COMBS WHEN I HAD A TIGHT PERM AND IT WORKED WONDERS, AS IT NOW DOES ON MY GRANDDAUGHTER.  IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO FIND ONE THAT I COULD SEND HOME WITH HER.  IT CUTS THROUGH THE SNARLS OF TIGHT CURLY HAIR DOUSED WITH CONDITIONED WITH EASE.  THE HANDLE OFFERS LEVERAGE, AND THE METAL TEETH PREVENT STATIC.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are correct. The handle is not sturdy at all. If you have thick hair or hair that needs to be detangled, hold the comb at the area by the teeth. Otherwise the handle will break which is the reason I took off 2 stars. I use it on very thick, textured hair at it detangles very easily with less pulling and tugging. I ordered 2 just in case I broke one.</li>
            <li> Hold it very very tight or you will drop it.  It&#x27;s not like hard handle 😭!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m very upset this never happens to me</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the quality of the product.  It is not durable.  One of the teeth fell out of my comb soon after I received it.</li>
            <li> I can only use this comb for detangling my curly natural hair. It minimizes the amount of damage that can occur when attempting to remove tangles and shed hair. I heard about this comb years ago on a site called &amp;#34;motowngirl&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. If you have thick, curly hair this is the best comb to use. I only use it when my hair is sopping wet with conditioner or when I&#x27;m moisturizing by section in preparation for detangling. Once per week is all that my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb for my thick hair and my daughter started using and liked it.  She left for college and took it with her and I could not find it anywhere..Until....I looked on Amazon.  I cannot live without this comb!</li>
            <li> Rather chintzy. Far too flexible to be very useful to comb out snarls. If you have any amount of hair this will not work for you.</li>
            <li> This comb is alright, i have really coarse 4c hair, and it worked fine I just wish the handle was a little stronger and the teeth was a tad bit sharper.</li>
            <li> I broke this comb the same day I used it.  It definitely is not for those who have kinky hair such as mine!  Not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Flimsy cheap weak flexible handle. Worst pick i&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;i need a pick with a stiff handle,</li>
            <li> SUPER LARGE! Can&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that gets tangled easily. I spray on detangler than use this comb after I wash my hair. Works like magic. My hair is fine but I think this would work great for any hair. This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve purchased. The first one I bought after my stylist recommended it over 5 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong. Got another as a spare.</li>
            <li> This comb shipped fast and it is high quality....It will make my fro easy to manage...I had one of these in the past and loved it but lost it. This is a replacement....</li>
            <li> The handle is weak! My hair is thick so i have to be careful not to snap the handle.</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit &amp;#34;bendy&amp;#34; but it tames my hair.</li>
            <li> The Hairart The K Cutter Comb is exactly what I have been looking for to replace my old rake. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy duty as I remember from from back in the days but I did order a second k cutter from Hair art.</li>
            <li> Great hair untangler!</li>
            <li> Just like I remember.</li>
            <li> I was given a comb like this, years ago, from a hairdresser with whom I&#x27;ve lost touch. It&#x27;s the only thing that easily goes through my wet hair, as my hair is very fine and tangles easily. I finally found what appeared to be an exact replica and so, I ordered these. My original one had a wooden handle, whereas these are plastic. I was concerned, at first, by this, as they seemed a little flimsy. However, it works just as well as the original! Yay! No more searching!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this comb; the metal teeth are smooth and spaced wide apart so detangling my wet hair is so much easier with this comb than with a plastic one. I took off a star, because like another reviewer stated, the handle is a little flimsy and it has an odd shape. I have no idea why the manufacturers wouldn&#x27;t make the handle either round or flat, but it&#x27;s a small annoyance; it doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that this is a great detangling comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while I love Amazon, you can save yourself a few dollars and pick it up at your local Asian beauty supply store. That&#x27;s where I purchased mine.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;Was shipped very fast&lt;br /&gt;It is nice and strong&lt;br /&gt;Would recomend to anyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an oddly shaped comb for a personal grooming tool. It seems to be more ergonomic if someone else is using it on your hair a la hairstylists etc. But that&#x27;s just nit picking. The weakest part of the comb is the middle. Initially i thought it would buckle but the material is decent. The teeth are metal but gentle on the scalp. I have thick African hair. The combs works best straight out of the shower. For my hair at 4 inches its a great detangler. Solid buy for the price.</li>
            <li> This is great to use on your long afro, it really picks it out fully!</li>
