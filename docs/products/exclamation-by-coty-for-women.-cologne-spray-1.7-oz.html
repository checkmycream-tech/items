            <li> over 50 percent less than at wallyworld, but why in the world does this need \\&quot;special handling\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> the 1980s, the mass market was trending in heavy florals and heavy orientals (e.g., White Diamonds, Poison, Beautiful, Red, Giorgio, Rive Gauche, Anais, Passion).</li>
            <li> back when, Exclamation provided young women with a fresh, new fragrance that wasn&#x27;t their mother&#x27;s, grandmother&#x27;s, or little sister&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It was the young ladies in the middle</li>
            <li> I would normally buy such a product in a local store but stopped due to the price.  </li>
            <li> Department stores were slowly stocking decent frags for carefree, young professional women, but the choices were few &amp; far between.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> Scent does not last as long as it should though.</li>
            <li> I use other colognes/perfumes for a change</li>
            <li> I realize it&#x27;s flammable, but  I&#x27;ve purchased perfume online before and received it within a few days.</li>
            <li> And women in their 30s to 50s were wearing these ... heavily.</li>
            <li> (ages 18-24) who had few fragrance choices</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong, which means others can breathe.</li>
            <li> Christmas shopping for my wife usually involves hours, days, weeks of online searching and reading reviews and comparing prices.  </li>
            <li> A waste of my money !  </li>
            <li> purchased for my wife as an everyday type of spray!</li>
            <li> This is a gift for a friend who loves this fragrance and has a difficult time find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> the 1.7 oz bottles are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Highly disappointed I will never do this again.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very happy with the quick service and it it the real cologne. I was paying over double for one bottle in the stores and couldn&#x27;t always get it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years and I love it. Amazon&#x27;s price is the best anywhere...over 50 percent less than at wallyworld, but why in the world does this need \\&quot;special handling\\&quot;? I realize it&#x27;s flammable, but  I&#x27;ve purchased perfume online before and received it within a few days. I purchased it on December 22nd and the estimated delivery is January 5th. I guess at such a great price I shouldn&#x27;t complain, but it&#x27;s really annoying.</li>
            <li> Fragrance smell nice and fixed  I think I will again Order  Thank you for providing on-site</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting this for my mom every year for Christmas for awhile now.   She loves it and asks for more each year.   Can&#x27;t beat the price and the Service of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy fresh fragrances and I found Exclamation to fit the bill. Also the price was TOO good to pass up,less than half the price from what the discount drugstore advertised. It was a win win deal.</li>
            <li> I adored this 25 years ago when I wore it in college. I loved it then. I&#x27;ve often wondered if I would love it now. When I came across a tester in a big box store, I couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG. It is all chemicals to me now. It&#x27;s the same juice ... I clearly remember it ... but I just don&#x27;t know how I wore this. I don&#x27;t. Somewhere after three hours, I started smelling some of the fruit notes &amp; vanilla. It reminded me of Paris Hilton and of Forbidden Fruit, two fruity concoctions that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1980s, the mass market was trending in heavy florals and heavy orientals (e.g., White Diamonds, Poison, Beautiful, Red, Giorgio, Rive Gauche, Anais, Passion). And women in their 30s to 50s were wearing these ... heavily. Teens had a bevy of musks &amp; powdery scents to choose from (Jovan Musks, Love&#x27;s Baby Soft). It was the young ladies in the middle (ages 18-24) who had few fragrance choices (exceptions: Charlie, Lady Stetson). Most of the choices in the market were too adult, too granny, or too teeny-bopper. Department stores were slowly stocking decent frags for carefree, young professional women, but the choices were few &amp; far between. (Keep in mind that Liz Claiborne was mid-1980s fragrance, after all! That&#x27;s about when the fragrance market for younger women started taking off in Middle America.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way back when, Exclamation provided young women with a fresh, new fragrance that wasn&#x27;t their mother&#x27;s, grandmother&#x27;s, or little sister&#x27;s. And it was available at Walgreens. For that, hats off to Exclamation!</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome.  I have been wearing this for about 30 years now and i have never received so many compliment for anything as i have when I am wearing this.  People stop me in stores and work to ask what I am wearing.  I won&#x27;t wear anything else.  The fragrance is subtle and fresh smelling.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!  And as always, Amazon is wear i do most of my shopping.  Everything i buy comes in a timely manner and well packed.</li>
            <li> Great soft scent for work.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing exclamation for 10 years. It is my number one favorite and it always will be. I buy 5-6 bottles at a time, I never want to run out. I love when people tell me they think of me when they smell exclamation. There is four relatives who told me they loved what I was wearing, I bought each of them a bottle and all four gave them back to me. They said it didn&#x27;t smell as good on them as it does on me. Thank you so much Coty!</li>
            <li> I love this scent and have been wearing it for years. I constantly get compliments about it. It is not overpowering like some perfumes can be.</li>
            <li> My mom loved when she opened her present and this was inside! It is her favorite perfume and I am happy shes happy!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, delivered on time and in perfect condition ..... I recommend</li>
            <li> This is an older fragrance but still has that fun young kick to it.  Its fresh and not overpowering - it lets your personal chemistry come thru.  Try it if you like a sweet kick to your fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite cologne and I give it to her every Christmas.  She says it is the only one where the fragrance lasts all day and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Thanks item was received on time for Christmas for my friend and she loved it. Communication was outstanding. The price was amazing and made me very happy.</li>
            <li> This is one of those sprays that some will love and others will not. It has a flowery smell to it. It is like walking through flowers on a summer shining day. It is a more mature flower-like scent. I would recommend it to women around 20 that want a clean and flowery smell. The scent is not strong, which means others can breathe. It is more of a light scent than a strong scent. The scent can last up to about 3 hours depending on where it is worn and your activies.</li>
            <li> Brings me back to 8th grade.  LOL</li>
            <li> Product well packed and just as listed on amazon</li>
            <li> This is a gift for a friend who loves this fragrance and has a difficult time find it in the stores.  It always comes very fast and extremely well packed, will be ordering more for other special occasions in her life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding my favorite perfume - Exclamation in the stores,  and now I have found it on amazon, I LOVE it!  Best price I&#x27;ve ever seen it. I bought two! Love it and people are always asking me &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; it smells wonderful. I hope it stays around forever!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice perfume</li>
            <li> Smells the same after all these years.  A good deal if you must have it again.</li>
            <li> It was the right bottle, but whatever was inside was not the normal scent. Highly disappointed I will never do this again.</li>
            <li> When finding this perfume at this price I thought it was a steal but after shipping, taxes, etc I found it cheaper in store and it even came with a travel size as well. I love the perfume and would recommend it defintely. Shipping was also fast!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this smell</li>
            <li> This perfume is way cheaper here than at the store. It smells good and wife really likes it for her.</li>
            <li> Sexy light fragrance that lasts all day. Always getting asked ,what is that scent?&#x27; Will definitely buy again. Great price</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it stays with you all day and has the best smell. I think this will be my signature perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells good and most importantly, she likes it.</li>
            <li> my wifes favorite perfume, thanks a lot. Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Christmas shopping for my wife usually involves hours, days, weeks of online searching and reading reviews and comparing prices.  I think I found the best deal possible at the time right here. Thanks and hope you&#x27;re still here next year!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this cologne for years and she loves it. The purchased arrived in quickly and I will be ordering it again. Great people to work with.</li>
            <li> Made a great gift and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!  I would normally buy such a product in a local store but stopped due to the price.  The price here made it affordable again.</li>
            <li> After not being able to find my cologne in stores, it was nice to find a place I can still get it. Waiting a week isn&#x27;t to exciting, but a $12 difference is nice:)</li>
            <li> My first bottle of Exclamation was a gift from my son when he was just a boy (he&#x27;s 32 now!!)  Since then it has been my &#x27; signature scent&#x27;!  I get many compliments on this fragrance every time I wear it!  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Nothing like the original. !!!!  It smelled awlful.  I don&#x27;t  know what happened to that batch it was nothing like the original .  A waste of my money !  And I so looked foward to getting it .  It was my favorite perfume! !!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. It is one of my favorites. If this is what you are looking for I have no complaints. I will purchase more later on.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t smelled this since the 90&#x27;s when it was really popular.  I remembered really liking this back then, so I decided to purchase it and I&#x27;m happy I did.  I love the scent and I LOVE the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this cologne in stores for many years but many of the stores have discontinued it and the 1.7 oz bottles are so expensive.  Amazon prices are really good and I received the cologne quickly.  It is a light fresh smelling cologne.  I have received so many compliments from men and women and they ask what I am wearing.  I use other colognes/perfumes for a change but I always go back to exclamation.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT MY WIFE WANTED.SHE REALLY LIKES IT.FAST SHIPPING ALSO THANKS</li>
            <li> Exactly as I remembered it!!! Bought it just for the memories.... SPOT ON!!</li>
            <li> Good perfume.  I have liked this for a long time but could not find it anywhere. Scent does not last as long as it should though.</li>
            <li> Yes I like for my girl.</li>
            <li> purchased for my wife as an everyday type of spray! smells great! and i should note: If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy! good stuff!</li>
            <li> wife loves this stuff as do I</li>
            <li> I love it , it my throw back from the 90s</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t beat the price even with the shipping</li>
