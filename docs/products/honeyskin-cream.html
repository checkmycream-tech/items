            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several things but the most impressive was getting rid of some redness on our baby&#x27;s butt after a bout of diarrhea.</li>
            <li>and it was GONE! :)</li>
            <li>I just ordered more of this for my fianc&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li>I will update in a month or so with hopefully  even more results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the package, the smell and creaminess.</li>
            <li>My friends and I all call it the magic cream.</li>
            <li>She has never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to people who are keloid prone or anyone wanting a great and beneficial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on the both of us, and it has quickly and totally alleviated the itch and healed the skin!  </li>
            <li>I loved this cream from the first time I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product!</li>
            <li>He said it really helps keep them fresh and bright looking!</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and it was great for me.</li>
            <li>They contact you directly and happily answered some of my questions.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars for the texture of the cream and it goes on so easily.</li>
            <li>I break out easily and this doesn&#x27;t do that to me.</li>
            <li>This is a very mild, non-greasy cream.</li>
            <li>I like how it feels and it rubs in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super moisturizing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  smooth and creamy and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong medicine smell.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, and makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have skin issues, it&#x27;s a fabulous moisturizer and a wonderful value considering the quality and how little of the product one has to use each time.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It is all together a wonderful body cream, one that I do not hesitate to use on my sensitive skin and the sensitive skin of my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer it feels nice on my skin and its organic and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>Another great thing is that it&#x27;s multi purpose, one jar for the entire body!  </li>
            <li>I feel totally comfortable putting it on myself and my son.</li>
            <li>It then leaves skin wonderfully smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product....</li>
            <li>jar does day 100% organic, cruelty free, not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>but I think it would works better when the roseate is calm</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for this amazing product.</li>
            <li>I use nothing else but undistilled alcohol free witch hazel toner.</li>
            <li>It has a light feel and does NOT have an obnoxious smell.  </li>
            <li>It feels comfortable on the face or legs (my primary uses).</li>
            <li>This is a great overall moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The fact that these people make personal contact with customers in a world that has become so automated means  a great deal to me.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a month, so far so good, no keloid has form.</li>
            <li>Third, it makes my skin feel very moisturized and look great!</li>
            <li>First off, I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor,  </li>
            <li>I love it as a body cream because it adds the right amount of moisture without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I love this this cream for my whole body!</li>
            <li>Honeyskin is also great for rashes, itches, eczema, dermatitis, burns, minor cuts, and wounds.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant change in the beauty and elasticity of my skin.</li>
            <li>My sister originally introduced me to it.</li>
            <li>It soaks in and leaves our skin feeling super smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Few things that we like a lot about the Haneyskin cream:&lt;br /&gt;first of all, organic ingredients, for our family it is must since we use only organic products.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly its fragrance free, my wife is very sensitive to any perfumes so this cream works great for her, also her skin is very sensitive and it is hard for her to find a good organic cream that does not irritate her skin, this face cream calms her</li>
            <li>I did think it was going to smell more like honey, or have a sweeter smell to it than it actually did, but that is ok with me since we have sensitivity to strong smells in my home.</li>
            <li>RIGHT UP!</li>
            <li>Honeyskin cream has texture of heavy whipped cream that absorbs very fast for flawless none shine looking skin.</li>
            <li>which is great, I don&#x27;t like to feel like my skin is oily from a product, I normally steer clear from ones who feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and neck and it turned it bright red.</li>
            <li>We love this, the whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>Also leaves my skin nice and soft and moisturizer, not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream.  </li>
            <li>I have never been happy with any other face cream like this.</li>
            <li>I have a couple areas of super dry skin, I don&#x27;t think it is psoriasis or anything else because a good very rich cream usually works great if I remember to use it twice or 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>When I did a test on the backs of my hands, it was obvious which hand had received the cream because the skin was so obviously more hydrated and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I went the all natural route and have spent hundreds trying products, but have never found the perfect moisturizer until now!&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li>I have mild rocacica</li>
            <li>This product is simple, non-toxic, and makes my skin feel smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li>This works better than the high priced eye</li>
            <li>It is much softer, smooth, not oily, no residue left, feels good and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honeyskin relieved my symptoms the very first day.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed into the skin and has a slightly sweet or honey scent that dissipates.</li>
            <li>It feels great and light on my skin, and even the small jar lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>First of all it&#x27;s non toxic!</li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s the only body lotion she can also use on the face without causing any kind of breakouts.</li>
            <li>but you will see an improvement that rarely if ever comes from using the water based creams.</li>
            <li>Overall a really nice cream.</li>
            <li>Really happy with this product and highly recommend for those with dry skin or those looking for a lightweight face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Honeyskin, is an excellent soothing cream for rashes, itches, eczema, any kind of dermatitis actually, burns, minor cuts and wounds, as well as dry skin, wrinkles, puffy eyes, etc</li>
            <li>I love the fact that honey is one of its main ingredients and that it is a totally pure product.</li>
            <li>though, I&#x27;m sure other people love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super light and fluffy, and leaves the skin feeling incredibly moisturized, without a heavy or greasy feel to it like many creams leave.</li>
            <li>I had a rash on my fingers and this cream made it go away and helped with the itching right</li>
            <li>As soon as I apply the cream it soaks right into my skin and it feels</li>
            <li>There is no offensive odor, it leaves no tacky or sticky feeling, and it absorbs right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>and so I was worried about putting it on my face, since I have very sensitive skin that reacts strongly too fragrance and breaks out in either acne or rashes if irritated.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this cream on my lips instead of lip balm and after two treatments my lips were perfect again.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my husband bought me a super expensive ($150)  moisturizing cream for Xmas</li>
            <li>It helped my overly dried skin from warm weather, washing hands frequently etc to feeling nice and moist again.</li>
            <li>This can is fabulous on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbed right into my skin and my face felt very soothed after.</li>
            <li>Feels great even right after shaving, when my skin is extremely sensitive and most other creams cause irritation, feel stingy and leave red</li>
            <li>My HoneySkin Cream arrived very fast - in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it goes on the skin very smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy or oily</li>
            <li>Great for after shaving legs and other sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, with mild rosacea, and I&#x27;ve had mild acne for over a decade</li>
            <li>I will most likely not buy in the future and will look for something more emollient.</li>
            <li>The redness on my cheeks is fading and overall, my skin feels better than ever.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Definitely gave me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied this to my legs</li>
            <li>This is also my first review I have ever written about a product.  </li>
            <li>Love the personal connection to the company.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and organic, it&#x27;s fragrance free, and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more...</li>
            <li>The texture of this cream is really luxurious!</li>
            <li>It looks and feels younger. :-)</li>
            <li>After the first night I used it.</li>
            <li>It has made my scars disappear, my face brighter, and has just made my overall skin tone more even.</li>
            <li>The only thing that isn&#x27;t my favorite is the fragrance -</li>
            <li>Its not heavy or greasy in the least and wears beautifully under powder or liquid foundation, although my skin has never looked better bare.</li>
            <li>Completely fragrance free, not oily at all so it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I am sure that living in the dry NW part of the country may not help.</li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin and mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>I got it for my wee one who has super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>you can relate to how quick it spreads like wild fire and  </li>
            <li>and I have more dry skin</li>
            <li>I like that it has no real scent, just a light pleasant slight scent.</li>
            <li>Organic Dry Skin Repair Cream - Natural Facial Moisturizer works great for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice, thick cream!</li>
            <li>It really calms the itching and my skin looks better and doesn&#x27;t feel as cracked and dry, and I love that it sinks into the skin instead of just sitting on top of it like a lot of other ointments and creams I&#x27;ve tried for my eczema.</li>
            <li>Within one application there was a huge difference by the second application that evening the patches vanished.</li>
            <li>Now I have a huge red mark on my neck.</li>
            <li>so you can feel how much it is moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciated the additional instructions.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really softens your skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s one product for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I like that it really has no scents or added junk.</li>
            <li>do I know what&#x27;s absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It feels so lightweight yet really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I am a holistic health practitioner, so I am very picky about what products I recommend.</li>
            <li>and it helps so much.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product and even if you have oily skin it will not make it worse.</li>
            <li>This really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li>This stuff is crazy good!!!!  </li>
            <li>It does moisturize very well</li>
            <li>They really care about the product and your satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it is organic</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do anything for me really.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>I don;t see that it has any real affect on ecxema or psoriasis</li>
            <li>I love all the natural ingredients too, a big plus!</li>
            <li>If you have rosacea and this does not seem to be helping, stop using any facial cleaner and simply use warm water followed by HoneySkin.</li>
            <li>It feels like butter on my skin and has a very subtle, lovely honey smell :)</li>
            <li>and it works for both of use better than any other cream.</li>
            <li>so finding a product that handles my dry skin but is not greasy has not been easy.</li>
            <li>I have been going through it pretty quickly since I apply it twice daily to my face, and then daily to my decolletage and belly (pregnant).  </li>
            <li>Honestly after applying it to various parts of my skin, it felt quite dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few natural skin products and this is easily my favorite!</li>
            <li>absorbs very quickly but still leaves skin very dry</li>
            <li>I am a huge stickler for completely non-toxic products and had given up on buying any commercial moisturizers--I can feel the chemicals and a lot of them have fragrance, which I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li>have been using this product on the areas where the skin is almost impossible to moisturize and it has had a wonderful effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I turned super red.</li>
            <li>Plus, my skin looks dewy and vibrant.</li>
            <li>have very dry skin and this rubs in easy and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue that normal lotions sometimes leave on.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of using this daily, we have noticed a major transformation occurring for about the past week, with it looking better and better every day.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>It has been life changing and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It really calms the irritated skin and it is not heavy or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I can see myself in a product from use, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick</li>
            <li>I have acne issues and super sensitive skin and using this product, I actually witness my acne shrink and go away!</li>
            <li>As an additional point, my husband uses this on his tattoos (new and one) and he LOVES it.  </li>
            <li>As I felt a new cyst coming in under my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clearing it up real quick to unbelievable .</li>
            <li>I used it three or four times a day at first and felt immediate relief, even though the irritation came back after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I need to give it more time?</li>
            <li>I usually have to apply lots of cream until it feels hydrated but with this one I put on one layer and my skin immediately felt better.  </li>
            <li>my daughter&#x27;s eczema is nearly all gone!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Honeyskin on my face for the past two weeks and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>When she gets &amp;#34;Winter itch&amp;#34; she uses a small dab and like magic the itch is gone.</li>
            <li>I am a 58 year old female with mature, sensitive skin; a tricky combination for product success.  </li>
            <li>Based on these short-term results, I&#x27;m expecting new skin to be completely clear of acne and signs of rosacea.</li>
            <li>but Honeyskin smoothed and soothed those dry ares on my babies immediately and showed improvement right away.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised to find it not greasy.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the seller reaching out and sending an e-mail with FAQs and stuff to help us understand how the product works, and how it will benefit the different skin conditions we are using it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every natural, home remedy known to man, nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>ones marked sensitive.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Also this cream is so natural you could eat it</li>
            <li>So far</li>
            <li>A little does go a long way, but I&#x27;m going to have to order more since my husband has started using it as well and loves it for his dryness problems.</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough about this product, wow!</li>
            <li>Its an interesting combo of very simple and natural while still feeling expensive and high tech.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using Honeyskin daily, my skin is almost completely clear of any signs of rosacea or acne.</li>
            <li>I also use this religiously on my frequent bug bites and it makes the itch go away almost instantly.</li>
            <li>it really quick unbelievable</li>
            <li>(occasionally I&#x27;d clear it up with various face products but they always made my skin splotchy red, would cause flareups with the rosacea, or were so dying I&#x27;d end up with flaky skin).</li>
            <li>It does flare up very briefly (for a minute or two) when I first apply it, but then it dies down.  </li>
            <li>The day I got this in the mail, I happened to have really puffy dark circles under my eyes due to not sleepiing much the night before.</li>
            <li>It is very thick, smooth on the skin, and the natural (fragrance-free) scent is reminiscent of chocolate and honey once it has warmed on your skin.</li>
            <li>I can really tell that it absorbs further into my skin than other lotions.</li>
            <li>; I believe it&#x27;s because some of my makeup was previously being absorbed by my dry skin, which now doesn&#x27;t happen as the cream has sufficiently hydrated it.  </li>
            <li>My skin tends to be very dry and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>So then I tried it on my chronically dry hands and they are now soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from super dry and Rosanna with a small spot of psoriasis.</li>

            <li> I was excited to try this product!</li>
            <li> He said it really helps keep them fresh and bright looking!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and it was great for me.</li>
            <li> They contact you directly and happily answered some of my questions.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars for the texture of the cream and it goes on so easily.</li>
            <li> I break out easily and this doesn&#x27;t do that to me.</li>

            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t have skin issues, it&#x27;s a fabulous moisturizer and a wonderful value considering the quality and how little of the product one has to use each time.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It is all together a wonderful body cream, one that I do not hesitate to use on my sensitive skin and the sensitive skin of my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I feel totally comfortable putting it on myself and my son.</li>
            <li> It then leaves skin wonderfully smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product....</li>
            <li> jar does day 100% organic, cruelty free, not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> but I think it would works better when the roseate is calm</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for this amazing product.</li>

            <li> It feels comfortable on the face or legs (my primary uses).</li>
            <li> This is a great overall moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The fact that these people make personal contact with customers in a world that has become so automated means  a great deal to me.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month, so far so good, no keloid has form.</li>
            <li> Third, it makes my skin feel very moisturized and look great!</li>

            <li> My sister originally introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> It soaks in and leaves our skin feeling super smooth.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Few things that we like a lot about the Haneyskin cream:&lt;br /&gt;first of all, organic ingredients, for our family it is must since we use only organic products.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly its fragrance free, my wife is very sensitive to any perfumes so this cream works great for her, also her skin is very sensitive and it is hard for her to find a good organic cream that does not irritate her skin, this face cream calms her</li>
            <li> I did think it was going to smell more like honey, or have a sweeter smell to it than it actually did, but that is ok with me since we have sensitivity to strong smells in my home.</li>
            <li> RIGHT UP!</li>
            <li> Honeyskin cream has texture of heavy whipped cream that absorbs very fast for flawless none shine looking skin.</li>
            <li> which is great, I don&#x27;t like to feel like my skin is oily from a product, I normally steer clear from ones who feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and neck and it turned it bright red.</li>
            <li> We love this, the whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> Also leaves my skin nice and soft and moisturizer, not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream.  </li>
            <li> I have never been happy with any other face cream like this.</li>
            <li> I have a couple areas of super dry skin, I don&#x27;t think it is psoriasis or anything else because a good very rich cream usually works great if I remember to use it twice or 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> When I did a test on the backs of my hands, it was obvious which hand had received the cream because the skin was so obviously more hydrated and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I went the all natural route and have spent hundreds trying products, but have never found the perfect moisturizer until now!&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li> I have mild rocacica</li>
            <li> This product is simple, non-toxic, and makes my skin feel smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li> This works better than the high priced eye</li>
            <li> It is much softer, smooth, not oily, no residue left, feels good and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honeyskin relieved my symptoms the very first day.</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed into the skin and has a slightly sweet or honey scent that dissipates.</li>
            <li> It feels great and light on my skin, and even the small jar lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s non toxic!</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s the only body lotion she can also use on the face without causing any kind of breakouts.</li>
            <li> but you will see an improvement that rarely if ever comes from using the water based creams.</li>
            <li> Overall a really nice cream.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product and highly recommend for those with dry skin or those looking for a lightweight face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Honeyskin, is an excellent soothing cream for rashes, itches, eczema, any kind of dermatitis actually, burns, minor cuts and wounds, as well as dry skin, wrinkles, puffy eyes, etc</li>
            <li> I love the fact that honey is one of its main ingredients and that it is a totally pure product.</li>
            <li> though, I&#x27;m sure other people love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s super light and fluffy, and leaves the skin feeling incredibly moisturized, without a heavy or greasy feel to it like many creams leave.</li>
            <li> I had a rash on my fingers and this cream made it go away and helped with the itching right</li>
            <li> As soon as I apply the cream it soaks right into my skin and it feels</li>
            <li> There is no offensive odor, it leaves no tacky or sticky feeling, and it absorbs right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> and so I was worried about putting it on my face, since I have very sensitive skin that reacts strongly too fragrance and breaks out in either acne or rashes if irritated.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cream on my lips instead of lip balm and after two treatments my lips were perfect again.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my husband bought me a super expensive ($150)  moisturizing cream for Xmas</li>
            <li> It helped my overly dried skin from warm weather, washing hands frequently etc to feeling nice and moist again.</li>
            <li> This can is fabulous on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbed right into my skin and my face felt very soothed after.</li>
            <li> Feels great even right after shaving, when my skin is extremely sensitive and most other creams cause irritation, feel stingy and leave red</li>
            <li> My HoneySkin Cream arrived very fast - in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it goes on the skin very smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy or oily</li>
            <li> Great for after shaving legs and other sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, with mild rosacea, and I&#x27;ve had mild acne for over a decade</li>
            <li> I will most likely not buy in the future and will look for something more emollient.</li>
            <li> The redness on my cheeks is fading and overall, my skin feels better than ever.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Definitely gave me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied this to my legs</li>
            <li> This is also my first review I have ever written about a product.  </li>
            <li> Love the personal connection to the company.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and organic, it&#x27;s fragrance free, and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more...</li>
            <li> The texture of this cream is really luxurious!</li>
            <li> It looks and feels younger. :-)</li>
            <li> After the first night I used it.</li>
            <li> It has made my scars disappear, my face brighter, and has just made my overall skin tone more even.</li>
            <li> The only thing that isn&#x27;t my favorite is the fragrance -</li>
            <li> Its not heavy or greasy in the least and wears beautifully under powder or liquid foundation, although my skin has never looked better bare.</li>
            <li> Completely fragrance free, not oily at all so it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I am sure that living in the dry NW part of the country may not help.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin and mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> I got it for my wee one who has super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> you can relate to how quick it spreads like wild fire and  </li>
            <li> and I have more dry skin</li>
            <li> I like that it has no real scent, just a light pleasant slight scent.</li>
            <li> Organic Dry Skin Repair Cream - Natural Facial Moisturizer works great for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice, thick cream!</li>
            <li> It really calms the itching and my skin looks better and doesn&#x27;t feel as cracked and dry, and I love that it sinks into the skin instead of just sitting on top of it like a lot of other ointments and creams I&#x27;ve tried for my eczema.</li>
            <li> Within one application there was a huge difference by the second application that evening the patches vanished.</li>
            <li> Now I have a huge red mark on my neck.</li>
            <li> so you can feel how much it is moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciated the additional instructions.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really softens your skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one product for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I like that it really has no scents or added junk.</li>
            <li> do I know what&#x27;s absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It feels so lightweight yet really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I am a holistic health practitioner, so I am very picky about what products I recommend.</li>
            <li> and it helps so much.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product and even if you have oily skin it will not make it worse.</li>
            <li> This really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy good!!!!  </li>
            <li> It does moisturize very well</li>
            <li> They really care about the product and your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that it is organic</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything for me really.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream</li>
            <li> I don;t see that it has any real affect on ecxema or psoriasis</li>
            <li> I love all the natural ingredients too, a big plus!</li>
            <li> If you have rosacea and this does not seem to be helping, stop using any facial cleaner and simply use warm water followed by HoneySkin.</li>
            <li> It feels like butter on my skin and has a very subtle, lovely honey smell :)</li>
            <li> and it works for both of use better than any other cream.</li>
            <li> so finding a product that handles my dry skin but is not greasy has not been easy.</li>
            <li> I have been going through it pretty quickly since I apply it twice daily to my face, and then daily to my decolletage and belly (pregnant).  </li>
            <li> Honestly after applying it to various parts of my skin, it felt quite dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few natural skin products and this is easily my favorite!</li>
            <li> absorbs very quickly but still leaves skin very dry</li>
            <li> I am a huge stickler for completely non-toxic products and had given up on buying any commercial moisturizers--I can feel the chemicals and a lot of them have fragrance, which I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li> have been using this product on the areas where the skin is almost impossible to moisturize and it has had a wonderful effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I turned super red.</li>
            <li> Plus, my skin looks dewy and vibrant.</li>
            <li> have very dry skin and this rubs in easy and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue that normal lotions sometimes leave on.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of using this daily, we have noticed a major transformation occurring for about the past week, with it looking better and better every day.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> It has been life changing and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It really calms the irritated skin and it is not heavy or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I can see myself in a product from use, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick</li>
            <li> I have acne issues and super sensitive skin and using this product, I actually witness my acne shrink and go away!</li>
            <li> As an additional point, my husband uses this on his tattoos (new and one) and he LOVES it.  </li>
            <li> As I felt a new cyst coming in under my skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clearing it up real quick to unbelievable .</li>
            <li> I used it three or four times a day at first and felt immediate relief, even though the irritation came back after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I need to give it more time?</li>
            <li> I usually have to apply lots of cream until it feels hydrated but with this one I put on one layer and my skin immediately felt better.  </li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s eczema is nearly all gone!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Honeyskin on my face for the past two weeks and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> When she gets &amp;#34;Winter itch&amp;#34; she uses a small dab and like magic the itch is gone.</li>
            <li> I am a 58 year old female with mature, sensitive skin; a tricky combination for product success.  </li>
            <li> Based on these short-term results, I&#x27;m expecting new skin to be completely clear of acne and signs of rosacea.</li>
            <li> but Honeyskin smoothed and soothed those dry ares on my babies immediately and showed improvement right away.</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised to find it not greasy.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the seller reaching out and sending an e-mail with FAQs and stuff to help us understand how the product works, and how it will benefit the different skin conditions we are using it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every natural, home remedy known to man, nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> ones marked sensitive.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Also this cream is so natural you could eat it</li>
            <li> So far</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way, but I&#x27;m going to have to order more since my husband has started using it as well and loves it for his dryness problems.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about this product, wow!</li>
            <li> Its an interesting combo of very simple and natural while still feeling expensive and high tech.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using Honeyskin daily, my skin is almost completely clear of any signs of rosacea or acne.</li>
            <li> I also use this religiously on my frequent bug bites and it makes the itch go away almost instantly.</li>
            <li> it really quick unbelievable</li>
            <li> (occasionally I&#x27;d clear it up with various face products but they always made my skin splotchy red, would cause flareups with the rosacea, or were so dying I&#x27;d end up with flaky skin).</li>
            <li> It does flare up very briefly (for a minute or two) when I first apply it, but then it dies down.  </li>
            <li> The day I got this in the mail, I happened to have really puffy dark circles under my eyes due to not sleepiing much the night before.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, smooth on the skin, and the natural (fragrance-free) scent is reminiscent of chocolate and honey once it has warmed on your skin.</li>
            <li> I can really tell that it absorbs further into my skin than other lotions.</li>
            <li> ; I believe it&#x27;s because some of my makeup was previously being absorbed by my dry skin, which now doesn&#x27;t happen as the cream has sufficiently hydrated it.  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to be very dry and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> So then I tried it on my chronically dry hands and they are now soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from super dry and Rosanna with a small spot of psoriasis.</li>
            <li> also live in a very dry climate so my lips get dry.</li>
            <li> It will take a very long time for this product to run out - you only need a tiny bit on your fingertip to have enough for your face - but when it does, I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> The skin softening effect seems to last for several days, long after the product is washed off.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well with little dry time.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> so I think it will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> The dryness around my eyes which has been a bother for a long time, disappeared by the third day.  </li>
            <li> a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed is the very subtle and natural smell -</li>
            <li> I have used other forms of Manuka Honey medical, from medical supply for open wounds</li>
            <li> Its the only thing that has helped our baby&#x27;s dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> It actually heals dry skin.</li>
            <li> I get dry patches on my face in different areas.</li>
            <li> For the first few minutes, it seems to make my skin slightly redder.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight odor that does not bother me and I am very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> This cream is very luxurious and thick.  </li>
            <li> But after 15 minutes or so, it seems to absorb into the skin, the extra redness goes away and the skin ends up considerably less red than before it was put on.</li>
            <li> I had eczema on my eyelids and had tried other products (even prescription) to heal the red itchy areas and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I look forward to testing it on my dry skin and lips during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This cream has also helped soothe my dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I was using coconut oil on my legs every morning but by the afternoon they would be dry again.</li>
            <li> Also handled my really dry elbows.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 days on these dry areas and they are now gone.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> The organic dry skin repair crean from Honeyskin Organics is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin gets dry every easily(especially my ankles and elbows).</li>
            <li> For any of you that get flare ups with the systic like acne and really dry chin and nose  </li>
            <li> I can put my makeup on with out  dry peeling skin underneath it.</li>
            <li> Its soft, even, firmer, and the size of my pores have decreased considerably.</li>
            <li> and it really helps get rid of the dry, tight skin feeling that I usually have after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> The dark circle that had the cream on it was about 70% smaller than the one without the cream.</li>
            <li> Honeyskin reversed the wintertime problems I have with dry hands!  </li>
            <li> I use it on dry patches on my face, and my elbows too!</li>
            <li> It is truly a cellular regenerative cream, matches the PH of your skin at precisely 5.5 - very difficult to find that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of this product.</li>
            <li> next morning no more red marks</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> suffer from psoriasis and very dry skin which is itchy and scaly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it less than a week and have used it on my face mostly for I was desperate to get my rosacea flare up under control.</li>
            <li> It has even helped a little bit with my facial dermatitis!</li>
            <li> did use it as a night ream last night because I though it felt a bit heavy for daytime.</li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t trying to use it there, I just rubbed the last bit after putting it on my arms into my hands for a few days.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the thickness was going to mean it would be too heavy for daytime wear, but I found that is NOT the case!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways, it is very thick, but it is very creamy also and just melts into your skin.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this cream</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been acne prone, oily in some parts and a dry flaky mess in others.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews of Honeyskin, I thought I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream on the basis of some of the other reviews here on Amazon as I was having dryness and itching around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I started using it on other itchy parts of my body</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using this on my baby that is due in the fall.</li>
            <li> No oily or any other residue.</li>
            <li> Would like to know of their other products</li>
            <li> Other creams take 3-5 days to make them go away</li>
            <li> ONE application, after weeks of trying other stuff.  </li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t have any skin issues, it just gives you this glow that you can not find in any other product out there.</li>
            <li> have really dry skin behind my ears and I&#x27;ve tried numerous creams, prescriptions and products to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> and I am also using less make-up</li>
            <li> My scars are less visible</li>
            <li> Have used everything from Aveda and Dr. Spiller to over the counter products and while some seemed to work a little; none produced the results I&#x27;m seeing with</li>
            <li> Giant pores, old acne and a few bad decision scars...</li>
            <li> I have serious dry skin and from day one this has helped.</li>
            <li> However, it did flare up my Rosacea skin after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I waited a few minutes to see if I would have to apply another layer</li>
            <li> Even my elbows stopped feeling dried out after rubbing the cream into them.  </li>
            <li> It has little to no smell, absorbs rapidly and doesn&#x27;t leave a slick, greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> They all made my face worse, so I just went without and used no moisturizer which made my skin beyond dry.</li>

            <li> With the wind and heat lately, my daughter and I have gotten some serious dry skin!  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on the both of us, and it has quickly and totally alleviated the itch and healed the skin!  It has some great ingredients in there, which is one of the main reasons I bought it, and it also is scent-free!  It soaks in and leaves our skin feeling super smooth.  No sticky or oily mess!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product. Honestly after applying it to various parts of my skin, it felt quite dry afterwards. I am sure that living in the dry NW part of the country may not help. I will most likely not buy in the future and will look for something more emollient.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really bad eczema so I purchase this cream for her. I will continue to use it  on her skin. As with everything it takes time and everyone body are different.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was just what my skin needed. It feels very smooth when I apply but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. Absorbed right into my skin and my face felt very soothed after.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It feels like butter on my skin and has a very subtle, lovely honey smell :)</li>
            <li> I had a rash on my fingers and this cream made it go away and helped with the itching right away!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!! I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This cream is fabulous.  It is so smooth and creamy.  It feels like clouds or whipped cream.  It is nice and thick so you can feel how much it is moisturizing.  I use it in the morning after I wash my face and it really helps get rid of the dry, tight skin feeling that I usually have after washing my face.  A little bit goes a long way with this cream so I think it will last me a long time.  As an additional point, my husband uses this on his tattoos (new and one) and he LOVES it.  He said it really helps keep them fresh and bright looking!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizing cream! The day I got this in the mail, I happened to have really puffy dark circles under my eyes due to not sleepiing much the night before. As an experiment I put the cream under one eye to see what it would do. I came back to the bathroom about 10 minutes later and was AMAZED! The dark circle that had the cream on it was about 70% smaller than the one without the cream. I mean, I literally could measure the difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;I also live in a very dry climate so my lips get dry. I decided to try this cream on my lips instead of lip balm and after two treatments my lips were perfect again.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my husband bought me a super expensive ($150)  moisturizing cream for Xmas but I think this Honeyskin does a better job! I would def buy this again and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> My HoneySkin Cream arrived very fast - in just a couple of days. It came with helpful information on skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVED this cream! I have very dry skin so finding a product that handles my dry skin but is not greasy has not been easy. HoneySkin is thick and creamy so I was pleasantly surprised to find it not greasy. It is easily absorbed into the skin and has a slightly sweet or honey scent that dissipates. I have been using it twice a day on my face for almost a week now and have noticed improvements in the dryness of my skin. I have used quite a few natural skin products and this is easily my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have been trying different lotions/moisturizers and this product instantly helped a rash I had for days go away in a matter hours! It helped my overly dried skin from warm weather, washing hands frequently etc to feeling nice and moist again. I also tried it on my face and my cracked feet! I love this this cream for my whole body! It even helped my sons diaper rash!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I use it all the time for my face and body and it&#x27;s super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product didn&#x27;t help my rosacea at all. The moment I put it on my face I turned super red. My face burned. Also, I tried to find the website of the company and it doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li> Have been using this moisturizer exclusively (as the directions recommend) for about ten days.  The dryness around my eyes which has been a bother for a long time, disappeared by the third day.  The redness on my cheeks is fading and overall, my skin feels better than ever.  I am a 58 year old female with mature, sensitive skin; a tricky combination for product success.  Have used everything from Aveda and Dr. Spiller to over the counter products and while some seemed to work a little; none produced the results I&#x27;m seeing with Honeyskin.&lt;br /&gt;It is my sincere hope my finicky skin will continue to drink up the goodness in this product.  Thank you, Honeyskin!</li>
            <li> Wonderful had a cut or scrape healing it really quick unbelievable ,also I have eczema and it&#x27;s clearing it up real quick to unbelievable .</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for about a month now and I think it is a great product. I had eczema on my eyelids and had tried other products (even prescription) to heal the red itchy areas and nothing worked. After reading other reviews of Honeyskin, I thought I had to try it. I used it three or four times a day at first and felt immediate relief, even though the irritation came back after an hour or so. I did get helpful advice/tips from the company telling me I would need to use Honeyskin more in the beginning so I knew what to expect. I really appreciated the additional instructions. After maybe four days, my condition cleared up. I still use the cream in the morning and at night for moisturizing. I have also used it on a bad itchy spot from a tick bite and it helped with that.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again. I look forward to testing it on my dry skin and lips during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars for the texture of the cream and it goes on so easily. My face was not as moist as I thought it would be after an hour of application.  However, it did flare up my Rosacea skin after a few uses.  Too bad.  I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Few things that we like a lot about the Haneyskin cream:&lt;br /&gt;first of all, organic ingredients, for our family it is must since we use only organic products.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly its fragrance free, my wife is very sensitive to any perfumes so this cream works great for her, also her skin is very sensitive and it is hard for her to find a good organic cream that does not irritate her skin, this face cream calms her skin!&lt;br /&gt;The Honeyskin cream has texture of heavy whipped cream that absorbs very fast for flawless none shine looking skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love Honeyskin. First of all it&#x27;s non toxic! Secondly it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s handled my twin babies eczema. I&#x27;ve tried lots of products but Honeyskin smoothed and soothed those dry ares on my babies immediately and showed improvement right away. It&#x27;s a must have product for babies and for Momma too!  Honeyskin, is an excellent soothing cream for rashes, itches, eczema, any kind of dermatitis actually, burns, minor cuts and wounds, as well as dry skin, wrinkles, puffy eyes, etc It is truly a cellular regenerative cream, matches the PH of your skin at precisely 5.5 - very difficult to find that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream on the basis of some of the other reviews here on Amazon as I was having dryness and itching around my eyes. It relieved my eyes and I started using it on other itchy parts of my body - I found it to be very effective in relieving itching and adding moisture. A little does go a long way, but I&#x27;m going to have to order more since my husband has started using it as well and loves it for his dryness problems. It has a very slight odor that does not bother me and I am very sensitive to fragrances. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> We were so happy to be introduced to this product. Its the only thing that has helped our baby&#x27;s dry skin patches. It was getting so bad we didn&#x27;t know what to do. Within one application there was a huge difference by the second application that evening the patches vanished. This cream has also helped soothe my dry chapped hands. I would recommend every family have a jar in their house!</li>
            <li> Very nice cream.  Not oily at all at all yet it lasts all day for me.  It has even helped a little bit with my facial dermatitis!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer it feels nice on my skin and its organic and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, thick cream! My skin is sensitive and it was great for me. I especially like to use it at night before bed in my face, feet and elbows. I love all the natural ingredients too, a big plus!</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel moisturized at all. I use it in the morning and at night. As soon as I apply the cream it soaks right into my skin and it feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One good thing is that it lessens the appearance of my pores. Not sure if I need to give it more time? It&#x27;s been maybe 10 days since my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works on more than just roseacea! Rashes of most any kind and hives too.</li>
            <li> We love this, the whole family uses it. It really calms the irritated skin and it is not heavy or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  There is no offensive odor, it leaves no tacky or sticky feeling, and it absorbs right into my skin.  I love this cream.  Will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> This can is fabulous on my very sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t make me greasy or broken out at all like a lot of moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> It really softens your skin. It is not oily and over time it puts moisture back. It actually heals dry skin. I like that it&#x27;s organic and it&#x27;s one product for the whole family. Another great thing is that it&#x27;s multi purpose, one jar for the entire body!  Very nice product!!</li>
            <li> I just got this cream but so far it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used. I like that it really has no scents or added junk. I feel totally comfortable putting it on myself and my son. Looking forward to using this on my baby that is due in the fall.</li>
            <li> I like this cream for my face.  I even use it as after shave.  I find it lowers the redness that I have had for years (low grade rosatia).  Its non greasy and moisturizes all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I got it for my husband, who had a rash-type condition on his hand. After a couple weeks of using this daily, we have noticed a major transformation occurring for about the past week, with it looking better and better every day. I also appreciated the seller reaching out and sending an e-mail with FAQs and stuff to help us understand how the product works, and how it will benefit the different skin conditions we are using it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super light and fluffy, and leaves the skin feeling incredibly moisturized, without a heavy or greasy feel to it like many creams leave. I am very impressed with this product and love using it!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not over scented, love that it&#x27;s organic ingredients do I know what&#x27;s absorbing into my skin. Also leaves my skin nice and soft and moisturizer, not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty awesome. It feels great and light on my skin, and even the small jar lasts quite a while. I was using coconut oil on my legs every morning but by the afternoon they would be dry again. With this cream, my legs stay moisturized all day. Also handled my really dry elbows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of body creams that smell like Cocoa butter. It is very thick. It is necessary for me to mix it with water and or body oil. I&#x27;ll keep using it. However, no reordering for me.</li>
            <li> I loved this cream from the first time I put it on.  I have been using it as my facial cream.  My skin tends to be very dry and very sensitive.  I usually have to apply lots of cream until it feels hydrated but with this one I put on one layer and my skin immediately felt better.  I waited a few minutes to see if I would have to apply another layer but it wasn&#x27;t necessary.  I also have noticed a difference applying my foundation makeup after using this cream.  My foundation seems to cover my face better now and I am also using less make-up; I believe it&#x27;s because some of my makeup was previously being absorbed by my dry skin, which now doesn&#x27;t happen as the cream has sufficiently hydrated it.  Needless to say I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! It&#x27;s hydrating and thick and it was like my skin was drinking it up. Definitely gave me a healthy glow. I need to buy some more!</li>
            <li> Works great for my rosea!</li>
            <li> Shipping must have been the fastest ever, the product was at my door within 24 hours!&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is the very subtle and natural smell - obviously nothing articial added. It goes on very easy, the skin drinks it up immediately! No oily or any other residue. It then leaves skin wonderfully smooth and hydrated. Feels great even right after shaving, when my skin is extremely sensitive and most other creams cause irritation, feel stingy and leave red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Will buy again and again.  I have tried..so many.&lt;br /&gt;my tone is more even..I love this cream.  Would like to know of their other products</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I use it on my face and my husband and son have been using it to help with their eczema issues. It feels so lightweight yet really moisturizing. A little goes a long way. Really happy with this product and highly recommend for those with dry skin or those looking for a lightweight face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product....great organic ingredients, which do wonderful things for one&#x27;s skin...highly recommended. I am a holistic health practitioner, so I am very picky about what products I recommend. This one is 5 star.  Karen@HealthyLifeAdvisors.org</li>
            <li> I use this cream twice a day and have 3/4 gone.  Some improvements but not earth shattering.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I have never been happy with any other face cream like this. I break out easily and this doesn&#x27;t do that to me. I will definitely be keeping this in stock.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer! I have a couple areas of super dry skin, I don&#x27;t think it is psoriasis or anything else because a good very rich cream usually works great if I remember to use it twice or 3 times a day. I have used this for 2 days on these dry areas and they are now gone. Other creams take 3-5 days to make them go away completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grand-daughter got out and got bug bites on her this weekend so we tried this after a bath, worked like a charm, no more itch, next morning no more red marks left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use it as a night ream last night because I though it felt a bit heavy for daytime. After using it one time last night I believe it would work for daytime also. A little goes a long ways, it is very thick, but it is very creamy also and just melts into your skin. It is much softer, smooth, not oily, no residue left, feels good and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My jar does day 100% organic, cruelty free, not tested on animals. I have used other forms of Manuka Honey medical, from medical supply for open wounds and I know it heals like nothing else will. When I seen the honey in this product I just had to try it and it didn&#x27;t let me down. I will be keeping a jar of this on hand at all times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. I received no monitory compensation and I am not required to give a good review. I am also not associated with the seller in any way. This disclosure is in accordance with Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.

            <li> I&#x27;m editing my review to give this five stars. The first time I applied this to my legs it made them itchier for some reason but maybe it was because I had just shaved. Anyway, now I am using it for my face and also for eczema on my legs and hands and it helps so much. It really calms the itching and my skin looks better and doesn&#x27;t feel as cracked and dry, and I love that it sinks into the skin instead of just sitting on top of it like a lot of other ointments and creams I&#x27;ve tried for my eczema. This is a really great product and even if you have oily skin it will not make it worse.</li>
            <li> This really worked for me. I am fighting rosacea and I have seen marked improvement using Honeyskin and it does not have a bad odorr and it is not greasy or oily on your skin.</li>
            <li> Works great. After I got a surgery removing my keloid scars, My surgeon told me to rub petroleum to prevent any keloid scar from forming and swelling. I wanted to find a more organic formula that can hydrate like petroleum. I read in a site that honey is great for post- surgery treatment because it&#x27;s antibacterial and rapidly heals wound. Been using it for a month, so far so good, no keloid has form. My skin feels softer and smoother. It has a light- pleasant fragrance and I love the ingredients. Would highly recommend it to people who are keloid prone or anyone wanting a great and beneficial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> All the girls in my family suffer from excema but it was only recently that I erupted with the family curse. Desperate for a cream that didn&#x27;t aggravate the condition, I tried this one. I love the fact that honey is one of its main ingredients and that it is a totally pure product. It works great on the excema, but the more I use it--on my legs, hands, and even face, the more I like it. It has little to no smell, absorbs rapidly and doesn&#x27;t leave a slick, greasy feeling on your skin. My skin feels like it&#x27;s being nourished! I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about this product, wow! Helps with dry skin and acne prone skin. Does not cause me to breakout. I am in love!</li>
            <li> Expensive and did not work at All for me</li>
            <li> The organic dry skin repair crean from Honeyskin Organics is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from psoriasis and very dry skin which is itchy and scaly.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product on the areas where the skin is almost impossible to moisturize and it has had a wonderful effect.&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced a huge difference in the itching and irritation from both conditions since beginning to use Honeyskin.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for home testing and an unbiased review and I think it is one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;It contain only Organic and  Anti-oxidant  ingredients and makes my skin feel and look years younger.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer!  Completely fragrance free, not oily at all so it absorbs really well. Very thick and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin and this rubs in easy and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue that normal lotions sometimes leave on.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This made my skin redder not better, it also made my skin itchy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would work, BUT I&#x27;m sold.  We&#x27;ve been trying to get to the bottom of what&#x27;s causing my daughter&#x27;s eczema, but meanwhile I needed something that would give her skin relief.  I&#x27;ve tried every natural, home remedy known to man, nothing worked.  Someone recommended I try this stuff, so I ordered it.  After only one application my daughter&#x27;s eczema is nearly all gone!  ONE application, after weeks of trying other stuff.  So then I tried it on my chronically dry hands and they are now soft and supple.  This stuff is crazy good!!!!  I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream! I can really tell that it absorbs further into my skin than other lotions. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes but I think it would works better when the roseate is calm and perhaps it&#x27;ll prevent another breakout. It does moisturize very well and I&#x27;ll continue to use it. I have to pay more attention to my triggers.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product! My skin gets dry every easily(especially my ankles and elbows). First off, I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor,  I did think it was going to smell more like honey, or have a sweeter smell to it than it actually did, but that is ok with me since we have sensitivity to strong smells in my home. Secondly, it goes on the skin very smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy or oily which is great, I don&#x27;t like to feel like my skin is oily from a product, I normally steer clear from ones who feel greasy. Third, it makes my skin feel very moisturized and look great! It absorbs very well with little dry time.&lt;br /&gt;I  do think the packaging is very appealing to the eye, a lot of people judge an item based on how it looks and the reviews they can find through the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer - I received this item at a reduced cost from the manufacturer to give my honest and nonbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Finally a moisturizer that does everything it advertises.  I have always had sensitive skin and mild rosacea. I never could use soaps or lotions with fragrance because they irritated my skin. I bought this for my face and was so HAPPY I can use all over.  It works everywhere.  Great for after shaving legs and other sensitive areas. Now I have no reaction to the shaving. My rosacea rash is gone.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream.  This will be my moisturizer hopefully for the rest of my life. I am 56 and you definitely have to take care of your skin. This is also my first review I have ever written about a product.  Love the personal connection to the company. They really care about the product and your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has helped with the sagging skin around my jawline and neck.</li>
            <li> Great cream. It is not too greasy, it is smells very nice. It feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I got it for my wee one who has super sensitive skin. If I see a rash starting, I just put this on it and by the next morning it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I waited to give a review to see what i experienced. And I have to honestly say, that I saved a trip to the dermatologist.  There was rash I was wanting to get rid of, and it went away after using this twice a day for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to use it for my rosacea and my daughter&#x27;s excema. Happy to say it has been great for both. I use it every day on my rosacea and it has definitely tamed the red.  It does flare up very briefly (for a minute or two) when I first apply it, but then it dies down.  A noticeable improvement in appearance, smoothness, and softness in the month I&#x27;ve been using it.  It&#x27;s also the only cream my daughter (age 9) will use on her excema, because she says it doesn&#x27;t sting like the others.  It is very, very smooth and emollient - a tiny bit goes a long way.  I totally love it.  Even if you don&#x27;t have skin issues, it&#x27;s a fabulous moisturizer and a wonderful value considering the quality and how little of the product one has to use each time.  (Note: the sellers have contacted me multiple times - to provide tips on use and perhaps to offer a discount on a further purchase - but I haven&#x27;t responded.  I honestly really, really do love this cream.)</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Organic Dry Skin Repair Cream - Natural Facial Moisturizer works great for me.  I get dry patches on my face in different areas. Especially in the summer heat. It&#x27;s  smooth and creamy and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong medicine smell. It makes my face feel so soft and smooth. My complexion had also lighten. Honeyskin is also great for rashes, itches, eczema, dermatitis, burns, minor cuts, and wounds. A household most have</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I have untreated rosacea and no over the counter products worked well - even ones marked sensitive. They all made my face worse, so I just went without and used no moisturizer which made my skin beyond dry. This has worked wonders to improve my complexion, get rid of the rosacea bumps, reduce redness and moisturize.</li>
            <li> My name is Taylor, not James :D (Under my bf&#x27;s account). This lotion is incredible! It makes my face feel so soft and refreshed. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and actually moisturizes! I have acne issues and super sensitive skin and using this product, I actually witness my acne shrink and go away! It works amazingly on stretch marks and scars! I use it, not just on my face, but all over! I seriously recommend this product!</li>
            <li> OMG, this stuff is amazing.  My friend turned me on to it and my skin looks amazing.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it&#x27;s working for me.  They shipped it out immediately to me and I am extremely happy with the price.  Thanks again for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> This skin cream is creamy, silky, and non-greasy.  It absorbs beautifully into the skin, leaving it hydrated and feeling refreshed.  When I did a test on the backs of my hands, it was obvious which hand had received the cream because the skin was so obviously more hydrated and healthy looking.  Even my elbows stopped feeling dried out after rubbing the cream into them.  The ingredients are all natural and organic, it&#x27;s fragrance free, and not tested on animals.  It is all together a wonderful body cream, one that I do not hesitate to use on my sensitive skin and the sensitive skin of my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I suffer from super dry and Rosanna with a small spot of psoriasis. I have used this for a couple days and have already noticed a difference. What made me want to try this is 1. It&#x27;s 100% organic. 2. unscented and 3.non-greasy. This works better than the high priced eye cream!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Honeyskin reversed the wintertime problems I have with dry hands!  Excellent product and totally safe!</li>
            <li> I will not be buying this again. It was 25 before and now it&#x27;s 100 when the bigger size is cheaper. Thats borderline robbery.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin cream I have ever used! I love it as a body cream because it adds the right amount of moisture without leaving a greasy feeling. I also use it as face cream in the morning under my makeup and at night before I go to bed. I have naturally dry skin and dark circles under my eyes. The cream helps to even out my skin and blemishes and reduces the tired-eye look. It feels great on and the more I use it, the more I can see the difference in the health of my skin. It smells heavenly too!</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used! I have serious dry skin and from day one this has helped.</li>
            <li> My face is getting better every time. I have being using this product for a while and this product do the job as it promise. Don&#x27;t clot my pores and don&#x27;t make my face oily. I have a combination skin (T) and my face looks great with no blackheads or acne. My rosasea is almost gone. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more... Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The texture of this cream is really luxurious! It moisturizes better than coco butter. Its an interesting combo of very simple and natural while still feeling expensive and high tech. It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve used it for several things but the most impressive was getting rid of some redness on our baby&#x27;s butt after a bout of diarrhea. Two applications and it was GONE! :)</li>
            <li> My skin has always been acne prone, oily in some parts and a dry flaky mess in others. Giant pores, old acne and a few bad decision scars...it was always one problem after another. Years ago I went the all natural route and have spent hundreds trying products, but have never found the perfect moisturizer until now!&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. I could tell a dramatic difference after just one day of using it morning and night after cleansing. Now after a week, I feel like I have someone else&#x27;s skin. Its soft, even, firmer, and the size of my pores have decreased considerably. My scars are less visible and I&#x27;ve had no breakouts. I&#x27;m trying not to do one of those fan-freak-out reviews but this lotion was a game changer for me. I use nothing else but undistilled alcohol free witch hazel toner. Its not heavy or greasy in the least and wears beautifully under powder or liquid foundation, although my skin has never looked better bare. For the awesome unique ingredients and the large jar size, im extremely pleased with the price. Couldnt be happier! THANK YOU HONEYSKIN, you guys are THE BEST!!</li>
            <li> So Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry skin behind my ears and I&#x27;ve tried numerous creams, prescriptions and products to get rid of it.  This is the only thing that calms my skin.  I really appreciate that it is organic and I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of chemicals on my skin.  It has a light feel and does NOT have an obnoxious smell.  Great for face and hands too!</li>
            <li> not as great as the reviews let on. doesn&#x27;t do anything for me really. absorbs very quickly but still leaves skin very dry so im applying this almost every hour.</li>
            <li> the best cream ever. it saved my face from ros&amp;aacute;cea acne and dryness. I would buy it again definitely</li>
            <li> Ordered from Amazon and the lotion jar came damaged. I found it at a local shop and I purchased it. I used it on my face and neck and it turned it bright red. Looks almost burned and it itches. Now I have a huge red mark on my neck. Not good!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this cream! It smells so good, and makes my skin so soft! I use it on dry patches on my face, and my elbows too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Honeyskin on my face for the past two weeks and absolutely love it. My skin is sensitive, with mild rosacea, and I&#x27;ve had mild acne for over a decade (occasionally I&#x27;d clear it up with various face products but they always made my skin splotchy red, would cause flareups with the rosacea, or were so dying I&#x27;d end up with flaky skin). After two weeks of using Honeyskin daily, my skin is almost completely clear of any signs of rosacea or acne. Plus, my skin looks dewy and vibrant. Based on these short-term results, I&#x27;m expecting new skin to be completely clear of acne and signs of rosacea. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you have rosacea and this does not seem to be helping, stop using any facial cleaner and simply use warm water followed by HoneySkin.</li>
            <li> This cream smells and looks like what I remember of pond&#x27;s cold cream and so I was worried about putting it on my face, since I have very sensitive skin that reacts strongly too fragrance and breaks out in either acne or rashes if irritated. But I promised to try this cream so I used it for a few days on my arms, and I was surprised after the third day that the stubborn dermatitis which lives on my left hand was completely gone. Here&#x27;s the thing, I wasn&#x27;t trying to use it there, I just rubbed the last bit after putting it on my arms into my hands for a few days.  I&#x27;m going to try it on my face now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a discount on this product so that I could try it and offer my honest opinion on it.</li>
            <li> For the first few minutes, it seems to make my skin slightly redder. But after 15 minutes or so, it seems to absorb into the skin, the extra redness goes away and the skin ends up considerably less red than before it was put on. The skin softening effect seems to last for several days, long after the product is washed off. No scent. Doesn&#x27;t made the skin &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing! I have noticed a significant change in the beauty and elasticity of my skin. It looks and feels younger. :-) I also use this religiously on my frequent bug bites and it makes the itch go away almost instantly. Plus it smells delicious. It also doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on the skin, which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just ordered more of this for my fianc&amp;eacute;. She loves this stuff. Says it&#x27;s the only body lotion she can also use on the face without causing any kind of breakouts. She said it&#x27;s awesome on razor burns and soothing. The seller was great and answered all my questions.</li>
            <li> AAAAAmazing  product. I&#x27;ve had it less than a week and have used it on my face mostly for I was desperate to get my rosacea flare up under control. For any of you that get flare ups with the systic like acne and really dry chin and nose  you can relate to how quick it spreads like wild fire and  awful I takes you feel. As I felt a new cyst coming in under my skin. After the first night I used it. My face just soaked up all that greatness in the cream and the cyst coming thru felt smaller and the others that were already  on my face seemed smaller. I recommend  getting their cleanser also. After a week of this product my face is smoother. I can put my makeup on with out  dry peeling skin underneath it. The redness I know will take sometime but I can tell my face is heeling. The Honeyskin Compaq has the best customer service  I&#x27;ve ever had. They contact you directly and happily answered some of my questions. I will update in a month or so with hopefully  even more results.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural cream I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;m so happy I found it! My sister originally introduced me to it. You can use this cream anywhere and for anything and it doesn&#x27;t even matter what skin type you have. My sister has oily skin and I have more dry skin and it works for both of use better than any other cream. Also this cream is so natural you could eat it and it wouldn&#x27;t harm you which is why I&#x27;m also using it with my baby if she needs it.</li>
            <li> So far so good, smells good, feels great! I have mild rocacica so it will probably will need time.</li>
            <li> This is a very mild, non-greasy cream. It feels comfortable on the face or legs (my primary uses). I like that it has no real scent, just a light pleasant slight scent. I have been using it for about two weeks and it works very well. Would recommend to others</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, it do a great job keeping my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great overall moisturizer. So far I don;t see that it has any real affect on ecxema or psoriasis but it is hydrating and feels nice. It is organic so I use it on my face, hands, elbows - any place that need extra moisture. I&#x27;m pleased with the package, the smell and creaminess. It&#x27;s not sticky even though it has honey in it. I will definitely purchase their products again.</li>
            <li> Woah! This feels SO GREAT on my face!! At first I thought the thickness was going to mean it would be too heavy for daytime wear, but I found that is NOT the case! My face DRANK IT RIGHT UP! It feels so moisturized!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I use it for everything! It has made my scars disappear, my face brighter, and has just made my overall skin tone more even. My friends and I all call it the magic cream. It has been life changing and I highly recommend it. Even if you don&#x27;t have any skin issues, it just gives you this glow that you can not find in any other product out there. Please try it for yourself, you will love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice item!!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used.  I use it on my face and body and it absorbs really well and never feels heavy.  I am a huge stickler for completely non-toxic products and had given up on buying any commercial moisturizers--I can feel the chemicals and a lot of them have fragrance, which I can&#x27;t stand.  This product is simple, non-toxic, and makes my skin feel smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!! My wife has gone to skin doctors for years and they have prescribed all kinds of creams and lotions, some work and some don&#x27;t. With Honeyskin she has quit using all of them. When she gets &amp;#34;Winter itch&amp;#34; she uses a small dab and like magic the itch is gone. She has never felt or looked better.Thank you so much for your wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Phil Hocott</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It is very thick, smooth on the skin, and the natural (fragrance-free) scent is reminiscent of chocolate and honey once it has warmed on your skin. It will take a very long time for this product to run out - you only need a tiny bit on your fingertip to have enough for your face - but when it does, I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Exceptional customer support. The fact that these people make personal contact with customers in a world that has become so automated means  a great deal to me. For years I have suffered from eczema triggered by allergies and I&#x27;ve been forced to use cortisone creams. Never Again will I be using a steroid on my skin !  I&#x27;ve already tried all of the non steroid creams from the pharmacy which contain oat and they irritated my skin and made the eczema worse. . Honeyskin relieved my symptoms the very first day. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it as a face cream yet but I think it will work well for that too. It isn&#x27;t your usual moisturizer. You won&#x27;t feel an oily film on your skin but you will see an improvement that rarely if ever comes from using the water based creams. I do recommend this product for multiuse skin care and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This cream is very luxurious and thick.  I have been going through it pretty quickly since I apply it twice daily to my face, and then daily to my decolletage and belly (pregnant).  I like how it feels and it rubs in very quickly.  The only thing that isn&#x27;t my favorite is the fragrance - which from what I gather is all-natural, so that&#x27;s awesome.  But it has a scent of cocoa butter to me and I am not a big fan of that smell.  Just me though, I&#x27;m sure other people love it.  Overall a really nice cream.</li>
