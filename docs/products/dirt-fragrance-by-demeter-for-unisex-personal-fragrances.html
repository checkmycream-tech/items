            <li>the smell...is impressive.</li>
            <li>When I heard that \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot; was the best selling fragrance by Demeter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really very lovely!</li>
            <li>It smells incredibe and makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>Demeter seems to have a good exchange policy</li>
            <li>For my own pleasure not to attract attention.</li>
            <li>but I tested it and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells like soil after a nice summer rain.</li>
            <li>I thought I was on Candid Camera.</li>
            <li>my own fault for taking a risk on something called dirt :)</li>
            <li>I think, honestly, this is a love it or despise it type frangrance.</li>
            <li>This is a very unique, amazing perfume, but I pass on spraying it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, an interesting experience.</li>
            <li>I love Demeter frangrances.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving this I immediately sprayed it in the air to smell, and fell in love.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>does more for you, than for those you come in contact with...</li>
            <li>I figured that even if she didn&#x27;t love the scent, she could put it out as a conversation piece.</li>
            <li>smells more like metal than anything, else, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of dirt and the smell that Dirt is putting out.</li>
            <li>This fragrance isnt for everyone its more of a novelty item.</li>
            <li>If you love the outdoors and gardening, you will love it, and if you are unconventional, even better.</li>
            <li>I have had lots of compliments on this nice, light, refreshing sent.</li>
            <li>This smells more like EARTH than dirt.</li>
            <li>I love it but can see how others would not.</li>
            <li>The biggest concern might be how people around you might react, even though you love it yourself.</li>
            <li>I would call it interesting but it may come off as unsophisticated or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When my Siamese cat smelled it on me, he became very excited and lifted his tail.  </li>
            <li>Very unique.</li>
            <li>This was a win as far as gifts go.</li>
            <li>is actually very strongly of is if you are in your garden and buy fresh soil from the hardware store and are working closely with that soil.</li>
            <li>So in that sense this is a very unique product and thats cool</li>
            <li>The bottle shipped with it was fine.</li>
            <li>She did of course enjoy the scent, though.</li>
            <li>liked the fast shipping  </li>
            <li>The box smelled fabulous</li>
            <li>This cologne really does smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Its original and</li>
            <li>However I do still like the scent of Dirt by Demeter and it is so unique its something I cannot stop smelling.</li>
            <li>Because this was advertised for men and women, I thought it would be good, even though I could only guess what it would smell like.</li>
            <li>This one smells like dirt but with a sweet something about it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having it available!</li>
            <li>I loved this initially, but my enjoyment has waned since..</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t explain it, except that I love it.</li>
            <li>Demeter could charge far more for its fragrances, but fortunately for me, they don&#x27;t.....</li>
            <li>If you like light, more natural smells this may be the one for you.</li>
            <li>This starts out overpowering but quickly fades into mild scent.</li>
            <li>They mostly have a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; smell and not a commonly perceived scent.</li>
            <li>In the cool down stage it becomes a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>but they are fun.</li>
            <li>It smells like a garden-dirt exactly w a touch of a sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>Ever wanted that fresh out of the grave smell?</li>
            <li>then it could mix in with your body chemicals to produce an accompanying fresh lift without it being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice, crisp, earthy smell.</li>
            <li>When you first spray this its comes off as freshly dug dirt in the backyard.</li>
            <li>though Im not fond of that exactly) you&#x27;ll like this..  </li>
            <li>so I will try to send it back to them in exchange for grass (which I do love),</li>
            <li>It really smells like a fresh bag of potting soil.  </li>
            <li>This product smells nearly exactly as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>would definitely suggest it to anyone who likes to play in the dirt :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled actual dirt plenty of times and while it can have a memorable scent when working in the garden, I would have never dreamed of spraying the stuff on as a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Demeter has a cult following and most customers mix these scents.</li>
            <li>I would hesitate to wear at an interview or first date because it may be a polarizing scent.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and very masculine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as an eau de parfum but is nice and lightly uplifting.  </li>
            <li>It most certainly does smell like dirt, but with a hint of sweetness, almost a vanilla, but it&#x27;s really not discernible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get to play in the dirt much anymore, but this scent reminds me of when I did.</li>
            <li>really does smell like dirt!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>This cologne is very upsetting to me..</li>
            <li>I love earthy scents but this reminds me more of a stale, musty basement than fresh dirt.</li>
            <li>Me, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I wanted  thanks anyway for letting me try it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I used the normal amount that I usually use for cologne and it stunk up my office good after application.</li>
            <li>, it can start to smell as though you&#x27;ve just left your hot yoga class instead of your hot shower</li>
            <li>or so you don&#x27;t really smell it unless you put your nose directly to where it was sprayed.</li>
            <li>However, it is a huge bottle, so spraying it multiple times throughout the day will barely put a dent in it.</li>
            <li>For those of you with more sensitive noses it smells like very loamy dirt, but with just a very slight chemical hint</li>
            <li>asked for this because it doesn&#x27;t rain a lot where I live now, and this cologne makes me smile!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my number one scent and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>Discovered this stuff a few years ago at Whole Foods, but went back for more</li>
            <li>love to smell this on my husband everyday!</li>
            <li>while I don&#x27;t personally like the way it smells as a perfume, I appreciate the thinking-out-of-the-box creativity that created this perfume in the first place.  </li>
            <li>- like when you first open a bag of potting soil.  </li>
            <li>The only con is that it wears VERY close to the skin.</li>
            <li>There is a spicy undertone that I do like, but the initial \\&quot;Hey this is dirt!\\&quot; is what seems to cling longest and is very one dimensional- like a basement.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, it smells just like I have been out working in my garden turning the soil, the only thing missing is the smellof the kiss of the sun.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes of all time simply for it&#x27;s uniqueness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for women or men who want to sweeten up the fragrance a little bit, I mixed Dirt with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Possibly because I live in nyc and miss the outdoors?  </li>
            <li>Where I live in MN our soil smells way differently than this.</li>
            <li>OK, this is a very hard review to write.  </li>
            <li>it is a clean, soothing and subtle hint of an earthly fragrance without the edges of patchouli or musk......</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Where I live in MN our soil smells way differently than this.</li>
            <li> OK, this is a very hard review to write.  </li>
            <li> it is a clean, soothing and subtle hint of an earthly fragrance without the edges of patchouli or musk......</li>
            <li> I took a risk based on the positive reviews, popularity, and my past experiences with Demeter not realizing this is a final sale item.</li>
            <li> The sents don&#x27;t last as long as oils or the finer perfumes/colognes</li>
            <li> My only thought was that he must have been reminded of the wet dirt outside where he does his business.  </li>
            <li> I have smelled a few other Demeter fragrances, and this one really stands out.</li>
            <li> You might think that would be a bad thing, but it truly is quite amazing.</li>
            <li> one spray is all it takes, so this lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it turns out, Demeter was able to make the impossible possible.</li>
            <li> When I thought of a cologne called \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot; I was imagining a manly earthy musk type situation, but ultimately similar to other cologne styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mysterious and earthy, with slight floral hints.</li>
            <li> However after a little while I think I&#x27;m starting to like</li>
            <li> This is a common issue with Demeter however, and the bottle is larger so reapplication is no big deal for me.</li>
            <li> The brute of the dirt plus the fluff of the banana - smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> I am so intrigued, I&#x27;m going to buy the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> who knows, I was rather obsessed at first)</li>
            <li> this is not a run of the mill cologne, so make sure to try it out before you buy or you could really hate it.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of incense a little and the smell of trees.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re in trouble.</li>
            <li> The scent hangs close to the skin - very little projection.</li>
            <li> think the trick may be to use very little.</li>
            <li> you use very little</li>
            <li> Wish I could find the lotion they made in the past.</li>
            <li> Still not sure if its a woman or mans cologne</li>
            <li> I mean, it smells like you picked up a handful of loam and spread it all over yourself.  </li>
            <li> Vaguely soil-like in smell.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really stinks.  </li>
            <li> It smells like dirt, but does not smell dirty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We had a family present swap and it had to begin with the letter D. Because this was advertised for men and women, I thought it would be good, even though I could only guess what it would smell like. It is a fragrance that lasts a LOOOOOOOOng time, so if you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re in trouble. My family was so-so about the smell. Like wine, though, it improves with time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really stinks.  I guess I was foolish to order this.  I just wanted to try something different.  When my Siamese cat smelled it on me, he became very excited and lifted his tail.  My only thought was that he must have been reminded of the wet dirt outside where he does his business.  All in all, an interesting experience.</li>
            <li> I use the Demeter fragrances for ME! For my own pleasure not to attract attention. I spray them on when I want a lift. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m getting low on my bottle of dirt and have to think about ordering more. It smells incredibe and makes me feel good. I don&#x27;t get to play in the dirt much anymore, but this scent reminds me of when I did. AAAAAhhhhhhh!</li>
            <li> I love Demeter frangrances. The sents don&#x27;t last as long as oils or the finer perfumes/colognes but they are fun. This one smells like dirt but with a sweet something about it. If you didn&#x27;t tell anyone the name of it, let them smell it and then tell them the name of the fragrance I bet they&#x27;ll say \\&quot;Oh yeah, I smell it!\\&quot; I have Tomato and Grass and they smell like their names too.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this I immediately sprayed it in the air to smell, and fell in love. It&#x27;s such a nice, crisp, earthy smell. My partner asked me what the smell was, and when I said \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot; he yelled out \\&quot;It really does smell like dirt!\\&quot;  You might think that would be a bad thing, but it truly is quite amazing. The only con is that it wears VERY close to the skin. After about 30 min or so you don&#x27;t really smell it unless you put your nose directly to where it was sprayed. However, it is a huge bottle, so spraying it multiple times throughout the day will barely put a dent in it. I have smelled a few other Demeter fragrances, and this one really stands out.</li>
            <li> You have to smell it to understand!  Discovered this stuff a few years ago at Whole Foods, but went back for more and they had stopped carrying it.  Thanks Amazon for having it available!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. I add patchouli to it and I am set to go!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it. I keep buying it. Wish I could find the lotion they made in the past. The aroma last longer in the lotion.</li>
            <li> Demeter could charge far more for its fragrances, but fortunately for me, they don&#x27;t..... Dirt is a mellow, earth-tone fragrance.... and is definitely not for the flamboyant type.. it is a clean, soothing and subtle hint of an earthly fragrance without the edges of patchouli or musk...... does more for you, than for those you come in contact with...</li>
            <li> This cologne is very upsetting to me..the smell...is impressive. It&#x27;s smells so putrid but unlike any vomit inducing smell i have ever sniffed. So in that sense this is a very unique product and thats cool i guess. DONT SPRAY IT IN YOUR KITCHEN11&#x60;~~!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this perfume is for everyone but I tested it and liked it.  Possibly because I live in nyc and miss the outdoors?  It smells like a garden-dirt exactly w a touch of a sweet smell.  Reminds me of incense a little and the smell of trees.  Still not sure if its a woman or mans cologne but if your into things that smell similar to patchouli(even though Im not fond of that exactly) you&#x27;ll like this..  Its original and I smell it throughout the day on my wrist for aromatherapy purposes.</li>
            <li> I took a risk based on the positive reviews, popularity, and my past experiences with Demeter not realizing this is a final sale item. I love earthy scents but this reminds me more of a stale, musty basement than fresh dirt. There is a spicy undertone that I do like, but the initial \\&quot;Hey this is dirt!\\&quot; is what seems to cling longest and is very one dimensional- like a basement. Demeter seems to have a good exchange policy so I will try to send it back to them in exchange for grass (which I do love), my own fault for taking a risk on something called dirt :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my friend who does landscaping. I figured that even if she didn&#x27;t love the scent, she could put it out as a conversation piece. She did of course enjoy the scent, though. It&#x27;s really very lovely! She says she had friends try to guess the scent, and they were guessing florals. I am amused! This was a win as far as gifts go.</li>
            <li> Vaguely soil-like in smell.  smells more like metal than anything, else, it&#x27;s just okay. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  It really smells like a fresh bag of potting soil.  The scent hangs close to the skin - very little projection.</li>
            <li> love to smell this on my husband everyday! one spray is all it takes, so this lasts a long time. have had this almost 6 months and havent even used 1/2 the bottle!</li>
            <li> OK, this is a very hard review to write.  Did it smell like dirt?  OMG, it smells like dirt!  I mean, it smells like you picked up a handful of loam and spread it all over yourself.  Hence the three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next question: Do you want to smell like Dirt?  Me, not so much.  I love the smell of dirt and the smell that Dirt is putting out. This is a very unique, amazing perfume, but I pass on spraying it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I don&#x27;t personally like the way it smells as a perfume, I appreciate the thinking-out-of-the-box creativity that created this perfume in the first place.  I am so intrigued, I&#x27;m going to buy the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  Maybe you can spray it on your garden floor?  Then your dirt will smell like Dirt!</li>
            <li> Larger bottle than I&#x27;m used to.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as an eau de parfum but is nice and lightly uplifting.  Thunderstorm is similar to this scent.</li>
            <li> I loved this initially, but my enjoyment has waned since.. If over applied (or maybe too often.. who knows, I was rather obsessed at first), it can start to smell as though you&#x27;ve just left your hot yoga class instead of your hot shower</li>
            <li> This product smells nearly exactly as I had hoped.  For those of you with more sensitive noses it smells like very loamy dirt, but with just a very slight chemical hint - like when you first open a bag of potting soil.  It is not flowery at all.&lt;br /&gt;I asked for this because it doesn&#x27;t rain a lot where I live now, and this cologne makes me smile!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely suggest it to anyone who likes to play in the dirt :)</li>
            <li> Theree is something about the dirt smell that is taboo. When you first spray this its comes off as freshly dug dirt in the backyard. It doesnt project well on my skin after about 5 minutes it moves closer to the skin. In the cool down stage it becomes a pleasant scent. This fragrance isnt for everyone its more of a novelty item.</li>
            <li> know I did not like it I sent it back  liked the fast shipping  but it was not what I thought  I wanted  thanks anyway for letting me try it</li>
            <li> This is my number one scent and cannot live without it. Ever wanted that fresh out of the grave smell? This is where it&#x27;s at. You can creep out your friends or make strangers second guess your origins with this dirt scent. It&#x27;s mysterious and earthy, with slight floral hints. This says for men, but I beg to differ, recommended for both genders, for all occasions!</li>
            <li> This bottle leaked all over inside the box. The bottle shipped with it was fine. The box smelled fabulous</li>
            <li> It smells like soil after a nice summer rain. Very unique. If you love the outdoors and gardening, you will love it, and if you are unconventional, even better.</li>
            <li> Demeter does it again! I love this cologne, it smells just like I have been out working in my garden turning the soil, the only thing missing is the smellof the kiss of the sun. If you like light, more natural smells this may be the one for you. I have had lots of compliments on this nice, light, refreshing sent.</li>
            <li> When I heard that \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot; was the best selling fragrance by Demeter I thought I was on Candid Camera. I&#x27;ve smelled actual dirt plenty of times and while it can have a memorable scent when working in the garden, I would have never dreamed of spraying the stuff on as a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, Demeter was able to make the impossible possible. This cologne really does smell amazing. It most certainly does smell like dirt, but with a hint of sweetness, almost a vanilla, but it&#x27;s really not discernible. I really can&#x27;t explain it, except that I love it. It smells like dirt, but does not smell dirty. It smells clean and very masculine. One of my favorite colognes of all time simply for it&#x27;s uniqueness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for women or men who want to sweeten up the fragrance a little bit, I mixed Dirt with [[ASIN:B000XE46KS Banana Flambee By Demeter For Women. Pick-me Up Cologne Spray 4.0 Oz]] and find the mix to be quite tasty. The brute of the dirt plus the fluff of the banana - smells like heaven. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Demeter has a cult following and most customers mix these scents. When this scent is mixed with Tomato...you will smell as if you were done gardening in the summertime. They mostly have a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; smell and not a commonly perceived scent. This smells more like EARTH than dirt. We use them at our spa and I have a larger collection at my home. Mixing several scents at once is as close to a Willie Wonka experience as you&#x27;ll ever get!</li>
            <li> I imagine that some areas do have dirt that has this scent. Where I live in MN our soil smells way differently than this.However I do still like the scent of Dirt by Demeter and it is so unique its something I cannot stop smelling. I think, honestly, this is a love it or despise it type frangrance. I love it but can see how others would not. The biggest concern might be how people around you might react, even though you love it yourself. I use it sparingly, or along with Paris, and it works well. This starts out overpowering but quickly fades into mild scent. The only issue is it does need reapplication every couple hours, it has no staying ability. This is a common issue with Demeter however, and the bottle is larger so reapplication is no big deal for me. I wear this occaisonally.</li>
            <li> When I thought of a cologne called \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot; I was imagining a manly earthy musk type situation, but ultimately similar to other cologne styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this smells like is actually very strongly of is if you are in your garden and buy fresh soil from the hardware store and are working closely with that soil. I can&#x27;t decide whether I like it or not but it&#x27;s definitely different and not at all mechanical/chemical smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the trick may be to use very little. I used the normal amount that I usually use for cologne and it stunk up my office good after application. However after a little while I think I&#x27;m starting to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use very little then it could mix in with your body chemicals to produce an accompanying fresh lift without it being overpowering. At this very low level I think I find it quite pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it all depends on what you are wearing it for. I would hesitate to wear at an interview or first date because it may be a polarizing scent. I would call it interesting but it may come off as unsophisticated or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary this is not a run of the mill cologne, so make sure to try it out before you buy or you could really hate it.</li>
