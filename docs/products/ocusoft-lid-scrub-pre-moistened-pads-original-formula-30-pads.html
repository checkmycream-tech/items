            <li>I find these pads to be a perfectly adequate substitute for the foam.</li>

            <li>My lids feel fresh and no longer itch</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you would like to get the puffiness out of your eyes, but I do not recommend for every day because it does leave your eyes tired, like a light soap would.</li>
            <li>They do the job (help keep her lids and lashes clear of crust) and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love the individual packages as they travel well.  </li>

            <li> These are the easiest way to use Ocusoft while traveling.  Would be nice to be able to afford them but for everyday use they are too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you would like to get the puffiness out of your eyes, but I do not recommend for every day because it does leave your eyes tired, like a light soap would. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these a few times and find them effective for removing dark, waterproof eye makeup. I will order again when needed</li>

            <li> I have very dry, sensitive eyes.  My eye doctor introduced me to this product and I use it every morning to cleanse my eye lids.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> Love the individual packages as they travel well.  Do an excellent job of cleaning without any eye irritation.  Also bought cleanser from dispenser but have not used it as I keep coming back to these pre-moistened pads.</li>
            <li> These are great.  My husband has allergies, winds up rubbing his eyes and irritating them.  We use these when our eyes itch, which keeps dirty fingers out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, recommended by my opthamologist.  He told me that many eye problems were caused by poor cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was super quick.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  Great price.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Expensive little swabs for your eyelids. The price is probably for the packaging and promotion, can&#x27;t be for the product itself; flat gauze pad and a damp solution-probably like a no-tears shampoo. Easy to use, but I do wonder about the price/benefit. Also, they&#x27;re hawked by the eye docs at Costco. Maybe they get a commission?</li>
            <li> I have used Ocusoft Lid Scrub for a few years. It cleans and exfoliates the eye area. This is the best price I have found.</li>
            <li> As soon as I get home from work I use one of the pads.  I love the way the pre-moistened pads remove my eye make-up &amp; help make my eyes feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Good product at a more reasonable price compared to my local drug stores.</li>
            <li> very good product - ordering through amazon makes always having them on hand much easier as i use them daily.</li>
            <li> I have an eye medical condition brought on by allergies. An opthamology tech suggested I try these to help. I haven&#x27;t needed a drop of prescription medication since using them in over two years! It clears oils and debris from eyes and lashes and was a miracle find.</li>
            <li> and it does it very well indeed!! It does as well as any product on the market for this problem.</li>
            <li> It works very well, I have been usint Systane, and am trying Ocusoft because of the price</li>
            <li> Good for travel. Keep several in my flight kit. No TSA worries and space is minimal. A rinse with water is required. I use the Original Foam on a daily basis per recommendation of my optometrist. I find these pads to be a perfectly adequate substitute for the foam.</li>
            <li> I like the price better than Cliradex, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective.</li>
            <li> I always believed eye make up remover did the job.  Little did I know it did not.  My lids feel fresh and no longer itch</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to.  When I use these consistently my dry eye problem goes away.</li>
            <li> I clean my glasses every morning with these cleaning pads.</li>
            <li> I tried this on the recommendation of my otphthalmologist; it was listed as one among several possible relief remedies for dry eye. Previously, I was usuing only eye drops.  Despite my initial skeptism, I found that this actually helped to relieve the dry eye symptoms.  I would recommend using it daily before bed.</li>
            <li> As I live in a very hot and dry climate and have allergic eyes to dust, this product works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this exact product at Walmart because my eye doctor recommend it.  It was 8.99.</li>
            <li> I found them at my eye doctor&#x27;s office.  After trying them, I ordered them on Amazon.  They are great for cleaning your eyes.  They don&#x27;t burn, and they are easy to use and disposable.</li>
            <li> Very good - I checked with my ophthalmologist and she highly recommends them.</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry eyes after LASIK. I use once or twice daily, especially in the afternoon when my eyes are tired. Also removes eye makeup very well without burning my eyes. I did as another poster suggested and cut the strip in half. That&#x27;s still plenty to clean each eye without material going to waste. I&#x27;ll continue using these for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Not very big and don&#x27;t work as well as other makeu[ removers!</li>
            <li> great every time i use them</li>
            <li> These wipes have provided so much relief for my dry eye condition, Highly recommend giving them a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried eye drops, eye washes, restasis, all offer only temporary relief. Using these twice a day has allowed me to be able to wear makeup again which I could not do before.</li>
            <li> This does what it says it will do but the packages are awkward to open and I can keep some Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo in the shower and get the same results for a lot less.</li>
            <li> Great price, great delivery!</li>
            <li> My optometrist told me to use these for dry eyes in addition to using eye drops. They work well and are helping quite a bit. Once I bought the more expensive ones of the same brand, thinking they would be better. However, they were drier and did not seem to do any more than a plain pad. These are the best.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use and highly effective. I cut each pad in half, so they last twice as long.  I would recommend these to anyone who has problems with burning or irritated eyelids.</li>
            <li> It is very practical, especially when you are travelling. I am used to the foam, but the pads worked just fine as well.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> soothing on the eyelids and does the trick for cleaning the area.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re prone to chalazions, using these lid scrubs is a great way to keep your lids clean and help prevent recurrences.</li>
            <li> Been using these pads for years at the insistence of my eye doctor, but local stores have jacked up the price so I was glad to find them on Amazon at a decent price. They do the job every time.</li>
            <li> Works great and very gentle on my eyes.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Before using Ocusoft Lid Scrub, I was using a cleaner together with cotton wools to clean my eyelids.  This product is like a wet tissue and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> My eye specialist told me to use Ocusoft lid scrub every night. My blepharitis has been stable since I started using these.</li>
            <li> Works well, and is great for travel. At home I use them occasionally though I usually use Baby Shampoo and cotton pads.</li>
            <li> These pads really helped my husbands  eyes.</li>
            <li> After a visit to the eye Dr. I was told I had a eyelash infection.... Go figure, how does that happen? I really do not get all dolled up anymore but I do get dressed up to a point (means dress pants and not sweat pants) and did my face as well. You know the eyes, etc, Never was much on makeup but I do the works once in a while. I guess I had a bad eyelash mascara, If your make up is old Throw It Away..... Anyway my Dr. recommended this product and I use it all the time now. My infection is gone but these pads are great. Another tip wash you eyelashs with baby shampoo, Remove your makeup with baby shampoo, its great does not burn your eyes and is gentle for you face.</li>
            <li> These are great for long trips to clean up the eye area.  Good for alleviating mild blepharitis.</li>
            <li> This was recommended before cataract surgery and works great, just follow directions to make sure it is rinsed completely.  Pre-moistened pads are much more convenient than mixing other form with water</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered!</li>
            <li> Be careful it will burn when it gets in your eyes. Crazy for an opthalmic preparation!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT. KEEPS MY EYES FEELING GOOD.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years!  It removes eye makeup and those little &#x27;sleepers&#x27;, and it&#x27;s completely painless!  I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> We use these per our ophthalmologist for our 2 year old. They do the job (help keep her lids and lashes clear of crust) and are easy to use. No complaints!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I can use to remove my eye make up.  Everything else irritates my eyes!</li>
