            <li>More convenient than a razor!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor but a lot better than any electric shaver!</li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it should do and works wonderfully well at it.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I know that it works great on peach fuzz and fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>I certainly did not expect this to work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I could get a &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34; on discount or possibly free lol.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that the shaver works so well without any pain and leave a smooth skin afterward.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>No No as I would never spend that kind of money for a hair removal product.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with how gentle and effective this is.  </li>
            <li>This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Purchased in April 2015 &amp; still loving it in December 2015.</li>
            <li>Every razor, every pre-shave rub and every post-shave treatment has had its own set of side effects...</li>
            <li>I consider it a nice gadget to have in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>Works nice and Quite..TY</li>
            <li>Gives a nice, close hair removal</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove hair at all, of course, it would have to stay on longer than 5 seconds to be effective.</li>
            <li>Probably is not as good as many electric shavers.</li>
            <li>My eye brow trimmer does a better job at a good shave than this piece of junk</li>
            <li>If you are using it on longer hair say on your arms or legs then the original head works great.</li>
            <li>is a great device to have for a quick touch up between shaving.</li>
            <li>lol  RETURNED quickly</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and its really does what they advertise</li>
            <li>This by far is the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The lighted front is handy so you can be sure you missed no stray hairs.</li>
            <li>Works good on my arms as for the legs not so smooth like with a razor</li>
            <li>I have upgraded to a Tria laser and remain hopeful that it will be more effective.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and no burning hair smell!</li>
            <li>I would find an alternative that is more effective, even if it costs more.</li>
            <li>It sounds very convincing and fancy with the light but not even close to the price.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great to use first to shorten the hairs.  </li>
            <li>This is just a very cheap electric razor that doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the product is nice and slim and fits easily in your hand when using it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and for the price</li>
            <li>I feel a lot better using this than a razor.  </li>
            <li>Product is ok.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be just the perfect present.</li>
            <li>: I was expecting better results with this tool.</li>
            <li>The YES is more money and does not work as well.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>I was able to see and get all the hairs removed safely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>You would be better off to buy the No No</li>
            <li>Much better price to another item that I had to no, no to because of the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not, this is a razor with a light!</li>
            <li>They say safe for skin, no nicks.</li>
            <li>I have MORE stubble than I did BEFORE I used this thing.</li>
            <li>yeah, definitely the best purchase of my life!</li>
            <li>Glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>Now I say NO to razors :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My legs , ok.</li>
            <li>I had tried them all for many eons.</li>
            <li>it looked more like scales.</li>
            <li>Just follow the directions, and you should love it too.</li>
            <li>This hair remover has been perfect for my daughter, she no longer has the itchy red bumps and she can shave anytime, not just in the shower.</li>
            <li>I received this Finish Touch Yes as a free sample to test and offer my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Works ok but does not always remove stuble.</li>
            <li>anyone giving more than 1 star is paid to do so.  </li>
            <li>I wrote it at a free will and the opinion expressed in this review is solely my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;M ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH THE BROTHER REPLACEMENT ITEMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would love this YES as well.</li>
            <li>to many devices</li>
            <li>Took a year of me using it about once a month (changing the head once) and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I like the way the motor starts when you touch your skin and shuts off when it isn&#x27;t touching anything.  </li>
            <li>I allowed it to charge over night just to be sure.</li>
            <li>Touching up a wax while fixing your make up for the day.</li>
            <li>I am sure you can find one here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not a close cut but better than using a blade.</li>
            <li>Read reviews before purchasing and am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they came out with this product...</li>
            <li>does a better job than NO-NO</li>
            <li>Read directions and make sure you shave at a slant.</li>
            <li>; technology is nothing more then a flashlight on the end of a piece of junk, lower powered, electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I sit on top of paper towels (undressed) while watching tv</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>just a razor with a pen light!  </li>
            <li>I love this and use it a lot.</li>
            <li>Surely they&#x27;ve heard of these things called germs.  </li>
            <li>so sure about the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>Should have paid more attention to others&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>works better than no no</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>she is extremely pleased; no pain whatsoever;</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It must have some kind of a motion sensor in it that turns the light and the motor on when it nears the skin.</li>
            <li>Ok, ok.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I&#x27;ve got it.  </li>
            <li>I Love this.</li>
            <li>so when I got an opportunity to try it out and review it I was very excited.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about this product because I prefer doing all grooming in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>Pain free and easy!</li>
            <li>and I must say this new YES is a great improvement.</li>
            <li>I was pleased when I received it, it was so easy to use</li>
            <li>If you are looking to cut long hair and leave stubble then this is perfect but not if you want a nice clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It is okay, but it is not what the commercials make it sound like.</li>
            <li>The light is nothing more than a sensor for when the head gets close to the skin.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished and was glad to have a smooth chin even though it had taken longer than I&#x27;d anticipated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100x better than shaving, and stays smooth for days longer.</li>
            <li>product creates a smooth surface my makeup looks so much better</li>
            <li>Best money I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using other Finishing Touch products I can say this one is impressive.</li>
            <li>It is just a cheap electric razor with light bulb attached to the end.&lt;br /&gt;Light a $20 on fire and punch yourself in the face 5 times, you&#x27;ll be better off.</li>
            <li>It is easy to replace the heads once you read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the Yes about 3 weeks ago &amp; found it extremely easy to use</li>
            <li>easy to order.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making removing hair so easy.</li>
            <li>YES is nothing more than a cheap flimsy electric razor with an LED light on it.  </li>
            <li>no blades to deal with, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has a compact design, fits in my purse or desk drawer without drawing attention, and it&#x27;s easy to re-charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and easy to carry around if you are traveling.</li>
            <li>it does how ever work good on armpits not tried on legs yet but the main reason I bought it was for face</li>
            <li>It also is excellent for trimming the bikini area without pulling any of the hairs, just wipe the blades down with rubbing alcohol after you use it in the bikini area to keep it sanitary.  </li>
            <li>it could get fine stubbly hairs on my chin area though</li>
            <li>and it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>It does work fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine to me.  </li>
            <li>I think it works fine</li>
            <li>Tried it on my arm (fine hair)</li>
            <li>I applied some lotion and after about 10 minutes, my face felt and looked fine.  </li>
            <li>I think I had better success than others because I read the instructions in detail.  </li>
            <li>Nothing fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is simply a cheap electric razor/trimmer with a light.  </li>
            <li>This item was advertised to remove hair, leaving a smooth skin surface.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt my face so smooth since I was thirteen</li>
            <li>I was sent a free sample product to test out before writing this review.</li>
            <li>but I thought the so-called light technology had something to do with it.  </li>
            <li>This does not leave skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what the light on it is for.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for writing a review</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>I have to say it is cheaply made but it work.</li>
            <li>My chin is soo smooth after use.</li>
            <li>But not quite as smooth.</li>
            <li>so prefer the smooth silky feel of the microfoil head.</li>
            <li>It is sleek, lightweight and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>received one free unit for review purposes.</li>
            <li>This turned out to be a cheap, low-end electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap answer to no-no</li>
            <li>I was happy with the performance of it as is.s say that to use the included foil head on stubble, but I didn&#x27;t find that necessary.  </li>
            <li>in video is royalty free</li>
            <li>I removed the cap and pressed it against my leg and the LED light came on</li>
            <li>I bought yes through their offical website before it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange of writing a review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a razor with a light.</li>
            <li>The light on the Touch</li>
            <li>It leaves your legs smooth.</li>
            <li>The light also helps a lot.  </li>
            <li>Nice product compared to one costing almost 10 times as much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped, but still far better than a razor, I am more than satisfied</li>
            <li>leaves skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Just smooth skin on face.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It has a light that helps me see.</li>
            <li>Just received the YES and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>so far, as good as I&#x27;d hoped&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li>I used it for my most intimate areas and I am smooth as a baby!</li>
            <li>This is a great little razor does pretty good</li>
            <li>That makes it super easy to use anyplace on the body.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to learn.  </li>
            <li>Oh my this is everything it says it is took all the peach fuzz off my face and left it so very smooth no nicks or cuts no bumps I&#x27;m living this so much and would recommend it To everyone who deals with peach fuzz on their face it also works great on your arms</li>
            <li>I love it, but you should be aware of what your expectations are, and what purpose you will be using it.  </li>
            <li>So far very pleased.....</li>
            <li>Instead, you get \\&quot;introducing the world&#x27;s first full-body hair remover made just for women to feel clean and sexy</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t figured out yet how to clean it.</li>
            <li>Safer than a razor, but not as clean of a finish.</li>
            <li>You must first make sure it has a full charged.</li>
            <li>it really is pane free love it.</li>
            <li>This is just another shaver, nothing special at all.  </li>
            <li>And, there is nothing special in this razor &amp;#34;sensing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Her hair is fine, and it takes it right off with no snagging or pulling on the hairs.  </li>
            <li>The ads are true.  </li>
            <li>It does cut hair fairly well but is not totally painless.  </li>
            <li>I loved it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li>Works so good that I bought a 2nd for a friend!</li>
            <li>This world is full of fraudulent advertising...</li>
            <li>This product beats tria home laser that I used for two years without full hair removal.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good product and bought it for half the price as the no no :)</li>
            <li>easy to use and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is nothing more than a light and it is barely helpful for that.</li>
            <li>I am educated enough to understand a user manual :) but magic didn&#x27;t happened.  </li>
            <li>She reports that it worked better than many earlier reviewers here have stated, so</li>
            <li>I trust Fran Drescher because I am one of her biggest fans and have followed her extraordinary life and career.  </li>
            <li>this point, I am PLEASED with my purchase &amp; will be back once I have used it for longer &amp; have a better idea of the ups &amp; downs of the</li>
            <li>/&gt;DELIVERY WAS QUICK ON THESE ITEMS.  </li>
            <li>Just mild stinging on my legs.</li>
            <li>The device worked well and charged quickly.</li>
            <li>It works very well is easy to use and only takes minutes for good results</li>
            <li>When I bought it I paied for the deluxe edition witch came with buffer pads that made the stubble almost completely gone when used on my skin right after using the yes.</li>
            <li>I got these for my two teenage daughters and they both are very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>was the Remington smooth and silky it works like a charm and the price is thrilling ( tweazy) look under trust me</li>
            <li>; light does absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li>On my first try I got a 100% smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty good, but I end up needing to use it every 2-3 days because hair comes back quick.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and so much cheaper than getting  a wax</li>
            <li>It is easy fast and painless.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and trims really well</li>
            <li>that yes, I read all instructions, fine print, legal jargon,</li>
            <li>that yes, I read all instructions, fine print, legal jargon,</li>
            <li>this is a cheap razor that does not shave very closely.</li>
            <li>It also has a light on it, so you can really see the hair you are trying to shave off.  </li>
            <li>The light on it does absolutely nothing, besides inform you when the razor touches your skin.</li>
            <li>I just received it a couple of days ago,  but I have used it  a couple of times and so far I enjoy it!</li>
            <li>I am leaving my open and honest opinion on my experience with this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>So far it seems okay on my face.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not afraid of people getting close.  </li>
            <li>That product was successful down to 3 stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>I have used other items on unwanted hair and never have I gotten such wonderful results.</li>
            <li>You therefore don&#x27;t have to be right close to a plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right before my wedding (in 1981), I decided to have electrolysis to end the problem once and for all.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>This device is easy to use, painless, and effective for the purpose I have used it for so far, eliminating facial area peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>I received this free to review, and I can see that some of the prices on Amazon are pretty high.  </li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to change and it includes a little brush which make cleaning very easy.</li>
            <li>I think they are trying to fool people into thinking it is a new light technology that cuts or removes hair, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw this, I thought that it was an epilator, one of those things that will yank your hair right out of its socket.</li>
            <li>And the width of the head is narrow and a bit curved: It takes many more strokes to get the job</li>
            <li>I like this very much.  </li>
            <li>Three weeks ago was the first time I used it and the hair was very light growing back.  </li>
            <li>tried it just a little seems to work pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>Start with the longer cartridge first and then use the stubble cartridge.  </li>
            <li>I only used it once but love it thank you</li>
            <li>the trimmer - even with no guard - doesn&#x27;t cut shorter after the first pass.</li>
            <li>but I learned what I paid ($39.99) was more than the regular price plus shipping combined, so I indeed paid for shipping - had to pay to return it as well.  </li>
            <li>This is simply a pretty but over prices razor.</li>
            <li>I managed to nick myself TWICE the first time I used</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchase at your discretion but be aware that you&#x27;re buying a</li>
            <li>When you turn it on nothing happens at first.</li>
            <li>I was a bit scared at first</li>
            <li>I does exactly what it says it suppose to do...</li>
            <li>It is suppose to be fully charged before your first use.  </li>
            <li>All these people are wrong this product is the best!!!</li>
            <li>the yes works much better than smwlly creams or regular razors</li>
            <li>I have told pretty much everyone I know to get one!</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL and is really fast!</li>
            <li>Upon first use I said this is bogus.</li>
            <li>Or for that person that is just to self aware to even consider a spa or salon for a wax.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to shave first before using.  </li>
            <li>Etc BEFORE my first use, and I followed all the directions perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Etc BEFORE my first use, and I followed all the directions perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>and it hurt so much!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried to use it on my face, the micro-foil head did not work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and no regrets !</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law bought this product, the Deluxe model, at Bed Bath and Beyond for $20 and returned it after 30 days with use by her, my wife,her husband, a son, and both our daughters, all with NO positive</li>
            <li>Love it so much that I&#x27;ve purchased another one to give to a dear friend as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I liked better, the burning sensation I had for three days or the scab like mess it left on my face for days after.  </li>
            <li>But I focused on the positive reviews &amp; decided I had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li>The light does not do much but if your like me and have super long legs and might miss a few spots, than I can say the light is more like a flashlight.</li>
            <li>it came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>After trying so many products and procedures without any success, it was a complete shocker that this simple product worked like it does.</li>
            <li>After trying so many products and procedures without any success, it was a complete shocker that this simple product worked like it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s probably best for people with really shaky hands, who often cut themselves with regular clippers.</li>
            <li>One of the main problems is it does not hold a charge, after charging for more than 12 hours it will only run about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a very decent product</li>
            <li>It had simple and easy instructions to get started.</li>
            <li>It is simply an electric razor with a pretty blue/purple light.</li>
            <li>I wax my lower legs and arms, but sometimes when I go outside, I see a missed area and this easily takes care of it.</li>
            <li>A large version of the mini finishing touch.  </li>
            <li>I certainly would not have bought one for my wife.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like tweezing on a large scale.</li>
            <li>but I can do my entire chin easily without too much pain.</li>
            <li>This little appliance is so handy and easy to use, if it spares me fretting about a single errant hair showing by the end of the day, it is everything I hoped for and far, far more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OBVIOUSLY nothing more than a super tiny electric shaver, yet that term, \\&quot;shaver\\&quot;, is nowhere to be found.  </li>
            <li>nice little cordless razor.</li>
            <li>I got it a few days ago and it has been AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I see a lot of negative reviews on this product, and it is just an electric razor with a light, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>The difference is that is it so incredibly gentle on the skin around the hair, the only evidence that you used it is smooth skin without stubble.</li>
            <li>The difference is that is it so incredibly gentle on the skin around the hair, the only evidence that you used it is smooth skin without stubble.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li>Now, the foil head does make it smooth for a short time, but I always have to use it again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep this in my travel bag because it does not take up much space.</li>
            <li>This product is just a electric straight razor.  </li>
            <li>The Device works very well.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like it as much as the ravers.</li>
            <li>I was very upset about how it worked.</li>
            <li>Very deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li>This makes me think that the designers are very thoughtful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my skin and it gently removes unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>but it had done so much damage to my skin</li>
            <li>It met all my expectations, so much so that I bought another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>It charges with the included wall charger, or on my USB phone charger, which is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close, not as close as a blade razor, but almost.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>I lost it to him after he got out of the hospital, he really wanted to keep it.  </li>
            <li>Unlike everything else I&#x27;ve tried, the Yes! is absolutely pain-free--no smell, no wounds, no scarring, no itching, no redness--</li>
            <li>Unlike everything else I&#x27;ve tried, the Yes! is absolutely pain-free--no smell, no wounds, no scarring, no itching, no redness--</li>
            <li>Light weight enough that it fits in my bag whether I am traveling or just a night out.</li>
            <li>I give this a 4 star because it really does work..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it much yet.</li>
            <li>Yes! has really been a life saver.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>It is ok, I guess not what I expected</li>
            <li>Perhaps I was expecting too much.</li>
            <li>It really removes the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Take a good men&#x27;s shaver, add a couple of extra options to it, make them pink or purple or whatever, or DON&#x27;T, and</li>
            <li>So far I have NO complaints!!!  </li>
            <li>The Finishing touch YES makes my skin (especially my face, which is the most important To me) softer than any other product.</li>
            <li>It did remove the hair on my arm but left stubble, it wasn&#x27;t a clean, smooth shave like the commercial says.  </li>
            <li>Neither head works as good as shaving, but they work very similarly to any other hair</li>
            <li>I found this out after I had ordered 2 replacement heads that I assumed would be the same 2 as the original, but when they arrived they were the identical trimmer heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What is really cool about this little unit is the Sensa Light Technology.</li>
            <li>I thought this was all the new technology hair remover, but it is like the rest of the battery operated facial hair removers, because the blue light technology thing is just a light and has no effect of helping to remove unwanted hair for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>The only way to clean it is with this itty bitty brush that catches in the screen and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal user BUT only for certain body parts.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I expected, but for a razor it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I use the trimmer head for long hair and the smooth micro foil head for touch ups or smoothing any stubble.</li>
            <li>Ok for facial hair, but it grows back very soon.  </li>
            <li>This little appliance is so handy and easy to use, if it spares me fretting about a single errant hair showing by the end of the day, it is everything I hoped for and far,</li>
            <li>I almost started crying because my face was smooth for the first time in 7 years!  </li>
            <li>It does a decent job.</li>
            <li>I like the Sensa light because it helps you see the hair follicles closer especially if you are in a dim lit room.</li>
            <li>although my main purpose was my face.</li>
            <li>for  what it is it works but hair comes back quickly</li>
            <li>I bought into the clever wording of the infomercial...</li>
            <li>It is meant to be used on clean, dry skin</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, the lighted tip does absolutely nothing, nor is there anything in the instruction book about it.  </li>
            <li>so far really wished they sold replacement pieces,  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t do a great job removing hair.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m definitely convinced this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I loved it when I first got it for Christmas but now 6 months later, it has worsened my chin hair problem dramatically and the charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish 1/2 a leg.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is shaver that trims ONLY very thing hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Target and I am taking it right back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not about to buy a new unit just to get a micro foil replacement head...</li>
            <li>I should have known better before buying this, it&#x27;s nothing new besides a fake light that makes the product show its &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is an electric shaver with a light, a rechargeable lithium ion battery and two separate heads, one for longer hair and a second one for short hair or stubble.  </li>
            <li>- it shaves worse than my cheap razors - leaves stubble/fuzz/hair - does NOT stop operating when lifted from skin as advertised - advertised with &#x27;free shipping&#x27; when I ordered</li>
            <li>it works like an electric shaver .....and not that effective and the battery does not last either...don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li>but my skin is very sensitive and if anything I feel like that&#x27;s an testament to how close the product gets the shave.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by this &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; hair remover.</li>
            <li>This razor cuts more skin than hair, moving roughly across my legs; however, it does not do a good job of cutting hair at the skin level.  </li>
            <li>but it is no where near the level of a No-No!</li>
            <li>So far it out-performs NoNo by a mile!</li>
            <li>And while I was ill at first for falling for the hype, I fell in love after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per instructions, I charged it for 2.5 hours.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it a 2nd star for the look because it looks cool, but for the performance of this product it should be one star.</li>
            <li>if any hairs were missed or not completely eliminated you can clearly see them with the light and go back.  </li>
            <li>The first trimmer doesn&#x27;t do much but gets your hair close to the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; stage and the second attachment removes the stubble so you&#x27;re left with a face that feels like you&#x27;ve just shaved - except no razor bumps or cuts!    </li>
            <li>The white or clear ones are more stubborn than the dark.</li>
            <li>Overall it works much better than the previous options that were used.</li>
            <li>(very hairy) back, and it left it pretty smooth but with a little stubble.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super small, super basic set of hair clippers that has a protective shell</li>
            <li>I love it to touch up the hard places to get with a razor like around your knees.</li>
            <li>I finally laid down on my bed in order to get the paralyzed arm high enough to be able to shave.  </li>
            <li>So, if you make the mistake of purchasing this item,  make sure that you return it immediately if it proves to be useless to you.</li>
            <li>This is a way better alternative to shaving with razors, painful lasering that takes way longer and costs more, or waxing.  </li>
            <li>do yourself a favor and steer clear of this product and this company</li>
            <li>I think we&#x27;re clear that we ALL were scammed on how this thing works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month and my facial hair is much thinner.  </li>
            <li>: The two heads are meant for shorter and longer hairs and they are really sensitive in regards to length.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is growing back twice as fast since using the product.  </li>
            <li>thanks Amazon returned policy it sent back</li>
            <li>It worked as designed, charges fine--if as she tells me a bit slowly--and so far has met her expectations.</li>
            <li>I used this product a few times and found it to be pain free and helpful when shaving.</li>
            <li>A cheap electric razor for not a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>I really want my money back.  </li>
            <li>I will be surprised to receive a refund.  </li>
            <li>Or, if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If I wanted a razor, I would have stuck with my Disposable Venus and some sensitive skin shave</li>
            <li>and I much prefer the microfoil head for use on facial hair.</li>
            <li>also charges quickly in a few hours and is cord free when in use.</li>
            <li>You do not want to use this in the shower or anywhere near water.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve passed menopause, I seem to have developed hairs on my neck and chin.  </li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>I say if you&#x27;re diligent with this AND a hair growth inhibitor cream like whish or prescription vaniqua or all natural tumeric paste, then go for it.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li>I have been fighting wiry chin hairs almost all my adult life.</li>
            <li>far more.ouch</li>
            <li>I have a problem doing sensitive spots</li>
            <li>Beats getting cut with razors and so far I have no problem with it.  </li>
            <li>Completely painless.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps people  should read complete details before writing reviews.  </li>
            <li>If a person don&#x27;t read instructions or complete details they should not get an item.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mom, I&#x27;m busy, and shaving just isnt a priority when my legs are covered.</li>
            <li>Wow, it&#x27;s the tiniest electric shaver ever with a headlight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d finish a complete marathon before I&#x27;d finish removing hair from my body with this thing</li>
            <li>Even my 4 year old daughter knows about germs.  </li>
            <li>Men get awesome, giant foil headed shavers that adjust to every contour imaginable for their faces, but somehow women are expected to meet the perfectly smooth whole-bodied expectations of those men with crap like this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking hair completely gone after running it over my leg one time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well the yes yes works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely painless.</li>
            <li>this gets an A+ from a 60 year old who was always fighting the peach fuzz on the face</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it, especially for facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Im not sure that it is what I was really looking for, but for a small, compact, cordless electric, razor its really good.</li>
            <li>It takes up a great deal of my time and just plain sucks.  </li>
            <li>Gave it to my wife for Christmas and she is extremely have with it, works much better then the more expensive hair removal systems</li>
            <li>Yes electric shaver to my Schick Hydro or my Gillette Venus disposable manual razors, I can mention few positive features: I can manage a dry shave where ever I may be--even in the dim light of the bathroom at work.</li>
            <li>The charging takes about 2 and a half hours for a full charge.</li>
            <li>To clean the heads there is a little included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way to REALLY clean these crappy little shaver heads.  </li>
            <li>That said, the only product I have found to be very useful with long lasting hair removal is an epilator.  </li>
            <li>The fine trimming end should be handled with care as I zipped off a small mole with it.</li>
            <li>Plus be aware they only offer a 20% refund with no return.&lt;br /&gt;Big Giant Rip!</li>
            <li>You can use it repeatedly, very slowly, and the light is simply a purple tinted regular light.</li>
            <li>Returned back highly overpriced item.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>so the battery charge lasts forever and it keeps the fresh charged cut feeling lasting very long.  </li>
            <li>but I can use this on very short stubble and it takes it completely off, leaving my face very soft.</li>
            <li>(just brush the eyebrows straight up, and trim the long ones).  </li>
            <li>This has a lot of potential but it doesn&#x27;t live up to the promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>,however it doesn&#x27;t really work for short short stubble like hair.</li>
            <li>No other appliance or treatment has even come close to the</li>
            <li>No other appliance or treatment has even come close to the</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with two heads, one that&#x27;s like a traditional set of clippers, which works on any hair growth, and another that only works when you press it down very firmly on light hair growth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money on razors before!!</li>
            <li>It works great on all areas without leaving the annoying red bumps on certain areas.</li>
            <li>You can get a Braun, Remington, Norelco, or other high-end shaver for the same price or less and it will do the job a thousand times better.</li>
            <li>It is simply a tiny battery operated razor with a small light.  </li>
            <li>and now I barely have stubble.    </li>
            <li>You actually have to get it near the skin for it to start working.</li>
            <li>GOT THEM MUCH SOONER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>Subsequently, no matter how much the tech backed off on the current, the result was always the same.</li>
            <li>No wet or cream required.</li>
            <li>Then, blah blah elegant, blah blah technology, blah blah a bunch of ridiculous words to make it sound like a piece of magic...its a super tiny shaver with a stupid light on it.&lt;br /&gt;One curious piece of info about this thing is that you are to NEVER get any part of it</li>
            <li>Apparently, water will damage them.  </li>
            <li>I spent 20 minutes doing practically my whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li>It dosent work.it barely cut the hairs</li>
            <li>Included is a tiny little brush and that is the ONLY way you are allowed to clean the heads.  </li>
            <li>The blade/comb actually held a lot of hair so there was no mess.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s mostly because I&#x27;m unable to raise my arm high enough to put shaver at the required angle.</li>
            <li>Good product, but I was disappointed in how fast hair grows back.</li>
            <li>The light is misleading it is really no different then a electric razor which I have never really liked.</li>
            <li>No, it does not make hair not grow back but for a person with sensitive skin who had to pluck any facial hair this is a life saver and PAINLESS!!!.  </li>
            <li>Took a little longer the first time I used it because I was not used to it.  </li>
            <li>Since the first night, I take about 5 minutes to grab what little has</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned, but the hairs my chin grows are like wires; even their dark ends were visible beneath the surface.</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned, but the hairs my chin grows are like wires; even their dark ends were visible beneath the surface.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been searching for a product for a long time hoping to give me a close shave without having to resort to razors because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it just makes it really short barely visible stubble.</li>
            <li>The light is dim light for visibility, and worthless at that.</li>
            <li>If you are just looking for an electric razor for small areas, such as face or armpits, this might be a product worth looking into otherwise</li>
            <li>The light is way to weak to do anything.</li>
            <li>Held it in every angle, looked for options on the web, maybe we were doing something wrong, not many people had better success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no better than any other cheap shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit noisy for a little thing, but it&#x27;s very efficient.</li>

            <li> More convenient than a razor!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor but a lot better than any electric shaver!</li>
            <li> I really love it!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it should do and works wonderfully well at it.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I know that it works great on peach fuzz and fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> I certainly did not expect this to work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I could get a &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34; on discount or possibly free lol.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that the shaver works so well without any pain and leave a smooth skin afterward.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> No No as I would never spend that kind of money for a hair removal product.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how gentle and effective this is.  </li>
            <li> This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Purchased in April 2015 &amp; still loving it in December 2015.</li>
            <li> Every razor, every pre-shave rub and every post-shave treatment has had its own set of side effects...</li>
            <li> I consider it a nice gadget to have in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> Works nice and Quite..TY</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, close hair removal</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove hair at all, of course, it would have to stay on longer than 5 seconds to be effective.</li>
            <li> Probably is not as good as many electric shavers.</li>
            <li> My eye brow trimmer does a better job at a good shave than this piece of junk</li>
            <li> If you are using it on longer hair say on your arms or legs then the original head works great.</li>
            <li> is a great device to have for a quick touch up between shaving.</li>
            <li> lol  RETURNED quickly</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and its really does what they advertise</li>
            <li> This by far is the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The lighted front is handy so you can be sure you missed no stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Works good on my arms as for the legs not so smooth like with a razor</li>
            <li> I have upgraded to a Tria laser and remain hopeful that it will be more effective.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and no burning hair smell!</li>
            <li> I would find an alternative that is more effective, even if it costs more.</li>
            <li> It sounds very convincing and fancy with the light but not even close to the price.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great to use first to shorten the hairs.  </li>
            <li> This is just a very cheap electric razor that doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the product is nice and slim and fits easily in your hand when using it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and for the price</li>
            <li> I feel a lot better using this than a razor.  </li>
            <li> Product is ok.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be just the perfect present.</li>
            <li> : I was expecting better results with this tool.</li>
            <li> The YES is more money and does not work as well.</li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> I was able to see and get all the hairs removed safely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> You would be better off to buy the No No</li>
            <li> Much better price to another item that I had to no, no to because of the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not, this is a razor with a light!</li>
            <li> They say safe for skin, no nicks.</li>
            <li> I have MORE stubble than I did BEFORE I used this thing.</li>
            <li> yeah, definitely the best purchase of my life!</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> Now I say NO to razors :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My legs , ok.</li>
            <li> I had tried them all for many eons.</li>
            <li> it looked more like scales.</li>
            <li> Just follow the directions, and you should love it too.</li>
            <li> This hair remover has been perfect for my daughter, she no longer has the itchy red bumps and she can shave anytime, not just in the shower.</li>
            <li> I received this Finish Touch Yes as a free sample to test and offer my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Works ok but does not always remove stuble.</li>
            <li> anyone giving more than 1 star is paid to do so.  </li>
            <li> I wrote it at a free will and the opinion expressed in this review is solely my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;M ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH THE BROTHER REPLACEMENT ITEMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would love this YES as well.</li>
            <li> to many devices</li>
            <li> Took a year of me using it about once a month (changing the head once) and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the motor starts when you touch your skin and shuts off when it isn&#x27;t touching anything.  </li>
            <li> I allowed it to charge over night just to be sure.</li>
            <li> Touching up a wax while fixing your make up for the day.</li>
            <li> I am sure you can find one here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not a close cut but better than using a blade.</li>
            <li> Read reviews before purchasing and am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they came out with this product...</li>
            <li> does a better job than NO-NO</li>
            <li> Read directions and make sure you shave at a slant.</li>
            <li> ; technology is nothing more then a flashlight on the end of a piece of junk, lower powered, electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I sit on top of paper towels (undressed) while watching tv</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> just a razor with a pen light!  </li>
            <li> I love this and use it a lot.</li>
            <li> Surely they&#x27;ve heard of these things called germs.  </li>
            <li> so sure about the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> Should have paid more attention to others&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> works better than no no</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> she is extremely pleased; no pain whatsoever;</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It must have some kind of a motion sensor in it that turns the light and the motor on when it nears the skin.</li>
            <li> Ok, ok.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I&#x27;ve got it.  </li>
            <li> I Love this.</li>
            <li> so when I got an opportunity to try it out and review it I was very excited.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about this product because I prefer doing all grooming in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> Pain free and easy!</li>
            <li> and I must say this new YES is a great improvement.</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I received it, it was so easy to use</li>
            <li> If you are looking to cut long hair and leave stubble then this is perfect but not if you want a nice clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but it is not what the commercials make it sound like.</li>
            <li> The light is nothing more than a sensor for when the head gets close to the skin.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished and was glad to have a smooth chin even though it had taken longer than I&#x27;d anticipated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100x better than shaving, and stays smooth for days longer.</li>
            <li> product creates a smooth surface my makeup looks so much better</li>
            <li> Best money I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using other Finishing Touch products I can say this one is impressive.</li>
            <li> It is just a cheap electric razor with light bulb attached to the end.&lt;br /&gt;Light a $20 on fire and punch yourself in the face 5 times, you&#x27;ll be better off.</li>
            <li> It is easy to replace the heads once you read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the Yes about 3 weeks ago &amp; found it extremely easy to use</li>
            <li> easy to order.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making removing hair so easy.</li>
            <li> YES is nothing more than a cheap flimsy electric razor with an LED light on it.  </li>
            <li> no blades to deal with, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has a compact design, fits in my purse or desk drawer without drawing attention, and it&#x27;s easy to re-charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and easy to carry around if you are traveling.</li>
            <li> it does how ever work good on armpits not tried on legs yet but the main reason I bought it was for face</li>
            <li> It also is excellent for trimming the bikini area without pulling any of the hairs, just wipe the blades down with rubbing alcohol after you use it in the bikini area to keep it sanitary.  </li>
            <li> it could get fine stubbly hairs on my chin area though</li>
            <li> and it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> It does work fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine to me.  </li>
            <li> I think it works fine</li>
            <li> Tried it on my arm (fine hair)</li>
            <li> I applied some lotion and after about 10 minutes, my face felt and looked fine.  </li>
            <li> I think I had better success than others because I read the instructions in detail.  </li>
            <li> Nothing fabulous.</li>
            <li> It is simply a cheap electric razor/trimmer with a light.  </li>
            <li> This item was advertised to remove hair, leaving a smooth skin surface.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt my face so smooth since I was thirteen</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample product to test out before writing this review.</li>
            <li> but I thought the so-called light technology had something to do with it.  </li>
            <li> This does not leave skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the light on it is for.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for writing a review</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> I have to say it is cheaply made but it work.</li>
            <li> My chin is soo smooth after use.</li>
            <li> But not quite as smooth.</li>
            <li> so prefer the smooth silky feel of the microfoil head.</li>
            <li> It is sleek, lightweight and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> received one free unit for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a cheap, low-end electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is a cheap answer to no-no</li>
            <li> I was happy with the performance of it as is.s say that to use the included foil head on stubble, but I didn&#x27;t find that necessary.  </li>
            <li> in video is royalty free</li>
            <li> I removed the cap and pressed it against my leg and the LED light came on</li>
            <li> I bought yes through their offical website before it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> received this product for free in exchange of writing a review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a razor with a light.</li>
            <li> The light on the Touch</li>
            <li> It leaves your legs smooth.</li>
            <li> The light also helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> Nice product compared to one costing almost 10 times as much.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped, but still far better than a razor, I am more than satisfied</li>
            <li> leaves skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Just smooth skin on face.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It has a light that helps me see.</li>
            <li> Just received the YES and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> so far, as good as I&#x27;d hoped&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li> I used it for my most intimate areas and I am smooth as a baby!</li>
            <li> This is a great little razor does pretty good</li>
            <li> That makes it super easy to use anyplace on the body.</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to learn.  </li>
            <li> Oh my this is everything it says it is took all the peach fuzz off my face and left it so very smooth no nicks or cuts no bumps I&#x27;m living this so much and would recommend it To everyone who deals with peach fuzz on their face it also works great on your arms</li>
            <li> I love it, but you should be aware of what your expectations are, and what purpose you will be using it.  </li>
            <li> So far very pleased.....</li>
            <li> Instead, you get \\&quot;introducing the world&#x27;s first full-body hair remover made just for women to feel clean and sexy</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t figured out yet how to clean it.</li>
            <li> Safer than a razor, but not as clean of a finish.</li>
            <li> You must first make sure it has a full charged.</li>
            <li> it really is pane free love it.</li>
            <li> This is just another shaver, nothing special at all.  </li>
            <li> And, there is nothing special in this razor &amp;#34;sensing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Her hair is fine, and it takes it right off with no snagging or pulling on the hairs.  </li>
            <li> The ads are true.  </li>
            <li> It does cut hair fairly well but is not totally painless.  </li>
            <li> I loved it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Works so good that I bought a 2nd for a friend!</li>
            <li> This world is full of fraudulent advertising...</li>
            <li> This product beats tria home laser that I used for two years without full hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good product and bought it for half the price as the no no :)</li>
            <li> easy to use and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is nothing more than a light and it is barely helpful for that.</li>
            <li> I am educated enough to understand a user manual :) but magic didn&#x27;t happened.  </li>
            <li> She reports that it worked better than many earlier reviewers here have stated, so</li>
            <li> I trust Fran Drescher because I am one of her biggest fans and have followed her extraordinary life and career.  </li>
            <li> this point, I am PLEASED with my purchase &amp; will be back once I have used it for longer &amp; have a better idea of the ups &amp; downs of the</li>
            <li> /&gt;DELIVERY WAS QUICK ON THESE ITEMS.  </li>
            <li> Just mild stinging on my legs.</li>
            <li> The device worked well and charged quickly.</li>
            <li> It works very well is easy to use and only takes minutes for good results</li>
            <li> When I bought it I paied for the deluxe edition witch came with buffer pads that made the stubble almost completely gone when used on my skin right after using the yes.</li>
            <li> I got these for my two teenage daughters and they both are very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> was the Remington smooth and silky it works like a charm and the price is thrilling ( tweazy) look under trust me</li>
            <li> ; light does absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li> On my first try I got a 100% smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty good, but I end up needing to use it every 2-3 days because hair comes back quick.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and so much cheaper than getting  a wax</li>
            <li> It is easy fast and painless.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and trims really well</li>
            <li> that yes, I read all instructions, fine print, legal jargon,</li>
            <li> that yes, I read all instructions, fine print, legal jargon,</li>
            <li> this is a cheap razor that does not shave very closely.</li>
            <li> It also has a light on it, so you can really see the hair you are trying to shave off.  </li>
            <li> The light on it does absolutely nothing, besides inform you when the razor touches your skin.</li>
            <li> I just received it a couple of days ago,  but I have used it  a couple of times and so far I enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I am leaving my open and honest opinion on my experience with this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> So far it seems okay on my face.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not afraid of people getting close.  </li>
            <li> That product was successful down to 3 stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> I have used other items on unwanted hair and never have I gotten such wonderful results.</li>
            <li> You therefore don&#x27;t have to be right close to a plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right before my wedding (in 1981), I decided to have electrolysis to end the problem once and for all.</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> This device is easy to use, painless, and effective for the purpose I have used it for so far, eliminating facial area peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> I received this free to review, and I can see that some of the prices on Amazon are pretty high.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to change and it includes a little brush which make cleaning very easy.</li>
            <li> I think they are trying to fool people into thinking it is a new light technology that cuts or removes hair, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw this, I thought that it was an epilator, one of those things that will yank your hair right out of its socket.</li>
            <li> And the width of the head is narrow and a bit curved: It takes many more strokes to get the job</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  </li>
            <li> Three weeks ago was the first time I used it and the hair was very light growing back.  </li>
            <li> tried it just a little seems to work pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> Start with the longer cartridge first and then use the stubble cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I only used it once but love it thank you</li>
            <li> the trimmer - even with no guard - doesn&#x27;t cut shorter after the first pass.</li>
            <li> but I learned what I paid ($39.99) was more than the regular price plus shipping combined, so I indeed paid for shipping - had to pay to return it as well.  </li>
            <li> This is simply a pretty but over prices razor.</li>
            <li> I managed to nick myself TWICE the first time I used</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchase at your discretion but be aware that you&#x27;re buying a</li>
            <li> When you turn it on nothing happens at first.</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared at first</li>
            <li> I does exactly what it says it suppose to do...</li>
            <li> It is suppose to be fully charged before your first use.  </li>
            <li> All these people are wrong this product is the best!!!</li>
            <li> the yes works much better than smwlly creams or regular razors</li>
            <li> I have told pretty much everyone I know to get one!</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL and is really fast!</li>
            <li> Upon first use I said this is bogus.</li>
            <li> Or for that person that is just to self aware to even consider a spa or salon for a wax.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to shave first before using.  </li>
            <li> Etc BEFORE my first use, and I followed all the directions perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Etc BEFORE my first use, and I followed all the directions perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> and it hurt so much!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to use it on my face, the micro-foil head did not work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and no regrets !</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law bought this product, the Deluxe model, at Bed Bath and Beyond for $20 and returned it after 30 days with use by her, my wife,her husband, a son, and both our daughters, all with NO positive</li>
            <li> Love it so much that I&#x27;ve purchased another one to give to a dear friend as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I liked better, the burning sensation I had for three days or the scab like mess it left on my face for days after.  </li>
            <li> But I focused on the positive reviews &amp; decided I had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> The light does not do much but if your like me and have super long legs and might miss a few spots, than I can say the light is more like a flashlight.</li>
            <li> it came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> After trying so many products and procedures without any success, it was a complete shocker that this simple product worked like it does.</li>
            <li> After trying so many products and procedures without any success, it was a complete shocker that this simple product worked like it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s probably best for people with really shaky hands, who often cut themselves with regular clippers.</li>
            <li> One of the main problems is it does not hold a charge, after charging for more than 12 hours it will only run about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a very decent product</li>
            <li> It had simple and easy instructions to get started.</li>
            <li> It is simply an electric razor with a pretty blue/purple light.</li>
            <li> I wax my lower legs and arms, but sometimes when I go outside, I see a missed area and this easily takes care of it.</li>
            <li> A large version of the mini finishing touch.  </li>
            <li> I certainly would not have bought one for my wife.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like tweezing on a large scale.</li>
            <li> but I can do my entire chin easily without too much pain.</li>
            <li> This little appliance is so handy and easy to use, if it spares me fretting about a single errant hair showing by the end of the day, it is everything I hoped for and far, far more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OBVIOUSLY nothing more than a super tiny electric shaver, yet that term, \\&quot;shaver\\&quot;, is nowhere to be found.  </li>
            <li> nice little cordless razor.</li>
            <li> I got it a few days ago and it has been AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of negative reviews on this product, and it is just an electric razor with a light, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> The difference is that is it so incredibly gentle on the skin around the hair, the only evidence that you used it is smooth skin without stubble.</li>
            <li> The difference is that is it so incredibly gentle on the skin around the hair, the only evidence that you used it is smooth skin without stubble.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> Now, the foil head does make it smooth for a short time, but I always have to use it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this in my travel bag because it does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> This product is just a electric straight razor.  </li>
            <li> The Device works very well.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like it as much as the ravers.</li>
            <li> I was very upset about how it worked.</li>
            <li> Very deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li> This makes me think that the designers are very thoughtful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my skin and it gently removes unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> but it had done so much damage to my skin</li>
            <li> It met all my expectations, so much so that I bought another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> It charges with the included wall charger, or on my USB phone charger, which is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close, not as close as a blade razor, but almost.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> I lost it to him after he got out of the hospital, he really wanted to keep it.  </li>
            <li> Unlike everything else I&#x27;ve tried, the Yes! is absolutely pain-free--no smell, no wounds, no scarring, no itching, no redness--</li>
            <li> Unlike everything else I&#x27;ve tried, the Yes! is absolutely pain-free--no smell, no wounds, no scarring, no itching, no redness--</li>
            <li> Light weight enough that it fits in my bag whether I am traveling or just a night out.</li>
            <li> I give this a 4 star because it really does work..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it much yet.</li>
            <li> Yes! has really been a life saver.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> It is ok, I guess not what I expected</li>
            <li> Perhaps I was expecting too much.</li>
            <li> It really removes the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Take a good men&#x27;s shaver, add a couple of extra options to it, make them pink or purple or whatever, or DON&#x27;T, and</li>
            <li> So far I have NO complaints!!!  </li>
            <li> The Finishing touch YES makes my skin (especially my face, which is the most important To me) softer than any other product.</li>
            <li> It did remove the hair on my arm but left stubble, it wasn&#x27;t a clean, smooth shave like the commercial says.  </li>
            <li> Neither head works as good as shaving, but they work very similarly to any other hair</li>
            <li> I found this out after I had ordered 2 replacement heads that I assumed would be the same 2 as the original, but when they arrived they were the identical trimmer heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What is really cool about this little unit is the Sensa Light Technology.</li>
            <li> I thought this was all the new technology hair remover, but it is like the rest of the battery operated facial hair removers, because the blue light technology thing is just a light and has no effect of helping to remove unwanted hair for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> The only way to clean it is with this itty bitty brush that catches in the screen and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal user BUT only for certain body parts.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected, but for a razor it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer head for long hair and the smooth micro foil head for touch ups or smoothing any stubble.</li>
            <li> Ok for facial hair, but it grows back very soon.  </li>
            <li> This little appliance is so handy and easy to use, if it spares me fretting about a single errant hair showing by the end of the day, it is everything I hoped for and far,</li>
            <li> I almost started crying because my face was smooth for the first time in 7 years!  </li>
            <li> It does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I like the Sensa light because it helps you see the hair follicles closer especially if you are in a dim lit room.</li>
            <li> although my main purpose was my face.</li>
            <li> for  what it is it works but hair comes back quickly</li>
            <li> I bought into the clever wording of the infomercial...</li>
            <li> It is meant to be used on clean, dry skin</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, the lighted tip does absolutely nothing, nor is there anything in the instruction book about it.  </li>
            <li> so far really wished they sold replacement pieces,  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t do a great job removing hair.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m definitely convinced this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I loved it when I first got it for Christmas but now 6 months later, it has worsened my chin hair problem dramatically and the charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish 1/2 a leg.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is shaver that trims ONLY very thing hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target and I am taking it right back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not about to buy a new unit just to get a micro foil replacement head...</li>
            <li> I should have known better before buying this, it&#x27;s nothing new besides a fake light that makes the product show its &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is an electric shaver with a light, a rechargeable lithium ion battery and two separate heads, one for longer hair and a second one for short hair or stubble.  </li>
            <li> - it shaves worse than my cheap razors - leaves stubble/fuzz/hair - does NOT stop operating when lifted from skin as advertised - advertised with &#x27;free shipping&#x27; when I ordered</li>
            <li> it works like an electric shaver .....and not that effective and the battery does not last either...don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> but my skin is very sensitive and if anything I feel like that&#x27;s an testament to how close the product gets the shave.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by this &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; hair remover.</li>
            <li> This razor cuts more skin than hair, moving roughly across my legs; however, it does not do a good job of cutting hair at the skin level.  </li>
            <li> but it is no where near the level of a No-No!</li>
            <li> So far it out-performs NoNo by a mile!</li>
            <li> And while I was ill at first for falling for the hype, I fell in love after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per instructions, I charged it for 2.5 hours.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it a 2nd star for the look because it looks cool, but for the performance of this product it should be one star.</li>
            <li> if any hairs were missed or not completely eliminated you can clearly see them with the light and go back.  </li>
            <li> The first trimmer doesn&#x27;t do much but gets your hair close to the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; stage and the second attachment removes the stubble so you&#x27;re left with a face that feels like you&#x27;ve just shaved - except no razor bumps or cuts!    </li>
            <li> The white or clear ones are more stubborn than the dark.</li>
            <li> Overall it works much better than the previous options that were used.</li>
            <li> (very hairy) back, and it left it pretty smooth but with a little stubble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super small, super basic set of hair clippers that has a protective shell</li>
            <li> I love it to touch up the hard places to get with a razor like around your knees.</li>
            <li> I finally laid down on my bed in order to get the paralyzed arm high enough to be able to shave.  </li>
            <li> So, if you make the mistake of purchasing this item,  make sure that you return it immediately if it proves to be useless to you.</li>
            <li> This is a way better alternative to shaving with razors, painful lasering that takes way longer and costs more, or waxing.  </li>
            <li> do yourself a favor and steer clear of this product and this company</li>
            <li> I think we&#x27;re clear that we ALL were scammed on how this thing works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month and my facial hair is much thinner.  </li>
            <li> : The two heads are meant for shorter and longer hairs and they are really sensitive in regards to length.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is growing back twice as fast since using the product.  </li>
            <li> thanks Amazon returned policy it sent back</li>
            <li> It worked as designed, charges fine--if as she tells me a bit slowly--and so far has met her expectations.</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times and found it to be pain free and helpful when shaving.</li>
            <li> A cheap electric razor for not a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> I really want my money back.  </li>
            <li> I will be surprised to receive a refund.  </li>
            <li> Or, if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If I wanted a razor, I would have stuck with my Disposable Venus and some sensitive skin shave</li>
            <li> and I much prefer the microfoil head for use on facial hair.</li>
            <li> also charges quickly in a few hours and is cord free when in use.</li>
            <li> You do not want to use this in the shower or anywhere near water.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve passed menopause, I seem to have developed hairs on my neck and chin.  </li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> I say if you&#x27;re diligent with this AND a hair growth inhibitor cream like whish or prescription vaniqua or all natural tumeric paste, then go for it.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting wiry chin hairs almost all my adult life.</li>
            <li> far more.ouch</li>
            <li> I have a problem doing sensitive spots</li>
            <li> Beats getting cut with razors and so far I have no problem with it.  </li>
            <li> Completely painless.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps people  should read complete details before writing reviews.  </li>
            <li> If a person don&#x27;t read instructions or complete details they should not get an item.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom, I&#x27;m busy, and shaving just isnt a priority when my legs are covered.</li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s the tiniest electric shaver ever with a headlight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d finish a complete marathon before I&#x27;d finish removing hair from my body with this thing</li>
            <li> Even my 4 year old daughter knows about germs.  </li>
            <li> Men get awesome, giant foil headed shavers that adjust to every contour imaginable for their faces, but somehow women are expected to meet the perfectly smooth whole-bodied expectations of those men with crap like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking hair completely gone after running it over my leg one time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well the yes yes works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely painless.</li>
            <li> this gets an A+ from a 60 year old who was always fighting the peach fuzz on the face</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it, especially for facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure that it is what I was really looking for, but for a small, compact, cordless electric, razor its really good.</li>
            <li> It takes up a great deal of my time and just plain sucks.  </li>
            <li> Gave it to my wife for Christmas and she is extremely have with it, works much better then the more expensive hair removal systems</li>
            <li> Yes electric shaver to my Schick Hydro or my Gillette Venus disposable manual razors, I can mention few positive features: I can manage a dry shave where ever I may be--even in the dim light of the bathroom at work.</li>
            <li> The charging takes about 2 and a half hours for a full charge.</li>
            <li> To clean the heads there is a little included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to REALLY clean these crappy little shaver heads.  </li>
            <li> That said, the only product I have found to be very useful with long lasting hair removal is an epilator.  </li>
            <li> The fine trimming end should be handled with care as I zipped off a small mole with it.</li>
            <li> Plus be aware they only offer a 20% refund with no return.&lt;br /&gt;Big Giant Rip!</li>
            <li> You can use it repeatedly, very slowly, and the light is simply a purple tinted regular light.</li>
            <li> Returned back highly overpriced item.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> so the battery charge lasts forever and it keeps the fresh charged cut feeling lasting very long.  </li>
            <li> but I can use this on very short stubble and it takes it completely off, leaving my face very soft.</li>
            <li> (just brush the eyebrows straight up, and trim the long ones).  </li>
            <li> This has a lot of potential but it doesn&#x27;t live up to the promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,however it doesn&#x27;t really work for short short stubble like hair.</li>
            <li> No other appliance or treatment has even come close to the</li>
            <li> No other appliance or treatment has even come close to the</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with two heads, one that&#x27;s like a traditional set of clippers, which works on any hair growth, and another that only works when you press it down very firmly on light hair growth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money on razors before!!</li>
            <li> It works great on all areas without leaving the annoying red bumps on certain areas.</li>
            <li> You can get a Braun, Remington, Norelco, or other high-end shaver for the same price or less and it will do the job a thousand times better.</li>
            <li> It is simply a tiny battery operated razor with a small light.  </li>
            <li> and now I barely have stubble.    </li>
            <li> You actually have to get it near the skin for it to start working.</li>
            <li> GOT THEM MUCH SOONER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Subsequently, no matter how much the tech backed off on the current, the result was always the same.</li>
            <li> No wet or cream required.</li>
            <li> Then, blah blah elegant, blah blah technology, blah blah a bunch of ridiculous words to make it sound like a piece of magic...its a super tiny shaver with a stupid light on it.&lt;br /&gt;One curious piece of info about this thing is that you are to NEVER get any part of it</li>
            <li> Apparently, water will damage them.  </li>
            <li> I spent 20 minutes doing practically my whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li> It dosent work.it barely cut the hairs</li>
            <li> Included is a tiny little brush and that is the ONLY way you are allowed to clean the heads.  </li>
            <li> The blade/comb actually held a lot of hair so there was no mess.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s mostly because I&#x27;m unable to raise my arm high enough to put shaver at the required angle.</li>
            <li> Good product, but I was disappointed in how fast hair grows back.</li>
            <li> The light is misleading it is really no different then a electric razor which I have never really liked.</li>
            <li> No, it does not make hair not grow back but for a person with sensitive skin who had to pluck any facial hair this is a life saver and PAINLESS!!!.  </li>
            <li> Took a little longer the first time I used it because I was not used to it.  </li>
            <li> Since the first night, I take about 5 minutes to grab what little has</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned, but the hairs my chin grows are like wires; even their dark ends were visible beneath the surface.</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned, but the hairs my chin grows are like wires; even their dark ends were visible beneath the surface.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been searching for a product for a long time hoping to give me a close shave without having to resort to razors because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it just makes it really short barely visible stubble.</li>
            <li> The light is dim light for visibility, and worthless at that.</li>
            <li> If you are just looking for an electric razor for small areas, such as face or armpits, this might be a product worth looking into otherwise</li>
            <li> The light is way to weak to do anything.</li>
            <li> Held it in every angle, looked for options on the web, maybe we were doing something wrong, not many people had better success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than any other cheap shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit noisy for a little thing, but it&#x27;s very efficient.</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs above the knee to the thigh, because my hair is fine and it&#x27;s pretty painful to wax.  </li>
            <li> The battery does not last long enough to do anything beyond &amp;#34;touch-up work&amp;#34; to quote my wife.</li>
            <li> If you really stop to think about hair removers and razors by purchasing this it comes out the same in the long run with no more cuts.......</li>
            <li> I find myself constantly switching out heads when I encounter an area that I&#x27;m unsure of would be considered long or short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should last a long time !&lt;</li>
            <li> The heads are also kind of hard to get off of the base to switch or clean.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about 2 months ago and when the micro foil head broke I was advised that those heads were not available for replacement and I would have to buy a new unit.  </li>
            <li> One ONLY works on stubble and the other one ONLY works on longer hairs.</li>
            <li> --I must declare that those positive features mean nothing if the blades on the head do not give a close</li>
            <li> My hair on my chin has not grown back in slower or thinner (and I&#x27;ve been using this since Dec 26, 2014).in fact, I have to use the foil head every day to get rid of the rough, scratchy stubble.</li>
            <li> When it comes out of the package the razor has the long hair head on it.</li>
            <li> But when I need to run out somewhere and want to wear shorts, i always find myself having to wear pants bc shaving takes so long.</li>
            <li> As long as you have this baby charged up you can shave in minutes and go.</li>
            <li> no matter how long I waited.  </li>
            <li> I tried to contact the company at the number they list for customer service but all I got was a overly rapid busy signal (all day long) or two rings and then dead silence,</li>
            <li> It only removes a few hairs randomly, it is false advertising in that it leads one to believe the product is going to remove hair via light technology, not via crappy razor blade.</li>
            <li> It can trim areas of really long corse hair down to a barely visible stubble.</li>
            <li> Te hair that is growing back is less coarse also.</li>
            <li> Those 3 hairs are less coarse &amp; now only 2 hairs; so I&#x27;m expecting it to eventually be none!!!</li>
            <li> used it to try to eliminate my coarse whiskers growing on my chin due to poly-cystic ovary disease.</li>
            <li> I have occasional facial hair, that usually I pluck, but that can make the area red for an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long either.</li>
            <li> This is basically just a dry electric razor.</li>
            <li> mainly bought it for my arms or other small areas</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any single hair was shaved.</li>
            <li> Every single day has been a struggle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;ll last - not the charge but the entire battery life</li>
            <li> trimmer is marketed by Idea Village as if through a company &amp;#34;Finishing Touch&amp;#34;... Idea Village markets a number of pretty poor (IMO) products.</li>
            <li> Ten thumbs down.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to(removes hair like crazy) and so easy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I will say the hair is definitely coming back in slower and usually at this point in time</li>
            <li> It is no better than what is called a razor, especially with short hair.</li>
            <li> I only need to shave my legs about once every 2 month &amp; the hair continues to grow back less &amp; less</li>
            <li> There was nothing I could do before or after a treatment to make it appear any less gross.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a permanent hair remover but has a larger razor head than the usual facial razors for women.</li>
            <li> I had A lot of bumps on my legs and very dry skin</li>
            <li> the product is initially charged, other charges take less time than 2.5 hours.  </li>
            <li> (at times I wonder if it&#x27;s an epilator due to some slight &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; when areas are shaved, but I don&#x27;t have an extra 40 bucks to take a unit apart and find out).  </li>
            <li> My daughter also uses it on her arms and legs, because she is in her early teens and isn&#x27;t ready to shave (and she&#x27;s too afraid to wax).  </li>
            <li> It is a razor but much more painful</li>
            <li> The so-called &amp;#34;sensa light&amp;#34; is just a light that turns on when you press the cutting head.  </li>
            <li> does not work as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re not supposed to get this thing wet.</li>
            <li> A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Def doesn&#x27;t remove hair like expected.</li>
            <li> My skin is never completely smooth but so close that I personally don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it on few different areas of my skin</li>
            <li> I expected it to b like NoNo.</li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> But it truly is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT MY DAUGHTER EXPECTED</li>
            <li> NOTHING like I expected.  </li>
            <li> Promoting a lighted electric razor as a &amp;#34;hair removal device&amp;#34; with deceptive advertising and return policies could certainly not be what she had in mind.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The first time seems a little frustrating as you get use to it.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman, I do not want rough stubble on my face!</li>
            <li> Not sure it is doing what I expected--it does not get rid of all the facial hair</li>
            <li> When I tried to put the other head on it fell apart in my hand</li>
            <li> This tool, doesn&#x27;t give an extreme close shave</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than the other guys.</li>
            <li> I have chin hair due to hormone problems which I had tried to eradicate with another product.</li>
            <li> It shaves extremely close without pulling hair.  </li>
            <li> But  because this would not shorten my time as I have other products that may take 3 to 10 minutes, I can not see myself using this all over.</li>
            <li> Does the job I expected it to do!</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews of women who think this product does not remove hair.  </li>
            <li> The other attachment works like all the other hair removal products that are shaped like a pen</li>
            <li> Yes does not work with the other razor attachment.</li>
            <li> so I give credit where credit is due</li>
            <li> This closer head did a decent job ONE TIME, then when I went to reuse it (in just a few days, because you are just &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; the hair, which is not a good idea to begin with) it would not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I think this is better than messing with razors and shaving cream or waxing or other messy painful way to remove hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who wrote all the positive reviews on this product, but they are wrong.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s a serious need I have with women&#x27;s shavers in general:  </li>
            <li> I only gave this a star because I couldn&#x27;t give it NEGATIVE stars!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not worth the 37$</li>
            <li> Light angle and heads are very pick, it is frustrating and annoying</li>
            <li> This is just razor and not worth the money......</li>
            <li> It is simply a small electric razor with 2 attachments for long or stubble hair.</li>
            <li> The Sensalight technology does not remove hair; the razor/trimmer does and it does not take the hair down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> cuz I don&#x27;t need to be in the shower to use, and it gets the hair all the way down to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also works on keeping my sideburns to a minimum, and I have even used it to neatly trim my eyebrows down like they do in Ulta</li>
            <li> I have stubble within less than 24 hours on areas treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I could leave less than one star I would.</li>
            <li> Really less than a one.  </li>
            <li> I have seen it at Walgreens for less.  </li>
            <li> Plus, waiting for enough hairs to grow to the surface to make an expense laser session worthwhile is awful.</li>
            <li> It took me less than 12 minutes to shave both legs that I had not shaved in three weeks.  </li>
            <li> This takes way less than lasering did for me.  </li>
            <li> and it takes less than 20 minutes for me to shave all parts.  </li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this product, but upon the first 5 minutes of inspection, I realized this was just a stupid game.</li>
            <li> Small end goes into finishing touch, but what do you plug other end into????</li>
            <li> I like this little machine</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the $40.00 dollars!</li>
            <li> It leaves a little fuzz.</li>
            <li> , this little tool is heading to work with me on Monday, where it will reside in a corner of a drawer for emergency use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this little beauty.  </li>
            <li> If the skin is damp like after a shower, the razor head grabs the skin and leaves the skin looking sun burned since it has taken off several layers of skin, very sensitive and painful.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.  </li>
            <li> : So it&#x27;s been a few days.</li>
            <li> The heads are also rather narrow</li>
            <li> There is no light technology.</li>
            <li> I can only hope that she was duped into promoting this poorly designed, ineffective product.</li>
            <li> A waste of money..don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> It then automatically turns off after a few seconds when you are done.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but she gets impatient and sometimes skips the gel.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It runs for just a few minutes before it dies.</li>
            <li> After reading the directions, I charged it for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and time .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fantastic but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the money unless you want a small electric razor</li>
            <li> Comparing it to the head for longer hair, I discovered a wire spring was missing from it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had to pluck a few hairs before I bought this .</li>
            <li> I JUST started seeing a 70 percent less growth there!</li>
            <li> Due to a disability, I have a hard time shaving my legs &amp; underarms.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST every other day.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have this problem, you probably cannot imagine all the time and worry I have dedicated to trying to tame bristles that are determined to grow.</li>
            <li> Unless you have this problem, you probably cannot imagine all the time and worry I have dedicated to trying to tame bristles that are determined to grow.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would have to wait for a little bit before I could shower or do just about anything.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would have to wait for a little bit before I could shower or do just about anything.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push down to hard onto your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is too thin and takes way too long to use everywhere that I need to use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if one claim is to make hair growth slow down.</li>
            <li> I slowly tried it up and down my leg</li>
            <li> When I was done, my face felt almost raw.  </li>
            <li> I tried it in a few areas and as I waited for that painful snag and the moments of ouch, I had to look twice to see if it really was working.</li>
            <li> I was 2 days past return time to return.</li>
            <li> Did not even take small hairs off</li>
            <li> No more razor nicks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and tried it immediately - the results were unbelievable.</li>
            <li> : The heads are small so the area they cover is small.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m doing all of the work since I constantly have to check each area if the hair remover worked and if it didn&#x27;t, I have to determine if it was because I used the wrong head for that hair length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what everyone else believed this product was about</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money!</li>
            <li> I did shave a small area of my husbands</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not satisfied</li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll tell you:  they&#x27;re too small to see without a microscope,  and they&#x27;re everywhere.  </li>
            <li> ITS NO MORE THAN A SHAVER TO ME</li>
            <li> The advertising for this product is deceptive because of the way it makes the consumer believe it&#x27;s comparable to the expensive hair remover with the name that&#x27;s opposite to YES.  </li>
            <li> I was a tad bit disappointed, but I use it anyways, so I must say it does work, but like a regular battery operated facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> Not only did this incredibly painful treatment not work, every single needle poke resulted in a white-head, and my chin swelled up like Duddly Doright&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Also there is a very narrow window to return this item.  </li>
            <li> very heavy duty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible, scam dosnt work at all not even on fine hair...</li>
            <li> Its like a razor on your face, leaves face feeling like it has hard bristles.</li>
            <li> HOW HARD IS THAT?!?&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> HOW HARD IS THAT?!?&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Amazon requires a star rating so I am marking one but would mark a minus if I could.</li>
            <li> Imagine my disappointment when I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow later that afternoon!</li>
            <li> but you have to select at least one star.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive, I always have zits across my chin that look as painful as they are.</li>
            <li> At least this does work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Deserves negative stars but</li>
            <li> Had to give it one undeserved star</li>
            <li> /&gt;Deserves negative stars but</li>
            <li> Had to give it one undeserved star</li>
            <li> This product is in fact a razor - and not a particularly effective one at that.  </li>
            <li> I would already have a thick shadow coming in</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it as much as the haters</li>
            <li> &quot; they really mean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more razors for me!</li>
            <li> The aftermath was so bad, it was obvious that I was &amp;#34;doing something&amp;#34; to my face for at least two weeks after an electrolysis session--then it was time for another.</li>
            <li> this is simply ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> which is a NO NO as it costs is ridiculous and doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> So not a good RAZOR.</li>
            <li> So for you women who have a couple errant hairs you can&#x27;t tame, I am sorry the</li>
            <li> This product sucks!</li>
            <li> Some of you negative posters seem to have missed the point of the Yes! appliance altogether.</li>
            <li> I do not understand any of the negative reviews because this thing is a miracle!  </li>
            <li> I like it comparing to razor, but the razors are very hard to remove</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!</li>
            <li> Just not happy with the product</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because the initial 2.5 hours of charging is a bit annoying</li>
            <li> This product is basically a razor, and a poor one at that.  </li>
            <li> Just the act of fingering my chin in search of a missed bristle kept my chin irritated and broken out all the time.</li>
            <li> Just the act of fingering my chin in search of a missed bristle kept my chin irritated and broken out all the time.</li>
            <li> IT IS DESIGNED FOR THIN GROWTH.</li>
            <li> Beware of the 25% restocking fee when you find out that you are not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving manually &amp; electric razors just don&#x27;t shave close enough.  </li>
            <li> Not really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> To my way of thinking, stubble is worse than longish leg hairs.</li>
            <li> Here is a link to a web site that gives you tips on how to make it less painful.</li>
            <li> Not Good!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s so weird, and dumb, and</li>
            <li> It was crazy insane how much hair this thing was getting!  </li>
            <li> This is simply a (poor) miniature trimmer, like hair cutting trimmers.</li>
            <li> Not even the expensive crea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> All reviews by fake accounts.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this at all.</li>
            <li> I find the advertisement on the package quite insulting to my female intelligence.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so skeptical to buy this because of the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> just a fancy expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> an expensive disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> but i was wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I dropped one of the parts or the razor attachment for cutting hair stubbles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are unhappy with this product.  </li>
            <li> USELESS!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s wrong with you people?!?  </li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to do an underarm shave.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s impossible.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s impossible.  </li>
            <li> So I am really bad about keeping up with shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> It is extremely painful.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed about that.  </li>
            <li> Nope :(</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife and she is quite disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li> Wtf is the point?!?!</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the shaver head.</li>
            <li> I bought this piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> - do not deal with Idea Village or this product - it is worthless.  </li>
            <li> Then you use the closer shaving head to trim stubbles and the base of hairs.  </li>
            <li> This piece of crap has a foil head about one fifth</li>
            <li> Since I bought this piece of crap now I have to shave my chin every day ....</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as advertised my wife hated it</li>
            <li> the worst product its crap</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I ever bought.</li>
            <li> It works so well and shaving is annoying!      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pathetic.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst scam ever...</li>
            <li> This product is terrible saw no hair loss whatsoever!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a glorified batter powered razor. Did not work well.</li>
            <li> This product sucks! All of the 5 star reviews are fakes. DONT BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are unhappy with this product.  I love it and for the price it&#x27;s well worth it, especially for facial hair.  I think I had better success than others because I read the instructions in detail.  Start with the longer cartridge first and then use the stubble cartridge.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month and my facial hair is much thinner.  I use the stubble cartridge about once a week now and on my legs there are sections where the hair is not even growing back.  I cannot compare it to the No No as I would never spend that kind of money for a hair removal product.</li>
            <li> Just received the YES and so far so good.  I feel a lot better using this than a razor.  i also used NO-NO to no avail.</li>
            <li> I only used it once but love it thank you</li>
            <li> Product is ok. Nothing fabulous. Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> Very very happy.  All my sister&#x27;s are jealous.  The ads are true.  It&#x27;s easy to use and no regrets !</li>
            <li> Just not happy with the product</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about.  They can call it what they want...it&#x27;s still a razor!</li>
            <li> Worst thing I ever bought. I was 2 days past return time to return. I just threw it out. Did not even take small hairs off</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t perform well at all.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but it is not what the commercials make it sound like. It is not like &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34; and no, I do not work for that company. I wish I did then I could get a &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34; on discount or possibly free lol. I cannot afford one, they are too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; was a Christmas gift from my mother. I absolutely hate the shaver head. It is too thin and takes way too long to use everywhere that I need to use it. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long either. My hair on my chin has not grown back in slower or thinner (and I&#x27;ve been using this since Dec 26, 2014).in fact, I have to use the foil head every day to get rid of the rough, scratchy stubble. I am a woman, I do not want rough stubble on my face! Now, the foil head does make it smooth for a short time, but I always have to use it again the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is nothing more than a light and it is barely helpful for that. The heads are also kind of hard to get off of the base to switch or clean.</li>
            <li> Its like a razor on your face, leaves face feeling like it has hard bristles. Sent it back</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It takes the hair off with no pain! I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Works great! No more razor nicks. Currently unavailable on Amazon. I need a spare in case it gives out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by this product!  It is simply a cheap electric razor/trimmer with a light.  The Sensalight technology does not remove hair; the razor/trimmer does and it does not take the hair down to the skin.  I don&#x27;t know who wrote all the positive reviews on this product, but they are wrong.  Please don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.  I have requested a refund from the seller.</li>
            <li> Excellent.,.,,thank you</li>
            <li> This item was advertised to remove hair, leaving a smooth skin surface.  It leaves a stubble.  I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and she is unimpressed.I am disappointed about that.  I thought it would be just the perfect present.</li>
            <li> So after seeing some of the reviews on this thing I can&#x27;t help but wonder if they&#x27;re just plants by the \\&quot;no-no\\&quot; corporation to bash this product.    I bought this product and tried it immediately - the results were unbelievable. The first trimmer doesn&#x27;t do much but gets your hair close to the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; stage and the second attachment removes the stubble so you&#x27;re left with a face that feels like you&#x27;ve just shaved - except no razor bumps or cuts!    I haven&#x27;t felt my face so smooth since I was thirteen and I&#x27;ve been searching for a product for a long time hoping to give me a close shave without having to resort to razors because I have sensitive skin. This product does just that!    The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because the initial 2.5 hours of charging is a bit annoying and I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;ll last - not the charge but the entire battery life but we&#x27;ll see.    All in all, it&#x27;s a very decent product and I&#x27;d definitely buy it again. It works so well and shaving is annoying!      Edit: So it&#x27;s been a few days. I did get some \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; on my neck - but my skin is very sensitive and if anything I feel like that&#x27;s an testament to how close the product gets the shave. I will say the hair is definitely coming back in slower and usually at this point in time I would already have a thick shadow coming in and now I barely have stubble.    So I&#x27;m definitely convinced this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how well it works.</li>
            <li> I received my product &amp; read all instructions. After charging, I proceeded to shave my legs. It didn&#x27;t work. Not one hair on my leg. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> This is simply a (poor) miniature trimmer, like hair cutting trimmers. It isn&#x27;t even like an electric razor, but like a very tiny set of hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever used hair trimmers (and I did but now shave my head) the trimmer - even with no guard - doesn&#x27;t cut shorter after the first pass. You can use it repeatedly, very slowly, and the light is simply a purple tinted regular light. It actually does nothing. My brother-in-law is in electronics and verified that. My sister-in-law bought this product, the Deluxe model, at Bed Bath and Beyond for $20 and returned it after 30 days with use by her, my wife,her husband, a son, and both our daughters, all with NO positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no company &amp;#34;Finishing Touch&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is marketed by Idea Village as if through a company &amp;#34;Finishing Touch&amp;#34;... Idea Village markets a number of pretty poor (IMO) products.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product because I prefer doing all grooming in the comfort of my own home. This has a lot of potential but it doesn&#x27;t live up to the promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: The two heads are meant for shorter and longer hairs and they are really sensitive in regards to length. One ONLY works on stubble and the other one ONLY works on longer hairs. I find myself constantly switching out heads when I encounter an area that I&#x27;m unsure of would be considered long or short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: The heads are small so the area they cover is small. Using this tool therefore turns into a quite time consuming task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: Said to not give you bumps. Well it did, in the bikini area.... Not nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: I feel like I need to use this daily. I don&#x27;t know if one claim is to make hair growth slow down. Well, if that&#x27;s the claim, I don&#x27;t notice it yet. I have stubble within less than 24 hours on areas treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: Can be used on legs without inflicting any pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: I was expecting better results with this tool. I feel like I&#x27;m doing all of the work since I constantly have to check each area if the hair remover worked and if it didn&#x27;t, I have to determine if it was because I used the wrong head for that hair length. It&#x27;s pricey for what it delivers. I would find an alternative that is more effective, even if it costs more.</li>
            <li> so far, as good as I&#x27;d hoped&lt;br /&gt;good delivery</li>
            <li> Not sure it is doing what I expected--it does not get rid of all the facial hair and I haven&#x27;t figured out yet how to clean it.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> It is an electric shaver with a light, a rechargeable lithium ion battery and two separate heads, one for longer hair and a second one for short hair or stubble.  It is meant to be used on clean, dry skin so don&#x27;t try it in the shower or bath. The heads are also rather narrow so it is easier to use the Finishing Touch on face or underarms rather than extensive hair removal.  The unit needs to be charged before using.  It comes with a charging USB cord and a AC block to attach it to.  The charging takes about 2 and a half hours for a full charge. I was sent a free sample product to test out before writing this review. It did not irritate my skin. I&#x27;m going to keep this in my travel bag because it does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what everyone else believed this product was about but I thought the so-called light technology had something to do with it.  This product is just a electric straight razor.  A large version of the mini finishing touch.  As far as I can tell, the lighted tip does absolutely nothing, nor is there anything in the instruction book about it.  I think they are trying to fool people into thinking it is a new light technology that cuts or removes hair, but it&#x27;s not.  It does cut hair fairly well but is not totally painless.  It scratches a bit.  Also I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is growing back twice as fast since using the product.  Not good!&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t be scammed by this company.  Know what you&#x27;re getting.  It&#x27;s just a razor!</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way.</li>
            <li> Returned back highly overpriced item.&lt;br /&gt;Took a chance to try. This tool works as the regular shaving tool. I am educated enough to understand a user manual :) but magic didn&#x27;t happened.  I am a red-blond and expected to get at least 2 weeks  free of hair removal needs. Nope :( thanks Amazon returned policy it sent back</li>
            <li> I got these for my two teenage daughters and they both are very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected, but for a razor it is pretty good. The fine trimming end should be handled with care as I zipped off a small mole with it.</li>
            <li> USELESS! This does not leave skin smooth. It leaves stubble, which means you will have to get a razor and shave. There is no light technology. The light is dim light for visibility, and worthless at that.If I could leave less than one star I would. I own the $10 Finishing Touch and am happy with it. The YES is more money and does not work as well. It is a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> The Device works very well.  For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> nice little cordless razor.</li>
            <li> This is so good for me I had A lot of bumps on my legs and very dry skin this is very good Brenda</li>
            <li> it is just a poor  shaver with a light.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this out. She reports that it worked better than many earlier reviewers here have stated, so possibly the product (provided me for review) might have been improved. It worked as designed, charges fine--if as she tells me a bit slowly--and so far has met her expectations.</li>
            <li> What a shame. I trust Fran Drescher because I am one of her biggest fans and have followed her extraordinary life and career.  I can only hope that she was duped into promoting this poorly designed, ineffective product. Promoting a lighted electric razor as a &amp;#34;hair removal device&amp;#34; with deceptive advertising and return policies could certainly not be what she had in mind.  Fran, please pull the plug on the commercials and divorce yourself from this product mach schnell!!</li>
            <li> does not work as expected.</li>
            <li> it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> love this. great product</li>
            <li> Good product, but I was disappointed in how fast hair grows back.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware!!  This product does NOT work as advertised,  at all.  The product description is inaccurate and deceptive.  It is simply a tiny battery operated razor with a small light.  Also there is a very narrow window to return this item.  So, if you make the mistake of purchasing this item,  make sure that you return it immediately if it proves to be useless to you.</li>
            <li> Received it on time and  as described</li>
            <li> I bought this piece of crap.  I am sending  it back for a refund.  I would NEVER recommend it to anyone ever!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it as much as the haters and I don&#x27;t like it as much as the ravers. It does a decent job. You know those pen-sized trimmers you can get in drug stores? It&#x27;s a notch or two above that in quality. Leaves stubble, not perfectly smooth, but I&#x27;ve been reasonably content with it.</li>
            <li> This product but I find it had to keep it charged.</li>
            <li> It had simple and easy instructions to get started. I used this product a few times and found it to be pain free and helpful when shaving. I like the Sensa light because it helps you see the hair follicles closer especially if you are in a dim lit room. I was able to see and get all the hairs removed safely. By not using any water or shaving gel is a plus! The shape of the product is nice and slim and fits easily in your hand when using it.  I like the idea that it is portable and rechargeable. This product can also be unisex.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about 2 months ago and when the micro foil head broke I was advised that those heads were not available for replacement and I would have to buy a new unit.  I found this out after I had ordered 2 replacement heads that I assumed would be the same 2 as the original, but when they arrived they were the identical trimmer heads.  I&#x27;m not about to buy a new unit just to get a micro foil replacement head...this is simply ridiculous.  When I called them they told me that my order number was correct, but they had no record of me n their system, even though I registered after receiving the product.</li>
            <li> It is no better than what is called a razor, especially with short hair.</li>
            <li> Best purchase for the price, I love my Yes.</li>
            <li> It is simply an electric razor with a pretty blue/purple light. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money.  Does a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase. It works great on all areas without leaving the annoying red bumps on certain areas. Every time I shave around my ankles I always knick myself but with Finishing touch I have no problems. And the battery life just on forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it a star because it&#x27;s quiet.  It DOESN&#x27;T WORK.  It was great for three days...then...nothing.  It&#x27;s pathetic.  For all the hoopla, it&#x27;s just a micro screen razor.  Ten thumbs down.</li>
            <li> A cheap electric razor for not a cheap price.  It has two heads, one for stubble and one for longer hair. When it comes out of the package the razor has the long hair head on it. When I tried to put the other head on it fell apart in my hand and I can&#x27;t figure out how to put it back together. I have no idea what the light on it is for. I think it&#x27;s to give the illusion that it&#x27;s a laser or something? I would not purchase again. I wish I had the packaging so I could send it back.</li>
            <li> unless you want to grow a coarse stubbly mustache ...save your money and don&#x27;t buy this scam!  Returning mine after just one use.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It works good for me and that is all I care about.</li>
            <li> excellent product that works better than advertised</li>
            <li> I was very upset about how it worked. It didn&#x27;t work like they stated.</li>
            <li> Works ok&lt;br /&gt;Wish it could get fine stubbly hairs on my chin area though</li>
            <li> This product does not work well at all.</li>
            <li> Really less than a one.  Only used once to test.  Our Finishing Touch Yes has not held a charge since.</li>
            <li> I loved it when I first got it for Christmas but now 6 months later, it has worsened my chin hair problem dramatically and the charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough to finish 1/2 a leg. I was under the impression that after a while, it would eliminate hair growth. That&#x27;s what Fran Dresher said on a talk show.  I really want my money back.  But that won&#x27;t happen.  Stay away from this product. Shame on you Fran Dresher and Finishing Touch.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and so much cheaper than getting  a wax</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for writing a review and I was not paid or told what to write.  I found this product not to work because  It didn&#x27;t remove the hair from my legs.  Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This hair remover doesn&#x27;t do anything different than a razor or regular shaver.</li>
            <li> *UPDATE - Idea Village did give me the refund but I still had to pay for return shipping through the USPS.  do not buy this product - it shaves worse than my cheap razors - leaves stubble/fuzz/hair - does NOT stop operating when lifted from skin as advertised - advertised with &#x27;free shipping&#x27; when I ordered but I learned what I paid ($39.99) was more than the regular price plus shipping combined, so I indeed paid for shipping - had to pay to return it as well.  It arrived almost a month after I ordered it - do not deal with Idea Village or this product - it is worthless.  I will be surprised to receive a refund.  Unfortunately Amazon requires a star rating so I am marking one but would mark a minus if I could.</li>
            <li> A waste of money..don&#x27;t buy it. Does not remove hair to the skin. Leaves noticeable stubble. So not a good RAZOR. Would not recommend to anyone. You would be better off to buy the No No</li>
            <li> This is simply a pretty but over prices razor.</li>
            <li> Works great. !  Much better price to another item that I had to no, no to because of the price</li>
            <li> it works but leaves the stublely hair effect. I got this because i have a movement disorder so i can&#x27;t shave without creating pits in my skin. I like it for the fact it SHORTENS the hair but the stuble snap on does not work. You A)need to shave it away or B) get your legs waxed</li>
            <li> When I first saw this, I thought that it was an epilator, one of those things that will yank your hair right out of its socket. It&#x27;s not at all. It&#x27;s a super small, super basic set of hair clippers that has a protective shell so you don&#x27;t get cut. Oh, it also activates when you put some pressure on the tip, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two heads, one that&#x27;s like a traditional set of clippers, which works on any hair growth, and another that only works when you press it down very firmly on light hair growth. Neither head works as good as shaving, but they work very similarly to any other hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably best for people with really shaky hands, who often cut themselves with regular clippers. Or, if you have really sensitive skin. Or, if you don&#x27;t want people to know that you&#x27;re carrying clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Extremely safe&lt;br /&gt;+Good for people with a history of gouging themselves with traditional clippers.&lt;br /&gt;+Very small&lt;br /&gt;+Attractive design and colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not very heavy duty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Finishing Touch gave me this shaver to review*</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as advertised my wife hated it and I sent it back</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> This device is easy to use, painless, and effective for the purpose I have used it for so far, eliminating facial area peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Very deceptive advertising. this is a cheap razor that does not shave very closely. The light is nothing more than a sensor for when the head gets close to the skin. If the skin is damp like after a shower, the razor head grabs the skin and leaves the skin looking sun burned since it has taken off several layers of skin, very sensitive and painful. If advertised as an electric razor instead of a competitor to the NoNo, may not have been so upset. I certainly would not have bought one for my wife.</li>
            <li> I only gave this a star because I couldn&#x27;t give it NEGATIVE stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I was under the belief that this was supposed to be like the No-No. It&#x27;s not, this is a razor with a light! I feel like I&#x27;ve been mislead to what this product is. The commercials and print are definitely misrepresenting the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to try to eliminate my coarse whiskers growing on my chin due to poly-cystic ovary disease. It took a while to get the YES to get rid of them. They say safe for skin, no nicks. I managed to nick myself TWICE the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished and was glad to have a smooth chin even though it had taken longer than I&#x27;d anticipated. Imagine my disappointment when I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow later that afternoon! My whiskers stayed away longer if I&#x27;d plucked them. I have MORE stubble than I did BEFORE I used this thing. My face is breaking out as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re not supposed to get this thing wet. The only way to clean it is with this itty bitty brush that catches in the screen and there&#x27;s no way to tell if you got anything from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: It is quicker than plucking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the convenience of recharging with the USB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: It&#x27;s a razor and the whiskers grow back immediately after you&#x27;ve finished. If I wanted a razor, I would have stuck with my Disposable Venus and some sensitive skin shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase at your discretion but be aware that you&#x27;re buying a rechargeable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: No, I would not recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Very good product. easy to use and does exactly what it says. Should last a long time !&lt;br /&gt;Good value for the money !</li>
            <li> I did not like that mach!</li>
            <li> It is just a cheap electric razor with light bulb attached to the end.&lt;br /&gt;Light a $20 on fire and punch yourself in the face 5 times, you&#x27;ll be better off.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Yes.  Makes skin feel smooth and you do not have to deal with knicks or cuts from a razor.</li>
            <li> It was good product for the job.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for on the go touch ups!</li>
            <li> So I bought this because I recently moved into an apartment with just a shower and no bath. Shaving my legs was LITERALLY a pain and when I saw this on TV and looked it up. I got it a few days ago and it has been AMAZING. It&#x27;s so easy to use, perfect cuz I don&#x27;t need to be in the shower to use, and it gets the hair all the way down to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I saw some reviews complaining of in grown hairs?? I haven&#x27;t had any problems with those and idk how this would cause those??&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, definitely the best purchase of my life! I can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money on razors before!!</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this. I am impressed with how gentle and effective this is.  Now I say NO to razors :)&lt;br /&gt;I am telling my friends all about it too..good best friend gift!</li>
            <li> It is a razor.  I was expecting something else.</li>
            <li> I just received it a couple of days ago,  but I have used it  a couple of times and so far I enjoy it! 🌻 I think I&#x27;m going to use it all of the time! 🌻</li>
            <li> This product is basically a razor, and a poor one at that.  It has 2 heads, one that cuts and a closer one for &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34;.  This closer head did a decent job ONE TIME, then when I went to reuse it (in just a few days, because you are just &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; the hair, which is not a good idea to begin with) it would not hold a charge.  SO, plug it in, try again later - now the unit just flashes, does not work at all.  Will not start, have tried several times, remove and replace head, etc, etc.  A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item although not from amazon.  I love it. I use on my legs and chin and upper lip. I have to say it is cheaply made but it work. My chin is soo smooth after use. My legs , ok. But not quite as smooth.</li>
            <li> For years I tried everything to remove hairs from my body. Not even the expensive crea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has ever removed hairs from my face or body but YES. I had tried them all for many eons.</li>
            <li> I have been using another Finishing Touch product for facial hair ever since I turned forty and I must say this new YES is a great improvement. There are two heads and I much prefer the microfoil head for use on facial hair. If you are using it on longer hair say on your arms or legs then the original head works great. I just find it a bit scratchy for the face so prefer the smooth silky feel of the microfoil head. It is easy to replace the heads once you read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also charges quickly in a few hours and is cord free when in use. That makes it super easy to use anyplace on the body. You therefore don&#x27;t have to be right close to a plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is really cool about this little unit is the Sensa Light Technology. It turns on the unit when it touches your skin. When you turn it on nothing happens at first. You actually have to get it near the skin for it to start working. It then automatically turns off after a few seconds when you are done. This makes me think that the designers are very thoughtful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cautions are included with the instructions. You do not want to use this in the shower or anywhere near water. To clean the heads there is a little included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using other Finishing Touch products I can say this one is impressive. It is sleek, lightweight and comfortable to use. When they say \\&quot;instant and pain free\\&quot; they really mean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free unit for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion. I loved it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I do not like this razor. Def doesn&#x27;t remove hair like expected. Waste of money. Not sellers vault though.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a cheap, low-end electric shaver.  It did not remove the hair as advertised on TV.  Do yourself a favor and buy a good high-end shaver.  You can get a Braun, Remington, Norelco, or other high-end shaver for the same price or less and it will do the job a thousand times better.</li>
            <li> Did not work as avertised</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it works great on my legs,underarms and bikini area.no pain at all.</li>
            <li> I do not know what you plug the one end into for charging?  Small end goes into finishing touch, but what do you plug other end into????</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as I&#x27;d hoped...but will do in a pinch..</li>
            <li> Finally something that works without being over priced!! I&#x27;m thrilled with this product! I&#x27;m recommending to my friends!</li>
            <li> Love this product !!! It does not irritate my skin and it gently removes unwanted hair. Finishing Touch YES is truly meant for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I liked better, the burning sensation I had for three days or the scab like mess it left on my face for days after.  I tried to cover it up with make up but it had done so much damage to my skin it looked more like scales. NEVER AGAIN! Biggest waste of money!</li>
            <li> Works so good that I bought a 2nd for a friend!</li>
            <li> It met all my expectations, so much so that I bought another one for my daughter. She also loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> It not only  doesnt remove the hair it hurts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a glorified shaver. I thought hair was removed below the skin line and it is not.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve passed menopause, I seem to have developed hairs on my neck and chin.  This is a cheap answer to no-no and it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> The Finishing Touch YES is a great way to remove unwanted hair.  I see a lot of negative reviews on this product, and it is just an electric razor with a light, but I love it.  I wax my lower legs and arms, but sometimes when I go outside, I see a missed area and this easily takes care of it. I use it on my legs above the knee to the thigh, because my hair is fine and it&#x27;s pretty painful to wax.  It charges with the included wall charger, or on my USB phone charger, which is very convenient.  It also has a light on it, so you can really see the hair you are trying to shave off.  I have occasional facial hair, that usually I pluck, but that can make the area red for an hour or so.  If I am running out the door and see a rogue face hair, this takes care of it.  It also works on keeping my sideburns to a minimum, and I have even used it to neatly trim my eyebrows down like they do in Ulta (just brush the eyebrows straight up, and trim the long ones).  It shaves very close, not as close as a blade razor, but almost.  My daughter also uses it on her arms and legs, because she is in her early teens and isn&#x27;t ready to shave (and she&#x27;s too afraid to wax).  Her hair is fine, and it takes it right off with no snagging or pulling on the hairs.  I received this free to review, and I can see that some of the prices on Amazon are pretty high.  I have seen it at Walgreens for less.  As for men using it, I don&#x27;t know.  I know that it works great on peach fuzz and fine hairs.  It also is excellent for trimming the bikini area without pulling any of the hairs, just wipe the blades down with rubbing alcohol after you use it in the bikini area to keep it sanitary.  I love it, but you should be aware of what your expectations are, and what purpose you will be using it.  I did shave a small area of my husbands (very hairy) back, and it left it pretty smooth but with a little stubble. It also stays charged for quite some time. Just follow the directions, and you should love it too. It does say that to use the included foil head on stubble, but I didn&#x27;t find that necessary.  I was happy with the performance of it as is.s say that to use the included foil head on stubble, but I didn&#x27;t find that necessary.  I was happy with the performance of it as is.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:498983a3ebaa6d833ffd7cfc398aa0f4]]This hair remover is perfect to use when teaching my tween how to shave her legs. I tried to teach her with a regular razor along with using the foam gel but she gets impatient and sometimes skips the gel. When she skips the gel, her legs get itchy and rash starts to form. This tool, doesn&#x27;t give an extreme close shave but you can&#x27;t tell unless your feeling the skin. This hair remover has been perfect for my daughter, she no longer has the itchy red bumps and she can shave anytime, not just in the shower. When I tested this hair remover, it looked like a mini electronic shaver. I was a bit scared at first but it got easier to use. You really have to go over the same spot a few times but atleast it doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation. The attachments are easy to change and it includes a little brush which make cleaning very easy. The blade/comb actually held a lot of hair so there was no mess. I received this Finish Touch Yes as a free sample to test and offer my honest opinion. Well, it works great for the purpose that I need it for. I have another daughter who will be learning soon also so I&#x27;m really happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**music in video is royalty free**</li>
            <li> WAS BOUGHT AS A GIFT SHE SAID IT WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Beat the Price &amp; it works Good!</li>
            <li> Love this product, works great!!!</li>
            <li> it works like an electric shaver .....and not that effective and the battery does not last either...don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This is a great little razor does pretty good</li>
            <li> I does exactly what it says it suppose to do...I will be getting one for daughter too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even touch the finest hair on any of our faces or arms. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product does not work 4 me at all! Would send back if I could get refund!!!</li>
            <li> This is a joke! It runs for just a few minutes before it dies. It doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this but I use this because she does not like it.</li>
            <li> I had seen Fran D. on t.v. advertise this all the time so when I got an opportunity to try it out and review it I was very excited.  After reading the directions, I charged it for a few hours.  It is suppose to be fully charged before your first use.  I then decided to try it on my stubbly legs.  I removed the cap and pressed it against my leg and the LED light came on and it made a noise.  I slowly tried it up and down my leg and it did not remove any hair that I could see.  I then decided to try it on my arm since I have a lot of hair there.  It did remove the hair on my arm but left stubble, it wasn&#x27;t a clean, smooth shave like the commercial says.  I was not impressed at all.  If you are looking to cut long hair and leave stubble then this is perfect but not if you want a nice clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Does not trim hair at all!!! The stubble still remains. I wish I could have returned this product but it got lost in my move. ):</li>
            <li> Works ok but does not always remove stuble. Safer than a razor, but not as clean of a finish.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Great price. Fast shipping. Painless.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t shave as well as promised</li>
            <li> anyone giving more than 1 star is paid to do so.  Total scam.  Even the Money back guarantee is a scam. It&#x27;s 60 days on the website, but on the receipt I printed, it says you only have 30 days.</li>
            <li> works as good as it says. A lot cheaper than the other guys.</li>
            <li> I bought yes through their offical website before it was available on Amazon. Yes by itself isn&#x27;t a perfect hair removal system it doesn&#x27;t fully remove the hair it just makes it really short barely visible stubble. It can trim areas of really long corse hair down to a barely visible stubble. It is easy fast and painless. When I bought it I paied for the deluxe edition witch came with buffer pads that made the stubble almost completely gone when used on my skin right after using the yes. My skin is never completely smooth but so close that I personally don&#x27;t care. I think this is better than messing with razors and shaving cream or waxing or other messy painful way to remove hair. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. This was supposed to be a regular battery shaver but it doesn&#x27;t shave. I tried to use it on few different areas of my skin and I didn&#x27;t notice any single hair was shaved. I only gave it a 2nd star for the look because it looks cool, but for the performance of this product it should be one star. It starts so you can hear it but it just doesn&#x27;t shave.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange of writing a review and I was NOT paid to write this review. I wrote it at a free will and the opinion expressed in this review is solely my own.</li>
            <li> I like this little machine it&#x27;s easy to use and trims really well</li>
            <li> Due to a disability, I have a hard time shaving my legs &amp; underarms. I used the Yes about 3 weeks ago &amp; found it extremely easy to use &amp; I still do NOT need to shave my legs again 3 weeks later!!!  NO stubble, NO regrowth.  I am THRILLED!!!  I found it very difficult to do an underarm shave. That&#x27;s mostly because I&#x27;m unable to raise my arm high enough to put shaver at the required angle. I finally laid down on my bed in order to get the paralyzed arm high enough to be able to shave.  I did NOT end up with razor burn &amp; I did NOT cut myself during any of the leg &amp; underarm shaving!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I am PLEASED with my purchase &amp; will be back once I have used it for longer &amp; have a better idea of the ups &amp; downs of the Yes!!!  So far I have NO complaints!!!  Will be back with an update once I know more!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/04/2015: Purchased in April 2015 &amp; still loving it in December 2015. Love it so much that I&#x27;ve purchased another one to give to a dear friend as a Christmas present. I only need to shave my legs about once every 2 month &amp; the hair continues to grow back less &amp; less so I&#x27;m looking forward to when it just disappears.!!! Te hair that is growing back is less coarse also. I have chin hair due to hormone problems which I had tried to eradicate with another product. That product was successful down to 3 stubborn hairs. Those 3 hairs are less coarse &amp; now only 2 hairs; so I&#x27;m expecting it to eventually be none!!! Will update again when I make further progress!!!</li>
            <li> Crappy, scam, doesn&#x27;t work, poor electric shaver with a purple light on it. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> All these people are wrong this product is the best!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it!  Razor bumps and doesn&#x27;t remove hair effectively on legs or bikini line!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Very pleased and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> Ok for facial hair, but it grows back very soon.  Definitely not for coarse leg hair!</li>
            <li> Yes misses some of the hairs.</li>
            <li> the yes works much better than smwlly creams or regular razors it gets closer</li>
            <li> I like it comparing to razor, but the razors are very hard to remove</li>
            <li> This is just a very cheap electric razor that doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> More convenient than a razor!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, but I end up needing to use it every 2-3 days because hair comes back quick.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH EVERYTHING I PURCHASED.  THE SONY CHARGER WORKS PERFECTLY AND THE HELLO KITTY PILLOWS ARE SO CUTE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;M ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH THE BROTHER REPLACEMENT ITEMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE FINISHING TOUCH WORKS GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DELIVERY WAS QUICK ON THESE ITEMS.  GOT THEM MUCH SOONER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> it came pretty fast. easy to order. tried it just a little seems to work pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> Am just starting to use. Works well so far.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It literally is the only hair remover that actually does what it claims...I have told pretty much everyone I know to get one! You can use it anywhere, but I mostly use it on my legs and armpits and am always impressed. It&#x27;s 100x better than shaving, and stays smooth for days longer. Also, it doesn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL and is really fast!</li>
            <li> Great!! The wife loves it. Works better than expected. Good price for the performance.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have always used the Finishing Touch wand product so it was no surprise I would love this YES as well. I said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; to many devices but I said &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; to this because of its reputation, price and reviews. The Finishing touch YES makes my skin (especially my face, which is the most important To me) softer than any other product. I was amazed by how the stubble was gone and the skin felt afterwards. The two attachments make it versatile for legs, arms, etc. although my main purpose was my face. I now have the answer to my question. YES!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence about this product. Upon first use I said this is bogus. It&#x27;s a razor with a light. I&#x27;m sending it back. I&#x27;ve had it for a year and have used it on upper lip hair. I JUST started seeing a 70 percent less growth there! Took a year of me using it about once a month (changing the head once) and I&#x27;m pleased with the results. I&#x27;m very hesitant to use it on the few coarse hairs on my chin because I don&#x27;t know if it will work the same. I say if you&#x27;re diligent with this AND a hair growth inhibitor cream like whish or prescription vaniqua or all natural tumeric paste, then go for it. But it won&#x27;t keep hair from coming back simply by using this. I&#x27;m a loyal user BUT only for certain body parts. Gosh when will they invent something affordable and effective 100% ?!?!</li>
            <li> Best hair remover ever! Pain free and easy!</li>
            <li> The light on the Touch Yes is very bright and makes it easy to shave the hair on your legs. I love this razor.  It leaves your legs smooth.</li>
            <li> It is extremely painful. It left burns and bumps under my arms. Just mild stinging on my legs. It is a razor but much more painful</li>
            <li> This product delivers on everything said. I have been looking for something that works for years. Great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target and I am taking it right back.  It only removes a few hairs randomly, it is false advertising in that it leads one to believe the product is going to remove hair via light technology, not via crappy razor blade. It pinches and it is nothing like electrolysis which is what it is insinuating.  I can&#x27;t even give it one star but you have to select at least one star.</li>
            <li> This the most awesome shaver I have ever used.  It shaves extremely close without pulling hair.  I used this shaver on my dad in the hospital to cut his mustache and beard.  I lost it to him after he got out of the hospital, he really wanted to keep it.  I like the way the motor starts when you touch your skin and shuts off when it isn&#x27;t touching anything.  The light also helps a lot.  This by far is the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time. Go with No No!  You don&#x27;t want to use a blade on your face. Trust me!! Not Good!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a razor. The ad is deceiving. If is not like No No!</li>
            <li> I expected it to b like NoNo. But its a mini razor.</li>
            <li> This does not remove face hair especially if it is coarse it does how ever work good on armpits not tried on legs yet but the main reason I bought it was for face so I gave it only two stars for not working on all areas</li>
            <li> Some of you negative posters seem to have missed the point of the Yes! appliance altogether. Will it remove hair by the roots so it will never grow again? No. Will it change your genetic makeup so that hair won&#x27;t grow where you don&#x27;t want it to grow? No. So, did the electrolysis and/or laser treatments do that either?? If you bought a Yes!, then I&#x27;m assuming your answer is &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; on both of those counts, too. I have been fighting wiry chin hairs almost all my adult life. The white or clear ones are more stubborn than the dark. Right before my wedding (in 1981), I decided to have electrolysis to end the problem once and for all. WRONG. Not only did this incredibly painful treatment not work, every single needle poke resulted in a white-head, and my chin swelled up like Duddly Doright&#x27;s. Subsequently, no matter how much the tech backed off on the current, the result was always the same. The aftermath was so bad, it was obvious that I was &amp;#34;doing something&amp;#34; to my face for at least two weeks after an electrolysis session--then it was time for another. There was nothing I could do before or after a treatment to make it appear any less gross. My wedding pictures were all retouched--because my chin was hideous. Shaving and tweezing have been a daily chore for almost 35 years. My skin is so sensitive, I always have zits across my chin that look as painful as they are. Laser treatments did the same thing to me---and since the wiriest hairs are white, it hasn&#x27;t lessened their growth and they become ingrown. Plus, waiting for enough hairs to grow to the surface to make an expense laser session worthwhile is awful. Every single day has been a struggle. So for you women who have a couple errant hairs you can&#x27;t tame, I am sorry the Yes! wasn&#x27;t the panacea in personal grooming you&#x27;d hoped for. For me, though, this $40 trinket is a godsend. Every razor, every pre-shave rub and every post-shave treatment has had its own set of side effects...till I tried the Finishing Touch Yes!  After trying so many products and procedures without any success, it was a complete shocker that this simple product worked like it does. Perhaps it is just a lighted razor like its naysayers report. The difference is that is it so incredibly gentle on the skin around the hair, the only evidence that you used it is smooth skin without stubble. No other appliance or treatment has even come close to the Yes! in performance on my ultra-sensitive skin. In the past, I would have to wait for a little bit before I could shower or do just about anything. Putting on makeup was a recipe for disaster. Going out in the sun was killer--and I couldn&#x27;t put anything creamy (like sun-screen) anywhere I&#x27;d removed hair on my face. Even the skin around my eyebrows would get red knobs around the follicles after tweezing. Unless you have this problem, you probably cannot imagine all the time and worry I have dedicated to trying to tame bristles that are determined to grow. Unlike everything else I&#x27;ve tried, the Yes! is absolutely pain-free--no smell, no wounds, no scarring, no itching, no redness--no evidence that you have unwanted hair at all. Same with my bikini line---I can finally go to aqua-pilates without wearing shorts over my suit. If it were just a case of not wanting to shave every day, that would be one thing. This is a completely different situation--this product has changed my life. I can&#x27;t help myself from looking in the mirror and examining my chin. Just the act of fingering my chin in search of a missed bristle kept my chin irritated and broken out all the time. If my Yes! broke tomorrow, I&#x27;d be on my way to get another. I am very fair-skinned, but the hairs my chin grows are like wires; even their dark ends were visible beneath the surface. This little appliance is so handy and easy to use, if it spares me fretting about a single errant hair showing by the end of the day, it is everything I hoped for and far, far more.ouch Yes!

            <li> just what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> The Finishing Touch for me. is a great device to have for a quick touch up between shaving. Light weight enough that it fits in my bag whether I am traveling or just a night out. When it arrives, the instruction are to charge it for over 2 hours. I allowed it to charge over night just to be sure. I tried it in a few areas and as I waited for that painful snag and the moments of ouch, I had to look twice to see if it really was working. YES IT WORKS! Without the pain. But  because this would not shorten my time as I have other products that may take 3 to 10 minutes, I can not see myself using this all over. I am thinking this will be a great in between go to for myself. Now for facial usage, I would recommend it. Touching up a wax while fixing your make up for the day. Or for that person that is just to self aware to even consider a spa or salon for a wax. The light does not do much but if your like me and have super long legs and might miss a few spots, than I can say the light is more like a flashlight. I see not issue with it when there are lights on tweezers on the market. This items was purchased with the intent of leaving this review. I am leaving my open and honest opinion on my experience with this product. I consider it a nice gadget to have in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Does the job I expected it to do! I love it to touch up the hard places to get with a razor like around your knees.</li>
            <li> product creates a smooth surface my makeup looks so much better</li>
            <li> Great. I don&#x27;t notice the hair growing back slowing but I can use this on very short stubble and it takes it completely off, leaving my face very soft. Must have.</li>
            <li> This world is full of fraudulent advertising...We can walk on the moon ( 40 some years ago mind you ) but they can&#x27;t come up with an inexpensive permanent \\&quot;hair removal\\&quot; product that actually works??? @@  That said, the only product I have found to be very useful with long lasting hair removal is an epilator.  It&#x27;s not painless. It&#x27;s like tweezing on a large scale. I have a problem doing sensitive spots but I can do my entire chin easily without too much pain. The takes way longer to grow back. I like it.  I am sure you can find one here on Amazon. Here is a link to a web site that gives you tips on how to make it less painful. [...]</li>
            <li> Not a close cut but better than using a blade.</li>
            <li> All it was ,was a gimic it did not remove any hair whatsoever. It was a waste of money and time . It sounds very convincing and fancy with the light but not even close to the price. It should be sold for 1$ not 40$.what I did find out was the Remington smooth and silky it works like a charm and the price is thrilling ( tweazy) look under trust me it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected. I already have plenty of electric &amp;#34;razors.&amp;#34;  The advertising for this was a bit misleading.  It does work fine.</li>
            <li> Nice product compared to one costing almost 10 times as much. Does a great job.  Read reviews before purchasing and am completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The light is misleading it is really no different then a electric razor which I have never really liked.</li>
            <li> I give this a 4 star because it really does work.. I shaved my legs&lt;br /&gt;With it and didint have to shave again for a week,however it doesn&#x27;t really work for short short stubble like hair. All in all I think this is a good product and bought it for half the price as the no no :)</li>
            <li> Works great. Not as close as a razor but a lot better than any electric shaver!</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I received it, it was so easy to use</li>
            <li> Love this shaver!! So easy!!!</li>
            <li> IT IS DESIGNED FOR THIN GROWTH. THIS IS NOT A NO NO! BUT IF YYOU USE IT FOR FACE, ITS GREAT</li>
            <li> Its a glorified razor. The light is way to weak to do anything.</li>
            <li> Works nice and Quite..TY</li>
            <li> So easy to use and no burning hair smell! It does what it&#x27;s suppose to(removes hair like crazy) and so easy on your skin. I&#x27;m so glad they came out with this product...does a better job than NO-NO and like I said...no burning hair smell!</li>
            <li> All reviews by fake accounts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped, but still far better than a razor, I am more than satisfied</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it much yet.</li>
            <li> Caused ingrown hairs on my chin. Not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It works fine to me.  Took a little longer the first time I used it because I was not used to it.  But as time goes by it goes faster and faster.  Beats getting cut with razors and so far I have no problem with it.  If you really stop to think about hair removers and razors by purchasing this it comes out the same in the long run with no more cuts.......</li>
            <li> I have had no problem with this product.  It does remove hair on my chin and face.  Am very happy with this purchase. Compared to the no no...which is a NO NO as it costs is ridiculous and doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Read the reviews on the no no.  One star only.....that&#x27;s a JOKE.  At least this does work. Read directions and make sure you shave at a slant.</li>
            <li> it does not remove hair</li>
            <li> for  what it is it works but hair comes back quickly</li>
            <li> This is the worst scam ever...&amp;#34;Sensa-Light&amp;#34; technology is nothing more then a flashlight on the end of a piece of junk, lower powered, electric shaver.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  You can pluck every hair one by one faster then what this will do.</li>
            <li> This product beats tria home laser that I used for two years without full hair removal.  I have read other reviews of women who think this product does not remove hair.  I beg to differ.  The light helps you see the hair in front and behind the machine.  if any hairs were missed or not completely eliminated you can clearly see them with the light and go back.  This does pulsate to reduce hair growth.  A charge completed both legs, chin, and eyebrows for me.  Painless.  You have to tilt the product at 45 degrees, as the instructions state, to use the short trimmer.  For the close shaving head you hold it at 90 degrees, also in the directions.  It took me less than 12 minutes to shave both legs that I had not shaved in three weeks.  Three weeks ago was the first time I used it and the hair was very light growing back.  Don&#x27;t push down to hard onto your skin.  What I have found helpful is when you use the closer shaving head it helps to move it in a zig zag direction for any short hairs that are stubborn and don&#x27;t want to be removed.  Completely painless.  I have used it everywhere (armpits, crotch, around breasts, chin, eyebrows, and legs.  The first time seems a little frustrating as you get use to it.  It is quick and easy to learn.  This takes way less than lasering did for me.  Also no bleeding, pain, or razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the product is initially charged, other charges take less time than 2.5 hours.  This is a way better alternative to shaving with razors, painful lasering that takes way longer and costs more, or waxing.  You don&#x27;t have to shave first before using.  No creams needed period.  I sit on top of paper towels (undressed) while watching tv and it takes less than 20 minutes for me to shave all parts.  The trimmer is great to use first to shorten the hairs.  Then you use the closer shaving head to trim stubbles and the base of hairs.  I assure there is no pain when this product is used correctly.</li>
            <li> Amazing does a great jon</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase and the Finishing Touch Yes worked as described.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this at all. The light on it does absolutely nothing, besides inform you when the razor touches your skin. It is not worth the 37$ they are asking for it. It comes with two attachments for the head for longer and shorter length hair and it is rechargeable. If you are just looking for an electric razor for small areas, such as face or armpits, this might be a product worth looking into otherwise I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Never have to shave again so glad I got this!!!:) my husband love the way my legs feel!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Greatest thing I have ever used on my unwanted hair. Perhaps people  should read complete details before writing reviews.  There is no stubble.  If a person don&#x27;t read instructions or complete details they should not get an item.  Best money I have ever spent.  leaves skin silky smooth.  I have used other items on unwanted hair and never have I gotten such wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  Im not sure that it is what I was really looking for, but for a small, compact, cordless electric, razor its really good.</li>
            <li> We received this and one of the heads does not work and no one has gotten back to me on how to get it replaced.</li>
            <li> Not as described! This is simply a razor with lights! The battery does not last long enough to do anything beyond &amp;#34;touch-up work&amp;#34; to quote my wife. This is a product compared to a No-No but it is no where near the level of a No-No!</li>
            <li> this did not work as well as seen on tv.  would not tell anyone to use it. just a wast of my money.</li>
            <li> It is good. The hair grows in thinner.</li>
            <li> So I am really bad about keeping up with shaving my legs. I&#x27;m a mom, I&#x27;m busy, and shaving just isnt a priority when my legs are covered. But when I need to run out somewhere and want to wear shorts, i always find myself having to wear pants bc shaving takes so long. Finishing Touch Yes! has really been a life saver. This is a very quick way to shave flawlessly. No wet or cream required. As long as you have this baby charged up you can shave in minutes and go. No irritation, no razor bumps. The lighted front is handy so you can be sure you missed no stray hairs. I use the trimmer head for long hair and the smooth micro foil head for touch ups or smoothing any stubble. I used this on my legs, bikini area, underarms and toes. No problems at all. The device worked well and charged quickly. The lighted shaver comes with both heads, a usb wall charger, and cleaning brush. I really love it! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> WHAT A JOKE!  just a razor with a pen light!  lol  RETURNED quickly</li>
            <li> Glorified Aluminum Travel size shaver! Plus be aware they only offer a 20% refund with no return.&lt;br /&gt;Big Giant Rip! I will never purchase from them again.&lt;br /&gt;Does not do what they say and the &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34; light does absolutely NOTHING! It is all a gimmick.</li>
            <li> I love this and use it a lot.</li>
            <li> the worst product its crap it doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Light angle and heads are very pick, it is frustrating and annoying</li>
            <li> Works great, great price.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything the commercial or products says... I wish I could have returned it.  Not satisfied</li>
            <li> This finishing touch product does not work! Tried using it on my legs and they still have stubble. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!</li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s the tiniest electric shaver ever with a headlight.  Genius.  This piece of crap has a foil head about one fifth the size of a men&#x27;s counterpart, and we&#x27;re supposed to use it for our entire bodies.  It would literally take an entire day, 24 hours, if not longer to accomplish anything like that with this joke of a product.  I couldn&#x27;t even \\&quot;finish\\&quot; one leg in 45 minutes.  I&#x27;d finish a complete marathon before I&#x27;d finish removing hair from my body with this thing and I&#x27;m not even a runner.  I find the advertisement on the package quite insulting to my female intelligence.  It&#x27;s OBVIOUSLY nothing more than a super tiny electric shaver, yet that term, \\&quot;shaver\\&quot;, is nowhere to be found.  Instead, you get \\&quot;introducing the world&#x27;s first full-body hair remover made just for women to feel clean and sexy all over.\\&quot;... Then, blah blah elegant, blah blah technology, blah blah a bunch of ridiculous words to make it sound like a piece of magic...its a super tiny shaver with a stupid light on it.&lt;br /&gt;One curious piece of info about this thing is that you are to NEVER get any part of it wet-you can&#x27;t even rinse the trimmer and foil heads if they&#x27;re detached.  Apparently, water will damage them.  Included is a tiny little brush and that is the ONLY way you are allowed to clean the heads.  Surely they&#x27;ve heard of these things called germs.  Even my 4 year old daughter knows about germs.  She&#x27;ll tell you:  they&#x27;re too small to see without a microscope,  and they&#x27;re everywhere.  There&#x27;s no way to REALLY clean these crappy little shaver heads.  That&#x27;s so weird, and dumb, and GROSS.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a serious need I have with women&#x27;s shavers in general:  Men get awesome, giant foil headed shavers that adjust to every contour imaginable for their faces, but somehow women are expected to meet the perfectly smooth whole-bodied expectations of those men with crap like this.  What&#x27;s wrong with you people?!?  Take a good men&#x27;s shaver, add a couple of extra options to it, make them pink or purple or whatever, or DON&#x27;T, and voila!  You got a good women&#x27;s shaver.  HOW HARD IS THAT?!?&lt;br /&gt;Let me just state for the record that yes, I read all instructions, fine print, legal jargon, Etc BEFORE my first use, and I followed all the directions perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I think I&#x27;ve made my point.&lt;br /&gt;Deserves negative stars but that&#x27;s impossible.  Had to give it one undeserved star so I could leave this freaking review.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now I&#x27;ve made my point.  Good day.purple or whatever, or DON&#x27;T, and voila!  You got a good women&#x27;s shaver.  HOW HARD IS THAT?!?&lt;br /&gt;Let me just state for the record that yes, I read all instructions, fine print, legal jargon, Etc BEFORE my first use, and I followed all the directions perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I think I&#x27;ve made my point.&lt;br /&gt;Deserves negative stars but that&#x27;s impossible.  Had to give it one undeserved star so I could leave this freaking review.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now I&#x27;ve made my point.  Good day.</li>
            <li> This is a razor... Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Works good on my arms as for the legs not so smooth like with a razor but u cant see the hairs&lt;br /&gt;Not so sure about the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;I mainly bought it for my arms or other small areas I&#x27;m satisfied so far really wished they sold replacement pieces,  that&#x27;s the only downside for me.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, close hair removal</li>
            <li> Beware of the 25% restocking fee when you find out that you are not happy with this product. Bought this product for my wife and she is quite disappointed in its performance. One of the main problems is it does not hold a charge, after charging for more than 12 hours it will only run about 15 minutes. There is a sticker on the shaver that tells you to charge it for 2 1\2 hours before use, which was done so she charged it over night to no avail.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt when in use, no blood no pinching. Bought one for my daughter also.</li>
            <li> used it on my face and continue to get ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;not pretty</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t fallen for this.  It didn&#x27;t really work as advertised.  Maybe bearded ladies will become a thing again?  Next time I&#x27;ll just say NO!</li>
            <li> I do not understand any of the negative reviews because this thing is a miracle!  On my first try I got a 100% smooth shave.  I&#x27;m talking hair completely gone after running it over my leg one time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so skeptical to buy this because of the 3 stars.  But I focused on the positive reviews &amp; decided I had nothing to lose.  I purchased it at Walgreens for $34.99.  I hate shaving manually &amp; electric razors just don&#x27;t shave close enough.  And I&#x27;m terrified of an epilator/waxing.  I am beyond happy that I tried this product!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well the yes yes works.</li>
            <li> This product is in fact a razor - and not a particularly effective one at that.  I have upgraded to a Tria laser and remain hopeful that it will be more effective.</li>
            <li> rip off&lt;br /&gt;just an electric razor</li>
            <li> So far very pleased.....</li>
            <li> This is just razor and not worth the money......Don.t wast your time or money...</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it should do and works wonderfully well at it.  The contact feature is great so the battery charge lasts forever and it keeps the fresh charged cut feeling lasting very long.  Overall it works much better than the previous options that were used.</li>
            <li> I certainly did not expect this to work wonderfully. But it truly is a total waste of money. It does absolutely nothing. The only reason I gave it one star is because Amazon requires I give it something.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and was amazed with the results. It does removed the hair like the commercial says. You must first make sure it has a full charged. But does do what it says. Thank you for making removing hair so easy.</li>
            <li> Should have paid more attention to others&#x27; reviews. This product is terrible saw no hair loss whatsoever!</li>
            <li> The Finishing Touch YES is nothing more than a cheap flimsy electric razor with an LED light on it.  also the company that sells it will only give a refund if it is in an unused condition when returned.  So not only is the product a piece of garbage so is the company that sells it.  do yourself a favor and steer clear of this product and this company</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and its really does what they advertise I am so happy that the shaver works so well without any pain and leave a smooth skin afterward. Love this item.</li>
            <li> Really? I had very high hopes for this product, but upon the first 5 minutes of inspection, I realized this was just a stupid game. First of all, this is shaver that trims ONLY very thing hair. I should have known better before buying this, it&#x27;s nothing new besides a fake light that makes the product show its &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34;. On your skin&#x27;s crevices, it does not contour and sometimes it feels like the hair is yanked off. I returned it within 20 minutes of purchase @ bed bath &amp; beyond. AND this device will never ever give you permanent or longer lasting shaves than waxing or lasers would.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Love it!</li>
            <li> works better than no no</li>
            <li> It works very well is easy to use and only takes minutes for good results</li>
            <li> This is basically just a dry electric razor. I get a smoother longer lasting shave in the shower and I can do it faster! I am returning mine.</li>
            <li> Did everything I hoped for. It&#x27;s not a permanent hair remover but has a larger razor head than the usual facial razors for women. Left no stubble. Just smooth skin on face. Would definitely recommend. Just can&#x27;t find replacement heads.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like, did not hold charge.  just a fancy expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> I liked it I think it works fine</li>
            <li> not what i thought it was, does not work that well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fantastic but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon. I bought mine at Walgreens.My Advice is to save your money! It doesn&#x27;t remove hair at all, of course, it would have to stay on longer than 5 seconds to be effective. I don&#x27;t know maybe I just got a faulty one but you have to hit it to get it to start at all!!! Definitely not worth the $40.00 dollars!</li>
            <li> I wanted a cordless rechargeable hair remover and Yes is those things.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t do a great job removing hair.  Probably is not as good as many electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Does not do what the advertisement claimed. The attachment for removing peach fuzz from one&#x27;s face does not work at all. The other attachment works like all the other hair removal products that are shaped like a pen and you can get in any store for about $10 - $20</li>
            <li> I love it. Works great</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT MY DAUGHTER EXPECTED</li>
            <li> It is ok, I guess not what I expected</li>
            <li> Love this product! I was very surprised by this &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; hair remover. It&#x27;s completely painless. It does not pull your hair or harm your skin. It&#x27;s a bit noisy for a little thing, but it&#x27;s very efficient. I used it for my most intimate areas and I am smooth as a baby! No more razors for me!</li>
            <li> Product is good, I would buy it again. I would recommend it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Bed, Bath and Beyond and all it does is trim the hair!! I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it. It doesn&#x27;t even get close to the skin so you have nubs still. Wtf is the point?!?!</li>
            <li> It was  not what it said it would do</li>
            <li> good product good price</li>
            <li> ITS NO MORE THAN A SHAVER TO ME</li>
            <li> No technology. It is simply a small electric razor with 2 attachments for long or stubble hair. It takes the same amount of time as any electric razor and longer than a razor blade. It does remove hair which grows back the same as with any shave. Not worth the money unless you want a small electric razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying YES to this razor! I love it...no blades to deal with, easy to use. It really does work! I travel a lot and this is perfect to pack and go.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible! I got it home and charged it and I tried to shave and it was not shaving it was tearing the hair and it hurt so much! My eye brow trimmer does a better job at a good shave than this piece of junk</li>
            <li> Terrible, scam dosnt work at all not even on fine hair... Tried it on my arm (fine hair) and my husband aswell... Nothing. Held it in every angle, looked for options on the web, maybe we were doing something wrong, not many people had better success. The product does not come with any directions it&#x27;s just all nonsense.star rating 0</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift for the wife.  she is extremely pleased; no pain whatsoever;</li>
            <li> Perhaps I was expecting too much. It leaves a little fuzz. So far it seems okay on my face.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This razor cuts more skin than hair, moving roughly across my legs; however, it does not do a good job of cutting hair at the skin level.  Stubble is left on legs while skin is roughed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this hair removal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE STAR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I dropped one of the parts or the razor attachment for cutting hair stubbles. Now the Finishing Touch Yes does not work with the other razor attachment.</li>
            <li> This is just another shaver, nothing special at all.  The so-called &amp;#34;sensa light&amp;#34; is just a light that turns on when you press the cutting head.  It has nothing to do with hair removal.  The first time I tried to use it on my face, the micro-foil head did not work.  Comparing it to the head for longer hair, I discovered a wire spring was missing from it.  I tried to contact the company at the number they list for customer service but all I got was a overly rapid busy signal (all day long) or two rings and then dead silence, no matter how long I waited.  The advertising for this product is deceptive because of the way it makes the consumer believe it&#x27;s comparable to the expensive hair remover with the name that&#x27;s opposite to YES.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s no better than any other cheap shaver.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> NOTHING like I expected.  It is literally ... an expensive disposable razor.  Save your money ... and by the No-No.</li>
            <li> I thought this was all the new technology hair remover, but it is like the rest of the battery operated facial hair removers, because the blue light technology thing is just a light and has no effect of helping to remove unwanted hair for a longer period of time. I was a tad bit disappointed, but I use it anyways, so I must say it does work, but like a regular battery operated facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> I love it. It really removes the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Removes hair, but NOT permanently. Just another razor.</li>
            <li> So far it out-performs NoNo by a mile!</li>
            <li> Yall is a knock off no no you just change the name to yes trying to make money on someone else idea</li>
            <li> Since I bought this piece of crap now I have to shave my chin every day .... This is nothing but a razor. I had to pluck a few hairs before I bought this . Now I have beard stubble . So embarrassing</li>
            <li> Gave it to my wife for Christmas and she is extremely have with it, works much better then the more expensive hair removal systems</li>
            <li> Oh my this is everything it says it is took all the peach fuzz off my face and left it so very smooth no nicks or cuts no bumps I&#x27;m living this so much and would recommend it To everyone who deals with peach fuzz on their face it also works great on your arms this gets an A+ from a 60 year old who was always fighting the peach fuzz on the face</li>
            <li> Good product. Does what is supposed to do. I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> .Comparing this Finishing Touch Yes electric shaver to my Schick Hydro or my Gillette Venus disposable manual razors, I can mention few positive features: I can manage a dry shave where ever I may be--even in the dim light of the bathroom at work. It has a light that helps me see. It has a compact design, fits in my purse or desk drawer without drawing attention, and it&#x27;s easy to re-charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said--so I give credit where credit is due--I must declare that those positive features mean nothing if the blades on the head do not give a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this razor leaves a stubble. To my way of thinking, stubble is worse than longish leg hairs. And, there is nothing special in this razor &amp;#34;sensing&amp;#34; your skin! It must have some kind of a motion sensor in it that turns the light and the motor on when it nears the skin. Big deal....And the width of the head is narrow and a bit curved: It takes many more strokes to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this little tool is heading to work with me on Monday, where it will reside in a corner of a drawer for emergency use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from representatives of Finishing Touch.</li>
            <li> We returned it as soon as we figured out it sucked. 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think it would work but i was wrong it really is pane free love it. i say YES</li>
            <li> Ok, ok.  I think we&#x27;re clear that we ALL were scammed on how this thing works.  I bought into the clever wording of the infomercial...no shaving, Sensa-Light Technology removes unwanted hair, blah blah blah.  Here&#x27;s the deal, folks:  This thing is a shaver (at times I wonder if it&#x27;s an epilator due to some slight &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; when areas are shaved, but I don&#x27;t have an extra 40 bucks to take a unit apart and find out).  It is smaller than shavers offered to men.  Once I realized that it was a shaver, I understood then that I would not be using this for a whole-body shave.  Not a problem...I use men&#x27;s electrical razors for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was finally diagnosed with PCOS 2 years ago...it went undiagnosed for 5 (men, it&#x27;s a woman thing).  This has caused me to have a massive amount of hair on my chin, neck, cheeks, and a &#x27;stache.  I tweeze, use hair-removing cream, sigh.  I was having to do this AT LEAST every other day.  If I didn&#x27;t, it would become noticable to everyone...embarrassing, right?  It takes up a great deal of my time and just plain sucks.  I bought this little beauty.  And while I was ill at first for falling for the hype, I fell in love after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per instructions, I charged it for 2.5 hours.  I changed to the microfoil head since I was going to be working with stubble.  It was crazy insane how much hair this thing was getting!  I spent 20 minutes doing practically my whole face and neck.  When I was done, my face felt almost raw.  It scared me a bit by how red it had gotten.  I applied some lotion and after about 10 minutes, my face felt and looked fine.  But wait!  Holy bejeebus!  It felt great!!  I almost started crying because my face was smooth for the first time in 7 years!  No stubble, no ingrown hairs, no hairs stuck in skin.  Absolutely amazing!  I know now not to spend 20 minutes on it...lol.  Since the first night, I take about 5 minutes to grab what little has grown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this unit for almost a week and I am so glad that I&#x27;ve got it.  We&#x27;re going to be great partners :-).  Now, I have no problem letting my man touch and caress my face.  Now, I&#x27;m not afraid of people getting close.  It&#x27;s a great feeling.  Thank you, FT Yes!!</li>
            <li> I Love this. Been using it for about a month now. No, it does not make hair not grow back but for a person with sensitive skin who had to pluck any facial hair this is a life saver and PAINLESS!!!.  It is easy to use, and easy to carry around if you are traveling.</li>
            <li> It dosent work.it barely cut the hairs and it still cut you.</li>
