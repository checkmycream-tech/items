            <li> is my third mirror, the other two never did this.  </li>
            <li> it was finally getting a little wobbly.</li>
            <li> Unlike other Big Eyes mirrors I have purchased in the past, this one has a distorted image</li>
            <li> that was in the mirror, as the viewing surface is too small to view both eyes at the same time -- which is how I apply makeup.</li>
            <li> The stem does not fit in the holes.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my poor vision without glasses, but I had trouble focusing on just the one eye -- and you have to view the mirrored eye somewhat from the side --</li>

            <li> I use it for years and could not get it back. The increase of the mirror is bigger than many that are advertised more X&#x27;s, because it is on smooth surface.</li>
            <li> the magic focus big eyes mirror is the greatest magnifying mirror ever. i purchased this one to replace the one i bought twenty years ago. it was finally getting a little wobbly.</li>
            <li> I use this mirror every day!!  Love it!!  It along with my 20X magnification mirror get me through each morning plucking and tweezing.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love the Magic Focus Big Eyes Standing Vanity Mirror.  I couldn&#x27;t get ready for the day without it.   I bought 2.....one for house and one for travel.  Barbara</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror, stays where you put it...lasts for years, this is my second one.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is my second Magic Focus mirror. I had the first one for many years, then dropped it and broke it. It is a nice height for use on the bath vanity counter. Good magnification and the flexible goose neck is great.</li>
            <li> I think its good for eye make-up or putting in contacts - but that&#x27;s it. I would have preferred a bigger one. I did like that it really magnified your eye..one at a time.</li>
            <li> I like the stand that can be adjusted for good viewing.  The mirror is clear and allows me to apply eye makeup sooooo much better.  It magnifies more than I needed (5x) but it is useful and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unlike other Big Eyes mirrors I have purchased in the past, this one has a distorted image and I cannot use it for all my needs.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I wear glasses and I can put my eye makeup on perfect without my glasses. It&#x27;s the only mirror to use to put your make up on</li>
            <li> I love this product and am totally dependent on it.  My only fear is they will quit making them.  Everyone that visits my house wants one and I have bought several.  Nothing could be better for putting on eye make-up and looking closely at your skin.</li>
            <li> I can see fine detail with complete clarity, which means this mirror actually does what it was designed to do.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these mirrors for over 12 years now, and this one is being purchased as a holiday gift for my husband&#x27;s secretary.  Perfect for those who need glasses, reading or otherwise.  Makes putting on and perfecting your makeup a breeze.  I highly recommend these Magic Focus Big Eyes Mirrors.</li>
            <li> I love the 8x magnification on the mirror. But be sure that viewing only ONE of your eyes at a time in it is what you want. Maybe it&#x27;s just my poor vision without glasses, but I had trouble focusing on just the one eye -- and you have to view the mirrored eye somewhat from the side -- that was in the mirror, as the viewing surface is too small to view both eyes at the same time -- which is how I apply makeup. If you&#x27;re fine with just seeing one eye at a time, then this is the mirror for you! I ended up buying a larger, 11x model at the drug store.</li>
            <li> A good quality mirror.  Great for applying eye make up.</li>
            <li> I am able to get my eye makeup just perfect using this mirror. I also use it to inspect blemishes on my skin.</li>
            <li> I can put the mirror together. The stem does not fit in the holes.&lt;br /&gt;When I try to insert the stem the circles push up and get bigger.&lt;br /&gt;This is my third mirror, the other two never did this.  What is wrong?&lt;br /&gt;E. David</li>
            <li> The gooseneck cut me twice and made me bleed while I was trying to remove it from the box! I bought it for someone else,but I may return it.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an identical mirror that my wife had had for many years.  She loved it...the old one and the new one.  I was lucky to find it...thank you Amazon.  The vendor was very prompt and the price was right.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for applying eye make up or contacts.  I take mine with me everywhere.  It is very easy to forget to pack up when traveling, kinda blends in with surroundings.  I&#x27;ve lost a couple this way.</li>
