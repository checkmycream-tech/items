            <li>/&gt;I received an evaluation bag of Epsoak Epsom salt from San Francisco Bath Salt Company for evaluation and an honest review.</li>
            <li>B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] and warm conditioner to volumize your hair</li>
            <li>This Epsom Salt from the San Francisco Bath Salt Company reminds me of how much I liked taking baths and of the therapeutic value of just relaxing in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You put two cups of Epsom Salt into a warm bath and then soak for 12 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It is time to revitalize and pamper yourself with a nice relaxing and therapeutic salt</li>
            <li>My wife and I liked them all</li>
            <li>The views and opinions expressed in this review are my own, and in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor.</li>
            <li>Also, work well to pour some on your damp, warm washcloth for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li>crystals in this product are gorgeous, clear and perfectly formed.</li>
            <li>insulin more effective</li>
            <li>You may also want to try one that I liked even better --</li>
            <li>Unlike the cheaper brands, these are very fine salts.</li>
            <li>Then I carefully clicked all of the selections and realized that the best buy is the ten or twenty pound bulk salt - both ship prime, making this a very good deal as well as a very nice</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the reasons I was so pleased when the San Francisco Salt Company sent me a sample of this Epsoak Epsom Salt product to try.  </li>
            <li>I love using epsom salts in my bath because of the detoxifying qualities and because they help with sore muscles and skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>(the warmer the water, the more germs it kills) and soaked my foot 20 minutes every evening.</li>
            <li>If you have time, soaking twice a day is better.</li>
            <li>After about 5 days of soaking, my toe &amp; toenail looked much, much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it in my daughter&#x27;s bath at night to help her sleep better.</li>
            <li>While I do use these magnesium sulfate salts in my garden, these are much more refined than most bags of Epsom salts, hence the expense.</li>
            <li>Epson Salts make for a great way to relax and invigorate your body and skin, but I didn&#x27;t really know why or how.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Relaxing muscles, drawing out toxins, sedates the nervous system, reduces swelling, is an emollient and more?</li>
            <li>have tried many things to help this, including all of the over the counter creams and pills for allergies.</li>
            <li>Nothing is better for soaking an infected hangnail or sprained ankle or helping to draw out a splinter.  </li>
            <li>Epsom salt is mostly a chemical called magnesium sulfate.  </li>
            <li>Outdoor plants love epsom salt too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a winning product for epsom salt users.</li>
            <li>The company claims the lavender scent helps you sleep better.  </li>
            <li>I walk about 6-7 miles per day and beat my feet up pretty good.</li>
            <li>one last thing, the salt comes in a really nice resealable bag!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t always been good about doing this regularly, even though a good soaking does help.</li>
            <li>Sure soaking in salts may sound \\&quot;womanly\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It is amazing to remember back to my childhood when everyone knew the benefits of Epsom salts in a bath to relax, for use to exfoliate your skin and feet and as a good soak to remove toxins and even soak an injured joint or cut to help reduce infection.  </li>
            <li>I received was in a resealable bag which was nice, and dissolved easily and quickly in a hot tub of water.</li>
            <li>They melt very easily in a hot bath and offer a wonderful experience - no long swishing to get the salt to mix in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The grains of the Epsom salts are fine, but not ground up or pulverized.</li>
            <li>The effectiveness of Epsom salts is sometimes debated, but for those who enjoy an Epsom salts bath, the Epsoak Epsom Salt from the San Francisco Salt Company is a quality Epsom salt from a company that is easy to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sparkly, and if you look at it, you see that each piece is a perfect little magnesium sulfate crystal.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell you that our water bill is going up because of taking more baths instead of showers but it is well worth the time to relax and enjoy life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After adding some essential oils (I was making laundry softener) and shaking the jar to mix it all up, I am happy to report that the granules did not turn to powder.  </li>
            <li>The minerals are absorbed through the skin &amp; provide many health</li>
            <li>Sometimes I visit their website for information &amp; available products.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I visit their website for information &amp; available products.  </li>
            <li>I was provided a free sample for purposes of review.  </li>
            <li>I received these, I noticed a HUGE difference between the ones I had been buying cheaply at the store.</li>
            <li>It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was relaxed, for sure, but don&#x27;t know if soaking in hot water alone would have been just as effective as the hot water and Epsom salt.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t honestly know whether the effect is real or psychosomatic, but they do seem to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salt by San Francisco Salt Company]] far surpasses what you may find in retail stores, and I would recommend this product to anyone seeking more relaxation in a comforting, warm bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.are the links to the other three products shown in the video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got out my blue plastic container that perfectly fits my feet, added a handful of the Epsom salts, put in enough warm water to cover my feet and opened a good book for some quiet time.  </li>
            <li>epsom salts dissolve very easily, and I found the bath very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten to know most of the store brands pretty well.</li>
            <li>Epsoak Epsom has fine grains and dissolved quickly.</li>
            <li>Original 16-Ounce Glue,  Gloss Finish]] and some  </li>
            <li>In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit.  </li>
            <li>like that this product is completely clean and uniform in size from the San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean and relaxed, and my skin soothed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m controlling the diabetes successfully, but with a history of diabetes, my doctor wants me to avoid any more foot surgery if possible.</li>
            <li>She said that her skin felt nice and soft (I concurred!)</li>
            <li>(an ear infection - if it rains it pours), I took a full soak in the salt.</li>
            <li>(an ear infection - if it rains it pours), I took a full soak in the salt.</li>
            <li>The clear bag shows off the crystals nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a lovely basic bath salt to pamper yourself with for a warm to hot bath at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I received one bag of San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s regular epsom salts free, in exchange for writing an honest review.  </li>
            <li>As a Senior citizen with multiple back surgeries I have found the epsons salt a wonderful soaking bath product.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re pregnant or have any health concerns, check with your doctor before using Epsom salt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re pregnant or have any health concerns, check with your doctor before using Epsom salt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Epsom salts is good for relaxing muscles and drawing toxins from the body, sedative for the nervous system, reduces swelling, relaxes muscles, and is a natural emollient, exfoliator, and much more\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will sooth mosquito bites, bee stings, poison ivy and mild sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky, there just may be a handful or two leftover for my bath . . .</li>
            <li>will sooth mosquito bites, bee stings, poison ivy and mild sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky, there just may be a handful or two leftover for my bath . . .</li>
            <li>but it still quickly dissolves in your tub.  </li>
            <li>I find the San Francisco Salt Company brand dissolves quicker allowing me to hop in and enjoy the water while it is still warm enough to relax in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, that even without the scientific proof of the effectiveness of Epsom salts, I do enjoy a hot soak with the salts at times after strenuous workouts.</li>
            <li>I normally use, this product appears more refined.  </li>
            <li>, it dissolves easily and is very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night really helps feel and sleep better.  </li>
            <li>The product is pure and clean (no specks or other bits in them like some brands) and works great, but unless I were giving it as a gift to someone I&#x27;d probably buy Dr. Teale&#x27;s brand at Walmart ($5 for three pounds).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an athlete and my muscles and body need relaxing and this stuff really does the trick!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Modern studies have shown that the magnesium and sulfate are actually absorbed into the body through the skin.  </li>
            <li>Magnesium Sulfate can be absorbed into the skin and it is beneficial for you to detoxify your body.  </li>
            <li>I read in an article online that soaking in an Epsom Salt bath releases magnesium ions that are absorbed by the skin, and that these ions interfere with receptors in the brain that register pain.</li>
            <li>B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] absolutely would make great \\&quot;snow\\&quot; for Christmas decorations - and you can use these for dozens of other things too.</li>
            <li>and they glitter the way that a certain type of snow does when light shines on it, so much so that my very first thought was \\&quot;wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry for that long preamble, but I&#x27;m getting to the point now: my doctor has advised me to soak my feet often in warm water with dissolved Epson Salt to relieve the pain and soften my nails before clipping them.</li>
            <li>I use bath salts frequently for a good, long soak, and my wife does so even more frequently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first thing I noticed about these  [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] is that they are much finer crystals than the stuff in the waxed carton</li>
            <li>I am already hunting for more recipes and planning my next purchase.</li>
            <li>First off, I have also used [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came with a scoop, as when you pour it out of the bag, some of the crystals get stuck in the zip lock creases which makes it harder to close.</li>
            <li>first time buying form this company</li>
            <li>I used it the first day I received soaking in bath.</li>
            <li>Received it on time 2lb bag used it in my hot bathe water</li>
            <li>I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak help as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (as opposed to a hot bath without salts).  </li>
            <li>and she wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of this same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They dissolve almost instantly in hot bath water with no residue.</li>
            <li>It is soothing and relaxing in a hot bathtub.</li>
            <li>Their other products I&#x27;ve tried had lavender and eucalyptus in them, which added a nice fragrance to the air while soaking.  </li>
            <li>Epsoak is pure Magnesium Sulfate that quickly dissolves in warm or hot water and helps to relax stiff and sore muscles and relive your aches and pains.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s snow white and really just lovely to look at.  </li>
            <li>The shipping is fast and packed well, the salts themselves in a sturdy resealable bag, and one that actually does re-seal, unlike so many others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend epsom salt baths, and you simply cannot find a better option than San Francisco Salt Company.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very different from what you buy in the store- the little crystals are just beautiful, and so pure that they are reflective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These bath salts are aesthetically pleasing as well - they are sparkly, white, dissolve easily and don&#x27;t leave film in the tub.  </li>
            <li>product is so pure, that it&#x27;s in crystallized form.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure, so it is unscented.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased the large bag, since she found it helped her itching.</li>
            <li>I had purchased the large bag, since she found it helped her itching.</li>
            <li>salt is 100 % pure product without any fragrance or oils added.  </li>
            <li>There is much cheaper Epsom salts, but none are as pure as San Francisco Salt Company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go around shouting about how much I love taking hot baths, but i do recommend it to my other guy friends that work out as much as me.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing too.</li>
            <li>you enjoy bath salts, and especially Epsom salts</li>
            <li>Epsoak really did work for me...</li>
            <li>Yep, I get the itchies on my hands till I am ready to kill.</li>
            <li>and I was AMAZED at how relaxing and very soothing</li>
            <li>Mod Podge CS11202</li>
            <li>It does not matter the slightest to me, in fact their purity may contribute to their ease of use and ready</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a versatile relaxation</li>
            <li>Definitely worth considering if you want more of a \\&quot;spa\\&quot; treatment rather than just a plain epsom soak.&lt;br /&gt;[manufacturer</li>
            <li>I had to spare some for a dish that I put my favorite small samples of nonreactive minerals and crystals in, it looks so much better than regular salt.</li>
            <li>: my experience with this particular salt - two days after I got it, I developed hives, right on schedule.</li>
            <li>These are the plain unscented version, which is perfect for soaking sprains or for people who are sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed these salts as much as their other products, but the price seems a little high to me.  </li>
            <li>Just like most of the other reviewers here!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried several of their other products, and this one has the same high quality and great packaging.  </li>
            <li>have made a quick video of four different salts that I had the privilege to review for the San Francisco Salt company</li>
            <li>While this epsom salt from San Francisco Salt Company is quite a bit more expensive, it is also of much better</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this product from the San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li>but it is a naturally occurring pure mineral compound of magnesium and sulfate.</li>
            <li>I had hives really bad this week, and the best I felt was in this soak and the detox soak they have</li>

            <li>and I now realize that the baths help my joints and back a lot more and really relaxes my tight muscles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it is that the foot bath with dissolved Epson Salt gives better results than just plain warm water, but that&#x27;s definitely the case.</li>
            <li>I first looked at the price for two pounds, I was a bit taken aback, especially with the shipping.</li>
            <li>find that the hot soak reduces pain and relieve muscle cramps in my back.</li>
            <li>I tried a second test a few days later with just hot water, and that was a huge disappointment - my feet got warm, which is nice, but generally didn&#x27;t have that softened feel from the Epsom soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also great for soaking your tired feet after a long day of standing or walking a</li>
            <li>I recently used Epsoak Epson Salt dissolved in warm water to soak my feet in a small tub we use for that purpose.</li>
            <li>grain size of the version I used was indicated on the package as \\&quot;medium.\\&quot; That proved to be a far larger grain size than the epsom salt I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it still dissolved readily in warm water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Epsoak is pure epsom salts, simply magnesium sulfate heptahydrate with no added ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I love these in my bath as we have hard well water, and these soften the water and my skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use soap because it will interfere with the action of the salt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural remedy that has been used hundreds of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>natural body scrub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This Epsom Salt from the San Francisco Bath Salt Company reminds me of how much I liked taking baths and of the therapeutic value of just relaxing in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is time to revitalize and pamper yourself with a nice relaxing and therapeutic salt</li>
            <li> My wife and I liked them all</li>
            <li> The views and opinions expressed in this review are my own, and in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor.</li>
            <li> Also, work well to pour some on your damp, warm washcloth for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> crystals in this product are gorgeous, clear and perfectly formed.</li>
            <li> insulin more effective</li>
            <li> You may also want to try one that I liked even better --</li>
            <li> Unlike the cheaper brands, these are very fine salts.</li>
            <li> Then I carefully clicked all of the selections and realized that the best buy is the ten or twenty pound bulk salt - both ship prime, making this a very good deal as well as a very nice</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one of the reasons I was so pleased when the San Francisco Salt Company sent me a sample of this Epsoak Epsom Salt product to try.  </li>
            <li> I love using epsom salts in my bath because of the detoxifying qualities and because they help with sore muscles and skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> (the warmer the water, the more germs it kills) and soaked my foot 20 minutes every evening.</li>
            <li> If you have time, soaking twice a day is better.</li>
            <li> After about 5 days of soaking, my toe &amp; toenail looked much, much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in my daughter&#x27;s bath at night to help her sleep better.</li>
            <li> While I do use these magnesium sulfate salts in my garden, these are much more refined than most bags of Epsom salts, hence the expense.</li>
            <li> Epson Salts make for a great way to relax and invigorate your body and skin, but I didn&#x27;t really know why or how.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Relaxing muscles, drawing out toxins, sedates the nervous system, reduces swelling, is an emollient and more?</li>
            <li> have tried many things to help this, including all of the over the counter creams and pills for allergies.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better for soaking an infected hangnail or sprained ankle or helping to draw out a splinter.  </li>
            <li> Epsom salt is mostly a chemical called magnesium sulfate.  </li>
            <li> Outdoor plants love epsom salt too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a winning product for epsom salt users.</li>
            <li> The company claims the lavender scent helps you sleep better.  </li>
            <li> I walk about 6-7 miles per day and beat my feet up pretty good.</li>
            <li> one last thing, the salt comes in a really nice resealable bag!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t always been good about doing this regularly, even though a good soaking does help.</li>
            <li> Sure soaking in salts may sound \\&quot;womanly\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is amazing to remember back to my childhood when everyone knew the benefits of Epsom salts in a bath to relax, for use to exfoliate your skin and feet and as a good soak to remove toxins and even soak an injured joint or cut to help reduce infection.  </li>
            <li> I received was in a resealable bag which was nice, and dissolved easily and quickly in a hot tub of water.</li>
            <li> They melt very easily in a hot bath and offer a wonderful experience - no long swishing to get the salt to mix in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The grains of the Epsom salts are fine, but not ground up or pulverized.</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of Epsom salts is sometimes debated, but for those who enjoy an Epsom salts bath, the Epsoak Epsom Salt from the San Francisco Salt Company is a quality Epsom salt from a company that is easy to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sparkly, and if you look at it, you see that each piece is a perfect little magnesium sulfate crystal.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell you that our water bill is going up because of taking more baths instead of showers but it is well worth the time to relax and enjoy life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After adding some essential oils (I was making laundry softener) and shaking the jar to mix it all up, I am happy to report that the granules did not turn to powder.  </li>
            <li> The minerals are absorbed through the skin &amp; provide many health</li>

            <li> I was provided a free sample for purposes of review.  </li>
            <li> I received these, I noticed a HUGE difference between the ones I had been buying cheaply at the store.</li>
            <li> It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was relaxed, for sure, but don&#x27;t know if soaking in hot water alone would have been just as effective as the hot water and Epsom salt.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t honestly know whether the effect is real or psychosomatic, but they do seem to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salt by San Francisco Salt Company]] far surpasses what you may find in retail stores, and I would recommend this product to anyone seeking more relaxation in a comforting, warm bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.are the links to the other three products shown in the video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got out my blue plastic container that perfectly fits my feet, added a handful of the Epsom salts, put in enough warm water to cover my feet and opened a good book for some quiet time.  </li>
            <li> epsom salts dissolve very easily, and I found the bath very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten to know most of the store brands pretty well.</li>

            <li> In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit.  </li>
            <li> like that this product is completely clean and uniform in size from the San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling clean and relaxed, and my skin soothed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m controlling the diabetes successfully, but with a history of diabetes, my doctor wants me to avoid any more foot surgery if possible.</li>
            <li> She said that her skin felt nice and soft (I concurred!)</li>
            <li> (an ear infection - if it rains it pours), I took a full soak in the salt.</li>
            <li> (an ear infection - if it rains it pours), I took a full soak in the salt.</li>

            <li> /&gt;These are a lovely basic bath salt to pamper yourself with for a warm to hot bath at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I received one bag of San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s regular epsom salts free, in exchange for writing an honest review.  </li>
            <li> As a Senior citizen with multiple back surgeries I have found the epsons salt a wonderful soaking bath product.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re pregnant or have any health concerns, check with your doctor before using Epsom salt.&lt;br</li>

            <li> will sooth mosquito bites, bee stings, poison ivy and mild sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky, there just may be a handful or two leftover for my bath . . .</li>
            <li> but it still quickly dissolves in your tub.  </li>
            <li> I find the San Francisco Salt Company brand dissolves quicker allowing me to hop in and enjoy the water while it is still warm enough to relax in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, that even without the scientific proof of the effectiveness of Epsom salts, I do enjoy a hot soak with the salts at times after strenuous workouts.</li>
            <li> I normally use, this product appears more refined.  </li>
            <li> , it dissolves easily and is very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night really helps feel and sleep better.  </li>
            <li> The product is pure and clean (no specks or other bits in them like some brands) and works great, but unless I were giving it as a gift to someone I&#x27;d probably buy Dr. Teale&#x27;s brand at Walmart ($5 for three pounds).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an athlete and my muscles and body need relaxing and this stuff really does the trick!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Modern studies have shown that the magnesium and sulfate are actually absorbed into the body through the skin.  </li>
            <li> Magnesium Sulfate can be absorbed into the skin and it is beneficial for you to detoxify your body.  </li>
            <li> I read in an article online that soaking in an Epsom Salt bath releases magnesium ions that are absorbed by the skin, and that these ions interfere with receptors in the brain that register pain.</li>
            <li> B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] absolutely would make great \\&quot;snow\\&quot; for Christmas decorations - and you can use these for dozens of other things too.</li>
            <li> and they glitter the way that a certain type of snow does when light shines on it, so much so that my very first thought was \\&quot;wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for that long preamble, but I&#x27;m getting to the point now: my doctor has advised me to soak my feet often in warm water with dissolved Epson Salt to relieve the pain and soften my nails before clipping them.</li>
            <li> I use bath salts frequently for a good, long soak, and my wife does so even more frequently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first thing I noticed about these  [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] is that they are much finer crystals than the stuff in the waxed carton</li>
            <li> I am already hunting for more recipes and planning my next purchase.</li>
            <li> First off, I have also used [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came with a scoop, as when you pour it out of the bag, some of the crystals get stuck in the zip lock creases which makes it harder to close.</li>
            <li> first time buying form this company</li>
            <li> I used it the first day I received soaking in bath.</li>
            <li> Received it on time 2lb bag used it in my hot bathe water</li>
            <li> I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak help as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (as opposed to a hot bath without salts).  </li>
            <li> and she wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of this same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They dissolve almost instantly in hot bath water with no residue.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and relaxing in a hot bathtub.</li>
            <li> Their other products I&#x27;ve tried had lavender and eucalyptus in them, which added a nice fragrance to the air while soaking.  </li>
            <li> Epsoak is pure Magnesium Sulfate that quickly dissolves in warm or hot water and helps to relax stiff and sore muscles and relive your aches and pains.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s snow white and really just lovely to look at.  </li>
            <li> The shipping is fast and packed well, the salts themselves in a sturdy resealable bag, and one that actually does re-seal, unlike so many others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend epsom salt baths, and you simply cannot find a better option than San Francisco Salt Company.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different from what you buy in the store- the little crystals are just beautiful, and so pure that they are reflective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These bath salts are aesthetically pleasing as well - they are sparkly, white, dissolve easily and don&#x27;t leave film in the tub.  </li>
            <li> product is so pure, that it&#x27;s in crystallized form.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure, so it is unscented.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased the large bag, since she found it helped her itching.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the large bag, since she found it helped her itching.</li>
            <li> salt is 100 % pure product without any fragrance or oils added.  </li>
            <li> There is much cheaper Epsom salts, but none are as pure as San Francisco Salt Company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go around shouting about how much I love taking hot baths, but i do recommend it to my other guy friends that work out as much as me.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing too.</li>
            <li> you enjoy bath salts, and especially Epsom salts</li>
            <li> Epsoak really did work for me...</li>
            <li> Yep, I get the itchies on my hands till I am ready to kill.</li>
            <li> and I was AMAZED at how relaxing and very soothing</li>
            <li> Mod Podge CS11202</li>
            <li> It does not matter the slightest to me, in fact their purity may contribute to their ease of use and ready</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a versatile relaxation</li>
            <li> Definitely worth considering if you want more of a \\&quot;spa\\&quot; treatment rather than just a plain epsom soak.&lt;br /&gt;[manufacturer</li>
            <li> I had to spare some for a dish that I put my favorite small samples of nonreactive minerals and crystals in, it looks so much better than regular salt.</li>
            <li> : my experience with this particular salt - two days after I got it, I developed hives, right on schedule.</li>
            <li> These are the plain unscented version, which is perfect for soaking sprains or for people who are sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed these salts as much as their other products, but the price seems a little high to me.  </li>
            <li> Just like most of the other reviewers here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried several of their other products, and this one has the same high quality and great packaging.  </li>
            <li> have made a quick video of four different salts that I had the privilege to review for the San Francisco Salt company</li>
            <li> While this epsom salt from San Francisco Salt Company is quite a bit more expensive, it is also of much better</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this product from the San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li> but it is a naturally occurring pure mineral compound of magnesium and sulfate.</li>
            <li> I had hives really bad this week, and the best I felt was in this soak and the detox soak they have</li>

            <li> and I now realize that the baths help my joints and back a lot more and really relaxes my tight muscles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it is that the foot bath with dissolved Epson Salt gives better results than just plain warm water, but that&#x27;s definitely the case.</li>

            <li> I followed the directions of 2 cups for a regular-sized tub and soaked for at least 12 minutes.  </li>
            <li> She reports softer skin after bathing with these salts, and I think even I have to admit that the thick calluses on my feet seem to soften a bit after epsom salt</li>
            <li> my muscles weren&#x27;t as stiff &amp; painful the next day.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s less expensive to soften a bathtub of water than all of the water we use in the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Have skin allergies and epsom salt helps a lot from itching. Very relaxing too.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  No complaints.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 2 lb. bag which yields about 4 cups.  They also included a little sample of their &amp;#34;French Grey Salt.&amp;#34;  I have not tried said food salt, but it is a nice gesture and appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grains of the Epsom salts are fine, but not ground up or pulverized. There was no &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; in my bag after I emptied the salt in to a glass jar.  After adding some essential oils (I was making laundry softener) and shaking the jar to mix it all up, I am happy to report that the granules did not turn to powder.  I am very pleased and even though I have not yet expended my 2 lb. bag--  I am already hunting for more recipes and planning my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, after a busy day of running around, you just want to soak your tired feet.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons I was so pleased when the San Francisco Salt Company sent me a sample of this Epsoak Epsom Salt product to try.  I got out my blue plastic container that perfectly fits my feet, added a handful of the Epsom salts, put in enough warm water to cover my feet and opened a good book for some quiet time.  Lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others in my family have used this product as 2 cups of Epsom salt in a tub of warm water to help soak away the muscle aches from overdoing on a project.  The salts completely dissolve and are no problem to totally rinse out of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product is completely clean and uniform in size from the San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li> The bag was not completely sealed so the salt was all over inside the box when it arrives. I am not going to use the product.</li>
            <li> I received one bag of San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s regular epsom salts free, in exchange for writing an honest review.  I&#x27;ve also tried several of their other products, and this one has the same high quality and great packaging.  I love using epsom salts in my bath because of the detoxifying qualities and because they help with sore muscles and skin conditions.  Their other products I&#x27;ve tried had lavender and eucalyptus in them, which added a nice fragrance to the air while soaking.  These are the plain unscented version, which is perfect for soaking sprains or for people who are sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed these salts as much as their other products, but the price seems a little high to me.  The product is pure and clean (no specks or other bits in them like some brands) and works great, but unless I were giving it as a gift to someone I&#x27;d probably buy Dr. Teale&#x27;s brand at Walmart ($5 for three pounds).</li>
            <li> First off, I have also used [[ASIN:B004GINGOY Minera Dead Sea Salt Bulk 5lb Bag Fine Grain, 100% Certified Pure and Natural]] and I love it!  I&#x27;m an athlete and my muscles and body need relaxing and this stuff really does the trick!!  Before ever using salts before, I thought that it was all a gimmick.  You honestly have to try it for yourself to become a believer! Sure soaking in salts may sound \\&quot;womanly\\&quot; but as a guy, i can honestly say I love it!  I wouldn&#x27;t go around shouting about how much I love taking hot baths, but i do recommend it to my other guy friends that work out as much as me.  Girls, buy this for your guy and MAKE him use it!! This is truly a great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh one last thing, the salt comes in a really nice resealable bag!!</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of Epsom salts is sometimes debated, but for those who enjoy an Epsom salts bath, the Epsoak Epsom Salt from the San Francisco Salt Company is a quality Epsom salt from a company that is easy to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Epsom salt I received was in a resealable bag which was nice, and dissolved easily and quickly in a hot tub of water. I&#x27;ll admit, that even without the scientific proof of the effectiveness of Epsom salts, I do enjoy a hot soak with the salts at times after strenuous workouts. Regardless if it is a placebo effect or not, I like them and find it a relaxing way to relive stress when tired and sore.  I have used a number of types of Epsom salts, and this product stands out as good as you are going to get when dealing with salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy bath salts, and especially Epsom salts, I highly recommend this product from the San Francisco Salt Company. I&#x27;m thinking of trying some of their other products as well.</li>
            <li> As a Senior citizen with multiple back surgeries I have found the epsons salt a wonderful soaking bath product.  I do not like atifical smilling bath products so the epsons salts is perfect for easing my aches and pains with make me smelling like something besides me.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, a few days before a beach vacation, I hit my toe on an unmovable object. My toe instantly swelled up &amp; my toenail lifted up &amp; away from its bed, but didn&#x27;t come off. When we arrived at our condo, the toe &amp; toenail were still looking bad &amp; feeling bad too, so I dissolved a cup of Epsom salt in very, very warm water, as hot as I could stand it (the warmer the water, the more germs it kills) and soaked my foot 20 minutes every evening. If you have time, soaking twice a day is better. After about 5 days of soaking, my toe &amp; toenail looked much, much better. Epsom salt will help prevent infection, drain the wound, &amp; heal it faster. It is dehydrating so you might need to use lotion to counteract the drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My muscles were tired &amp; sore from a lot of gardening &amp; planting the other day so I decided to test [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salt 2 Lbs]] in my bath that evening. I dissolved 2 cups of Epsoak Epsom Salt in very warm bath water and soaked for 15 minutes.  Don&#x27;t use soap because it will interfere with the action of the salt. Also, if you have arthritis you should move those joints  after the soak as much as possible to help prevent congestion in the joints. Epsoak really did work for me...my muscles weren&#x27;t as stiff &amp; painful the next day. I&#x27;m glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Epsom salt is not really salt but it is a naturally occurring pure mineral compound of magnesium and sulfate. It&#x27;s a natural remedy that has been used hundreds of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned quite a bit about Epsom salt when I did some research for this review. The minerals are absorbed through the skin &amp; provide many health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my review title states, &#x27;Epsom salt is not just for tired muscles&#x27;...it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Eases stress  &amp; relaxes the body&lt;br /&gt;~Eases pain, relieves inflammation &amp; relieves muscle cramps&lt;br /&gt;~Makes insulin more effective&lt;br /&gt;~Eliminates toxins from the body &amp; eases muscle pain&lt;br /&gt;~Relieves symptoms of athletes foot&lt;br /&gt;~Helps draw out splinters&lt;br /&gt;~Removes foot odor&lt;br /&gt;~Prevents or eases migraine headaches&lt;br /&gt;~and more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsom salt can also be used in gardening, crafts &amp;  household use too (do an internet search to see how it&#x27;s used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re pregnant or have any health concerns, check with your doctor before using Epsom salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been disappointed in any  San Fransisco Salt Company product I&#x27;ve received for reviewing purposes...I&#x27;ve been so happy with them that I&#x27;ve purchased many more for myself &amp; gifts too.

            <li> Good price for the size. I use it in my daughter&#x27;s bath at night to help her sleep better. It would be nice if it came with a scoop, as when you pour it out of the bag, some of the crystals get stuck in the zip lock creases which makes it harder to close. But no big deal, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I was provided a free sample for purposes of review.  I am not affiliated with or paid by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so pure, that it&#x27;s in crystallized form.  It&#x27;s sparkly, and if you look at it, you see that each piece is a perfect little magnesium sulfate crystal.  It&#x27;s snow white and really just lovely to look at.  I had to spare some for a dish that I put my favorite small samples of nonreactive minerals and crystals in, it looks so much better than regular salt. They make a beautiful presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bath, it dissolves easily and is very relaxing.  It leaves me feeling clean and relaxed, and my skin soothed.  I had hives really bad this week, and the best I felt was in this soak and the detox soak they have (Which is also really wonderful!.)  I used a bit in my hair too, and indeed, it is does increase volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be great to use in bath salt mixtures to give in gifts.  It&#x27;s very different from what you buy in the store- the little crystals are just beautiful, and so pure that they are reflective.  It&#x27;s pure, so it is unscented.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.  While I do use these magnesium sulfate salts in my garden, these are much more refined than most bags of Epsom salts, hence the expense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this Epsom salt. It is a multipurpose household item that everyone should have. The price is competitive to what you might find in stores.</li>
            <li> These salts are wonderful! I have never ordered food-grade epsom salts before, and I definitely notice a difference when using them in a bath.</li>
            <li> Epson Salts make for a great way to relax and invigorate your body and skin, but I didn&#x27;t really know why or how. A little search on Google and I discovered some basic things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epson salts make for a \\&quot;relaxing bath, a face scrub and a hair volumizer. It&#x27;s also a miracle cure-all, helping to remove splinters and reduce swelling of sprains and bruises\\&quot;. Sprains and Bruises? That&#x27;s why it feels so great after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Epsom salts is good for relaxing muscles and drawing toxins from the body, sedative for the nervous system, reduces swelling, relaxes muscles, and is a natural emollient, exfoliator, and much more\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relaxing muscles, drawing out toxins, sedates the nervous system, reduces swelling, is an emollient and more? This is now a regular ritual for me at the end of a day or workout. Product generously supplied by San Francisco Bath Salt Company.</li>
            <li> This San Francisco Salt Company Epsoak Epsom Salt  is superb. There is nothing to equal a bath in epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) if you have had a hard day, perhaps exercised harder than usual, or just want to completely relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsoak  has no discernible aroma, and dissolves almost instantly...there is no waving your hand in the water to dissolve the crystals, the movement in the water will do it...and you will feel tension evaporate in your body in minutes, and your skin afterwards will feel silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a purification process that one can sense happening. While it relaxes, it also purifies from toxins, and as a city-dweller I get enough toxins. It also can reduce any swelling, and has a pleasing effect on the nervous system. I highly recommend epsom salt baths, and you simply cannot find a better option than San Francisco Salt Company.  The shipping is fast and packed well, the salts themselves in a sturdy resealable bag, and one that actually does re-seal, unlike so many others. This is a health spa session in your own bath tub, and you can also use it in a foot bath if all you have is tired feet, however...why not indulge and treat all of you!</li>
            <li> A few years ago I developed a springtime problem - HIVES. Yep, I get the itchies on my hands till I am ready to kill. Between my fingers, across my palms, I burn, I itch, I HURT! Over time, I also experience them in the creases of my legs and elbows, where I sit - anywhere I get warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many things to help this, including all of the over the counter creams and pills for allergies. My doctor even prescribed stronger antihistamines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Till a friend suggested soaking them in simple Epsom Salts. I began by following her instructions, simply soaking my hands in the solution as hot as I could stand until it cooled off. The cooling effect actually is a part of drawing out the toxins ... and after a single treatment, my hands are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I keep Epsom Salts on hand at all times, either for a single soaking of my hands (and continued instant relief) or for a total body luxury spa. I&#x27;ve gotten to know most of the store brands pretty well. So, when San Francisco Salt company sent me an e-mail offering to let me \\&quot;try\\&quot; their product and consider it for a review, I was more than happy to comply. I had lots of experience with the salts already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received these, I noticed a HUGE difference between the ones I had been buying cheaply at the store. Unlike the cheaper brands, these are very fine salts. They melt very easily in a hot bath and offer a wonderful experience - no long swishing to get the salt to mix in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first looked at the price for two pounds, I was a bit taken aback, especially with the shipping. How could I recommend a product of this price. Then I carefully clicked all of the selections and realized that the best buy is the ten or twenty pound bulk salt - both ship prime, making this a very good deal as well as a very nice salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re: my experience with this particular salt - two days after I got it, I developed hives, right on schedule. Since I wasn&#x27;t feeling well that evening (an ear infection - if it rains it pours), I took a full soak in the salt. By the time I got out of the tub, my hands were still red, but no longer itchy and tender. Once again, the Epsom Salts worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I received a small amount as a complimentary sample, I ended up ordering the 20 pound size to keep in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited - my granddaughter developed hives this spring and I was especially happy I had purchased the large bag, since she found it helped her itching. We didn&#x27;t find out what caused them, so we will be keeping this on hand for the future as well. So Grandma and Granddaughter both approve this.ing (an ear infection - if it rains it pours), I took a full soak in the salt.

            <li> Received it on time 2lb bag used it in my hot bathe water and I was AMAZED at how relaxing and very soothing it was doing this in A 20 to 30 minute bathe was just what I needed to get me going for the week it left me feeling highly rejuvenated and relaxed Awwwwww the comfort it brings I recommend this and gi&#x27;ve all stars!</li>
            <li> I have a bad back and after a couple of back surgeries I learned a number strategies that help my back feel better. One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night really helps feel and sleep better.  Adding epsom salt to the bath water has been helpful, and recently I have tried  Epsoak Epsom salt from San Francisco Bath Salt Company.  Epsoak Epsom has fine grains and dissolved quickly. It is unscented.  The salt comes in a resealable plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Francisco Bath Salt Company also makes scented salts. If you like Lavender [[ASIN:B00AYNNX34 Lavender Bath Salts]] and if you prefer mint scent [[ASIN:B004MBJKRC Muscle Soak Bath Salts]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the hot soak reduces pain and relieve muscle cramps in my back. I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak help as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use one or two hand fulls of salt per bath, so one 2 pound bag lasts quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an evaluation bag of Epsoak Epsom salt from San Francisco Bath Salt Company for evaluation and an honest review. I have been using salt soaks for a couple of weeks now. In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit.  I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (as opposed to a hot bath without salts).  It takes fewer strokes with a pumice sponge to get my feet totally smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the use in the tub, I also tried using a bit of salt as skin exfoliator. It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I like the effects of adding salts to my bath and will continue to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always kept epsom salts around the house.  Nothing is better for soaking an infected hangnail or sprained ankle or helping to draw out a splinter.  Sadly, the last time I went to buy them locally all I could find was a waxed carton containing relatively huge, vaguely purple \\&quot;lavender\\&quot; crystals, not at all what I was after.  Nothing could be farther from that than these  [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] that arrived on my doorstep a couple of weeks ago from the San Francisco Salt Company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing I noticed about these  [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] is that they are much finer crystals than the stuff in the waxed carton and they glitter the way that a certain type of snow does when light shines on it, so much so that my very first thought was \\&quot;wouldn&#x27;t that make great snow for Christmas decorations!\\&quot;  As it turns out,  [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] absolutely would make great \\&quot;snow\\&quot; for Christmas decorations - and you can use these for dozens of other things too. Here are just a few I&#x27;ve found -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Epsom salt is mostly a chemical called magnesium sulfate.  It is great for plants.  Feed your houseplants monthly with water to which you&#x27;ve added 2 tablespoons of epsom salt per gallon of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Outdoor plants love epsom salt too.  See the Epsom Salt Council website for specifics of how much &amp; how often to feed your peppers, tomatoes, roses, lawn and other outdoor plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Add a pinch of epsom salt to each hole as you plant your bulbs for spring flowering to keep critters from feasting on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A little [[ASIN:B00178QQJ8 Mod Podge CS11202 Original 16-Ounce Glue,  Gloss Finish]] and some  [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] will have you turning out luminarias, artificial snowballs, greeting cards and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Combine  [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salts]] and warm conditioner to volumize your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Add a small handful to your shower gel for a natural body scrub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 2 tablespoons dissolved  in a cup of water will sooth mosquito bites, bee stings, poison ivy and mild sunburn.  Soak a cotton washcloth or pad and apply as a compress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m lucky, there just may be a handful or two leftover for my bath . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!r a natural body scrub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 2 tablespoons dissolved  in a cup of water will sooth mosquito bites, bee stings, poison ivy and mild sunburn.  Soak a cotton washcloth or pad and apply as a compress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m lucky, there just may be a handful or two leftover for my bath . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Anyone doing Zumba (aerobic exercise to Latin rhythms)knows what a workout you can get.  Since I haven&#x27;t used Epsom Salt before,I was looking forward to something to soothe my tired/exhausted body after the hour-long class.  The  salt is very nicely packaged in a resealable, heavy-duty plastic bag.  I followed the directions of 2 cups for a regular-sized tub and soaked for at least 12 minutes.  I was relaxed, for sure, but don&#x27;t know if soaking in hot water alone would have been just as effective as the hot water and Epsom salt.  For that reason, I could only give three stars.</li>
            <li> I use bath salts frequently for a good, long soak, and my wife does so even more frequently. We found the San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s bath salts, including these epsom salts, to be among the best we have used. We got them in a sampler box provided by the company for review, and it worked -- we will use them in the future as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epsom salts dissolve very easily, and I found the bath very relaxing. My wife reports that her headaches went away after bathing with these epsom salts, and aches in her neck also disappeared. She reports softer skin after bathing with these salts, and I think even I have to admit that the thick calluses on my feet seem to soften a bit after epsom salt baths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsom salts have been used to relax muscles in baths and soothe sore feet for centuries. I don&#x27;t honestly know whether the effect is real or psychosomatic, but they do seem to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsom salts -- which are made up simply of magnesium sulfate -- may be obtained from natural sources or produced in a simple industrial process by mixing sulfuric acid with magnesium oxide. Since the company does not state they are naturally sourced, I presume these are manufactured. It does not matter the slightest to me, in fact their purity may contribute to their ease of use and ready solubility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a winning product for epsom salt users. You may also want to try one that I liked even better -- [[ASIN:B004MBJKRC Muscle Soak Bath Salts]], which are epsom salts scented with a bit of eucalyptus and peppermint.</li>
            <li> Epsom salts have long been used as a soak to relieve tired muscles and hydrate the skin.  My grandmother kept a bag in the bathroom closet and used it for both foot and tub baths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modern studies have shown that the magnesium and sulfate are actually absorbed into the body through the skin.  The minerals also prevent the skin from pruning when taking a long soak and relieve itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsoak is pure epsom salts, simply magnesium sulfate heptahydrate with no added ingredients.  It can be used as a bath salt as-is or other ingredients such as sweet almond oil and fragrant essential oils can be added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A review sample of Epsoak was provided by the San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3MTLOALTC4I49]]I have gotten out of the habit of taking a long hot soaking bath to relax my muscles and back in favor of the faster shower.  I started using these bath salts and I now realize that the baths help my joints and back a lot more and really relaxes my tight muscles.  This Epsom Salt from the San Francisco Bath Salt Company reminds me of how much I liked taking baths and of the therapeutic value of just relaxing in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Epsoak is pure Magnesium Sulfate that quickly dissolves in warm or hot water and helps to relax stiff and sore muscles and relive your aches and pains.  You put two cups of Epsom Salt into a warm bath and then soak for 12 minutes.  It is also great for soaking your tired feet after a long day of standing or walking a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salt is 100 % pure product without any fragrance or oils added.  It is a medium grind of salt but it still quickly dissolves in your tub.  It is amazing to remember back to my childhood when everyone knew the benefits of Epsom salts in a bath to relax, for use to exfoliate your skin and feet and as a good soak to remove toxins and even soak an injured joint or cut to help reduce infection.  In today&#x27;s world we don&#x27;t take the time to relax and unwind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking in a tub with Epsom salt can relieve arthritis, muscle and nerve pain.  Magnesium Sulfate can be absorbed into the skin and it is beneficial for you to detoxify your body.  It is time to revitalize and pamper yourself with a nice relaxing and therapeutic salt bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have made a quick video of four different salts that I had the privilege to review for the San Francisco Salt company and I hope you take the time to watch it.  I have listed the links to the other products in the video for your information.  My wife and I liked them all and I can tell you that our water bill is going up because of taking more baths instead of showers but it is well worth the time to relax and enjoy life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the links to the other three products shown in the video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minera Dead Sea Salt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AMO22SM Minera Dead Sea Salt Bulk 10 Lb Bag Fine Grain, 100% Certified Pure Mineral Bath Salt]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muscle Soak Bulk Bath Salts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004MBJKRC Muscle Soak Bath Salts 2 Lbs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep lavender Bath Salts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AYNNX34 Sleep Lavender Bath Salts 2 Lbs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like you to know that I was supplied samples of these products and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.are the links to the other three products shown in the video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minera Dead Sea Salt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AMO22SM Minera Dead Sea Salt Bulk 10 Lb Bag Fine Grain, 100% Certified Pure Mineral Bath Salt]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muscle Soak Bulk Bath Salts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004MBJKRC Muscle Soak Bath Salts 2 Lbs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep lavender Bath Salts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AYNNX34 Sleep Lavender Bath Salts 2 Lbs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like you to know that I was supplied samples of these products and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> Diabetes and a tendency toward ingrown toenails are not a good combination, but that&#x27;s the hand I was dealt, so I&#x27;ve learned to live with it. One of my big toenails has been surgically removed by a podiatrist, but that was years ago, before I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I&#x27;m controlling the diabetes successfully, but with a history of diabetes, my doctor wants me to avoid any more foot surgery if possible. My wife has trained to cut my toenails without causing a break in the skin which could lead to a dangerous infection, but I often have some pain from my toenails trying to become ingrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for that long preamble, but I&#x27;m getting to the point now: my doctor has advised me to soak my feet often in warm water with dissolved Epson Salt to relieve the pain and soften my nails before clipping them. I haven&#x27;t always been good about doing this regularly, even though a good soaking does help. I recently used Epsoak Epson Salt dissolved in warm water to soak my feet in a small tub we use for that purpose. I used a handful of the Epson Salt, which was approximately 1/8 cup. I&#x27;m not sure why it is that the foot bath with dissolved Epson Salt gives better results than just plain warm water, but that&#x27;s definitely the case. I read in an article online that soaking in an Epsom Salt bath releases magnesium ions that are absorbed by the skin, and that these ions interfere with receptors in the brain that register pain. Whatever the mechanism, it does relieve the soreness in my feet and toes, and it softens the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give two thumbs up for the Epsoak Epsom Salt product. I know it has other uses besides foot baths, but for me, that&#x27;s enough to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Ordered Epsom salt. Got Epsom salt. No complaints. Packaged well.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift along with this company&#x27;s [[ASIN:B004GINGOY Dead Sea Salt]] product. Since I don&#x27;t use such things, I re-gifted this to a female friend who uses bath products extensively. Her verdict was that San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s EPSOAK EPSOM SALT is as good as any she&#x27;s used and she has no complaints. She said that her skin felt nice and soft (I concurred!) and she wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy more of this same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I HAVE used Epsom salt to soak my feet before, so I borrowed some of this back and did so. Awesome! I walk about 6-7 miles per day and beat my feet up pretty good. They also get itchy from being closed in shoes all day. After a single soaking of 20 minutes, my feet felt pretty refreshed. I tried a second test a few days later with just hot water, and that was a huge disappointment - my feet got warm, which is nice, but generally didn&#x27;t have that softened feel from the Epsom soaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5 stars. Just like most of the other reviewers here!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but the price though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epsom salt for years for foot soaking, but usually just get the generic store brand. While this epsom salt from San Francisco Salt Company is quite a bit more expensive, it is also of much better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grain size of the version I used was indicated on the package as \\&quot;medium.\\&quot; That proved to be a far larger grain size than the epsom salt I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it still dissolved readily in warm water. There was also no clumping of the dry material, an issue I&#x27;ve often had with the store brand stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grain size proved to be a benefit - I used some in my hand as a salt rub for my feet. It worked very well deal with callouses and rough spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any appreciable difference in the end result when using this versus the store brand. Epsom salt is, after all, just epsom salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costly, but the grain size, the ability to use it as a rub, and the lack of clumping does distinguish this from store brand epsom salts. Definitely worth considering if you want more of a \\&quot;spa\\&quot; treatment rather than just a plain epsom soak.&lt;br /&gt;[manufacturer provided sample for review]</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I used a tablespoon of this in warm/hot water to fade dark spots on my hand. It worked for me.</li>
            <li> We have used Epsom salt in our family for years.  My mother uses it for relaxing and soaking her feet after a long day.  I myself have bathed in an Epsom salt bath after a long day of exploring while traveling to relax my tired muscles.  It&#x27;s really a versatile relaxation product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I believe sets [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salt by San Francisco Salt Company]] apart from other brands appears to be the quality of the salt.  Compared to more commonly found store brand Epsom salt I normally use, this product appears more refined.  I find the San Francisco Salt Company brand dissolves quicker allowing me to hop in and enjoy the water while it is still warm enough to relax in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the quality of [[ASIN:B00B7QEBHE Epsoak Epsom Salt by San Francisco Salt Company]] far surpasses what you may find in retail stores, and I would recommend this product to anyone seeking more relaxation in a comforting, warm bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review. A review in exchange for the review sample was not promised. The views and opinions expressed in this review are my own, and in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor.</li>
            <li> I love these in my bath as we have hard well water, and these soften the water and my skin.  There is a noticeable difference in both.  And it&#x27;s less expensive to soften a bathtub of water than all of the water we use in the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bath salts are aesthetically pleasing as well - they are sparkly, white, dissolve easily and don&#x27;t leave film in the tub.  If you want scented salts, the company also makes lavender and a mint scent.  When you want a bit of aromatherapy, the scented variety are splendid.  The company claims the lavender scent helps you sleep better.  However, there are times you don&#x27;t want a scent, so this non-scented salt is great for then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a lovely basic bath salt to pamper yourself with for a warm to hot bath at the end of the day.  I just put a handful in - about 1/2 cup - and it seems like plenty. Also, work well to pour some on your damp, warm washcloth for exfoliation. It&#x27;s a non-guilty pleasure to bathe in these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> There is much cheaper Epsom salts, but none are as pure as San Francisco Salt Company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crystals in this product are gorgeous, clear and perfectly formed. They dissolve almost instantly in hot bath water with no residue. The generic and Walgreen brands take much longer to dissolve and leave a residue. San Francisco Salt Company has landed on some of the coolest packages I&#x27;ve seen for bath salts. The zipper closure bag is super thick and closes firmly and water tight. The clear bag shows off the crystals nicely. I even like the simple label and the lighter shade of Tiffany blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Epsom salt is a luxury. It is soothing and relaxing in a hot bathtub. In comparison to cheaper salts, this does not dry out my skin or make it itchy after soaking for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
