            <li>I am pleased with my purchase and recommend them to anyone with straight toenails.</li>
            <li>My guess is it would work better on large men who do a lot of work with their hands or have really gnarly toenails.  </li>

            <li>the blades don&#x27;t align properly and so you don&#x27;t get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>These are high quality and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>You find the skin tag you want to remove and pinch it until you can&#x27;t feel yourself being pinched then work the clippers so that you have the skin tag angled on the two best sides to have it flush with the skin and then press slowly and firmly.  </li>

            <li>This little clipper is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These have a good sharp edge and are strong enough to cut not only my fingernails but my tough old toenails as well.</li>

            <li> This little clipper is easy to use.  No excessive pressure needed to clip.  There is just enough curve to help shape your nails and it&#x27;s sharp enough to cut not shatter.  I&#x27;ve had expensive German clippers and these are far better.</li>
            <li> Very, very sharp edge so you get a very smooth effortless cut. Made out of heavy gauge steel. I&#x27;ve had a few different brands and these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of clippers and lots of problems. These clippers beat them all. They work with light pressure and are sharp.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for straight edge toenail clippers to replace the ones that my father had given me many years ago.  They lasted a long time but finally gave up the ghost and broke.  So when I found these on Amazon they seemed to be exactly what l had been searching for.  The curved type cause me to get ingrown toenails.  Besides eliminating that,  they are sturdy and do the job easily.  I am pleased with my purchase and recommend them to anyone with straight toenails.</li>
            <li> With the slightly convex blades, it can make the nail edge a bit uneven as you try to match up the ends of each clipping.  Solid cutting on thick nails but is difficult to slide under very curved or tight nail beds and you have to be careful judging where the cut will be with its outwardly curved cutting edge.  My guess is it would work better on large men who do a lot of work with their hands or have really gnarly toenails.  For me, more like a table saw when I needed a band saw.</li>
            <li> that there&#x27;s a well-built toenail clipper, man</li>
            <li> I am a nail technician and I do not like this toe nail clippers...the blades don&#x27;t align properly and so you don&#x27;t get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a clipper with a straight cutter which is impossible to find at other retail stores. Any concerns about the slight reversal in the curvature of the cutter were put aside as soon as she tried it. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Was glad to find these! And mine are straight edge. I was actually hoping for the ones that were convex but these do the trick. At Amazon I got two for what I paid at a beauty supply for one. These have a good sharp edge and are strong enough to cut not only my fingernails but my tough old toenails as well. Very happy</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> Got it fast and it works great.The price was very low for such a good clipper</li>
            <li> I bought one of these so I could clip off skin tags.  It works like a charm especially having the cutting edge curve to the outside.  With a regular nail clippers the outside ends curve out and so you can&#x27;t clip the skin tag flush with the skin but with this one it works perfect.  You find the skin tag you want to remove and pinch it until you can&#x27;t feel yourself being pinched then work the clippers so that you have the skin tag angled on the two best sides to have it flush with the skin and then press slowly and firmly.  Once you have the clippers pressed all the way close you must give it some extra flex and slowly, very slowly pull away from the skin and the tag comes with it.  It bleeds a little bit but with some tissue and a clotting pencil it&#x27;s no big deal plus you&#x27;re not applying tonics or treatments for up to two weeks to see if the tag falls off.  Works great under arm pits and in other hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Love it finally a clipper the can cut through my toe nails like butter so glad I bought this clipper</li>
            <li> These clippers are fine and will suit my needs. But I wanted to warn folks that these are &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; straight - with a very slight outward curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost my trusty old clippers I&#x27;ve used for a long time for my hard-to-cut large toenails. Looked at several on Amazon and decided on these. The description and the packaging all said straight. But these do have a slight curve to the clipper. This curve isn&#x27;t nearly as much as a curved clipper has, and the curve is opposite that of a the curved clippers (curving out at the center instead of inward). I didn&#x27;t ding the stars because it&#x27;s sturdy, but wanted folks to know that the product isn&#x27;t actually straight-edged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However these feel as sturdy as my old set and quite sharp (clipped better than Old Trusty). I think I can make them work, but I&#x27;ve always used a straight clipper instead of something curved. Can&#x27;t beat the price of $4, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the edge  will hold up over the years like my last ones. If you really need straight, go with the Tweezerman (twice the cost) which was going to be my other choice.</li>
            <li> Great product. Straight Edge just as they say.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described. Good quality, sharp cutting edges, I am very happy with the performance. I will never go back to using clippers with the conventional concave shape.</li>

            <li> Seems to work well enough.  Wish I could get one with a convex blade.</li>
            <li> the unfortunate part for me is: I bought two of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it says it is a straight edged clippers, but  it is  not! There is a slight outward curve to the blades which makes making a straight cut impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t cup my nails with these.</li>
            <li> Item helpful for it&#x27;s intended use.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers and I&#x27;m happy to find some with a straight edge.  Looked all over town and could only find the curved ones.  These are high quality and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> A great clipper!! I have been looking for a clipper that would cut in a controlled, safe &amp; accurate manner; this one ends my lifelong search!</li>
            <li> I have always felt that one nail clipper was about as good as another but this product has changed my mind.  My doctor recommended the reverse curve cutting edge to minimize ingrown nails.  This is a very well made, precisely functioning clipper that i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Friend has a slightly outwardly curved one I like of a different brand, which I can&#x27;t find to buy.  This one seems the same but with another name.  Works fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets of toenail clippers simultaneously to evaluate them: DENCO and TOOLWORX. The DENCO clippers did not cut cleanly and left very ragged edges. The TOOLWORX clippers cut very cleanly and I will be purchasing those going forward instead of the DENCO.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted with great quality and function!  Thank you!  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Work very well, as advertised.  I would recommend them for men&#x27;s tough toenails and to avoid hangnails.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Excellent to use.</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for the flat front large clippers.&lt;br /&gt;These look fairly well made and we&#x27;ll see how they last.</li>
            <li> These are great, very sharp and work very well.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, this toe nail clipper has a slightly convex edge as opposed to a straight edge. This is what I was looking for. The unit is solidly built of high quality and the cutting edge is very sharp. I am totally pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> These are not straight edged clippers. There is a slight outward curve to the blades which makes making a straight cut impossible. The curve is opposite of even a normal curved clipper blade is. It&#x27;s unnatural the way it curves. I am not happy with these but they do cut well (as far as the cleanness and ease of cutting the nail goes). Due to the unnatural backward curve to these clippers, I cannot recommend them for nails. I am very unhappy with that aspect of them. They do cut cleanly so I do give them that. They seem well built and easy to move the lever around and flip it so that it is in cutting position. So I give them 2 stars. 1 for working as intended and 1 for a clean, easy cut. Nothing more than that.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  This is an excellent clipper and makes a straight cut.</li>
