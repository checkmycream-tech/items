            <li>color nail polish is suitable when you want a gentler nail color.  </li>
            <li>Moonlight &amp; Roses is very light.</li>
            <li>This color is just perfect for doing French manicure or just wearing by itself.</li>
            <li>Neglige is much better.  </li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for more colors to come out.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I got moonlight &amp; roses mostly for layering purposes.</li>
            <li>While I love these products, I must warn you to NOT peel the polish off.  </li>
            <li>I love Shellac and this is a must have color.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>It has an iridescent feel to it that I love.</li>

            <li>It can be used alone or over top another darker color for a pretty shimmer.</li>
            <li>I used it on its own (2 coats) and as 2nd coat of darker colors to give it an interesting iridescence/shine.</li>
            <li>This is the best color for short nails as I have short nail beds as well and strong color I like to avoid.</li>
            <li>Looks good over other colors as well.</li>
            <li>If you are just starting you don&#x27;t have to be as exact about putting it on, which I love about it.</li>
            <li>CND Shellac is the answer to great, long lasting mani!</li>
            <li>Love the sheer color.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty color...</li>
            <li>You do a lot of damage to your natural nail so go have it soaked off - its worth saving your nails!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more sparkly than I like, and the pink tone is a bit on the orange-y side.  </li>
            <li>Lovely color; looks prettier on than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>really recommend this color and product.</li>
            <li>Good color to wear over other colors like said above.</li>
            <li>I originally thought i was buying WHITE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen that this color over black pool creates a gorgeous deep purple shade that I want to try.</li>
            <li>I love this shade by itself, but can&#x27;t wait to layer it over dark colors to create new shades!</li>
            <li>This is the MAIN reason I like this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shines a gentle rainbow of colors and enhances a natural nail look.  </li>
            <li>New.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a sheer white/sparkle that has a light pink sheen to it.</li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>The glow has some pink in it like you see on the bottle but end result will be much more sheer than what&#x27;s on the bottle (opaque white).</li>
            <li>Have used it mainly with red shades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for an iridescent glow and this delivers an interesting pink pearly look.  </li>
            <li>NOTE TO USER - put base, color, and top coats in hot water before using!</li>

            <li> It is subtle enough to wear if you are not ready for the commitment of 2 weeks of a bold color.</li>
            <li> I used the base, 1 coat of this, 1 coat of studio white on tips, then one coat of this again and top coat.  </li>
            <li> has a very pink tone to it.</li>
            <li> The iridescence is a dark pink with some green to it.</li>
            <li> Came in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I think it should also create a dark green turquoise layered over midnight swim.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I can&#x27;t see ever actually wearing this color.</li>
            <li> This will thin out the gels, and you WILL notice less lifting and peeling.</li>
            <li> I would recommend you try at least once.</li>

            <li> I originally thought i was buying WHITE! not at allt he case. It is a shimmery pearl. i like it becuase when the cuticle starts to grow out, there is not an obvious transition from nail to gel. This is the MAIN reason I like this product. NOTE TO USER - put base, color, and top coats in hot water before using! This will thin out the gels, and you WILL notice less lifting and peeling. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> This color is just perfect for doing French manicure or just wearing by itself. If you are just starting you don&#x27;t have to be as exact about putting it on, which I love about it. I will continue to buy this product as it has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; when I can&#x27;t decide what color. I would recommend you try at least once.</li>
            <li> Like all Shellac products, this one is shiny and lasts forever.  However, I&#x27;m not a fan of the color.  It&#x27;s more sparkly than I like, and the pink tone is a bit on the orange-y side.  Neglige is much better.  Sadly, I can&#x27;t see ever actually wearing this color.</li>
            <li> Love this color. I put it over my darker colors and it looks great.  I LOVE  CND Shellac! Can&#x27;t wait for more colors to come out.</li>
            <li> New. Came in less than a week. This color is actually white pearl. It matches the color of my motorcycle. Love it.</li>
            <li> I got moonlight &amp; roses mostly for layering purposes. I&#x27;ve seen that this color over black pool creates a gorgeous deep purple shade that I want to try. I think it should also create a dark green turquoise layered over midnight swim. I haven&#x27;t tried the layering yet, only a french mani with one coat of moonlight &amp; roses,which I&#x27;ve uploaded. It looks like something of a cross between negligee and beau. Nice color depth with just one coat. The iridescence is a dark pink with some green to it. I love this shade by itself, but can&#x27;t wait to layer it over dark colors to create new shades!</li>
            <li> CND Shellac is the answer to great, long lasting mani! Just follow directions and done for 2 weeks!! LOVE IT!! :-)</li>
            <li> Lovely color; looks prettier on than I expected.  It can be used alone or over top another darker color for a pretty shimmer.</li>
            <li> While I love these products, I must warn you to NOT peel the polish off.  You do a lot of damage to your natural nail so go have it soaked off - its worth saving your nails!</li>
            <li> Love the sheer color. I use it over negligee for a shimmery neutral/sheer color</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful. For those who already know the product and use the shellac product is expected and used correctly is perfect in appearance and durability</li>
            <li> I love Shellac and this is a must have color. The price is good, the shipping is great and I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;This has a very pink tone to it.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice finish for darker colors! Gives a bit of shine and gloss, but not tacky! Have used it mainly with red shades.</li>
            <li> Beautiful layered over many colors. Very sheer, it would also give a french mani a shimmering look.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty color...it&#x27;s a sheer white/sparkle that has a light pink sheen to it. I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is the best color for short nails as I have short nail beds as well and strong color I like to avoid.</li>
            <li> Love this color. It is subtle enough to wear if you are not ready for the commitment of 2 weeks of a bold color. It has an iridescent feel to it that I love. Looks good over other colors as well. Good addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the even coverage. I use it over my french tips and it adds just enough oomph without overtaking the white ends. I get many compliments on this combination.</li>
            <li> I read a suggestion from a nail tech to pair Moonlight and Roses with Studio White for a french manicure so I tried it myself.  I&#x27;m on day 14 and there are no chips and it looks great except for my nail growth.  I&#x27;m a sucker for an iridescent glow and this delivers an interesting pink pearly look.  Natural but with a kick.  I used the base, 1 coat of this, 1 coat of studio white on tips, then one coat of this again and top coat.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good color to wear over other colors like said above. You don&#x27;t have to &#x27;go&#x27; get the nails soaked off though as in the last  review.  Just use acetone and soak them off.</li>
            <li> I discovered that CND Shellac products are the best for DIY shellac.&lt;br /&gt;This color nail polish is suitable when you want a gentler nail color.  It&#x27;s shines a gentle rainbow of colors and enhances a natural nail look.  I recommend using just one coat of the color polish.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this color and product.</li>
            <li> this is a very good color to layer over a deeper shade  I have had salon manicures with this color and am looking forward to the versatility</li>
            <li> Moonlight &amp; Roses is very light. I used it on its own (2 coats) and as 2nd coat of darker colors to give it an interesting iridescence/shine. Very easy to apply and cured in LED lamp as well. The glow has some pink in it like you see on the bottle but end result will be much more sheer than what&#x27;s on the bottle (opaque white).</li>
            <li> I loved the neutral shimmer of this color. It&#x27;s one of my favorites. Somewhat sheer but additional coats fix that.</li>
