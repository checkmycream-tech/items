            <li>Thank you Matrix for the quick service and great packaging of this product.  </li>

            <li>You can&#x27;t find many gels that do that.  </li>
            <li>Wife&#x27;s favorite for her naturally curly hair, at a great price for the liter bottle.</li>
            <li>Great for naturally curly hair.</li>

            <li>Good hold on my long, curly hair without getting crispy.</li>
            <li>Been using and loving this product for a few years now, and glad I can get in on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>Thanks, Biolage!</li>
            <li>I had not been able to find in stores so just what I needed and large bottle so won&#x27;t have to purchase for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this thickens fine hair without obvious build up.  </li>
            <li>and you can decide how much curl or body you would like to have with this gel.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This is my primpy honey&#x27;s go to stuff, she is a repeat buyer, fast delivery and no problems.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>however, just a small amount of this gelee on the ends and scrunching the ends while my head is upside down, those frizzy waves becomes soft, beautiful waves.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy and holds my natural curls all day.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give a wet look, unless you put too much on&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding the Biolage Gelee in stores, and I have never found this extra large size.  </li>

            <li> Everything was received as I expected to get it.</li>
            <li> Only bummer is it is not available as Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like a lot of gels.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find</li>
            <li> It gets crazy in the summer.</li>

            <li> BIOLAGE GELEE WORKS THE BEST OUT OF ALL THE HAIR CARE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product when found my wife had for her hair.  Keeps my hiar from standing out like Porcupine.</li>
            <li> I have used this gel for about 20 years now.  Great for naturally curly hair. It helps define the curl and you can decide how much curl or body you would like to have with this gel.  Leaves no build-up it rinses clean with just water.  You can&#x27;t find many gels that do that.  Only downfall is the price and the fact it doesn&#x27;t come in a gallon.</li>
