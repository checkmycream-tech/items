            <li>Beautiful soft scent!  </li>
            <li>Warm and rich smell.</li>
            <li>I just ran out and had to purchase some more and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>not bed but strong to my taste  </li>
            <li>Strong fragrances were worn then</li>
            <li>It is a sexy, musky, sweet aroma.  </li>
            <li>Sheepish has great service and puts their personal touch on the shipment which always makes the product</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed many Kuumba scents and knew the roll-on would be optimal for him as he learns how much fragrance to use.</li>
            <li>The quality stays consistent and I always get compliments on the lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Smells cheep and sweet.</li>
            <li>Its sweet, earthy, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overpowering, sickeningly sweet, and gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>Woodsy with just a hint of sweet.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and was packaged for transportation.</li>
            <li>I wish they carried this in a larger size, because I love the scent!  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and the Amber and Sandalwood is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>It is, by far, my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, delicate scent.</li>
            <li>This is nice and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I will be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I only got one and as soon as I applied it, I knew I would be ordering more (which I did).</li>
            <li>This is my first time getting this scent</li>
            <li>In general, I don&#x27;t care for strong scents but this one has that je na sais quoi.</li>
            <li>Smells a little strong when you first put it on, but adjusts quickly and isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>Was very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li>If your not looking for the real thing, this will do, but be prepared to WAIT on it.</li>
            <li>I cannot detect any &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34;, or the pine undertones of real amber, but I like it anyway.  </li>
            <li>Everyone wants to smell me when I wear this s</li>
            <li>The product came in packaged very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost incense-y but not over powering, a bit like a subtle sweet frankincense (woodsy scent), a sort of calming pleasant scent that lasts all day and perhaps into the next.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood smells a little strong at first but levels off to a sweet sandalwood smell all day long!</li>
            <li>One gets what one pays for, sandalwood normally runs around $50.</li>
            <li>I usually purchase this fragrance/brand from Whole Foods which is $2.00 more.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a natural high and I feel like I can take on the world.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate if a little more Sandalwood was present.</li>
            <li>I bought this fragrance at my local Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>This oil is very thin, and has a nice  artificial scented im comparison to REAL amber-sandlewood which has a thicker consistency with actual resin particles which gives it a more authentic smell.</li>
            <li>Initially not even interested in trying out any more sandalwood fragrances as I find them to be irritating.  </li>
            <li>Always love Kuumba made productsd and they are a small business, not corporate</li>
            <li>As far as fragrance oils go, this is terrific.  </li>
            <li>Lasts a long time on the skin, and does not irritate sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>Bought this and disliked it so much!</li>

            <li> Bought this and disliked it so much!</li>
            <li> the size is tiny tiny tiny - a lot goes a long way</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time and the scent lingers long after others I&#x27;ve used have faded.</li>
            <li> The kuumba made oils last forever and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Put a little on pulse areas and it will last all day long!</li>
            <li> As a perfume, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to choose a scent online when you&#x27;ve never smelled it before, but I was willing to take a chance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to explain because it definitely (to me) does not smell like sandalwood or the sort of ambiguous scent of amber.  </li>
            <li> This seemed watered down from the one</li>
            <li> I could say that of a few of the other Kuumba Made oils, but this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> A little goes a looong way.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these little bottles of Kuumba Made!  </li>
            <li> Small bottle.</li>
            <li> After several hours I can still smell (faintly), this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really sure what amber is supposed to smell like.  </li>
            <li> This is a very down to earth smell that I never get sick of!</li>
            <li> and Oh talk about making me sick...</li>
            <li> All those have alcohol in them and the fragrances are annoying.  </li>

            <li> This seemed watered down from the one I oreviously bought at a health food store</li>
            <li> I will be coming back for more. It lasts all day too! Beautiful, delicate scent. A little goes a looong way.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. Does not smell like sandalwood, at all. Smells cheep and sweet. One gets what one pays for, sandalwood normally runs around $50.</li>
            <li> Small bottle. Smells good. Got this for our daughter for Christmas, she had put it on her list. Decided to get it for her. We hope she likes it!</li>
            <li> Was very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for years. The quality stays consistent and I always get compliments on the lovely scent. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It absolutely smells wonderful!! Put a little on pulse areas and it will last all day long! I could still smell it on me as I was laying in bed! If you love musk and sandalwood~you&#x27;ll love this product!!</li>
            <li> I wish they carried this in a larger size, because I love the scent!  Goes on smooth and stays put!  Lasts a long time on the skin, and does not irritate sensitive skin!  The scent mixed with my skin is heavenly!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this fragrance/brand from Whole Foods which is $2.00 more.  Sandalwood and Musk works best for my body chemistry.  After several hours I can still smell (faintly), this fragrance.  Item arrived quickly and was packaged for transportation.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years!  I just ran out and had to purchase some more and was not disappointed.  This is a very down to earth smell that I never get sick of!</li>
            <li> This oil has the earthy, woody scent I hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not overpowering and is very romantic -- try it.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance at my local Whole Foods.  Initially not even interested in trying out any more sandalwood fragrances as I find them to be irritating.  But after reading all the great reviews I tried it and I like it a lot.  It&#x27;s a bit hard to explain because it definitely (to me) does not smell like sandalwood or the sort of ambiguous scent of amber.  (Not really similar to their amber paste scent either) It&#x27;s almost incense-y but not over powering, a bit like a subtle sweet frankincense (woodsy scent), a sort of calming pleasant scent that lasts all day and perhaps into the next.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these little bottles of Kuumba Made!  The sandalwood smells a little strong at first but levels off to a sweet sandalwood smell all day long!</li>
            <li> Love to combine this twitch their patchouli. Amazing smell.</li>
            <li> This oil is very thin, and has a nice  artificial scented im comparison to REAL amber-sandlewood which has a thicker consistency with actual resin particles which gives it a more authentic smell. In addition to the quality shipping took almost two weeks. On the same day  ordered oils from a company further from this one and received them in only 3 days. If your not looking for the real thing, this will do, but be prepared to WAIT on it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, I love it. Its sweet, earthy, not overpowering. The only downside of this product for me is the size, the bottle is tiny. I wish this was offered in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> My yoga instructor dabs this on our third eye and our temples at the end of yoga. I love the smell.  It&#x27;s warming, clearing, My gym was out of it, so I bought it here.  It was packaged well and I will buy it here again when it&#x27;s done.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and the Amber and Sandalwood is my absolute favorite. It smells so freaking good and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> not bed but strong to my taste  i will give it as a gift to an arab or to indu delivery and service very good .</li>
            <li> Sheepish has great service and puts their personal touch on the shipment which always makes the product better.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Amber/Sandalwood, its a beautiful combination and the scent is beautiful</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this perfume oil at all.  To me, it smells like cinnamon and cotton candy.  I couldn&#x27;t detect sandalwood and I&#x27;m not really sure what amber is supposed to smell like.  I&#x27;m going to have to return this perfume oil.  It&#x27;s overpowering, sickeningly sweet, and gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> Kuumba, you really do make the best scented roll on oils that I have ever found, this amber and sandalwood is quite exceptional</li>
            <li> I only got one and as soon as I applied it, I knew I would be ordering more (which I did). Rolls on and because it is an oil, the scent comes wafting up each time my body heat rises, like when I am working. I hope you keep making these scented oils.</li>
            <li> As far as fragrance oils go, this is terrific.  I work with essential oils and thus was hesitant to purchase this product as it is not a plant derived.  As a perfume, a little bit goes a long way.  It is a sexy, musky, sweet aroma.  I cannot detect any &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34;, or the pine undertones of real amber, but I like it anyway.  If you are looking for something authentic the 100% pure amber from &amp;#34;Silky Scents&amp;#34; is excellent, however, even with my discriminating nose, I cannot say that I&#x27;m displeased with this option.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to smell me when I wear this s***.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who loves the smell of sandalwood and he loves this fragrance.  I have enjoyed many Kuumba scents and knew the roll-on would be optimal for him as he learns how much fragrance to use.</li>
            <li> Beautiful soft scent!  Excellent all the way through!  I like that it&#x27;s not like any perfume scents.  All those have alcohol in them and the fragrances are annoying.  This is nice and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I like this oil sandalwood is great for calming and nausea, This oil is theraputic and makes me feel whole</li>
            <li> Bought this and disliked it so much! It smelled like my Grandma years ago. Strong fragrances were worn then and Oh talk about making me sick...&lt;br /&gt;Never again...much to strong!</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells in my grapeseed body oil. It is, by far, my favorite scent. Warm and rich smell.</li>
            <li> I recorded two of these and I ordered 6 different ones</li>
            <li> Best scent ever! Constant compliments.</li>
            <li> I wear this kinda as a cologne. It lingers around most of the day and is not offensive. I always get compliments of how good I smell when I have this on.</li>
            <li> the size is tiny tiny tiny - a lot goes a long way</li>
            <li> This is my first time getting this scent and I love it.  The kuumba made oils last forever and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this scent.  Woodsy with just a hint of sweet. I get tons of compliments when I wear it.  Smells a little strong when you first put it on, but adjusts quickly and isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.  I&#x27;ve bought this twice now and will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when you are feeling seductive! I could say that of a few of the other Kuumba Made oils, but this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to choose a scent online when you&#x27;ve never smelled it before, but I was willing to take a chance.  While the scent is potent, it is exotic.  Amber and sandalwood works well with my brain chemistry (so to speak).  It gives me a natural high and I feel like I can take on the world.  In general, I don&#x27;t care for strong scents but this one has that je na sais quoi.</li>
            <li> I could smell the amber but not the sandalwood.  I appreciate if a little more Sandalwood was present. The product came in packaged very well</li>
            <li> Always love Kuumba made productsd and they are a small business, not corporate and I like to support their endeavors.  The bottle lasts a long time and the scent lingers long after others I&#x27;ve used have faded.</li>
