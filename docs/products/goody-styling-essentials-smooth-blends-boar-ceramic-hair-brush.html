            <li>LOL!</li>
            <li>It is awesome and the price is just excellent.</li>
            <li>This would be perfect if it had the stuff on the handle.</li>
            <li>It works great on my should length hair.</li>
            <li>Really very nice all though bristles do come out from time to time</li>
            <li>thought my hair would turn out smoother but didn&#x27;t see good results.  </li>
            <li>An excellent buy, well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I really love this brush, but the boar bristles are already falling out!</li>
            <li>My medium length curly hair styles nicely and easily when using this brush, and the style holds well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth on my hair!</li>
            <li>just ok..</li>
            <li>some bristles fall out easily but it is an ok brush</li>
            <li>so it did not slip easily.  </li>
            <li>and I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>and it was Huge.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something cheap and this did it.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST round brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for this hair brush for months now, after I purchase the first one from a well know discount store.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part about this brush is that the handle is one solid piece.  </li>
            <li>The barrel doesn&#x27;t get as hot as i thought it would, for blow outs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It fits well in her hands and her hair is much shinier than with standard brushes (as is mine, now that I have my own brush back!).</li>
            <li>Some of the bristles are coming out, but not so much that it would stop me from using it.  </li>
            <li>Had high expectations of it</li>
            <li>Your hair doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;touch\\&quot; the ceramic part, but you hair turns REALLY soft and sleek from the heat of it.   </li>
            <li>Love this size round brush.  </li>
            <li>So many round brushes have a notch in the handle for a grip, and my hair always gets tangled into the notch.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, and tames the frizz.</li>
            <li>It works great on my thick hair, wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8 year old after a year of her stealing my larger version.</li>
            <li>Ended up going back to my old brush.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s glides through my thick straight hair effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> since I had very long hair</li>
            <li> The BIG one was a little over $6.</li>

            <li> I have this brush on it&#x27;s bigger version...since I had very long hair (I cut it and donated it a few months ago). My hair is shorter now, but I still use it. The base of the brush is made of ceramic and it gets REALLY hot. Your hair doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;touch\\&quot; the ceramic part, but you hair turns REALLY soft and sleek from the heat of it.   This is the BEST round brush I have ever used! And believe me, I have used a LOT! I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one, for when mine has been too abused. LOL! I got mine at Walmart. The BIG one was a little over $6. I have used round brushes that cost over $10 and $15...and they do NOT compare to this one. It is awesome and the price is just excellent. But I do recommend buying it at Walmart, it costs less and, hey, there is no shipping cost involved!!   I&#x27;m only rating the product, since I have not purchased anything from this seller. But do get it at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this hair brush for months now, after I purchase the first one from a well know discount store.  It&#x27;s glides through my thick straight hair effortlessly.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> some bristles fall out easily but it is an ok brush</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this brush and the way it styles. My only complaint is that it has lost several bristles, especially upon first use. I have never had a brush do this to this extent. Hope it lasts longer than I expect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth on my hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old after a year of her stealing my larger version. It fits well in her hands and her hair is much shinier than with standard brushes (as is mine, now that I have my own brush back!). An excellent buy, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the deal. It works great on my should length hair. I wanted something cheap and this did it.</li>
            <li> I have used the brush every day for a few weeks now, and no bristles falling out. It works great on my thick hair, wet or dry. It was larger than I expected, but is still what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic. It makes my hair soft, and tames the frizz.</li>
            <li> Love this size round brush.  Wish it had a handle covering so it did not slip easily.  I ordered the one called Pink handle goody brush and it was Huge.  This would be perfect if it had the stuff on the handle.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in brush.  Had high expectations of it I guess.....thought my hair would turn out smoother but didn&#x27;t see good results.  Ended up going back to my old brush.</li>
            <li> Hard to brush my thick hair. just ok..</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles are coming out, but not so much that it would stop me from using it.  My favorite part about this brush is that the handle is one solid piece.  So many round brushes have a notch in the handle for a grip, and my hair always gets tangled into the notch.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush, but the boar bristles are already falling out! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. They are all over the floor after each use, so I&#x27;m concerned about how long it will last. My medium length curly hair styles nicely and easily when using this brush, and the style holds well. Would give 5 stars except for the bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> The barrel doesn&#x27;t get as hot as i thought it would, for blow outs.</li>
            <li> the bristles fall out every where. I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> Really very nice all though bristles do come out from time to time and I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest brush ever purchased.  Bristles kept falling out!</li>
