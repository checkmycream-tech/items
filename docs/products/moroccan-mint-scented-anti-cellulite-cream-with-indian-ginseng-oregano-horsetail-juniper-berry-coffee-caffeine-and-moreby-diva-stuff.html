            <li>I think you have a great business Diva Stuff and wish you success :)</li>
            <li>this is very important for me too.</li>
            <li>Ordered more soaps for Christmas gifts and recieved this moroccan mint anti cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>Using it now and love it.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and smell of this product.</li>
            <li>It would be more convenient if it was in a pump rather than having to dig the product out of the container.</li>
            <li>I will know more in about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with my purchases.</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>This cream smells delicious and instantly made my skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li>good delivery, fast.</li>
            <li>I ordered some speacialty coffee soaps from Diva Stuff and recieved a free sample of the pineapple anti-cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>but it was really thoughtful</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling quite smooth.</li>
            <li>Not only are these products all natural and great smelling, the customer service is top notch and speedy.</li>
            <li>It also makes you skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order more full size jars.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much, specially if you apply it on a fresh showered skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty darn visible!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the way of helping my &amp;#34;trouble&amp;#34; spots, but I may have to give it more time.  </li>
            <li>My email questions were answered quickly and I recieved my products extremely fast.</li>
            <li>you are in a hurry to get rid of your problem with cellulite, consider using this, but I suggest the soap much more, especially when used with an anticellulite hand massager.</li>
            <li>Knowing that it&#x27;s natural is really important to me too.</li>
            <li>an just feel more toned back there, like we all want.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on ordering more of this cream.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to work, but honestly, the anti cellulite coffee, juniper and kelp soap I get from the same company seemed to deliver more and better results for a LOT less, and you weren&#x27;t left stinking of this stuff all</li>
            <li>It is super natural and really well made.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like how this product has a very cooling effect on your skin when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.    </li>
            <li>Im trying to get bikini ready</li>
            <li>Maybe the other one smells better, but I wanted to try the mint.  </li>
            <li>i have been using this product for two weeks and saw no result i will try using the product a little longer to see if i get a better result</li>
            <li>When the weather gets really hot in summer I like to use the Key lime Anti-cellulite gel in the morning too as it dries fast and works wonder</li>
            <li>I would normally think results of this nature would be a placebo effect, but this is cellulite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice consistency, not too thick and not runny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE June 2014:  I have been using this product pretty regularly since I got it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have purchased this product, I have only been using it for a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There really are tiny pieces of coffee bean in this product.  </li>
            <li>but so far this product it does not work</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised when I received the shipment of Diva Stuff I ordered.</li>
            <li>This has really helped with my overly dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Also this lady has some great tips: [...]    </li>
            <li>Something about the smell of a too-sweet mint, mixed with coffee, juniper, lemon, and other ingredients that really assaults my senses.</li>

            <li> Seriously, I did that routine ONE time and the back of my thighs already look much smoother!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week so not sure I can really judge it well.</li>
            <li> It is actually clearing up the dead skin on my elbows...</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;you can go for the Diva products with your eyes closed .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like mint which I was disappointed in, a bit more musty smelling.</li>
            <li> the smell is very natural and then you don&#x27;t get tired of it like for synthetic fragrances.</li>
            <li> Have not used it very long so not sure of the results like the Dr. Oz show recommends.</li>
            <li> At my age skin becomes very thin and looses moisture fast anyway.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have begun to make my cellulite less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I do think it has helped on my legs and butt as they seem less bumpy.</li>
            <li> and I can tell a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> We have really hard water and even with a water softner system my skin has become really dry.  </li>
            <li> and I swear it looks like it has already started working a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I did find after a few weeks that my skin was smoother, keep in mind</li>
            <li> usually use it at night and sometimes before going for a run.</li>
            <li> I am also watching what I eat (and I don&#x27;t mean a &amp;#34;see food diet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> In fact, I was looking at myself in the mirror last week and was shocked as to how much worse it had gotten since I switched from my previous cream.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not worth smelling weird all day and not helping with the cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I hate the way this smells, but other people probably wouldn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> i order this product base on customers review</li>
            <li> This truly smells terrible to the point it gags me.</li>
            <li> Smell is horrible and it stays with you</li>

            <li> This truly smells terrible to the point it gags me. Something about the smell of a too-sweet mint, mixed with coffee, juniper, lemon, and other ingredients that really assaults my senses. I hate the way this smells, but other people probably wouldn&#x27;t mind. I have a very acute sense of smell. It does seem to work, but honestly, the anti cellulite coffee, juniper and kelp soap I get from the same company seemed to deliver more and better results for a LOT less, and you weren&#x27;t left stinking of this stuff all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in a hurry to get rid of your problem with cellulite, consider using this, but I suggest the soap much more, especially when used with an anticellulite hand massager.</li>
            <li> When purchasing this came up under heading with &amp;#34;Retinol&amp;#34; and a different flavor, which must be a different formula. I did not even specify the flavor I received (moroccan mint) and do not care for this flavor. Ingredients are all natural and excellent, just very disappointed that I did not receive the retinol and other flavor version</li>
            <li> I ordered some speacialty coffee soaps from Diva Stuff and recieved a free sample of the pineapple anti-cellulite cream. Used it and loved it. Ordered more soaps for Christmas gifts and recieved this moroccan mint anti cellulite cream. Using it now and love it. Getting ready to order more full size jars.  Leaves skin feeling soft and smelling good. I am going to start using these creams now instead of the Bliss Fat Girl Slim and Bliss Fat Girl Sleep products as soon as I use them all up. Not only are these products all natural and great smelling, the customer service is top notch and speedy. My email questions were answered quickly and I recieved my products extremely fast. You will not be disappointed with this product. I ordered the cake batter lip scrub but giving it as a gift (stocking stuffer) so I have not tried it, but I&#x27;m sure it will be great.</li>
            <li> The Indian Ginseng Cellulite Cream is amazing and works wonders on my skin. It helped to diminish the appearance of my lumpy area on the skin. I was totally amazed with this product and you will be to. Everything about it is wonderful, the scent is very nice, it feels amazing on the skin, and it actually works. Thanks Diva Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find more wonderful products at [...] and facebook page [...]</li>
            <li> This has really helped with my overly dry skin.  We have really hard water and even with a water softner system my skin has become really dry.  At my age skin becomes very thin and looses moisture fast anyway.  It seems to have begun to make my cellulite less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  It smells great and feels great when applying it. I will be ordering more. I suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting the Moroccan Mint Anti Cellulite Cream because of all of the goods reviews it and Diva Stuff has.  I am not disappointed.  I received and started using it on Monday, today is Wednesday and I swear it looks like it has already started working a little bit.  I will come back in a couple of weeks and give an update... so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE June 2014:  I have been using this product pretty regularly since I got it.  I do think it has helped on my legs and butt as they seem less bumpy. It also makes you skin nice and soft. I plan on reordering it again soon.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell of this product. I  Will definitely be purchasing this again for myself and for gifts.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely awesome! Love the way it makes my skin feel and the scent is amazing! It is actually clearing up the dead skin on my elbows...great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling product. This is the first time that I have purchased this product, I have only been using it for a couple of months.  There really are tiny pieces of coffee bean in this product.  I like how this product has a very cooling effect on your skin when you put it on. It would be more convenient if it was in a pump rather than having to dig the product out of the container. I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the way of helping my &amp;#34;trouble&amp;#34; spots, but I may have to give it more time.  I am going to use up what I have, but I don&#x27;t think that I would purchase this again. BUT I DO LOVE THE SMELL !</li>
            <li> i order this product base on customers review i look forward to receiving my order i have been using this product for two weeks and saw no result i will try using the product a little longer to see if i get a better result but so far this product it does not work</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised when I received the shipment of Diva Stuff I ordered. She included a sample of her \\&quot;Cream Cheese Danish lip balm\\&quot; and \\&quot;face flush face scrub\\&quot; which was really nice to do so. I know she probably can&#x27;t include that with every order but it was really thoughtful and I loved them both, they feel and smell divine! Thank you so much.    So this cream is delicious, I like the smell. I swear everything that I ordered smelled wonderful and I wanted to eat it all. Knowing that it&#x27;s natural is really important to me too. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week and I can tell a slight improvement. Im a size 4 and just have some cellulite by genetics all my life. I&#x27;ve been massaging it in every night and like I said I think it&#x27;s been working. I will know more in about 4 weeks. I know it also has a lot to do with strengthening the muscles back there so I think combining exercise with a good massage cream like this, will work great and should give some good results. Ladies a tip for a ridding cellulite exercise routine: I found this Joey Atlas symulast program for cellulite an let me tell you the exercises do really work because I feel incredibly sore today after using it lol..so I know I am strengthening those muscles. Im trying to get bikini ready an just feel more toned back there, like we all want. Also this lady has some great tips: [...]    I also ordered the coffee body bar soap and pumpkin. I&#x27;ve been using that in the shower daily and think that helps too. Another tip: get a good cellulite massager and use that in the shower and with this lotion. Again, the lotion smells wonderful. Overall I am very happy with my purchases. I think the price range is great for the products you get (please don&#x27;t change that lol). I think you have a great business Diva Stuff and wish you success :)</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful and is very creamy.  I just love it.  Don&#x27;t know if it will do away with the cellulite but even if it&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t that is okay for it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week so not sure I can really judge it well. It&#x27;s a nice consistency, not too thick and not runny. It&#x27;s got a creamy substance a bit like mayonnaise. Color is of a beige hue which could possibly stain clothing however, I&#x27;ve seen a couple spots on my white towels. It doesn&#x27;t smell like mint which I was disappointed in, a bit more musty smelling. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling quite smooth. I will possibly purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is probably the product I love the Best from Diva Stuff . I just started the third jar!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the texture allow you to massage it well and you don&#x27;t need much, specially if you apply it on a fresh showered skin!&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it at night and sometimes before going for a run. the smell is very natural and then you don&#x27;t get tired of it like for synthetic fragrances. When the weather gets really hot in summer I like to use the Key lime Anti-cellulite gel in the morning too as it dries fast and works wonder too.&lt;br /&gt;you can go for the Diva products with your eyes closed . It is super natural and really well made.&lt;br /&gt;Those guys sound that they have a great ethic and this is very important for me too.</li>
            <li> I did find after a few weeks that my skin was smoother, keep in mind I do work out and drink a lot of water but I still think the cream did help!!</li>
            <li> smells great and not greasy. Absorbs into skin quickly. Have not used it very long so not sure of the results like the Dr. Oz show recommends.</li>
            <li> I watched Dr. Oz recently and the ingredients in this matches what Dr. Oz said to use for cellulite.  I didn&#x27;t even know they made creams that actually worked!  Well, I am impressed with this cream.  Each day I see a difference.  I am also watching what I eat (and I don&#x27;t mean a &amp;#34;see food diet&amp;#34; either.  ☺  I definitely plan on ordering more of this cream.  Oh, I also want to add the almond lip tube is wonderful at conditioning the lips!  I AM IMPRESSED with Diva Stuff!!</li>
            <li> Smell is horrible and it stays with you/clings all day... to the point where I actually had people ask &amp;#34;what is that smell?&amp;#34;.. plus, it does not work.  In fact, I was looking at myself in the mirror last week and was shocked as to how much worse it had gotten since I switched from my previous cream.  Tossing this stuff.  Certainly not worth smelling weird all day and not helping with the cellulite.  Maybe the other one smells better, but I wanted to try the mint.  It does NOT smell like mint. Yuck.</li>
            <li> loved using this. smells nice. good delivery, fast.</li>
            <li> I would normally think results of this nature would be a placebo effect, but this is cellulite. It&#x27;s pretty darn visible! This cream smells delicious and instantly made my skin appear smoother. I used in conjunction with the cellulite mud mask and pineapple orchid soap. Seriously, I did that routine ONE time and the back of my thighs already look much smoother! I &amp;#60;3 diva stuff!</li>
