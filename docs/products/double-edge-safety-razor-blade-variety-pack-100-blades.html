            <li>The 7am blades and the Shark blades are not the best</li>
            <li>This is an awesome variety pack.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to find out which blade works best for me.</li>

            <li>The best shave I&#x27;ve gotten was with the Crystals, however mileage may vary with each company.</li>

            <li>Good assortment of blades.  </li>
            <li>I started shaving with a safety razor using Derby blades, but I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s important to find the blade that&#x27;s best for your beard, so I decided to try out this sample pack.  </li>

            <li>A good prep would give me almost a 3 for shave quality.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything good about the Sharps or the 7 A.M. blades.</li>
            <li>This sampler pack is a good one.  </li>
            <li>I shave in the shower, using glycerine soap and a brush, so I get good shaves from the Gillette Sensor Excel blades.  </li>
            <li>This package was fairly priced and offered variety, but as stated in the description supplies do vary based on availability.</li>
            <li>These razor blades are superior to any in the universe.</li>

            <li>This is a fantastic sampler and it is a very good price at 24 cents a blade.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to be sure that your DE shave is all that it can be.  </li>
            <li>My kit also came with Wilkinson Sword blades that are more aggressive and work great for me.</li>

            <li>My favorite are the Astra Platinums, pick one and find yours!</li>

            <li>and I think I even found my favorite blades (Astras!)</li>
            <li>For this many blades this is a steal of a deal!</li>
            <li>I have read a lot of reviews and online information and it is amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily I did find an amazing blade, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Cost savings are huge and, once you get the hang of it, a safety razor works great.</li>
            <li>The drug store blades make the 7am blades in this group look like amazing blades.</li>
            <li>And the real verdict of which one is the best is dependent on the combination of your face and the handle you use.  </li>
            <li>I really liked</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t even ordered this yet, but I did some research into blades and skin sensitively/beard coarseness really determines the best blade.</li>
            <li>; it works and smells good, it&#x27;s just cheaper and more customizable for me to make</li>
            <li>; it works and smells good, it&#x27;s just cheaper and more customizable for me to make</li>
            <li>I liked the Astra platinums a bit, but in the end I&#x27;ve grown to appreciate the Shark chromes.  </li>
            <li>I had forgotten just how good a shave you get from these blades, I love them.</li>
            <li>Nice variety pack</li>

            <li>This sampler has a good selection of some of the more popular but doesn&#x27;t include</li>
            <li>but they really did work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still a nice variety to get my start in shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>am excited to use the Astra Superior Platinum because I have heard good things about them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to try some new blades and start to learn what suits each person best.</li>
            <li>I am new to safety razors, and it was nice to purchase a variety of blades to find which ones work best for my skin and hair type.</li>
            <li>but they are both super smooth for me and result in perfect shaves.  </li>
            <li>This is a great value and a good way to find out what blades are worth your time, money, and skin when you buy more.  </li>
            <li>BTW all the blades in my shipment were in individually wrapped packages of 5 blades each (except for one package of 10) and the packages are in good shape, perfect for putting some in you overnight bag and some in your bathroom...</li>
            <li>so I decided to give DE razors a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with the decision.</li>
            <li>the price and the number of shaves you can get out of this pack, it is a really good value and will let you try different brands to see what is best for you.</li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone starting to DE shave to start with a kit like this to get a good feel on the type of blade will work best for their face,</li>
            <li>Good variety here - makes it easy to decide what brand you like.  </li>
            <li>In all, this is a good pack to buy once, find out which blade works best for you and move on to buying only that brand.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome value and a great way to explore other brands.</li>
            <li>Very good razors that all give very close shaves without butchering your face.  </li>
            <li>So far I think I like the Astra Platinum the best.  </li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t tried them all yet, but so far they all work great!</li>
            <li>Astra are the best I&#x27;ve used in the set so far.</li>
            <li>Nice thing about this pack is there are so many to try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far the best ones for me have been:&lt;br</li>
            <li>There, I can load them with stuff that&#x27;s good for my skin and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Shark and Lord are so far the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried one of every variety in the pack so far and they are just wicked awesome.</li>
            <li>Though in principle anyone can use pretty much any blade; the best thing to do is to shop around until you find the right balance of sharpness and flex that fits you and your shaver best.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m happy to have had the sampling and after a lot of shaving, found my favorite (Astra.)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good deal and good idea for someone exploring different blades.</li>
            <li>If the shave prep was more towards a fair to good level, these blades still performed pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I dont know of a better way to try all of these options which cover most of the popular brands.</li>
            <li>Count on about 5 to 6 great shaves with these blades and you can see why this is such a great value.</li>
            <li>First, I am an experienced shaver -</li>
            <li>any of them work great the first shave, but some &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; better than others.</li>
            <li>The W&amp;S blade has a good day one shave but quickly deteriorates.  </li>
            <li>Quickly found some were good for 2 uses, and others could make it 4.</li>
            <li>I found a favorite blade while testing this pack.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Con: I wish there was even more variety.</li>
            <li>(there are so many boxes i messed up when counting)</li>
            <li>im sure someone is reading this and going..</li>
            <li>Simply stated, this is one of the best sampler packs you are going to find.</li>
            <li>There are sets out there that offer more variety, but also cost considerably more, and provide fewer of each blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i think most of them are lower quality blades</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying trying out the different blades to see which ones work best for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought this pack.</li>
            <li>Awesome variety to try different brands of razors</li>
            <li>and yes, some are better than others</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found some of my favorite blades from it.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love the Astras and Shark blades.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m enjoying the comparison between the brands.</li>
            <li>Simply stated, this is one of the best sampler packs you are going to find.</li>
            <li>There are sets out there that offer more variety, but also cost considerably more, and provide fewer of each blade.</li>
            <li>Some are better than others.</li>
            <li>It also gives you a chance to see which blades you like the best, as the metals used such as platinum has evolved and the honing process has been refined.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>DE shaving is a satisfying experience.</li>
            <li>trying out diffrent razors to find my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My husband wanted these blades and has been quite satisfied with the order.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be a better deal.</li>
            <li>A better assortment is found here:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered some feather blades and am hoping for a better shave with them.</li>
            <li>blades where ok but never revived</li>
            <li>I wish this had more variety.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>After trying all these I may find one I like more than the rest</li>
            <li>Sure beats $4.00 a blade that I had been paying</li>
            <li>The thing is, it&#x27;s WAY too many blades.</li>
            <li>Want to rule out 6 brands of safety razors and find your one favorite?</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try different blades so that I could find one that works best for me.  </li>
            <li>I was just looking to see if there was something else better out there...</li>
            <li>Fantastic variety!</li>
            <li>Shaving has never been as enjoyable as with a safety razor using these blades.</li>
            <li>Many fillers.</li>
            <li>Even though I know my favorite already, I still use the others</li>
            <li>This is the perfect way to try 7 different double edge blades brands and find out which works best for you!!!  </li>
            <li>This bundle is OK</li>
            <li>What more can one say?</li>
            <li>Most of the razors in this sampler are bottom of the barrel.  </li>
            <li>I also received a more than 100 blades.</li>
            <li>of the blades in this bundle really stood out as great quality though</li>
            <li>think the variety could have been better.  </li>
            <li>There are definitive differences between the blades, where some just seem to work much better than others.  </li>
            <li>My favorite two in this pack were the Shark and the Astra;</li>
            <li>Shark was okay</li>
            <li>but I think I like the Astra better.</li>
            <li>I like the idea that i can try different blades and decide which will work best with my shaving kit.</li>
            <li>DE safety razor blades are so much better than those overpriced multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>Being that I have 100 blades, I won&#x27;t have to purchase blades for many years.</li>
            <li>trying out different ones to see what gives the best shave, varies for people.</li>
            <li>This order came with so many razors.</li>
            <li>Great assortment if you are looking for a good double edge blade.</li>
            <li>I get a better shave with some and not with others.  </li>
            <li>This is an interesting group of razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Better shave prep improved performance somewhat.  </li>
            <li>These were the poorest blades in the group, but they are not a terrible blade.  </li>
            <li>They are clearly better than the 7am Durablade, but not the highest quality in the group.  </li>
            <li>Gals, safety razors are not just for men and they are better for the earth if you care.</li>
            <li>And again, this process is WAAAAAY better for the environment.</li>
            <li>Excellent starter pack, came with 5 extra blades.  </li>
            <li>Love these items.</li>
            <li>What more to say.</li>
            <li>I like the most</li>
            <li>Top runners were 7am and Astra...</li>
            <li>but my favorite was Wilkinson</li>
            <li>(And Sensor Excels are the CHEAP ones!)</li>
            <li>I especially like the variety you get to see which blades work best for you.</li>
            <li>I have yet to settle on a favorite</li>
            <li>My husband bought these and is experimenting with these to find the brand he likes most.</li>
            <li>Well most of them are.</li>
            <li>Sooooo many choices.great quality</li>
            <li>these give you a chance to sample different ones to find what works best.</li>
            <li>They sent all the blades pictured, and the cost was OK.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see a lot of variety packs like this, but what&#x27;s especially nice about this one is that it includes Crystal and Astra Platinum, which are in my opinion two of the highest quality blades you can put in your double edge razor.</li>
            <li>I am trying different safety razors and have to say this is one of the best ways to do it.</li>
            <li>Great first pack of razors, easy to figure out what works and what doesnt.  </li>
            <li>Great mix of razors that allows a classic shaver beginner to choose their preference.</li>
            <li>Most of the Gillette variants are pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>Lots of blades to choose from, great for a person new to the safty razor, gives you a chance to try many differnt brands of razors.</li>
            <li>The price was right, and so far most of the blades are good to great.</li>
            <li>The Astra were pretty good and there were both Chrome and Platinum versions included.</li>
            <li>A good 3 out of 5 blade, and consistent in shave quality unlike the Wilkinson Sword.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, consistent shaves, and a life of 4-6 shaves.  </li>
            <li>Great sampling from most of the major popular brands available today.</li>
            <li>A great selection of blades for someone new to DE</li>
            <li>I am very pleased, IF all 100 were included i would be raving right now.</li>
            <li>I got the razors quickly and with a nice assortment.</li>
            <li>AKA Israeli Personna&#x27;s blades are also fantastic and are now my most favorite out the bunch.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to see where the rest of these blades are going to take me in my venture of finding the closest most comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>If you are new to shaving with a safety razor this is a great, cost effective way to find which blade is right for you.</li>
            <li>Several very good quality brands of blades.</li>
            <li>Several are actually very good.  </li>
            <li>As I haven&#x27;t used all the blades yet I can&#x27;t comment on which one is best, but for the value if you are going back to DE shaving or just starting out this is a great value.</li>
            <li>Perfect set for people just getting into wet shaving and don&#x27;t know what blade brands work for you.</li>
            <li>Overall, the price I paid was fairly cheap for 100 blades, and quality of the blades ranged from fair to good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now</li>
            <li>This is a great way to sample 7 different double edge blades, to find the one brand that works best on your face and beard.</li>
            <li>This sample pack lets you try a good array of blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They all fit perfectly in my Parker 24C, Parker 99R and Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Astra blades with wonderful, smooth, comfortable results for several months.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Astra  Superior Stainless</li>
            <li>A 5 would indicate a shave as good as my straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I am new to safety razors and its great to try so many different types of blades for a great price.</li>
            <li>Excellent starter pack for anyone who is new to using a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I will say that the Astra blades are the best for me that I have ever tried and I am amazed at how well they work, mostly because they are extremely flexible, light blades, and that seems to work for me.  </li>
            <li>What I found very early on was that there were 2 good blades (Astra and Crystal), 3 OK blades (</li>
            <li>There was also 6 boxes of Astra in the package so it was nice to see that a third of the total blades consisted of the ones I liked best.</li>
            <li>Received my blades and not only did this include a good selection of blades, but I received 105 blades instead of 100!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to see what razor blades you like, and it&#x27;s probably close to 2-4 years worth of razors, depending on how much you change out your blades.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really recommend buying it unless you are exceptionally un-picky about the blades you use.</li>
            <li>Tried most of the different brands already and all work great.</li>
            <li>So the price for this many blades and the different brands, great deal.</li>
            <li>and I love the results, I could still plan an adventure trip for two weeks in Oregon with the money that Brazilian, arms, pitties, and full leg waxing would cost me per year.</li>
            <li>An excellent sampler pack for those that are new to wetshaving or anyone wanting to try out some new blades.</li>
            <li>When I bought this I was new to DE shaving and a sampler seemed like a good idea.  </li>
            <li>about 12 good shaves before I had to insert a new one.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the blades are fine and you have to see what blades work for you.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this variety pack of razors and suggest it to anyone new to shaving with a double edge safety razor so they can find the type of razor that works best for them.</li>
            <li>These blades are all inexpensive in a large pack and you get a nice sized sample of each brand.</li>
            <li>HUGE difference in blades.  </li>
            <li>Having just started DE shaving this is a great way to try different blades.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal: buying this pack of 100 blades gives you 7 types of blades - if you look at this fact and think \\&quot;I only need 1 type of blade; I can pretend to be happy with the largest amount I can buy at once,\\&quot; then consider the fact that all blades are made with different blade angles, manufacturing guidelines, etc.</li>
            <li>A great price to try several brands and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li>Great starter pack especially for the price.</li>
            <li>They should have thrown in a cheap plastic disposable container</li>
            <li>They are fantastic blades.  </li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>Sharps are good, shark is ok the best for my beard are the Astras blue or green box.</li>
            <li>They last for a couple of weeks at minimum for me and have been a joy to shave with.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m just forcing myself to keep shaving with inferior blades for the next two years until I can just be a happy Feather customer.</li>
            <li>For someone just starting out with a safety razor this is a great way to determine which blades you like</li>
            <li>Both are cheap here on amazon</li>
            <li>Great way to sample different types of blades and see what you like.</li>
            <li>The 7AM blades tend to work great for me, even after the second shave (I would not use any blade three</li>
            <li>Some of the blades work great, some tend to cut or scrap my skin, each brand cuts differently and this pack lets me find which one I like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great deal, great way to understand how your razor performs with different blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d avoid them and buy a cheap disposable razor over ever using those blades again.  </li>
            <li>A great way to try different brands of razors and save some money.  </li>
            <li>once you spend some time learning the process, I&#x27;ve learned to love the art and ritual; it&#x27;s not a waste of time, it&#x27;s a personal investment in my awesome frakking legs.</li>
            <li>When I bought this assortment, reviews suggested all kinds of great blades (the picture of blades has changed since then, the assortment looks about the same).</li>
            <li>Gives a nice opportunity to shave with a variety of blades while figuring out what you really like.</li>
            <li>I bought these in July 2012 and its now March 2014 and still have boxes of blades available.</li>
            <li>You wanna see something fantastic?</li>
            <li>Given the cost and variety available with this pack, you can change blades a couple times every week.</li>
            <li>This is a much better idea than buying, say, 1,000 of some specific blade (say, 7 AM)  and then realizing you can&#x27;t get a good shave with it.    </li>
            <li>I started shaving with a safety razor and its far superior to all the cartridge shavers.</li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>The Feather platinum-coated stainless blades from Japan are the best I&#x27;ve tried for a double edge.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not stupid either</li>
            <li>He was really happy about it, and was excited to try all the different brands.</li>
            <li>If I were to buy these again, I would look for a pack w/o shark and 7am ones but given that the pack has lasted me more than a year I still like the value of this product very much.</li>
            <li>A straight edge razor will give one a superior shave, but it will require more skill and some more time than these double edge systems.  </li>
            <li>I get a better shave with the Astra Platinum after two plus weeks than most blades brand new.  </li>
            <li>Plus if you are new to it you can try out the different razors to see which brand you like best.</li>
            <li>was my original review....</li>
            <li>This is a really fun and cost-effective experiment!</li>
            <li>This variety pack contains 100 weeks worth of blades!</li>
            <li>but I could&#x27;ve done better if I went to Maggard.com first and got there razor blade variety pack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this was a great purchase as I have some experience with some different blades now, and I have good idea of where to put my money next.</li>
            <li>BUT, the weighted handle of higher end razors work better for guys I think.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, packaging was neat and tidy that it fit inside a normal mailbox.</li>
            <li>data is still being collected on which I liked best for where, but this package enabled me to try different combos over a length of time that would give me more accurate  testing results (your skin changes with long term use of a particular blade, it&#x27;s cool like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladyfriends and Mancreatures, safety razors are a cheaper, closer shave</li>
            <li>I have been surprised to find how different each of the brands are, I immediately found a brand I like better, and am interested to try the rest to see which will serve me best.</li>
            <li>the 10 Crystal blades got some cheap American made 10 blades you can get from the dollar store in place of the 10 Crystal blades haven&#x27;t tryed them hope they are good 7 am blades are Indian made and wouldn&#x27;t use them even to shave a dog&#x27;s Butt.</li>
            <li>They look like the type of blades you would buy for a paint scraper, and in my opinion they are probably just poor product, although I am sure someone will say they are the best blades in the world.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am most pleased with these...</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive a large variety of blades, but I found that many of the packaged were Shark blades.  </li>
            <li>I hesitated for long time on buying this sampler pack because I thought I had already found the best DE blades, but I finally decided to pull the trigger and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a lot of the blades rust pretty quickly, so I don&#x27;t get as many uses out of them as I would like, but that might just be me not taking care of them</li>
            <li>omg I love this, very sheep, not expensive at all, and i love how they all come from different countries, so i could pick and try, thank you very much for this pack great service.</li>
            <li>that I love and was using for a half year with great success.</li>
            <li>I have been happy so far after 8 months of usage the blades are all high quality and have worked well with my Merkur razor that I also received as a gift.</li>
            <li>After getting started with a safety razor the first time, and running out of the sample pack of blades, this was a great way to see how multiple brands feel and not break the bank.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a different blade, this is a good start.</li>
            <li>but I had to add another sampler to get a really good cross section.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied in the package because it really is nice to find a few good blades that I like.</li>
            <li>the reviews of the different blades and get a good idea before you buy THIS pack.</li>
            <li>You get a bunch of different blades for a good price.</li>
            <li>I tried the Shark Stainless blades and had to keep checking the mirror to make sure my face wasn&#x27;t bleeding.  </li>
            <li>My advice - get a smaller sample pack even if it seems like it&#x27;s not as good a value.</li>
            <li>Some good ones mixed in with a bag of sub-par blades.</li>
            <li>But good pack overall.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t gripe too much about the discrepancy though since I did get more blades than I bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the Stainless blades worked better for me than the Platinum</li>
            <li>It seemed to me that the Astra and Shark were leaps and bounds better than the others, so much so that I ended up just giving the others away.  </li>
            <li>Good sampling of different razor brands.</li>
            <li>If you are just starting with a DE it is a good way to find a blade that suits you.</li>
            <li>Astra Platinum:  Better quality than the Astra Stainless, I&#x27;d rate these about a 4 for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Good way to try several brands.</li>
            <li>This is a really good sample set to try out different blades.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to investigate different blades.</li>
            <li>Not a bad way to investigate wet-shaving with dual-edge blades.</li>
            <li>I am brand new to using a safety razor, coming from disposable cartridges so I was a little overwhelmed when trying to figure out what kind of blade to use since I read that one blade may be perfect for one person and a different blade works better for someone else.</li>
            <li>This was the best way to identify a daily razor blade, some work better with my beard (coarse and fast growing) than others.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and Durablade 7AM blades were not that great in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Awesome purchase, I can pick the blade(s) I wish to purchase in the future based on actual using the blade my self.</li>
            <li>When you are starting out and trying to figure out which blade is best for you, you NEED to try each one multiple times as your skill/brush/soap changes.</li>
            <li>The Crystal Super+</li>
            <li>* 15 Shark Super Chrome&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Shark Super Stainless&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Shark Super Chrome - No Country of Origin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely found some brands and models that don&#x27;t work so well for me, although none that really seem great.  </li>
            <li>Ended up ordering a 100 pack of the shark super chromes as a result.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li>Super Stainless&lt;br /&gt;Astra</li>
            <li>Shark Super Chrome</li>
            <li>Great for someone starting out, would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>Shark Super Chrome:  </li>
            <li>and I am quickly learning my preferences.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m leaning towards the Shark Super Chrome.  </li>
            <li>These work MUCH better than all of those high priced disposables.  </li>
            <li>These will last me for a really long time, plus I&#x27;ll be able to compare many different brands and see which I like best.</li>
            <li>While ultimately I would choose the blade that works best for me, I would have at least liked to try putting the U.S in the mix.  </li>
            <li>They are, however, more sensitive to a good facial prep -</li>
            <li>If you are in the same boat, I&#x27;d highly recommend it - and at a great price.</li>
            <li>you do not know what blade to get, I would recommend getting this first and try them all out!</li>
            <li>While all the options might be overwhelming for someone new to DE shaving the payoff is that after a little trial and error you can get great shaves.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have a little variety to figure out which type you like.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little sample set.</li>
            <li>Some are very good, some are mediocre, and some are just OK.</li>
            <li>I expect that there are so many variables as to which blades are good for each person (which razor you have, how hard you press, shaving soap, beard type, etc).  </li>
            <li>BTW the seller had a very pleaseing atitudae and genuine concern for my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic way to really gauge which blades work well for you, and then buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li>The derby blades were very forgiving and comfortable but lacked the close shave factor.</li>
            <li>Good selection lets you try a bunch of different DE razors at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I purchased a wet shave set for my husband for our anniversary and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Since there are so many different brands of blades available he wanted this set</li>
            <li>and I seem to get about 1 weeks worth of shaving for each blade.</li>
            <li>100 blade packs (of the non-variety kind) often cost just ten dollars, so someone is making a killing repackaging these.</li>
            <li>I think this variety pack is cool for when you are trying to figure out which blades to use for the first time.</li>
            <li>7 am are my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I liked the variety pack and received a couple of different brands than posed here, but it gave me a chance to try out the razors.  </li>
            <li>And, you get enough of each kind to determine if it is your shaving technique or your blade that is the issue.</li>
            <li>If you use a blade a week like me, that means you&#x27;ve just paid for 2 years worth of blades.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to compare different blades.  </li>
            <li>The blades were a bit inconsistent, as some were clearly a 4 for performance, but most fell into the 3 category.  </li>
            <li>selection arrived the same time as the razor (which came in handy).  </li>
            <li>It takes some learning but the journey is worth it.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have 7 different brands to sample too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Astra SP so far are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Well, I got this variety pack hoping to learn what types I liked, and I definitely have</li>
            <li>With the popular American multi-blade razor I had been using each cartridge cost about $4</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to shave like your father did.  </li>
            <li>Love every one so far.</li>
            <li>This package of 100 blades is well over a years worth if you don&#x27;t need to shave every day.</li>
            <li>Does not include some popular brands such as Derby or Feather.  </li>
            <li>The variety is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>As we all know a super smooth, non irritating and super close shave is a great way to start the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently gotten into the art of shaving (not the brand) and am enjoying the nice clean shaves that I receive from doing it the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>With all of these other variables in flux, it takes several times for a beginner to nail the blade that suits their face the best.</li>
            <li>For example many people love Derby&#x27;s(my son loves them) but they don&#x27;t work at all for me(they tug and pull and thrash my neck) on the other hand some people don&#x27;t like Astra or Shark</li>
            <li>once.. on the first of the packs of blades, the \\&quot;Super Platinum\\&quot; blades made in Israel.  </li>
            <li>All of the blades seem to be high quality, now all that&#x27;s left is figuring out which is best for him personally.</li>
            <li>but the rest are all good and sharp.</li>
            <li>Really wide variety of razors, excellent would definitely recommend for any first time DE razor users.</li>
            <li>Good value pack, they are all pretty much the same, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, you get a lot for what you pay.</li>
            <li>I am a lady with fair skin and thin/sparse hair and found the Sharp blades work well for me.</li>
            <li>this is not a review of the individual razors but they are all high quality and a good assortment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A number of sources recommend trying a variety of blades to find the blade that is right for you, and this variety pack lets you do just that.  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to find the right blade for me.</li>
            <li>Have not used them all yet but a super buy and a great way to try several different brands.  </li>
            <li>Selection sent did not match description 110 total received - 15ea Astra Superior Platinum, Astra Superior Stainless, Shark Super Stainless, Gillette 7o&#x27;clock, 20ea Sharp Hi Chromium and Treet Platinum, and 10 Crystal Stainless</li>
            <li>but we can fit in normal society with these blades.  </li>
            <li>Seven types of blades seemed like such a good way to explore the variety that is available to double edged shavers.  </li>
            <li>Good sample of several brands of razor blades for someone who wants to try out a few different ones to see what works best on his face, without having to buy a large quantity of each one.</li>
            <li>They are NOT all the same, and it&#x27;s an easy way to find the one that works for you!</li>
            <li>The razor was sent with 10 Shark blades, and I found them to be good blades for me - long lasting and easy on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is a decent starter, I would have liked a little more variety.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure which blade to use in your new DE razor this is a quick easy and cheap way to test drive a few blades.  </li>
            <li>I switched to double edge shaving because I got tired of spending more and more money for more and more shave tech that I didn&#x27;t need or used.</li>
            <li>Shark Super Stainless - Alex, Egypt</li>
            <li>A good variety, so far all of them solid blades.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just getting into shaving with double edged blades, this is a great way to try different blades.  </li>
            <li>I quickly learned which blades worked for me and which didn&#x27;t, without spending too much money.</li>
            <li>It came with  Shark super blades,  Astra platinum,  Astra stainless,</li>
            <li>It is nice to see and use these single edged blades once again.</li>
            <li>Very nice to get a variety for such a low price,</li>
            <li>, I think (forgot to count) for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The first 2-3 shaves with a better facial prep givessolid 3 level shaves, but they fall off to 2 quickly after that or if you used only a fair facial prep.  </li>
            <li>This package is very reasonably priced and I&#x27;m sure you get 10 additional blades above the advertised 100.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My most recent shave with a 4/6 using the Sharks is one my closest yet.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that it has become somewhat of a hobby because there are so many different products/options that allow you to get</li>
            <li>the perfect shave.(I didn&#x27;t really understand at first how a blade that can be great for one person can be terrible for someone else...</li>
            <li>how many different opinions there are on just about every DE shaving product.  </li>
            <li>My first experience with a safety razor was with the Merkur blade that came with my Merkur handle.</li>
            <li>These blades give you both enough blades of each type to &#x27;get used to&#x27; each, but not too many to regret if one type isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>They are worth the price for the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>DE gives me a closer shave for a fraction of the cost and it is an overall enjoyable</li>
            <li>: Threw away the 7a.m. after first use-</li>
            <li>If you can find a variety pack with about one box of each razor I&#x27;d try that one first.</li>
            <li>Others are more blunt but seem to last longer.</li>
            <li>My first time shaving with these blades</li>
            <li>I am more cautious, like a teen who is shaving for the first time.</li>
            <li>I bought it when I purchased my first safety razor because my husband suggested that I try out a variety of blades.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have made a better starting purchase.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t always know exactly what you will get</li>
            <li>Now I just need to spend the next two years working through all of the blades, and figuring out what brand I like the most.</li>
            <li>(thanks Gramps!)</li>
            <li>All are made in the Middle East (Egypt mostly, I think, none from Israel in my pack) except for the Astra, which are Gillette blades made in Russia.</li>
            <li>I received these razors in about 3 days from ordering them and when I finally got the package there were so many razors</li>
            <li>A variety pack of blades that will last most guys somewhere around a year.</li>
            <li>I think it comes with just enough that you can discover what razor works best for you without feeling bad about throwing out a pack if it doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>Everything else was exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a month since my purchase, and I&#x27;m still on the first pack.</li>
            <li>a bit more than buying the same number from one manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>People have different preferences, styles, shaver/grip, skin tone and texture; not every blade is for or will be enjoyable for everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat new to wet shaving and decided this would be a good way to find a blade that works well for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be a good assortment of blades for the guy (or gal) new to wet shaving to try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super important to try every different blade you can.</li>
            <li>They each either tug a little more or simply take more strokes to achieve a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Durablade</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is probably a better idea for several reasons: It gives you more variety, and it costs less overall.</li>
            <li>There are so many razors to choose from, I couldn&#x27;t fathom buying a large pack of one type only to discover</li>
            <li>Even if they are, it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal- 15 blades from this pack is about a seventh of $25 is a little more than $3...</li>
            <li>Nice sharp blades.</li>
            <li>I found three different blades that I liked more than my previous go to.</li>
            <li>It is a good way for anyone starting to shave with a safety razor to try multiple brands.</li>
            <li>I like these blades as a good basic entry level blade for double edge razor users.  </li>
            <li>I have only gotten through one set so far, but the packaging was nice, and the razors are all separately wrapped.  </li>
            <li>I like these blades slightly better than the \\&quot;Super Platinum\\&quot; blades made in Israel, but have only used 1 blade for 3 shaves so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny they all have such nice colorful packaging except these really generic looking Krystal brand blades.  </li>
            <li>Considering the cost of other razor blades in the store for razors that discontinue every five minutes, the double Edge razor and these blades are great.  </li>
            <li>What I have found is pretty much</li>
            <li>Item is exactly as advertised, for a reasonable price, delivered promptly.</li>
            <li>The Astra blades will punish you if you move to fast on your first shave with them.</li>
            <li>There a few nice blades in this pack, and many that tug at my coarse beard.</li>
            <li>Overall decent and still made for an interesting gift.</li>
            <li>I got what I wanted out of this purchase by being able to have the variety to compare and would highly recommend this pack to anyone looking for the same.</li>
            <li>Since I shave 3 times per week, I will easily get 6-9 months out of this variety pack for a tiny fraction of the cost of cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty light beard, but I do shave daily.</li>
            <li>I make my own soaps or shaving creams in my kitchen (timesink: a half hour every two months).</li>
            <li>I get so much more life out of a single blade than I do from a Gillette, Schick, etc.</li>
            <li>Large variety pack.  </li>
            <li>so I look forward to reordering a large quantity of my favorites soon.  </li>
            <li>There is a large assortment of blades to try.</li>
            <li>Little packages come in handy.  </li>
            <li>This is probably a good starter kit for someone with fine to mildly thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Actually, for the price, when you receive this huge handful, you might react like I did: &amp;#34;How</li>
            <li>some of the razors don&#x27;t shave very well</li>
            <li>I bought this set about 3 months ago, and have had time to get to know each of the blades very well.</li>
            <li>Also, I spent some time online learning more about shaving(on shaving forums and</li>
            <li>I bought this set about 3 months ago, and have had time to get to know each of the blades very well.</li>
            <li>Almost all of these blades are someone&#x27;s favourite and just might work for you so the pack is definitely worth buying; I know for a fact that none of the blades are complete trash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product shipped and was received extremely fast-</li>
            <li>would recommend this to any one using a DE razor or straight razor that the blade can be changed</li>
            <li>Platinum and Astra Stainless steel are my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Thanks as always to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>The majority of the blades were 7am and Shark Stainless (none of the chrome were</li>
            <li>They give a very close shave without nicks.</li>
            <li>80% of the blades are fantastic quality (hence only 4 stars).</li>
            <li>He wants to try shaving with the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; blades.</li>
            <li>and it got here fast.</li>
            <li>I did and found out three of the seven worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the sampler.</li>
            <li>The reason I suspect there might be an error is that In one of the images for this product is shows 2 packages of Wilkinson Sword blades which I really like.</li>
            <li>I prefer Astra Stainless Steel blades.</li>
            <li>I did not get any shark stainless and got two brands not pictured.</li>
            <li>Shark Stainless</li>
            <li>did not receive the Astra Stainless blades mentioned in the product description, so I presume the Gillette Platinum were substituted for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>I could just toss out the whole package and not feel like I had lost</li>
            <li>This variety pack includes a lot of razors at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>High quality razors!</li>
            <li>Also important to the shaving process is the facial prep, and it has some bearing on how these blades work.  </li>
            <li>Astra Stainless:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate the Feather blades at 4.5, just below my straight razors at a 5 level of performance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say on it specifically since I purchased the product for someone else.</li>
            <li>But you really don&#x27;t need 3 tucks of each type to make a judgement about the blade.  </li>
            <li>but most fathers will attest that 15-20 min is heaven if it&#x27;s spent looking after dad.</li>
            <li>The blades are imprinted &#x27;Stainless&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that means they are without stains or made of stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>Man, I can&#x27;t get over how much money I have saved since purchasing my straight razor.  </li>
            <li>you really like and stick to.</li>
            <li>The shark blades really sucked.</li>
            <li>Stop dreading shaving every day as if you would rather cross a canyon filled with rabid wolves and pit vipers.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this deal!</li>
            <li>However, this product is still a good deal,  especially if you want to give each type of blade a lot of tries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back and write reviews once I try out all of the blades, but so far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Like others point out, this assortment offers better value for money (only IF you use all the blades) since you get 100 blades ($0.25 per blade).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>But I have to say those generic looking Krystal brand blades have been my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>When starting out using a safety razor, I would recommend trying either this pack or a different assortment pack of some kind.  </li>
            <li>Like the Durablade, they are more sensitive to a quality facial prep.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m partial to the Astra line - The superior stainless seems to be the sharpest of the entire box, and the superior platinum is right behind.</li>
            <li>The facial prep is again quite important to getting the decent shave from these blades.  </li>
            <li>hi platinum,  Sharp Durablade,  Shark Super Stainless,  Shark Super Chrome, and  Chrystal Stainless Steel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to try out the various razors, some seem to be very comfortable shaving my sensitive moustache, but for only two shaves.</li>
            <li>the Sharks, at first, I did manage to scrape the top of my skin in a few places</li>
            <li>Personally, the 7AM blades work the best for me, but it sounds like different blades are better or worse for different people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Similar to the Shark Super Chrome or Astra Stainless - about a 3 out of 5.  </li>
            <li>I kept a smooth face all day long.</li>
            <li>These will provide a solid shave with good facial prep, and last 4-6 shaves.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone looking to get into true shaving and trying out multiple blades for their uses.</li>
            <li>The main thing I like about this pack is that it will keep me shaving for a LONG time- on the cheap.</li>
            <li>I found my new favourite in this pack!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely have to look for a package with some feathers, wilkinsons, and some other blades to try in the future, but this package should do a great job in getting me</li>
            <li>It is not a mechanical razor, so I have to handle the blades more... cut myself slightly...</li>
            <li>The blades included in this set are of decent quality</li>
            <li>I got my dad&#x27;s classic safety razor and ordered this pack of blades.   </li>
            <li>This sentence is extra because Amazon require more words than are really necessary.  </li>
            <li>Stick with some decent shave cream</li>
            <li>If you are just starting out with DE shaving then you may want to pick a sample pack with more variety and fewer overall blades.</li>
            <li>Finding a blade that works well for your facial hair is critical to enjoying your shave.  </li>
            <li>The shark blades seem decent too.  </li>
            <li>There were some decent quality blades in this package.</li>
            <li>These are all decent quality blades and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>A good bet to try a few different brands out.</li>
            <li>Ultimately I was better off buying the blades I like, rather than around 50 left over blades that don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>They are horrible - a 1 at best, and more like 0.5 for shave level.  </li>
            <li>I just started using a double edged safety razor and wanted to be able to try out different blades.  </li>
            <li>For future edits, I will only post info if I find a blade I like more than the highly-rated (by me)</li>
            <li>I am just now getting into shaving with a double edge safety razor, so I was looking forward to trying many different blade.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend purchasing through them, and will be sure to get my razors here next time.</li>
            <li>Seems to offer a decent variety of blades to try.  </li>
            <li>the seller was very concerned for my satisfaction and was willing to send me more blades to keep me smiling (which wasn&#x27;t necessary because i got what i paid for and declined the offer), even though they pointed out that the Sharp blades were in a package of 10.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s not a blade for new double edge users, but only experienced people who know how to handle the sharpest blades.  </li>
            <li>The only bad thing I would ever have to say is that there are way more razors than you actually would need from a sample pack to get to know which one works best, and it could be cheaper by removing the number of razors provided by having one pack of five per type rather than three.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High Platinum Durablade -</li>
            <li>I know there are other high quality blades out there, such as Merkur and others names that would have been nice to include in this pack.  </li>
            <li>but the variety package looked a little more &amp;#34;global.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure every batch varies a little.</li>
            <li>but so far, very high quality blades.</li>
            <li>I did seem to get a few more cuts with the Shark, and the Astra seemed a little more forgiving.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to make a Christmas &amp;#34;shaving gift basket&amp;#34; for my Dad...however some of these blades&#x27; packaging show clearly having been opened, much to my dismay.</li>
            <li>Cost per blade is far below what one pays for modern cartridges.</li>
            <li>I really like the Crystals blades so far.</li>
            <li>Also, the great satisfaction of jumping off the outrageously expensive multi-razor cartridge merry-go-round.  </li>
            <li>or whatever those are called, spend a few more minutes giving yourself a treat in shaving.</li>
            <li>I even tried a different Shark Stainless blade on the off-chance the first one had a manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li>was a fast delivery and a higher standard.  </li>
            <li>The Sharks don&#x27;t last as long but are more forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to try out different blades.</li>
            <li>They replaced the 5 missing blades and added 25 more to the package.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying it since I have heard no negative reviews on it.</li>
            <li>They have good edges and stay sharp for longer than some of the other blades as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you are new to DE shaving or have changed razors.</li>
            <li>This seemed like a really fun extra gift to go along with a new shaving brush and stand.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this variety pack if you&#x27;re new to double-edged shaving, or if you are looking for new blades to try.</li>
            <li>I get 4-5 shaves from one, they are extremely sharp and close shaving blades, and can deliver a solid shave even with fair facial prep.  </li>
            <li>A lot of veteran DE shavers will tell you to experiment with blades to find out which one is right for you.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a razor in this pack I really can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I just bought my husband a brand new safety razor for his birthday.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using a DE safety razor and wanted a variety of blades.</li>
            <li>suggestion if you are new to safety razor shaving, buy this and test them out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to the saftey razor world</li>
            <li>If you are new to the Art of Shaving</li>
            <li>Being new to safety-razor shaving</li>
            <li>purchased this with my new safety razor.</li>
            <li>I liked:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a double-edged razor was a new idea for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will shave maybe two or three times a week and will always replace my blade at the start of the new week.  </li>
            <li>three different blades and none of them gave a me a good shave... too dull.  </li>
            <li>Since he shave his head and face almost every single day, I wanted to get him a nice sharp razor.  </li>
            <li>you are considering going the Double Edge Safety Razor route, or are just not sure which Razor Blade is right for you, then make sure and pick up a Variety pack like this when buying your Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I actually got 110 blades--10 of Crystal Stainless Steel,  20 each of Treet Platinum and Personna Platinum and 15 each of Shark Chrome,7a.m., Astra Stainless and Astra Platinum.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have thought more carefully about the variety in this sampler pack prior to making my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Really appreciate being able to try several brands with little investment.  </li>
            <li>I would make the same recommendation to anyone else experimenting with their first razor.  </li>
            <li>Overall a really nice tester pack of razors for someone just starting out wet shaving.</li>
            <li>But I dislike most of these blades and found a big improvement after sampling other blades.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was interested in finding blades from lots of different places</li>
            <li>and I am not sure this one is better than others.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for any one else first using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I picked this pack up about two years ago--around the same time I picked up my first double-edged razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can have $25 in multi-bladed razors last me 5 weeks (1 head per week shaving daily) or, I can have $25 last me 2 years with better results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is enough blades to last me almost a full year.  </li>
            <li>I use these double edge blades systems as a backup to my normal straight edge razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a decent rating because it&#x27;s a nice value, but most of the blades are crap.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find safety blades in most stores in New Jersey.</li>
            <li>Decent durability, not exceptionally sharp</li>
            <li>Great variety of blades, I was actually surprised by just how many came, and nowhere near disappointed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shaving with double edge safety razors, and buying this kit is really introducing me to brands that I either like or don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And yes, brand is very important, each manufacturer is a little different.</li>
            <li>I am new to DE wet shaving and bought this to find that right blade.</li>
            <li>also ordered a higher end sampler, but it was more money for less blades and less selection.</li>
            <li>And that is half the fun!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve been favoring the 7 a.m. blades the most, but I&#x27;m starting to use the Shark blades a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some brands were good, many were bad, but if you didn&#x27;t  like a certain blade not only do you have the rest of that package to use up, you have multiple packages of that same blade.</li>
            <li>but so far I tried Astras and another one whose name I can&#x27;t recall...</li>
            <li>After that sample blade, all the blades in this variety pack felt like two-month old Mach 3 cartridges.</li>
            <li>Recommend men give this old fashioned way to shave a try.</li>
            <li>I am seventy five years old and have an electric razor I use sometimes.</li>
            <li>The Crystal blade, probably a 3.5 on a 5 point scale and by far the sharpest in this batch.  </li>
            <li>My husband recently started using a straight razor and didn&#x27;t know which brand to use, so I got him this.</li>
            <li>but so far the shark blades have worked wonders.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, I have actually noticed differences in the blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>Crystal Double Edge Stainless Steel Blades - Israel</li>
            <li>I have tried the Astra and Sharks so far.</li>
            <li>so I made the switch to old school safety razors.</li>
            <li>Definitely won&#x27;t be buying some of these though haha.</li>
            <li>Switch to the old school safety razor.</li>
            <li>has turned into my every second day ritual Dad time which revitalizes me and gives me my much needed alone time.</li>
            <li>marked the razor with a piece of tape</li>
            <li>I really like having different blades to try out as a beginner to DE shaving.</li>
            <li>100 blades should last someone about a year, give or take, so it really is quite economical.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I started shaving old school about two years ago after finding my dad&#x27;s old shave kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few samplers now and the Feathers are my definite favorite.</li>
            <li>Good value, but useless.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edge safety razor I highly recommend ordering this pack.</li>
            <li>Get your technique down, and then if you still MUST own some Feathers, go track them down and prepare to be blown away.</li>
            <li>After reading review after review on blades, I finally decided that the only way I was truly going to know what works right for me was to try a bunch.</li>
            <li>My facial hair grows thick and grows quickly, so I go through blades quickly.  </li>
            <li>Some blades seem sharp at first but dull quickly, where others seemed to just struggle from the get go, and yet others seemed just right.  </li>
            <li>so if you find one you don&#x27;t particularly like your stuck with a lot of extra blades.</li>
            <li>For me the Astra is the only decent blade in the bunch.  </li>
            <li>only criticism is that 5-10 blades should be sufficient to try out a particular blade, and there were 15 of some of these.  </li>
            <li>The Feather Blades were much sharper for me and really helped cut down on the irritation I had after shaving.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ordering these these razors are going to last me quite some time</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting back to basics when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li>As such, I required a new blade after the blades that came with my razor got old.  </li>
            <li>If you are a gal trying to shave your legs and nethers in a gym shower braced like a drunk yoga flamingo with one leg against a wall in such a way that the stream of hot water (or hot water bucket!)is accessible but not splashing soap off your intended target, weighted handles don&#x27;t help, ease of movement does.</li>
            <li>No blade, razor or soap will compensate for bad shaving technique but good technique can make just about anything work except for a blade that just isn&#x27;t right for you personally.</li>
            <li>Still no tugging, still very few strokes; and still a darn smooth shave with just no irritation to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li>I was new to the double edge safety razor</li>
            <li>None open or dirty, great selection.</li>
            <li>Everybody&#x27;s facial hair is different and this has a very well rounded set of blades.</li>
            <li>however is that I get to try an assortment of blades and prove to myself that different blades really do have a different feel to them.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but after using 3 or 4 blades and determining I don&#x27;t like it as much as the others, I still have 12 of them left.  </li>
            <li>Everyone is different and people have different types of hair so choosing a blade on reviews alone isn&#x27;t really reliable.</li>
            <li>A better starter kit for thick facial hair would be:  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find some you&#x27;ll love, maybe one to hate, and a lot that are ok.</li>
            <li>but that isn&#x27;t a main concern because different blades work with different razors and faces.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used 3 blades.</li>
            <li>I came across an old razor, similar to the one&#x27;s selling for $35 to $50 that my dad used.</li>
            <li>I surprised my husband with a safety razor and accessories, and this blade variety pack is just the ticket for him to figure out his personal blade preference.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin, especially south of my jaw line and my neck.</li>
            <li>Of course I&#x27;ve only used 2 or 3 so far...</li>
            <li>last one surprised me since they are so generically packaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m addressing the ladies that made it this far, searching like I was, back in Aug of 2012.</li>
            <li>Either take your old razor on the short trip or plan to find some blades at your destination of longer duration.</li>
            <li>Single edge razors offer less irritation, fewer ingrown hairs, healthier appearing skin and significantly lower</li>
            <li>These blades are super sharp and should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a DE razor that included 20 Shark Stainless blades, but wanted to see what other blades felt like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but the fact is they are all stainless and sharp.</li>
            <li>The razors last a long time or at least I do, because they are better than disposable.  </li>
            <li>Also, they are reasonably priced compared to other razors out there.  </li>
            <li>Sharp Stainless</li>
            <li>They were not sharp enough to cut through my coarse beard, however, those with sensitive skin and thin facial hair may have better results with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>None of the brands are sharp enough to last more than a few sessions</li>
            <li>$25 plus the razor cost is going to last me at least 10 months and no one gets to look closely at anything on me until it&#x27;s smooth and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason I would hesitate recommending this particular pack, and my reason for 4 stars, is that I don&#x27;t think there are enough different blades of equal caliber here to compare to.  </li>
            <li>The Astras can last around 3 weeks with near daily use.</li>
            <li>At this rate, I won&#x27;t need to buy new blades for a very long time!</li>
            <li>I have only used one pack of Astras, but the other ones look promising.  </li>
            <li>Definitely lets you see what&#x27;s out there in terms of blades and just how different each one can feel on your face and how different the job can be (I was surprised).</li>
            <li>In this pack, I enjoyed the Astra blades but the 7 am, the Sharp and the Sharks were a little rough for my liking.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Super Platinum\\&quot; blades gave me three shaves before getting too dull.  </li>
            <li>Being new to &#x27;wet shaving&#x27;</li>
            <li>or I just have super thick hair.</li>
            <li>really appreciated that there were enough different razors in this pack to test, against each other and on different areas of my person...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years with multi-bladed (3-5 per head) disposable razors, and they don&#x27;t do near as well as these single safety razor blades.</li>
            <li>If you are new to wet shaving, or been at it awhile using only one type of blade, this is the package for you.&lt;br /&gt;You get to try a wide variety of blades, (a year&#x27;s worth) for less than if you purchased each 5 pack</li>
            <li>So, the reason I am giving only 3 stars is for the no name brand and the lack of variety, I wish this had 7 differently branded high quality products, but it basically has 3 if you count the sharp.</li>
            <li>Okay men, if you&#x27;re tired of paying out the wazoo for razor blades, get back to the single blade safety razor and buy a bulk package of these.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A good prep would give me almost a 3 for shave quality.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything good about the Sharps or the 7 A.M. blades.</li>
            <li> This sampler pack is a good one.  </li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, using glycerine soap and a brush, so I get good shaves from the Gillette Sensor Excel blades.  </li>
            <li> This package was fairly priced and offered variety, but as stated in the description supplies do vary based on availability.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are superior to any in the universe.</li>
            <li> is there was a brand superior to the Merkur blades I had been using.</li>
            <li> is a good way to try a number of blades to see what works well for you.</li>

            <li> This is a great way to be sure that your DE shave is all that it can be.  </li>
            <li> My kit also came with Wilkinson Sword blades that are more aggressive and work great for me.</li>
            <li> Most of them are not that great</li>
            <li> Happy with most</li>
            <li> love it and great service.</li>

            <li> Theres so many choices..finding the best one for my face is kinda important to me</li>
            <li> I purchased a safety razor as well as a straight razor with replaceable blades and this pack has given me a good idea of what works best for my skin and beard.</li>
            <li> My favorite are the Astra Platinums, pick one and find yours!</li>
            <li> sure beats Shick and Gilette!</li>
            <li> and I think I even found my favorite blades (Astras!)</li>
            <li> For this many blades this is a steal of a deal!</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of reviews and online information and it is amazing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I did find an amazing blade, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Cost savings are huge and, once you get the hang of it, a safety razor works great.</li>
            <li> The drug store blades make the 7am blades in this group look like amazing blades.</li>
            <li> And the real verdict of which one is the best is dependent on the combination of your face and the handle you use.  </li>
            <li> I really liked</li>
            <li> The blades are mostly on the medium aggressive level and have been good with my learning curve as I transition to DE shaving.</li>

            <li> When I started using a DE razor a couple of years ago, it came with a pack of Feather blades that I liked quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This set of razor blades is nice.</li>
            <li> The variety is nice. .</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t even ordered this yet, but I did some research into blades and skin sensitively/beard coarseness really determines the best blade.</li>
            <li> ; it works and smells good, it&#x27;s just cheaper and more customizable for me to make</li>
            <li> ; it works and smells good, it&#x27;s just cheaper and more customizable for me to make</li>
            <li> I liked the Astra platinums a bit, but in the end I&#x27;ve grown to appreciate the Shark chromes.  </li>
            <li> I had forgotten just how good a shave you get from these blades, I love them.</li>
            <li> Nice variety pack</li>
            <li> brand gives a slightly different shave, so this multi-pack is a great way to try a variety of blades to determine what brand works best for you.</li>
            <li> This sampler has a good selection of some of the more popular but doesn&#x27;t include</li>
            <li> but they really did work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still a nice variety to get my start in shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> am excited to use the Astra Superior Platinum because I have heard good things about them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to try some new blades and start to learn what suits each person best.</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razors, and it was nice to purchase a variety of blades to find which ones work best for my skin and hair type.</li>
            <li> but they are both super smooth for me and result in perfect shaves.  </li>
            <li> This is a great value and a good way to find out what blades are worth your time, money, and skin when you buy more.  </li>
            <li> BTW all the blades in my shipment were in individually wrapped packages of 5 blades each (except for one package of 10) and the packages are in good shape, perfect for putting some in you overnight bag and some in your bathroom...</li>
            <li> so I decided to give DE razors a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with the decision.</li>
            <li> the price and the number of shaves you can get out of this pack, it is a really good value and will let you try different brands to see what is best for you.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone starting to DE shave to start with a kit like this to get a good feel on the type of blade will work best for their face,</li>
            <li> Good variety here - makes it easy to decide what brand you like.  </li>
            <li> In all, this is a good pack to buy once, find out which blade works best for you and move on to buying only that brand.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome value and a great way to explore other brands.</li>
            <li> Very good razors that all give very close shaves without butchering your face.  </li>
            <li> So far I think I like the Astra Platinum the best.  </li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t tried them all yet, but so far they all work great!</li>
            <li> Astra are the best I&#x27;ve used in the set so far.</li>
            <li> Nice thing about this pack is there are so many to try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far the best ones for me have been:&lt;br</li>
            <li> There, I can load them with stuff that&#x27;s good for my skin and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Shark and Lord are so far the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried one of every variety in the pack so far and they are just wicked awesome.</li>
            <li> Though in principle anyone can use pretty much any blade; the best thing to do is to shop around until you find the right balance of sharpness and flex that fits you and your shaver best.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m happy to have had the sampling and after a lot of shaving, found my favorite (Astra.)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good deal and good idea for someone exploring different blades.</li>
            <li> If the shave prep was more towards a fair to good level, these blades still performed pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I dont know of a better way to try all of these options which cover most of the popular brands.</li>
            <li> Count on about 5 to 6 great shaves with these blades and you can see why this is such a great value.</li>
            <li> First, I am an experienced shaver -</li>
            <li> any of them work great the first shave, but some &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; better than others.</li>
            <li> The W&amp;S blade has a good day one shave but quickly deteriorates.  </li>
            <li> Quickly found some were good for 2 uses, and others could make it 4.</li>
            <li> I found a favorite blade while testing this pack.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Con: I wish there was even more variety.</li>
            <li> (there are so many boxes i messed up when counting)</li>
            <li> im sure someone is reading this and going..</li>
            <li> Simply stated, this is one of the best sampler packs you are going to find.</li>
            <li> There are sets out there that offer more variety, but also cost considerably more, and provide fewer of each blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i think most of them are lower quality blades</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying trying out the different blades to see which ones work best for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this pack.</li>
            <li> Awesome variety to try different brands of razors</li>
            <li> and yes, some are better than others</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found some of my favorite blades from it.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love the Astras and Shark blades.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m enjoying the comparison between the brands.</li>
            <li> Simply stated, this is one of the best sampler packs you are going to find.</li>
            <li> There are sets out there that offer more variety, but also cost considerably more, and provide fewer of each blade.</li>
            <li> Some are better than others.</li>
            <li> It also gives you a chance to see which blades you like the best, as the metals used such as platinum has evolved and the honing process has been refined.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> DE shaving is a satisfying experience.</li>
            <li> trying out diffrent razors to find my favorite.  </li>
            <li> My husband wanted these blades and has been quite satisfied with the order.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be a better deal.</li>
            <li> A better assortment is found here:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered some feather blades and am hoping for a better shave with them.</li>
            <li> blades where ok but never revived</li>
            <li> I wish this had more variety.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> After trying all these I may find one I like more than the rest</li>
            <li> Sure beats $4.00 a blade that I had been paying</li>
            <li> The thing is, it&#x27;s WAY too many blades.</li>
            <li> Want to rule out 6 brands of safety razors and find your one favorite?</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try different blades so that I could find one that works best for me.  </li>
            <li> I was just looking to see if there was something else better out there...</li>
            <li> Fantastic variety!</li>
            <li> Shaving has never been as enjoyable as with a safety razor using these blades.</li>
            <li> Many fillers.</li>
            <li> Even though I know my favorite already, I still use the others</li>
            <li> This is the perfect way to try 7 different double edge blades brands and find out which works best for you!!!  </li>
            <li> This bundle is OK</li>
            <li> What more can one say?</li>
            <li> Most of the razors in this sampler are bottom of the barrel.  </li>
            <li> I also received a more than 100 blades.</li>
            <li> of the blades in this bundle really stood out as great quality though</li>
            <li> think the variety could have been better.  </li>
            <li> There are definitive differences between the blades, where some just seem to work much better than others.  </li>
            <li> My favorite two in this pack were the Shark and the Astra;</li>
            <li> Shark was okay</li>
            <li> but I think I like the Astra better.</li>
            <li> I like the idea that i can try different blades and decide which will work best with my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> DE safety razor blades are so much better than those overpriced multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Being that I have 100 blades, I won&#x27;t have to purchase blades for many years.</li>
            <li> trying out different ones to see what gives the best shave, varies for people.</li>
            <li> This order came with so many razors.</li>
            <li> Great assortment if you are looking for a good double edge blade.</li>
            <li> I get a better shave with some and not with others.  </li>
            <li> This is an interesting group of razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Better shave prep improved performance somewhat.  </li>
            <li> These were the poorest blades in the group, but they are not a terrible blade.  </li>
            <li> They are clearly better than the 7am Durablade, but not the highest quality in the group.  </li>
            <li> Gals, safety razors are not just for men and they are better for the earth if you care.</li>
            <li> And again, this process is WAAAAAY better for the environment.</li>
            <li> Excellent starter pack, came with 5 extra blades.  </li>
            <li> Love these items.</li>
            <li> What more to say.</li>
            <li> I like the most</li>
            <li> Top runners were 7am and Astra...</li>
            <li> but my favorite was Wilkinson</li>
            <li> (And Sensor Excels are the CHEAP ones!)</li>
            <li> I especially like the variety you get to see which blades work best for you.</li>
            <li> I have yet to settle on a favorite</li>
            <li> My husband bought these and is experimenting with these to find the brand he likes most.</li>
            <li> Well most of them are.</li>
            <li> Sooooo many choices.great quality</li>
            <li> these give you a chance to sample different ones to find what works best.</li>
            <li> They sent all the blades pictured, and the cost was OK.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see a lot of variety packs like this, but what&#x27;s especially nice about this one is that it includes Crystal and Astra Platinum, which are in my opinion two of the highest quality blades you can put in your double edge razor.</li>
            <li> I am trying different safety razors and have to say this is one of the best ways to do it.</li>
            <li> Great first pack of razors, easy to figure out what works and what doesnt.  </li>
            <li> Great mix of razors that allows a classic shaver beginner to choose their preference.</li>
            <li> Most of the Gillette variants are pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> Lots of blades to choose from, great for a person new to the safty razor, gives you a chance to try many differnt brands of razors.</li>
            <li> The price was right, and so far most of the blades are good to great.</li>
            <li> The Astra were pretty good and there were both Chrome and Platinum versions included.</li>
            <li> A good 3 out of 5 blade, and consistent in shave quality unlike the Wilkinson Sword.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, consistent shaves, and a life of 4-6 shaves.  </li>
            <li> Great sampling from most of the major popular brands available today.</li>
            <li> A great selection of blades for someone new to DE</li>
            <li> I am very pleased, IF all 100 were included i would be raving right now.</li>
            <li> I got the razors quickly and with a nice assortment.</li>
            <li> AKA Israeli Personna&#x27;s blades are also fantastic and are now my most favorite out the bunch.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to see where the rest of these blades are going to take me in my venture of finding the closest most comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> If you are new to shaving with a safety razor this is a great, cost effective way to find which blade is right for you.</li>
            <li> Several very good quality brands of blades.</li>
            <li> Several are actually very good.  </li>
            <li> As I haven&#x27;t used all the blades yet I can&#x27;t comment on which one is best, but for the value if you are going back to DE shaving or just starting out this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Perfect set for people just getting into wet shaving and don&#x27;t know what blade brands work for you.</li>
            <li> Overall, the price I paid was fairly cheap for 100 blades, and quality of the blades ranged from fair to good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now</li>
            <li> This is a great way to sample 7 different double edge blades, to find the one brand that works best on your face and beard.</li>
            <li> This sample pack lets you try a good array of blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They all fit perfectly in my Parker 24C, Parker 99R and Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Astra blades with wonderful, smooth, comfortable results for several months.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Astra  Superior Stainless</li>
            <li> A 5 would indicate a shave as good as my straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I am new to safety razors and its great to try so many different types of blades for a great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent starter pack for anyone who is new to using a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I will say that the Astra blades are the best for me that I have ever tried and I am amazed at how well they work, mostly because they are extremely flexible, light blades, and that seems to work for me.  </li>
            <li> What I found very early on was that there were 2 good blades (Astra and Crystal), 3 OK blades (</li>
            <li> There was also 6 boxes of Astra in the package so it was nice to see that a third of the total blades consisted of the ones I liked best.</li>
            <li> Received my blades and not only did this include a good selection of blades, but I received 105 blades instead of 100!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to see what razor blades you like, and it&#x27;s probably close to 2-4 years worth of razors, depending on how much you change out your blades.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really recommend buying it unless you are exceptionally un-picky about the blades you use.</li>
            <li> Tried most of the different brands already and all work great.</li>
            <li> So the price for this many blades and the different brands, great deal.</li>
            <li> and I love the results, I could still plan an adventure trip for two weeks in Oregon with the money that Brazilian, arms, pitties, and full leg waxing would cost me per year.</li>
            <li> An excellent sampler pack for those that are new to wetshaving or anyone wanting to try out some new blades.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was new to DE shaving and a sampler seemed like a good idea.  </li>
            <li> about 12 good shaves before I had to insert a new one.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the blades are fine and you have to see what blades work for you.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this variety pack of razors and suggest it to anyone new to shaving with a double edge safety razor so they can find the type of razor that works best for them.</li>
            <li> These blades are all inexpensive in a large pack and you get a nice sized sample of each brand.</li>
            <li> HUGE difference in blades.  </li>
            <li> Having just started DE shaving this is a great way to try different blades.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal: buying this pack of 100 blades gives you 7 types of blades - if you look at this fact and think \\&quot;I only need 1 type of blade; I can pretend to be happy with the largest amount I can buy at once,\\&quot; then consider the fact that all blades are made with different blade angles, manufacturing guidelines, etc.</li>
            <li> A great price to try several brands and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> Great starter pack especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They should have thrown in a cheap plastic disposable container</li>
            <li> They are fantastic blades.  </li>
            <li> Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Sharps are good, shark is ok the best for my beard are the Astras blue or green box.</li>
            <li> They last for a couple of weeks at minimum for me and have been a joy to shave with.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just forcing myself to keep shaving with inferior blades for the next two years until I can just be a happy Feather customer.</li>
            <li> For someone just starting out with a safety razor this is a great way to determine which blades you like</li>
            <li> Both are cheap here on amazon</li>
            <li> Great way to sample different types of blades and see what you like.</li>
            <li> The 7AM blades tend to work great for me, even after the second shave (I would not use any blade three</li>
            <li> Some of the blades work great, some tend to cut or scrap my skin, each brand cuts differently and this pack lets me find which one I like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great deal, great way to understand how your razor performs with different blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d avoid them and buy a cheap disposable razor over ever using those blades again.  </li>
            <li> A great way to try different brands of razors and save some money.  </li>
            <li> once you spend some time learning the process, I&#x27;ve learned to love the art and ritual; it&#x27;s not a waste of time, it&#x27;s a personal investment in my awesome frakking legs.</li>
            <li> When I bought this assortment, reviews suggested all kinds of great blades (the picture of blades has changed since then, the assortment looks about the same).</li>
            <li> Gives a nice opportunity to shave with a variety of blades while figuring out what you really like.</li>
            <li> I bought these in July 2012 and its now March 2014 and still have boxes of blades available.</li>
            <li> You wanna see something fantastic?</li>
            <li> Given the cost and variety available with this pack, you can change blades a couple times every week.</li>
            <li> This is a much better idea than buying, say, 1,000 of some specific blade (say, 7 AM)  and then realizing you can&#x27;t get a good shave with it.    </li>
            <li> I started shaving with a safety razor and its far superior to all the cartridge shavers.</li>
            <li> but so far so good</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> The Feather platinum-coated stainless blades from Japan are the best I&#x27;ve tried for a double edge.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not stupid either</li>
            <li> He was really happy about it, and was excited to try all the different brands.</li>
            <li> If I were to buy these again, I would look for a pack w/o shark and 7am ones but given that the pack has lasted me more than a year I still like the value of this product very much.</li>
            <li> A straight edge razor will give one a superior shave, but it will require more skill and some more time than these double edge systems.  </li>
            <li> I get a better shave with the Astra Platinum after two plus weeks than most blades brand new.  </li>
            <li> Plus if you are new to it you can try out the different razors to see which brand you like best.</li>
            <li> was my original review....</li>
            <li> This is a really fun and cost-effective experiment!</li>
            <li> This variety pack contains 100 weeks worth of blades!</li>
            <li> but I could&#x27;ve done better if I went to Maggard.com first and got there razor blade variety pack.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this was a great purchase as I have some experience with some different blades now, and I have good idea of where to put my money next.</li>
            <li> BUT, the weighted handle of higher end razors work better for guys I think.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, packaging was neat and tidy that it fit inside a normal mailbox.</li>
            <li> data is still being collected on which I liked best for where, but this package enabled me to try different combos over a length of time that would give me more accurate  testing results (your skin changes with long term use of a particular blade, it&#x27;s cool like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladyfriends and Mancreatures, safety razors are a cheaper, closer shave</li>
            <li> I have been surprised to find how different each of the brands are, I immediately found a brand I like better, and am interested to try the rest to see which will serve me best.</li>
            <li> the 10 Crystal blades got some cheap American made 10 blades you can get from the dollar store in place of the 10 Crystal blades haven&#x27;t tryed them hope they are good 7 am blades are Indian made and wouldn&#x27;t use them even to shave a dog&#x27;s Butt.</li>
            <li> They look like the type of blades you would buy for a paint scraper, and in my opinion they are probably just poor product, although I am sure someone will say they are the best blades in the world.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am most pleased with these...</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive a large variety of blades, but I found that many of the packaged were Shark blades.  </li>
            <li> I hesitated for long time on buying this sampler pack because I thought I had already found the best DE blades, but I finally decided to pull the trigger and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a lot of the blades rust pretty quickly, so I don&#x27;t get as many uses out of them as I would like, but that might just be me not taking care of them</li>
            <li> omg I love this, very sheep, not expensive at all, and i love how they all come from different countries, so i could pick and try, thank you very much for this pack great service.</li>
            <li> that I love and was using for a half year with great success.</li>
            <li> I have been happy so far after 8 months of usage the blades are all high quality and have worked well with my Merkur razor that I also received as a gift.</li>
            <li> After getting started with a safety razor the first time, and running out of the sample pack of blades, this was a great way to see how multiple brands feel and not break the bank.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a different blade, this is a good start.</li>
            <li> but I had to add another sampler to get a really good cross section.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied in the package because it really is nice to find a few good blades that I like.</li>
            <li> the reviews of the different blades and get a good idea before you buy THIS pack.</li>
            <li> You get a bunch of different blades for a good price.</li>
            <li> I tried the Shark Stainless blades and had to keep checking the mirror to make sure my face wasn&#x27;t bleeding.  </li>
            <li> My advice - get a smaller sample pack even if it seems like it&#x27;s not as good a value.</li>
            <li> Some good ones mixed in with a bag of sub-par blades.</li>
            <li> But good pack overall.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t gripe too much about the discrepancy though since I did get more blades than I bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the Stainless blades worked better for me than the Platinum</li>
            <li> It seemed to me that the Astra and Shark were leaps and bounds better than the others, so much so that I ended up just giving the others away.  </li>
            <li> Good sampling of different razor brands.</li>
            <li> If you are just starting with a DE it is a good way to find a blade that suits you.</li>
            <li> Astra Platinum:  Better quality than the Astra Stainless, I&#x27;d rate these about a 4 for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Good way to try several brands.</li>
            <li> This is a really good sample set to try out different blades.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to investigate different blades.</li>
            <li> Not a bad way to investigate wet-shaving with dual-edge blades.</li>
            <li> I am brand new to using a safety razor, coming from disposable cartridges so I was a little overwhelmed when trying to figure out what kind of blade to use since I read that one blade may be perfect for one person and a different blade works better for someone else.</li>
            <li> This was the best way to identify a daily razor blade, some work better with my beard (coarse and fast growing) than others.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and Durablade 7AM blades were not that great in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase, I can pick the blade(s) I wish to purchase in the future based on actual using the blade my self.</li>
            <li> When you are starting out and trying to figure out which blade is best for you, you NEED to try each one multiple times as your skill/brush/soap changes.</li>
            <li> The Crystal Super+</li>
            <li> * 15 Shark Super Chrome&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Shark Super Stainless&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Shark Super Chrome - No Country of Origin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely found some brands and models that don&#x27;t work so well for me, although none that really seem great.  </li>
            <li> Ended up ordering a 100 pack of the shark super chromes as a result.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li> Super Stainless&lt;br /&gt;Astra</li>
            <li> Shark Super Chrome</li>
            <li> Great for someone starting out, would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Shark Super Chrome:  </li>
            <li> and I am quickly learning my preferences.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m leaning towards the Shark Super Chrome.  </li>
            <li> These work MUCH better than all of those high priced disposables.  </li>
            <li> These will last me for a really long time, plus I&#x27;ll be able to compare many different brands and see which I like best.</li>
            <li> While ultimately I would choose the blade that works best for me, I would have at least liked to try putting the U.S in the mix.  </li>
            <li> They are, however, more sensitive to a good facial prep -</li>
            <li> If you are in the same boat, I&#x27;d highly recommend it - and at a great price.</li>
            <li> you do not know what blade to get, I would recommend getting this first and try them all out!</li>
            <li> While all the options might be overwhelming for someone new to DE shaving the payoff is that after a little trial and error you can get great shaves.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have a little variety to figure out which type you like.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little sample set.</li>
            <li> Some are very good, some are mediocre, and some are just OK.</li>
            <li> I expect that there are so many variables as to which blades are good for each person (which razor you have, how hard you press, shaving soap, beard type, etc).  </li>
            <li> BTW the seller had a very pleaseing atitudae and genuine concern for my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic way to really gauge which blades work well for you, and then buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> The derby blades were very forgiving and comfortable but lacked the close shave factor.</li>
            <li> Good selection lets you try a bunch of different DE razors at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased a wet shave set for my husband for our anniversary and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Since there are so many different brands of blades available he wanted this set</li>
            <li> and I seem to get about 1 weeks worth of shaving for each blade.</li>
            <li> 100 blade packs (of the non-variety kind) often cost just ten dollars, so someone is making a killing repackaging these.</li>
            <li> I think this variety pack is cool for when you are trying to figure out which blades to use for the first time.</li>
            <li> 7 am are my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I liked the variety pack and received a couple of different brands than posed here, but it gave me a chance to try out the razors.  </li>
            <li> And, you get enough of each kind to determine if it is your shaving technique or your blade that is the issue.</li>
            <li> If you use a blade a week like me, that means you&#x27;ve just paid for 2 years worth of blades.  </li>
            <li> It was nice to compare different blades.  </li>
            <li> The blades were a bit inconsistent, as some were clearly a 4 for performance, but most fell into the 3 category.  </li>
            <li> selection arrived the same time as the razor (which came in handy).  </li>
            <li> It takes some learning but the journey is worth it.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have 7 different brands to sample too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Astra SP so far are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Well, I got this variety pack hoping to learn what types I liked, and I definitely have</li>
            <li> With the popular American multi-blade razor I had been using each cartridge cost about $4</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to shave like your father did.  </li>
            <li> Love every one so far.</li>
            <li> This package of 100 blades is well over a years worth if you don&#x27;t need to shave every day.</li>
            <li> Does not include some popular brands such as Derby or Feather.  </li>
            <li> The variety is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> As we all know a super smooth, non irritating and super close shave is a great way to start the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently gotten into the art of shaving (not the brand) and am enjoying the nice clean shaves that I receive from doing it the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> With all of these other variables in flux, it takes several times for a beginner to nail the blade that suits their face the best.</li>
            <li> For example many people love Derby&#x27;s(my son loves them) but they don&#x27;t work at all for me(they tug and pull and thrash my neck) on the other hand some people don&#x27;t like Astra or Shark</li>
            <li> once.. on the first of the packs of blades, the \\&quot;Super Platinum\\&quot; blades made in Israel.  </li>
            <li> All of the blades seem to be high quality, now all that&#x27;s left is figuring out which is best for him personally.</li>
            <li> but the rest are all good and sharp.</li>
            <li> Really wide variety of razors, excellent would definitely recommend for any first time DE razor users.</li>
            <li> Good value pack, they are all pretty much the same, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, you get a lot for what you pay.</li>
            <li> I am a lady with fair skin and thin/sparse hair and found the Sharp blades work well for me.</li>
            <li> this is not a review of the individual razors but they are all high quality and a good assortment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A number of sources recommend trying a variety of blades to find the blade that is right for you, and this variety pack lets you do just that.  </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to find the right blade for me.</li>
            <li> Have not used them all yet but a super buy and a great way to try several different brands.  </li>
            <li> Selection sent did not match description 110 total received - 15ea Astra Superior Platinum, Astra Superior Stainless, Shark Super Stainless, Gillette 7o&#x27;clock, 20ea Sharp Hi Chromium and Treet Platinum, and 10 Crystal Stainless</li>
            <li> but we can fit in normal society with these blades.  </li>
            <li> Seven types of blades seemed like such a good way to explore the variety that is available to double edged shavers.  </li>
            <li> Good sample of several brands of razor blades for someone who wants to try out a few different ones to see what works best on his face, without having to buy a large quantity of each one.</li>
            <li> They are NOT all the same, and it&#x27;s an easy way to find the one that works for you!</li>
            <li> The razor was sent with 10 Shark blades, and I found them to be good blades for me - long lasting and easy on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is a decent starter, I would have liked a little more variety.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure which blade to use in your new DE razor this is a quick easy and cheap way to test drive a few blades.  </li>
            <li> I switched to double edge shaving because I got tired of spending more and more money for more and more shave tech that I didn&#x27;t need or used.</li>
            <li> Shark Super Stainless - Alex, Egypt</li>
            <li> A good variety, so far all of them solid blades.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just getting into shaving with double edged blades, this is a great way to try different blades.  </li>
            <li> I quickly learned which blades worked for me and which didn&#x27;t, without spending too much money.</li>
            <li> It came with  Shark super blades,  Astra platinum,  Astra stainless,</li>
            <li> It is nice to see and use these single edged blades once again.</li>
            <li> Very nice to get a variety for such a low price,</li>
            <li> , I think (forgot to count) for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The first 2-3 shaves with a better facial prep givessolid 3 level shaves, but they fall off to 2 quickly after that or if you used only a fair facial prep.  </li>
            <li> This package is very reasonably priced and I&#x27;m sure you get 10 additional blades above the advertised 100.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My most recent shave with a 4/6 using the Sharks is one my closest yet.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that it has become somewhat of a hobby because there are so many different products/options that allow you to get</li>
            <li> the perfect shave.(I didn&#x27;t really understand at first how a blade that can be great for one person can be terrible for someone else...</li>
            <li> how many different opinions there are on just about every DE shaving product.  </li>
            <li> My first experience with a safety razor was with the Merkur blade that came with my Merkur handle.</li>
            <li> These blades give you both enough blades of each type to &#x27;get used to&#x27; each, but not too many to regret if one type isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> They are worth the price for the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> DE gives me a closer shave for a fraction of the cost and it is an overall enjoyable</li>
            <li> : Threw away the 7a.m. after first use-</li>
            <li> If you can find a variety pack with about one box of each razor I&#x27;d try that one first.</li>
            <li> Others are more blunt but seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> My first time shaving with these blades</li>
            <li> I am more cautious, like a teen who is shaving for the first time.</li>
            <li> I bought it when I purchased my first safety razor because my husband suggested that I try out a variety of blades.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t have made a better starting purchase.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t always know exactly what you will get</li>
            <li> Now I just need to spend the next two years working through all of the blades, and figuring out what brand I like the most.</li>
            <li> (thanks Gramps!)</li>
            <li> All are made in the Middle East (Egypt mostly, I think, none from Israel in my pack) except for the Astra, which are Gillette blades made in Russia.</li>
            <li> I received these razors in about 3 days from ordering them and when I finally got the package there were so many razors</li>
            <li> A variety pack of blades that will last most guys somewhere around a year.</li>
            <li> I think it comes with just enough that you can discover what razor works best for you without feeling bad about throwing out a pack if it doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> Everything else was exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month since my purchase, and I&#x27;m still on the first pack.</li>
            <li> a bit more than buying the same number from one manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> People have different preferences, styles, shaver/grip, skin tone and texture; not every blade is for or will be enjoyable for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat new to wet shaving and decided this would be a good way to find a blade that works well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be a good assortment of blades for the guy (or gal) new to wet shaving to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super important to try every different blade you can.</li>
            <li> They each either tug a little more or simply take more strokes to achieve a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Durablade</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is probably a better idea for several reasons: It gives you more variety, and it costs less overall.</li>
            <li> There are so many razors to choose from, I couldn&#x27;t fathom buying a large pack of one type only to discover</li>
            <li> Even if they are, it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal- 15 blades from this pack is about a seventh of $25 is a little more than $3...</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I found three different blades that I liked more than my previous go to.</li>
            <li> It is a good way for anyone starting to shave with a safety razor to try multiple brands.</li>
            <li> I like these blades as a good basic entry level blade for double edge razor users.  </li>
            <li> I have only gotten through one set so far, but the packaging was nice, and the razors are all separately wrapped.  </li>
            <li> I like these blades slightly better than the \\&quot;Super Platinum\\&quot; blades made in Israel, but have only used 1 blade for 3 shaves so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny they all have such nice colorful packaging except these really generic looking Krystal brand blades.  </li>
            <li> Considering the cost of other razor blades in the store for razors that discontinue every five minutes, the double Edge razor and these blades are great.  </li>
            <li> What I have found is pretty much</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as advertised, for a reasonable price, delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> The Astra blades will punish you if you move to fast on your first shave with them.</li>
            <li> There a few nice blades in this pack, and many that tug at my coarse beard.</li>
            <li> Overall decent and still made for an interesting gift.</li>
            <li> I got what I wanted out of this purchase by being able to have the variety to compare and would highly recommend this pack to anyone looking for the same.</li>
            <li> Since I shave 3 times per week, I will easily get 6-9 months out of this variety pack for a tiny fraction of the cost of cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty light beard, but I do shave daily.</li>
            <li> I make my own soaps or shaving creams in my kitchen (timesink: a half hour every two months).</li>
            <li> I get so much more life out of a single blade than I do from a Gillette, Schick, etc.</li>
            <li> Large variety pack.  </li>
            <li> so I look forward to reordering a large quantity of my favorites soon.  </li>
            <li> There is a large assortment of blades to try.</li>
            <li> Little packages come in handy.  </li>
            <li> This is probably a good starter kit for someone with fine to mildly thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Actually, for the price, when you receive this huge handful, you might react like I did: &amp;#34;How</li>
            <li> some of the razors don&#x27;t shave very well</li>
            <li> I bought this set about 3 months ago, and have had time to get to know each of the blades very well.</li>
            <li> Also, I spent some time online learning more about shaving(on shaving forums and</li>
            <li> I bought this set about 3 months ago, and have had time to get to know each of the blades very well.</li>
            <li> Almost all of these blades are someone&#x27;s favourite and just might work for you so the pack is definitely worth buying; I know for a fact that none of the blades are complete trash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product shipped and was received extremely fast-</li>
            <li> would recommend this to any one using a DE razor or straight razor that the blade can be changed</li>
            <li> Platinum and Astra Stainless steel are my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Thanks as always to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> The majority of the blades were 7am and Shark Stainless (none of the chrome were</li>
            <li> They give a very close shave without nicks.</li>
            <li> 80% of the blades are fantastic quality (hence only 4 stars).</li>
            <li> He wants to try shaving with the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; blades.</li>
            <li> and it got here fast.</li>
            <li> I did and found out three of the seven worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the sampler.</li>
            <li> The reason I suspect there might be an error is that In one of the images for this product is shows 2 packages of Wilkinson Sword blades which I really like.</li>
            <li> I prefer Astra Stainless Steel blades.</li>
            <li> I did not get any shark stainless and got two brands not pictured.</li>
            <li> Shark Stainless</li>
            <li> did not receive the Astra Stainless blades mentioned in the product description, so I presume the Gillette Platinum were substituted for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> I could just toss out the whole package and not feel like I had lost</li>
            <li> This variety pack includes a lot of razors at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> High quality razors!</li>
            <li> Also important to the shaving process is the facial prep, and it has some bearing on how these blades work.  </li>
            <li> Astra Stainless:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate the Feather blades at 4.5, just below my straight razors at a 5 level of performance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say on it specifically since I purchased the product for someone else.</li>
            <li> But you really don&#x27;t need 3 tucks of each type to make a judgement about the blade.  </li>
            <li> but most fathers will attest that 15-20 min is heaven if it&#x27;s spent looking after dad.</li>
            <li> The blades are imprinted &#x27;Stainless&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that means they are without stains or made of stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> Man, I can&#x27;t get over how much money I have saved since purchasing my straight razor.  </li>
            <li> you really like and stick to.</li>
            <li> The shark blades really sucked.</li>
            <li> Stop dreading shaving every day as if you would rather cross a canyon filled with rabid wolves and pit vipers.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this deal!</li>
            <li> However, this product is still a good deal,  especially if you want to give each type of blade a lot of tries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back and write reviews once I try out all of the blades, but so far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Like others point out, this assortment offers better value for money (only IF you use all the blades) since you get 100 blades ($0.25 per blade).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> But I have to say those generic looking Krystal brand blades have been my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li> When starting out using a safety razor, I would recommend trying either this pack or a different assortment pack of some kind.  </li>
            <li> Like the Durablade, they are more sensitive to a quality facial prep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m partial to the Astra line - The superior stainless seems to be the sharpest of the entire box, and the superior platinum is right behind.</li>
            <li> The facial prep is again quite important to getting the decent shave from these blades.  </li>
            <li> hi platinum,  Sharp Durablade,  Shark Super Stainless,  Shark Super Chrome, and  Chrystal Stainless Steel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to try out the various razors, some seem to be very comfortable shaving my sensitive moustache, but for only two shaves.</li>
            <li> the Sharks, at first, I did manage to scrape the top of my skin in a few places</li>
            <li> Personally, the 7AM blades work the best for me, but it sounds like different blades are better or worse for different people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Similar to the Shark Super Chrome or Astra Stainless - about a 3 out of 5.  </li>
            <li> I kept a smooth face all day long.</li>
            <li> These will provide a solid shave with good facial prep, and last 4-6 shaves.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone looking to get into true shaving and trying out multiple blades for their uses.</li>
            <li> The main thing I like about this pack is that it will keep me shaving for a LONG time- on the cheap.</li>
            <li> I found my new favourite in this pack!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely have to look for a package with some feathers, wilkinsons, and some other blades to try in the future, but this package should do a great job in getting me</li>
            <li> It is not a mechanical razor, so I have to handle the blades more... cut myself slightly...</li>
            <li> The blades included in this set are of decent quality</li>
            <li> I got my dad&#x27;s classic safety razor and ordered this pack of blades.   </li>
            <li> This sentence is extra because Amazon require more words than are really necessary.  </li>
            <li> Stick with some decent shave cream</li>
            <li> If you are just starting out with DE shaving then you may want to pick a sample pack with more variety and fewer overall blades.</li>
            <li> Finding a blade that works well for your facial hair is critical to enjoying your shave.  </li>
            <li> The shark blades seem decent too.  </li>
            <li> There were some decent quality blades in this package.</li>
            <li> These are all decent quality blades and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> A good bet to try a few different brands out.</li>
            <li> Ultimately I was better off buying the blades I like, rather than around 50 left over blades that don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> They are horrible - a 1 at best, and more like 0.5 for shave level.  </li>
            <li> I just started using a double edged safety razor and wanted to be able to try out different blades.  </li>
            <li> For future edits, I will only post info if I find a blade I like more than the highly-rated (by me)</li>
            <li> I am just now getting into shaving with a double edge safety razor, so I was looking forward to trying many different blade.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend purchasing through them, and will be sure to get my razors here next time.</li>
            <li> Seems to offer a decent variety of blades to try.  </li>
            <li> the seller was very concerned for my satisfaction and was willing to send me more blades to keep me smiling (which wasn&#x27;t necessary because i got what i paid for and declined the offer), even though they pointed out that the Sharp blades were in a package of 10.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s not a blade for new double edge users, but only experienced people who know how to handle the sharpest blades.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing I would ever have to say is that there are way more razors than you actually would need from a sample pack to get to know which one works best, and it could be cheaper by removing the number of razors provided by having one pack of five per type rather than three.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> High Platinum Durablade -</li>
            <li> I know there are other high quality blades out there, such as Merkur and others names that would have been nice to include in this pack.  </li>
            <li> but the variety package looked a little more &amp;#34;global.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure every batch varies a little.</li>
            <li> but so far, very high quality blades.</li>
            <li> I did seem to get a few more cuts with the Shark, and the Astra seemed a little more forgiving.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to make a Christmas &amp;#34;shaving gift basket&amp;#34; for my Dad...however some of these blades&#x27; packaging show clearly having been opened, much to my dismay.</li>
            <li> Cost per blade is far below what one pays for modern cartridges.</li>
            <li> I really like the Crystals blades so far.</li>
            <li> Also, the great satisfaction of jumping off the outrageously expensive multi-razor cartridge merry-go-round.  </li>
            <li> or whatever those are called, spend a few more minutes giving yourself a treat in shaving.</li>
            <li> I even tried a different Shark Stainless blade on the off-chance the first one had a manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li> was a fast delivery and a higher standard.  </li>
            <li> The Sharks don&#x27;t last as long but are more forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to try out different blades.</li>
            <li> They replaced the 5 missing blades and added 25 more to the package.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying it since I have heard no negative reviews on it.</li>
            <li> They have good edges and stay sharp for longer than some of the other blades as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you are new to DE shaving or have changed razors.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a really fun extra gift to go along with a new shaving brush and stand.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this variety pack if you&#x27;re new to double-edged shaving, or if you are looking for new blades to try.</li>
            <li> I get 4-5 shaves from one, they are extremely sharp and close shaving blades, and can deliver a solid shave even with fair facial prep.  </li>
            <li> A lot of veteran DE shavers will tell you to experiment with blades to find out which one is right for you.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a razor in this pack I really can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I just bought my husband a brand new safety razor for his birthday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a DE safety razor and wanted a variety of blades.</li>
            <li> suggestion if you are new to safety razor shaving, buy this and test them out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to the saftey razor world</li>
            <li> If you are new to the Art of Shaving</li>
            <li> Being new to safety-razor shaving</li>
            <li> purchased this with my new safety razor.</li>
            <li> I liked:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a double-edged razor was a new idea for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will shave maybe two or three times a week and will always replace my blade at the start of the new week.  </li>
            <li> three different blades and none of them gave a me a good shave... too dull.  </li>
            <li> Since he shave his head and face almost every single day, I wanted to get him a nice sharp razor.  </li>
            <li> you are considering going the Double Edge Safety Razor route, or are just not sure which Razor Blade is right for you, then make sure and pick up a Variety pack like this when buying your Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I actually got 110 blades--10 of Crystal Stainless Steel,  20 each of Treet Platinum and Personna Platinum and 15 each of Shark Chrome,7a.m., Astra Stainless and Astra Platinum.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have thought more carefully about the variety in this sampler pack prior to making my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Really appreciate being able to try several brands with little investment.  </li>
            <li> I would make the same recommendation to anyone else experimenting with their first razor.  </li>
            <li> Overall a really nice tester pack of razors for someone just starting out wet shaving.</li>
            <li> But I dislike most of these blades and found a big improvement after sampling other blades.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I was interested in finding blades from lots of different places</li>
            <li> and I am not sure this one is better than others.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for any one else first using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I picked this pack up about two years ago--around the same time I picked up my first double-edged razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can have $25 in multi-bladed razors last me 5 weeks (1 head per week shaving daily) or, I can have $25 last me 2 years with better results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is enough blades to last me almost a full year.  </li>
            <li> I use these double edge blades systems as a backup to my normal straight edge razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a decent rating because it&#x27;s a nice value, but most of the blades are crap.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find safety blades in most stores in New Jersey.</li>
            <li> Decent durability, not exceptionally sharp</li>
            <li> Great variety of blades, I was actually surprised by just how many came, and nowhere near disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with double edge safety razors, and buying this kit is really introducing me to brands that I either like or don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And yes, brand is very important, each manufacturer is a little different.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE wet shaving and bought this to find that right blade.</li>
            <li> also ordered a higher end sampler, but it was more money for less blades and less selection.</li>
            <li> And that is half the fun!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve been favoring the 7 a.m. blades the most, but I&#x27;m starting to use the Shark blades a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some brands were good, many were bad, but if you didn&#x27;t  like a certain blade not only do you have the rest of that package to use up, you have multiple packages of that same blade.</li>
            <li> but so far I tried Astras and another one whose name I can&#x27;t recall...</li>
            <li> After that sample blade, all the blades in this variety pack felt like two-month old Mach 3 cartridges.</li>
            <li> Recommend men give this old fashioned way to shave a try.</li>
            <li> I am seventy five years old and have an electric razor I use sometimes.</li>
            <li> The Crystal blade, probably a 3.5 on a 5 point scale and by far the sharpest in this batch.  </li>
            <li> My husband recently started using a straight razor and didn&#x27;t know which brand to use, so I got him this.</li>
            <li> but so far the shark blades have worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, I have actually noticed differences in the blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> Crystal Double Edge Stainless Steel Blades - Israel</li>
            <li> I have tried the Astra and Sharks so far.</li>
            <li> so I made the switch to old school safety razors.</li>
            <li> Definitely won&#x27;t be buying some of these though haha.</li>
            <li> Switch to the old school safety razor.</li>
            <li> has turned into my every second day ritual Dad time which revitalizes me and gives me my much needed alone time.</li>
            <li> marked the razor with a piece of tape</li>
            <li> I really like having different blades to try out as a beginner to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> 100 blades should last someone about a year, give or take, so it really is quite economical.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I started shaving old school about two years ago after finding my dad&#x27;s old shave kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few samplers now and the Feathers are my definite favorite.</li>
            <li> Good value, but useless.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edge safety razor I highly recommend ordering this pack.</li>
            <li> Get your technique down, and then if you still MUST own some Feathers, go track them down and prepare to be blown away.</li>
            <li> After reading review after review on blades, I finally decided that the only way I was truly going to know what works right for me was to try a bunch.</li>
            <li> My facial hair grows thick and grows quickly, so I go through blades quickly.  </li>
            <li> Some blades seem sharp at first but dull quickly, where others seemed to just struggle from the get go, and yet others seemed just right.  </li>
            <li> so if you find one you don&#x27;t particularly like your stuck with a lot of extra blades.</li>
            <li> For me the Astra is the only decent blade in the bunch.  </li>
            <li> only criticism is that 5-10 blades should be sufficient to try out a particular blade, and there were 15 of some of these.  </li>
            <li> The Feather Blades were much sharper for me and really helped cut down on the irritation I had after shaving.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ordering these these razors are going to last me quite some time</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting back to basics when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li> As such, I required a new blade after the blades that came with my razor got old.  </li>
            <li> If you are a gal trying to shave your legs and nethers in a gym shower braced like a drunk yoga flamingo with one leg against a wall in such a way that the stream of hot water (or hot water bucket!)is accessible but not splashing soap off your intended target, weighted handles don&#x27;t help, ease of movement does.</li>
            <li> No blade, razor or soap will compensate for bad shaving technique but good technique can make just about anything work except for a blade that just isn&#x27;t right for you personally.</li>
            <li> Still no tugging, still very few strokes; and still a darn smooth shave with just no irritation to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I was new to the double edge safety razor</li>
            <li> None open or dirty, great selection.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s facial hair is different and this has a very well rounded set of blades.</li>
            <li> however is that I get to try an assortment of blades and prove to myself that different blades really do have a different feel to them.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but after using 3 or 4 blades and determining I don&#x27;t like it as much as the others, I still have 12 of them left.  </li>
            <li> Everyone is different and people have different types of hair so choosing a blade on reviews alone isn&#x27;t really reliable.</li>
            <li> A better starter kit for thick facial hair would be:  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find some you&#x27;ll love, maybe one to hate, and a lot that are ok.</li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t a main concern because different blades work with different razors and faces.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used 3 blades.</li>
            <li> I came across an old razor, similar to the one&#x27;s selling for $35 to $50 that my dad used.</li>
            <li> I surprised my husband with a safety razor and accessories, and this blade variety pack is just the ticket for him to figure out his personal blade preference.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, especially south of my jaw line and my neck.</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;ve only used 2 or 3 so far...</li>
            <li> last one surprised me since they are so generically packaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m addressing the ladies that made it this far, searching like I was, back in Aug of 2012.</li>
            <li> Either take your old razor on the short trip or plan to find some blades at your destination of longer duration.</li>
            <li> Single edge razors offer less irritation, fewer ingrown hairs, healthier appearing skin and significantly lower</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a DE razor that included 20 Shark Stainless blades, but wanted to see what other blades felt like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but the fact is they are all stainless and sharp.</li>
            <li> The razors last a long time or at least I do, because they are better than disposable.  </li>
            <li> Also, they are reasonably priced compared to other razors out there.  </li>
            <li> Sharp Stainless</li>
            <li> They were not sharp enough to cut through my coarse beard, however, those with sensitive skin and thin facial hair may have better results with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> None of the brands are sharp enough to last more than a few sessions</li>
            <li> $25 plus the razor cost is going to last me at least 10 months and no one gets to look closely at anything on me until it&#x27;s smooth and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I would hesitate recommending this particular pack, and my reason for 4 stars, is that I don&#x27;t think there are enough different blades of equal caliber here to compare to.  </li>
            <li> The Astras can last around 3 weeks with near daily use.</li>
            <li> At this rate, I won&#x27;t need to buy new blades for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I have only used one pack of Astras, but the other ones look promising.  </li>
            <li> Definitely lets you see what&#x27;s out there in terms of blades and just how different each one can feel on your face and how different the job can be (I was surprised).</li>
            <li> In this pack, I enjoyed the Astra blades but the 7 am, the Sharp and the Sharks were a little rough for my liking.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Super Platinum\\&quot; blades gave me three shaves before getting too dull.  </li>
            <li> Being new to &#x27;wet shaving&#x27;</li>
            <li> or I just have super thick hair.</li>
            <li> really appreciated that there were enough different razors in this pack to test, against each other and on different areas of my person...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years with multi-bladed (3-5 per head) disposable razors, and they don&#x27;t do near as well as these single safety razor blades.</li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving, or been at it awhile using only one type of blade, this is the package for you.&lt;br /&gt;You get to try a wide variety of blades, (a year&#x27;s worth) for less than if you purchased each 5 pack</li>
            <li> So, the reason I am giving only 3 stars is for the no name brand and the lack of variety, I wish this had 7 differently branded high quality products, but it basically has 3 if you count the sharp.</li>
            <li> Okay men, if you&#x27;re tired of paying out the wazoo for razor blades, get back to the single blade safety razor and buy a bulk package of these.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the disposable razor blade model and shifted to buying a nice set with a few hundred razors replacements.</li>
            <li> The ones I&#x27;ve used so far, ASTRA, are sharp and remain so for several shaves.</li>
            <li> So far the Astra&#x27;s have been extremely helpful and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference between different brands&#x27; initial cuts and how long they last.</li>
            <li> The reason was that the Sharp stainless blades must have been out of stock and they subbed Sharp hi-chromium Durablades which come in 10-packs instead of 5.</li>
            <li> With extreme glee and zeal due to the fact that my face is smoother than the very day I was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try these razors out and it will change your life for ever.</li>
            <li> This pack wastes money if you dislike a particular brand since you now have 15-20 blades you have to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li> The above blades handled my 3-5 day rather long stubble with next to no tugging, very few strokes, and with an overall gentle feel.</li>
            <li> I generally will not support any company the tries to deceive me.  </li>
            <li> they will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how long these last.</li>
            <li> I wonder how long these blades will last?</li>
            <li> Turn shaving into a fun experience that is like heaven on a small piece of extremely sharp rectangular shaped metal.</li>
            <li> one of shaving with the Sharks is a little rough, they bite just a bit, but after day 1, they shave very well and are comparable to my experience with the Astra and Crystal blades.  </li>
            <li> The Israeli blades are awful (and I was looking forward to those) and all the others can be found more cheaply elsewhere.</li>
            <li> B007HPXU1C A Wild Soap Bar - Black Willow bark shaving soap]]</li>
            <li> As a recent wet shaving convert, and as recommended for the novice, I bought this to try out different blades.</li>
            <li> There are a couple brands in the pack that will only give 5-6 decent shaves before needing swapped, but the majority of the brands will last at least twice that before requiring a change.</li>
            <li> Slowly working my way through the pack, starting with the Shark stainless blades.</li>
            <li> A single package of each blades is enough to find out that I like it or don&#x27;t, so three of each is a bit overkill.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re limited to only 4 manufacturers (Astra, Shark, DuraBlade, Crystal).</li>
            <li> I recommend a set like this to get the lay of the land before committing to a larger bulk package of a single brand.</li>
            <li> , obviously the dollar amount of my loss was low i know, but for those other misers out there...</li>
            <li> The price is very low (less than $0.75 per week) and this pack provides Israeli, Swiss, American and German blades.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit more expensive than other options out there</li>
            <li> So I am not sure recommending any particular blade is helpful (although I like the Astra and Sharks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a little overpriced as far as a razor &amp;#34;grab bag&amp;#34; is concerned.</li>
            <li> so I could shave with one edge one time and the other edge next time to see how long the blades would last.  </li>
            <li> I started wet shaving a few months ago mainly because of the cost effectiveness (about 17 cents per blade versus about $1.50-$2.00 a blade for the multi-blade cartridges).  </li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer, throw away the 7 a.m. blades, unless you really want to know what shaving with a dull blade feels like.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find that some of the blades are amazing while others are actually pretty terrible.</li>
            <li> it was a minor loss i know.</li>
            <li> the two specific brands not really a sampling.</li>
            <li> It will take you a long time to use all of them too.</li>
            <li> I got this as an intro to wet shave kit.&lt;br /&gt;I am still experimenting with different blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good concept to have this, but I find myself digging through the bag, looking for Shark blades like a kid digging through crap candy in his Halloween</li>
            <li> and I realized just how really not smart it was to continue to purchase multiple blade products.</li>
            <li> So far, I prefer the Shark blades, sharp but not too sharp!  </li>
            <li> I would like to see other brand options such as Merkur, Feather, Derby, etc.</li>
            <li> The Sharp hi chrome blades are in boxes of ten, while the others are in boxes of 5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found the Israeli-made Crystal/Personas to last for a week and stay relatively sharp.  </li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and every one in the pack were of similar quality.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this, or other sample packs, to others starting to shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> of the other reviews say that all the blades in this sampler are low quality...</li>
            <li> These blades have helped me understand the delicacy of shaving and extended my knowledge of how different blades can be from one brand to the other.</li>
            <li> I received enough blades in this pack to last me a few years and lots of money vs cartridge shavers.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a double-edged safety razor a few months ago and bought this variety pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something as simple as a razor blade, there is a surprisingly big difference between some of these.</li>
            <li> If you trust a random internet guy, the astra platinums and the shark platinums are the only prime eligible ones worth putting against your face.  </li>
            <li> So far the Astra platinum and 7am blades are working on my thick coarse beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to wet shaving and was not sure what blades to buy.</li>
            <li> which is what a single razor cartridge could cost these days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just get a single shave out of each blade.</li>
            <li> Shanghai Limited - China&lt;br</li>
            <li> have now started using the \\&quot;Gillette Wilkinson Sword\\&quot; pack of blades made in India by Gillette India Limited.  </li>
            <li> Cake soap and brush, single edge razor.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s too much to pay for the discomfort of someone politely making small talk about my weekend while they are staring quite closely at my oddly positioned body parts</li>
            <li> I purchased this combo pack of different blades in mid-December, 2012 with an average cost per blade of 20 cents.  </li>
            <li> You know deep down inside</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and only require 2 passes to achieve a BBS shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half a dozen different types of blades.</li>
            <li> I had been using Derby extra blades previous to this shipment.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight learning curve to the use of double edged blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My total annual cost for shaving is less than $20 dollars.</li>
            <li> I posted a similar but modified review for this little guy [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m left with 10 Sharps and 5 7 A.M. blades that I have little interest in using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every brand and type is just a little bit different; and it may take a while before you find a brand or two</li>
            <li> Not too bad of a deal, but I wish the variety would have been better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 2 or 3 blades so far from each brand.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re really not.</li>
            <li> Although this pack definitely gives you a bang for your buck, it is missing some cornerstone blades, like Feathers, for comparison with the rest.</li>
            <li> but that is expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to get 10-15 of each blade, instead I ended up getting anywhere from 5-20 and some blades were not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only shave 2 or 3 times a week, so one blade lasts me a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have just started wet shaving with a safety razor</li>
            <li> have a big heavy antique razor</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> ... used all the brands and only ended up tossing out a few that sucked (</li>
            <li> I do believe there were a few extra blades in my shipment, so</li>
            <li> After getting tired of paying nearly $5.00/blade for Gillette Fusion blades I decided to try a simple safety razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and last a few shaves before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I got this to try out blades other than Shark.</li>
            <li> Buying the variety pack was the recommendation in the reviews of one of the other single-brand blade packs, and it made sense.  </li>
            <li> Sharp Durablade&lt;br /</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> There are some other starter packs out there to try.</li>
            <li> Sharp, 7AM, Merkur, Crystal and Feather.</li>
            <li> However, if I had not bought this pack I would have never realized that I like the Astra blades over all the other blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with other safety razor essentials.</li>
            <li> and they are all foreign made blades.</li>
            <li> Sharp Durablade Hi Chromium - Swiss Quality?</li>
            <li> 7am, Sharp, and Shark are all garbage - either that</li>
            <li> Review updated for the Sharp Durablades</li>
            <li> Life was 2-4 shaves, so they are not as sharp as the others.  </li>
            <li> Sharp Durablade:  </li>
            <li> Now, for comparison, here are some other blades:  </li>
            <li> Other variety packs had people saying that they were shorted and to check upon delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update other brands as I work my way through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sharks don&#x27;t seem as flimsy as some of the other (cheaper) blades.  </li>
            <li> so I could sample various lades as I was not sure</li>
            <li> If you are buying this as a starter pack, you have no business going anywhere NEAR a Feather for at least a couple of months!</li>
            <li> The Astras and 7 A.M. blades only stayed sharp for a shave or two and then started to nick my face pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> Astra is the only one that didn&#x27;t feel like it was ripping out each hair, but even that got dull within three shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not IRATE, but i left negative feedback.</li>
            <li> and they should last me at least a year or two.</li>
            <li> I call it 5-star and 3 1-star blades, I guess that&#x27;s an average of 3 and a quarter.  </li>
            <li> 4-6 shaves on average for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate these 2 out of 5 for average use.  </li>
            <li> Its difficult to find good blades at any local drug stores, all those seem to be crap by comparison.</li>
            <li> I will probably pick up one other pack with additional brands of blades before I select the one!</li>
            <li> The other 3 brands, well they look so heavy</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> The feeling over independence over old cartridge razors is enough to make me want to jump up and down every single moment of every time one of these bad boys touches my face.</li>
            <li> Taking away one star because I wish there were less blades for slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> You can get a 100 pack of the Astras for even less, that&#x27;s my recommendation.</li>
            <li> typically replace blades after three shaves.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched to use Safety Razors rather than the expensive 5 layer razors that are marketed in the big box stores.</li>
            <li> stumbled across this and with little research I bought it and figured &amp;#34;well</li>
            <li> Definitely reccomend this variety pack over blindly ordering 100 blades of a single brand that you haven&#x27;t tried before.</li>
            <li> Also, while I am tough enough cookie to take the pain of waxing</li>
            <li> You are given quite a few of each</li>
            <li> A few brands didn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li> Granted, I do not shave everyday.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few repeats, you get a packs of blades per brand and model.</li>
            <li> so why not try a few?</li>
            <li> Tea, honey, rosewood, argon oil, coconut oil, and bentonite clay are just a few items I use, but there are tons of recipes online.</li>
            <li> My guy friends beg for my soap, they grow weary of chemically dried and fried skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave 3-4 times a week, with a heavy beard, and found I got 3 shaves from each of these blades with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not cheap</li>
            <li> I have a fairly stiff beard and I shave both my face and head with my Merkur 34 C.</li>
            <li> Like many others I got sick of paying ridiculous amounts of money for mach 19 and other razors which I perceived to be mediocre quality</li>
            <li> For example, I ended up throwing out the Astra Platinum Blades after the second blade because they were not sharp enough to cut through my thick hair and caused me horrible irritation.</li>
            <li> The Crystal blades seem to maintain their sharpness and they usually end up being replaced after 7-8 shaves before they start to dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> working through the Astra blades, so I&#x27;m not sure about the others.</li>
            <li> Compared with the German blades I had been using, these were, without exception, terrible after the first shave.</li>
            <li> I was sick of paying so much for Mach 3 blades</li>
            <li> , I do not buy the creams and foamy lotions and balms for use with these blades from retail, stuff loaded with nasty chemicals that easily absorb into skin and cause freaking tumors and hormonal unrest.</li>
            <li> Hard to find and hard to beat price</li>
            <li> If you just got a safety razor, pick these up instead of the overpriced dull ones at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> It is hard to beat $.23 a blade compared to the $3.00 a blade</li>
            <li> some spots around my nose that I had a hard time getting to.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard using the others.</li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t shave without cutting myself, I may grow a white mustache and beard.  </li>
            <li> With this assortment you get at least 10 of each blade.  </li>
            <li> A cold water shave in the woods is possible with these blades just not as \\&quot;fun\\&quot; in 30 degrees (EEP).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Having at least a 5 pack of each variety also helps.</li>
            <li> and no really nice blades.  </li>
            <li> I use about a blade a week unless I hate a particular blade.</li>
            <li> One star lower for the ridiculous price though.</li>
            <li> Expect a learning curve with these blades, serious close shave.  </li>
            <li> Just not a good product.  </li>
            <li> There were a couple of terrible blades in here, too, but that&#x27;s to be expected, I think, and of course everyone will have a different opinion.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t have to buy blades for at least a year!</li>
            <li> Both Sharks and a Chinese made W&amp;S blade sold in the Indian market), and 2 horrible blades (the Sharp and the 7 a.m.).  </li>
            <li> however when the order came, it was a little disappointing to get two packages of &amp;#34;classic wilkinson sword&amp;#34</li>
            <li> At any rate, several of the blades in this pack (Astra, Shark, Crystal) rank among the top-tier of DE blades</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review on the blades themselves, however the packaging itself is quite sloppy and half-opened.</li>
            <li> of these are decent blades EXCEPT the DuraBlade (\\&quot;Sharp\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;7 a.m.\\&quot;) which are horrible single-use blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sharpest blade may be the worst for a particular face.</li>
            <li> My son is wanting to get away from the expensive refillables and is finding electric shavers to be too irritating.  </li>
            <li> I was too careless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got three packs of them in my assortment.  </li>
            <li> The variety is helpful unfortunately if you do not like the blade you may end up throwing/giving some of them away.</li>
            <li> go out and buy some random blades in bulk, until you find one that works well for you, as you&#x27;ll just be wasting money then.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this for the variety of blades you receive and for the price.</li>
            <li> this was a immediate disappointment.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not jumping while I&#x27;m shaving because that would be dangerous.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid -</li>
            <li> But the listing is very vague.</li>
            <li> None are so bad that I would throw them out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet found a bad razor in the bunch.</li>
            <li> BAD Blades, IMO.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because i thought they shorted me some blades</li>
            <li> Not one brand disappointed me but</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with any of them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blade that came with the razor was horrible.</li>
            <li> I can state the Durablades are the worst of the bunch.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s the worst that can happen?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you are looking for a different blade, this is a good start. I received 7 different brands of blades from all over the world.</li>
            <li> some of the razors don&#x27;t shave very well</li>
            <li> Good mix and a good price. The blades included in this set are of decent quality and I feel I received a good deal for the price paid. I would like to see other brand options such as Merkur, Feather, Derby, etc.</li>
            <li> As a recent wet shaving convert, and as recommended for the novice, I bought this to try out different blades. This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great deal on razor blades. will buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades. They work good.</li>
            <li> I got this to try out blades other than Shark. It&#x27;s a good concept to have this, but I find myself digging through the bag, looking for Shark blades like a kid digging through crap candy in his Halloween stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gone through all the brands yet, but so far I tried Astras and another one whose name I can&#x27;t recall... anyways, they had to be replaced after two shaves, which is insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next buy will be a 100-pack of Sharks.</li>
            <li> Good variety.  Hard to find and hard to beat price</li>
            <li> Razor blades-Good selection.</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase, I can pick the blade(s) I wish to purchase in the future based on actual using the blade my self.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure which blade to use in your new DE razor this is a quick easy and cheap way to test drive a few blades.  I found a favorite blade while testing this pack.  With some of the brands I used all of the blades and some only one and tossed the rest.  Everyone has an opinion as to the best blade out there, this is a great way to form your own opinion.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> A variety of DE blades from around the world. Good to try to find out what brand your face likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I wish there was even more variety. A single package of each blades is enough to find out that I like it or don&#x27;t, so three of each is a bit overkill.</li>
            <li> I have to make a apology, i miscounted the blades and left a 2 star review (which I am now changing). I was disappointed because i thought they shorted me some blades (there are so many boxes i messed up when counting) The Sharp hi chrome blades are in boxes of ten, while the others are in boxes of 5. I was not IRATE, but i left negative feedback. the seller was very concerned for my satisfaction and was willing to send me more blades to keep me smiling (which wasn&#x27;t necessary because i got what i paid for and declined the offer), even though they pointed out that the Sharp blades were in a package of 10. BTW the seller had a very pleaseing atitudae and genuine concern for my satisfaction. id buy again from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here was my original review....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill cut to the chase it was a minor loss i know. i only received 95 blades. im sure someone is reading this and going.. \\&quot;OMG listen to this guy, complaining about 5 blades!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;well I am not bent out of shape over it However I only purchased from this seller based on PRICE PER BLADE not manufacture, obviously the dollar amount of my loss was low i know, but for those other misers out there... im just saying. I know it was probably a mistake in fact I sent this to the seller ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;My package only included 95 blades and not 100? Since I purchased from you based upon PRICE PER BLADE this was a immediate disappointment. I understand it was probably a mistake however the fact remains. I do not expect you to ship me 5 blades that would not be cost effective?&lt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and BTW all the blades in my shipment were in individually wrapped packages of 5 blades each (except for one package of 10) and the packages are in good shape, perfect for putting some in you overnight bag and some in your bathroom... ect  I am very pleased, IF all 100 were included i would be raving right now.</li>
            <li> I bought this set about 3 months ago, and have had time to get to know each of the blades very well. Simply stated, this is one of the best sampler packs you are going to find. In terms of value, it&#x27;s almost unbeatable. There are sets out there that offer more variety, but also cost considerably more, and provide fewer of each blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, no, there are no Feathers. Guess what? If you are buying this as a starter pack, you have no business going anywhere NEAR a Feather for at least a couple of months! Get your technique down, and then if you still MUST own some Feathers, go track them down and prepare to be blown away. . .by how overrated they are. At any rate, several of the blades in this pack (Astra, Shark, Crystal) rank among the top-tier of DE blades anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I would argue that the fact this set contains a multiplicity of each type is actually a boon. When you are starting out and trying to figure out which blade is best for you, you NEED to try each one multiple times as your skill/brush/soap changes. With all of these other variables in flux, it takes several times for a beginner to nail the blade that suits their face the best. And that is half the fun! Get in there and start experimenting! Happy shaves.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and sample pack. You might think that all double sided safet razors are the same but they&#x27;re really not. And the real verdict of which one is the best is dependent on the combination of your face and the handle you use.  This sample pack lets you try a good array of blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with feather and i think most of them are lower quality blades</li>
            <li> Great blades and they should last me at least a year or two.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. The 7am blades and the Shark blades are not the best but the rest are all good and sharp. If I were to buy these again, I would look for a pack w/o shark and 7am ones but given that the pack has lasted me more than a year I still like the value of this product very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with double edge safety razors, and buying this kit is really introducing me to brands that I either like or don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve been favoring the 7 a.m. blades the most, but I&#x27;m starting to use the Shark blades a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Sharks, at first, I did manage to scrape the top of my skin in a few places so I put those aside and I&#x27;m just now returning to them. I think the trick is to just use them once or twice and get rid of them. Also, I&#x27;m using a Merkur Futur razor, and with the Sharks I dial in about a 3.5/6 on the adjustment, and that seems to help not have any scraping. My most recent shave with a 4/6 using the Sharks is one my closest yet. I kept a smooth face all day long.</li>
            <li> After getting started with a safety razor the first time, and running out of the sample pack of blades, this was a great way to see how multiple brands feel and not break the bank.  Shipping was quick, packaging was neat and tidy that it fit inside a normal mailbox.</li>
            <li> I just switched from cartridge to safety razors a month ago.  I got my dad&#x27;s classic safety razor and ordered this pack of blades.   I have been enjoying trying out the different blades to see which ones work best for me.  So far I think I like the Astra Platinum the best.  Buying the variety pack was the recommendation in the reviews of one of the other single-brand blade packs, and it made sense.  I&#x27;m really glad I bought this pack.</li>
            <li> This is enough blades to last me almost a full year.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference from one blade to the next but they all work great.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Having just started DE shaving this is a great way to try different blades. A good variety for the price.</li>
            <li> Lots of blades to choose from, great for a person new to the safty razor, gives you a chance to try many differnt brands of razors. they will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome variety pack. It&#x27;s a great way to see what razor blades you like, and it&#x27;s probably close to 2-4 years worth of razors, depending on how much you change out your blades.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of variety and there was an abundance of the cheapest looking blade.  Overall decent and still made for an interesting gift.</li>
            <li> I started DE shaving several months ago.  I have to admit that it has become somewhat of a hobby because there are so many different products/options that allow you to get the perfect shave.(I didn&#x27;t really understand at first how a blade that can be great for one person can be terrible for someone else...it is true!!!) I have read a lot of reviews and online information and it is amazing how many different opinions there are on just about every DE shaving product.  For example many people love Derby&#x27;s(my son loves them) but they don&#x27;t work at all for me(they tug and pull and thrash my neck) on the other hand some people don&#x27;t like Astra or Shark but they are both super smooth for me and result in perfect shaves.  While all the options might be overwhelming for someone new to DE shaving the payoff is that after a little trial and error you can get great shaves.  As we all know a super smooth, non irritating and super close shave is a great way to start the day. This sampler has some good options in it but I had to add another sampler to get a really good cross section. I also recommend an inexpensive razor like a Lord L6 or a Feather Popular(both of these work well for me) Also, I spent some time online learning more about shaving(on shaving forums and youtube)and it helped me a lot. No blade, razor or soap will compensate for bad shaving technique but good technique can make just about anything work except for a blade that just isn&#x27;t right for you personally.</li>
            <li> Great selection of razors, a great set of razors to sample and see what works best!</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving a few months ago mainly because of the cost effectiveness (about 17 cents per blade versus about $1.50-$2.00 a blade for the multi-blade cartridges).  A number of sources recommend trying a variety of blades to find the blade that is right for you, and this variety pack lets you do just that.  The razor was sent with 10 Shark blades, and I found them to be good blades for me - long lasting and easy on my face.  I&#x27;ve also found the Israeli-made Crystal/Personas to last for a week and stay relatively sharp.  The Astras and 7 A.M. blades only stayed sharp for a shave or two and then started to nick my face pretty badly.  I still haven&#x27;t tried the Sharps, and I have a 10 pack of the Japanese Feather blades I want to try.  I&#x27;d also like to try Merkurs and Wilkinsons.  This is a really fun and cost-effective experiment!</li>
            <li> Awesome variety to try different brands of razors and yes, some are better than others but they all do what razors do, cut. Not one brand disappointed me but the Shark and ASTRA are my favorites. They all fit perfectly in my Parker 24C, Parker 99R and Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor.  I got what I wanted out of this purchase by being able to have the variety to compare and would highly recommend this pack to anyone looking for the same.</li>
            <li> Great variety pack and I&#x27;ve found some of my favorite blades from it. Personally, I love the Astras and Shark blades. They&#x27;re sharp and last a few shaves before needing to be replaced. The Crystal Super+ AKA Israeli Personna&#x27;s blades are also fantastic and are now my most favorite out the bunch. The Crystal blades seem to maintain their sharpness and they usually end up being replaced after 7-8 shaves before they start to dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sharp and Durablade 7AM blades were not that great in my opinion. They were not sharp enough to cut through my coarse beard, however, those with sensitive skin and thin facial hair may have better results with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this variety pack if you&#x27;re new to double-edged shaving, or if you are looking for new blades to try.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a DE safety razor and I wanted to find out which blade works best for me. I bought this variety pack with that search in mind. My first experience with a safety razor was with the Merkur blade that came with my Merkur handle. After that sample blade, all the blades in this variety pack felt like two-month old Mach 3 cartridges. Astra is the only one that didn&#x27;t feel like it was ripping out each hair, but even that got dull within three shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy Merkur blades until you get used to shaving with a safety razor. Then move to Feather, the best blades out there.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal: buying this pack of 100 blades gives you 7 types of blades - if you look at this fact and think \\&quot;I only need 1 type of blade; I can pretend to be happy with the largest amount I can buy at once,\\&quot; then consider the fact that all blades are made with different blade angles, manufacturing guidelines, etc. These blades give you both enough blades of each type to &#x27;get used to&#x27; each, but not too many to regret if one type isn&#x27;t for you. This is a much better idea than buying, say, 1,000 of some specific blade (say, 7 AM)  and then realizing you can&#x27;t get a good shave with it.    So why only a 4-star rating? Well, there&#x27;s the [[ASIN:B002Z85VJK 40 FEATHER BlueBird KAI GILLETTE ASTRA SHARK LORD DERBY Sampler Blades]] that has 20 types of blades, with 2 blades of each type. Honestly, this is probably a better idea for several reasons: It gives you more variety, and it costs less overall. However, this product is still a good deal,  especially if you want to give each type of blade a lot of tries.</li>
            <li> Several very good quality brands of blades. A great price to try several brands and decide for yourself. Actually, for the price, when you receive this huge handful, you might react like I did: &amp;#34;How the heck will I ever use this many?&amp;#34; hehe But I&#x27;m enjoying the comparison between the brands. Some are sharper. Some last longer. This is a great way to try seven of them for yourself to find out which works best for you.</li>
            <li> Try them all then decide what buy.  They do all feel different.  Who knew...</li>
            <li> A good variety pack that has allowed me to see what type of blades work best for my fact. This sentence is extra because Amazon require more words than are really necessary.  They must have lots of room on their databases.</li>
            <li> I bought this set about 3 months ago, and have had time to get to know each of the blades very well. Simply stated, this is one of the best sampler packs you are going to find. In terms of value, it&#x27;s almost unbeatable. There are sets out there that offer more variety, but also cost considerably more, and provide fewer of each blade.</li>
            <li> Slowly working my way through the pack, starting with the Shark stainless blades. Although this pack definitely gives you a bang for your buck, it is missing some cornerstone blades, like Feathers, for comparison with the rest. The main thing I like about this pack is that it will keep me shaving for a LONG time- on the cheap.</li>
            <li> I started using a safety razor and have not regretted the decision.  These work MUCH better than all of those high priced disposables.  Theres so many choices..finding the best one for my face is kinda important to me lol.    Stick with some decent shave cream and you will have a very happy face.</li>
            <li> Here is what I received in the package:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 15 Shark Super Chrome&lt;br /&gt;* 15 Shark Super Stainless&lt;br /&gt;* 15 7AM HI Platinum&lt;br /&gt;* 15 Astra Superior Stainless&lt;br /&gt;* 15 Astra Superior Platinum&lt;br /&gt;* 20 Sharp Durablade&lt;br /&gt;* 10 Crystal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; 105 blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried out any blades but that isn&#x27;t a main concern because different blades work with different razors and faces. Almost all of these blades are someone&#x27;s favourite and just might work for you so the pack is definitely worth buying; I know for a fact that none of the blades are complete trash. Even if they are, it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal- 15 blades from this pack is about a seventh of $25 is a little more than $3...which is what a single razor cartridge could cost these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product shipped and was received extremely fast- some of that might have had to do with my proximity to the product location though. I think this is an excellent deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely have to look for a package with some feathers, wilkinsons, and some other blades to try in the future, but this package should do a great job in getting me started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d definitely recommend this package. I&#x27;ll come back and write reviews once I try out all of the blades, but so far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchase this variety pack to go with my  Merkur HD 34C, Chrome Plated razor. Very happy with the variety of razors.</li>
            <li> Good selection lets you try a bunch of different DE razors at a reasonable price. Some are better than others. It will allow you to pick the type best suited for you.</li>
            <li> Great starter pack especially for the price. Would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Not too happy with this purchase, I was expecting a product that doesn&#x27;t show signs of already being opened. I was hoping to make a Christmas &amp;#34;shaving gift basket&amp;#34; for my Dad...however some of these blades&#x27; packaging show clearly having been opened, much to my dismay. I can&#x27;t review on the blades themselves, however the packaging itself is quite sloppy and half-opened.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, these blades all perform differently.  This is a great way to be sure that your DE shave is all that it can be.  I personally have settled on the \\&quot;Sharp\\&quot; brand blades.      Throw out that Makemecrazy3 or whatever those are called, spend a few more minutes giving yourself a treat in shaving.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used 3 blades. All were good with quality edge. They should have thrown in a cheap plastic disposable container</li>
            <li> Wonderful products.  Could not be happier.  Will definately will reorder this variety pack.  Blades are sharp and every one in the pack were of similar quality.</li>
            <li> As I haven&#x27;t used all the blades yet I can&#x27;t comment on which one is best, but for the value if you are going back to DE shaving or just starting out this is a great value. I got about 125 blades the website has it at a 100 blades. At 100 blades changing every week you still have almost of two years of shaves. It also gives you a chance to see which blades you like the best, as the metals used such as platinum has evolved and the honing process has been refined.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any one using a DE razor or straight razor that the blade can be changed</li>
            <li> After getting tired of paying nearly $5.00/blade for Gillette Fusion blades I decided to try a simple safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade that came with the razor was horrible. It wasn&#x27;t until I put in one of the blades from this package that I realized I&#x27;ll never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even with the difference in longevity. $0.025/blade versus $5.00/blade. No contest.</li>
            <li> i figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll get the pack and hope that at least some of these blades are worth using.  Several are actually very good.  I really liked the Astra Platinum and Shark blades a lot.  They are worth the price for the whole thing.  I get a better shave with the Astra Platinum after two plus weeks than most blades brand new.  They are fantastic blades.  The Shark are almost as good.  I did not like the 7am at all.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied in the package because it really is nice to find a few good blades that I like.</li>
            <li> I purchased a wet shave set for my husband for our anniversary and he loved it. Since there are so many different brands of blades available he wanted this set so he could try them all out and go from there. If you are in the same boat, I&#x27;d highly recommend it - and at a great price.</li>
            <li> DE shaving is a satisfying experience. These blades definitely help. Recommend men give this old fashioned way to shave a try.</li>
            <li> Like many others I got sick of paying ridiculous amounts of money for mach 19 and other razors which I perceived to be mediocre quality so I decided to give DE razors a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with the decision. DE gives me a closer shave for a fraction of the cost and it is an overall enjoyable experience.&lt;br /&gt;That said, this variety pack was a good place to get an idea of what worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s worked:&lt;br /&gt;Astra Platinum and Astra Stainless steel are my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not: Threw away the 7a.m. after first use- they were horrible!&lt;br /&gt;Still working through the Astra blades, so I&#x27;m not sure about the others. If you are contemplating taking the DE plunge here&#x27;s one person encouraging you to do it!</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Good assortment of blades.  Recommended for someone just getting in to double edged shaving</li>
            <li> As described. Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Awesome-  trying out diffrent razors to find my favorite.  but I may just keep doing these purchases!</li>
            <li> This assortment will introduce you to several high-quality blades. Not a bad way to investigate wet-shaving with dual-edge blades. Cost per blade is far below what one pays for modern cartridges.</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t tried all the different blades yet, but I do like the Astra variety.  I have medium to coarse beard hair and I seem to get about 1 weeks worth of shaving for each blade.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for Christmas from my wife as part of a package to switch to DE shaving. I have been happy so far after 8 months of usage the blades are all high quality and have worked well with my Merkur razor that I also received as a gift. The blades are mostly on the medium aggressive level and have been good with my learning curve as I transition to DE shaving. I use them to shave both my head and face. My kit also came with Wilkinson Sword blades that are more aggressive and work great for me. I received enough blades in this pack to last me a few years and lots of money vs cartridge shavers.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted these blades and has been quite satisfied with the order.  It came quickly and was just as advertised.  Thanks as always to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves the selection! He hasn&#x27;t tried them all yet, but so far they all work great! These will last him quite a while.</li>
            <li> Received my blades and not only did this include a good selection of blades, but I received 105 blades instead of 100!  I started shaving with a safety razor using Derby blades, but I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s important to find the blade that&#x27;s best for your beard, so I decided to try out this sample pack.  Great deal, fast shipping, and great selection of blades!</li>
            <li> Large variety pack.  Enough to last for a year or two</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be a better deal.</li>
            <li> Great sampling from most of the major popular brands available today. Perfect to get a feel for each one without having too many boxes you&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li> Like others point out, this assortment offers better value for money (only IF you use all the blades) since you get 100 blades ($0.25 per blade).&lt;br /&gt;But you&#x27;re limited to only 4 manufacturers (Astra, Shark, DuraBlade, Crystal). A better assortment is found here:  [[ASIN:B002Z85VJK FEATHER NACET BLUEBIRD Blade Sampler]]&lt;br /&gt;All of these are decent blades EXCEPT the DuraBlade (\\&quot;Sharp\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;7 a.m.\\&quot;) which are horrible single-use blades.&lt;br /&gt;Really, you only need 2 of each blade to figure out if you like it or not.  This pack wastes money if you dislike a particular brand since you now have 15-20 blades you have to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews of the different blades and get a good idea before you buy THIS pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four different blades and they all seem to be the same. They all cut my neck equally. I&#x27;ve ordered some feather blades and am hoping for a better shave with them.</li>
            <li> blades where ok but never revived the 10 Crystal blades got some cheap American made 10 blades you can get from the dollar store in place of the 10 Crystal blades haven&#x27;t tryed them hope they are good 7 am blades are Indian made and wouldn&#x27;t use them even to shave a dog&#x27;s Butt. Sharps are good, shark is ok the best for my beard are the Astras blue or green box.</li>
            <li> If you are just starting out with DE shaving then you may want to pick a sample pack with more variety and fewer overall blades. You are given quite a few of each so if you find one you don&#x27;t particularly like your stuck with a lot of extra blades. If you can find a variety pack with about one box of each razor I&#x27;d try that one first. I have yet to find a razor in this pack I really can&#x27;t live without. I can state the Durablades are the worst of the bunch. The best shave I&#x27;ve gotten was with the Crystals, however mileage may vary with each company.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain. You get a bunch of different blades for a good price. I&#x27;ve found a lot of the blades rust pretty quickly, so I don&#x27;t get as many uses out of them as I would like, but that might just be me not taking care of them properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Astra are the best I&#x27;ve used in the set so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to try out the various razors, some seem to be very comfortable shaving my sensitive moustache, but for only two shaves. Others are more blunt but seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> Nice to use all of the brands just to see which work the best for my hair.  I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Astra blades with wonderful, smooth, comfortable results for several months.  They last for a couple of weeks at minimum for me and have been a joy to shave with.  I tried the Shark Stainless blades and had to keep checking the mirror to make sure my face wasn&#x27;t bleeding.  HUGE difference in blades.  I even tried a different Shark Stainless blade on the off-chance the first one had a manufacturing defect.  Same.  Getting these in a variety pack is a great idea and helps you find the best blade for your face.</li>
            <li> I call it 5-star and 3 1-star blades, I guess that&#x27;s an average of 3 and a quarter.  However, it did help me come closer to knowing what to stock up on, and reminded me what&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> I am seventy five years old and have an electric razor I use sometimes. I have tried shaving using plastic throw-away razors. I came across an old razor, similar to the one&#x27;s selling for $35 to $50 that my dad used. I cleaned it up and thought I would give it a try and ordered these razor blades. What a difference. My first time shaving with these blades I was too careless. I put a couple of nice cuts on my face. These blades are sharp. I am more cautious, like a teen who is shaving for the first time. My beard is stiffer than a teens. I wore a mustache for years and also had handle bars and a goatee. If I can&#x27;t shave without cutting myself, I may grow a white mustache and beard.  It is nice to see and use these single edged blades once again.</li>
            <li> I surprised my husband with a safety razor and accessories, and this blade variety pack is just the ticket for him to figure out his personal blade preference.</li>
            <li> Good varity. Lets you try a lot of different blades to see what you like. Can&#x27;t say I like all the blades but that is expected.</li>
            <li> Good selection of blades for the noob like me to try out. There are some other starter packs out there to try. Only thing I would change is take out one of the Astras and one of the Sharks and add a Feather and Bluebird sample.</li>
            <li> Being new to &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; I purchased this sampler pack of blades.  Nice selection. Allows me to try different blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat new to wet shaving and decided this would be a good way to find a blade that works well for me. I had purchased a DE razor that included 20 Shark Stainless blades, but wanted to see what other blades felt like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this and with little research I bought it and figured &amp;#34;well one of these has to be a great blade&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find a great blade for me, and that was the Astra Platinum. However I only got 10 of these blades. The majority of the blades were 7am and Shark Stainless (none of the chrome were included)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to get 10-15 of each blade, instead I ended up getting anywhere from 5-20 and some blades were not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I did find an amazing blade, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars. However I&#x27;ll still be buying some feather and Gillette blades to see how they stack up.</li>
            <li> I just bought my husband a brand new safety razor for his birthday.  Since he shave his head and face almost every single day, I wanted to get him a nice sharp razor.  I had no idea which type of blade to get and I did not want to spend a bunch of money trying to figure out what works best on his skin.  I was able to find the one that works best for a great price.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish this had more variety.  Finding a blade that works well for your facial hair is critical to enjoying your shave.  I will say that the Astra blades are the best for me that I have ever tried and I am amazed at how well they work, mostly because they are extremely flexible, light blades, and that seems to work for me.  That said, both the Astra types are basically the same, as are the sharks.  The other 3 brands, well they look so heavy I wont even put them to my face.  They look like the type of blades you would buy for a paint scraper, and in my opinion they are probably just poor product, although I am sure someone will say they are the best blades in the world.  So, the reason I am giving only 3 stars is for the no name brand and the lack of variety, I wish this had 7 differently branded high quality products, but it basically has 3 if you count the sharp.</li>
            <li> Okay men, if you&#x27;re tired of paying out the wazoo for razor blades, get back to the single blade safety razor and buy a bulk package of these. I&#x27;m so glad I made the switch. Buying these razors I won&#x27;t need to buy blades for a couple years. Can&#x27;t beat that. After trying all these I may find one I like more than the rest but the fact is they are all stainless and sharp. Win Win!!</li>
            <li> I switched to double edge shaving because I got tired of spending more and more money for more and more shave tech that I didn&#x27;t need or used. Instead of the Quattro 7 for the Mach 12, I decided to go back to a time where shaving meant getting hair off your face and not lining &amp;#34;Big Razor&#x27;s&amp;#34; pockets with gold.</li>
            <li> A great deal. These will last me for a really long time, plus I&#x27;ll be able to compare many different brands and see which I like best.</li>
            <li> Still finding which one works for me best but they all are good razors.</li>
            <li> Great way to find what blades are best for you.  That said,  I should have bought a smaller sampler.  This one comes with a lot of blades,  which is great if you like them all.  A few brands didn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li> Great sampler pack of blades. I am new to DE wet shaving and bought this to find that right blade. I will probably pick up one other pack with additional brands of blades before I select the one!</li>
            <li> Nice variety at a great price. Sure beats $4.00 a blade that I had been paying</li>
            <li> Not knowing anything about any of the different brands of razor blades that are out on the market, I purchased this plenty pack.  It&#x27;s a good sampling of the more popular brands.  So far, I prefer the Shark blades, sharp but not too sharp!  I agree with another reviewer, throw away the 7 a.m. blades, unless you really want to know what shaving with a dull blade feels like.  Unfortunately, I got three packs of them in my assortment.  The rest of the blades are fine and you have to see what blades work for you.</li>
            <li> Good value, but useless.  cut my face to bits.  had to stop using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning to Double-edge shaving. I haven&#x27;t used a DE razor since my dad taught me to shave. This seems to be a good collection to try. I actually got 110 blades--10 of Crystal Stainless Steel,  20 each of Treet Platinum and Personna Platinum and 15 each of Shark Chrome,7a.m., Astra Stainless and Astra Platinum.  A good selection to see what I like.</li>
            <li> This is a good value but I don&#x27;t really recommend buying it unless you are exceptionally un-picky about the blades you use. When I started using a DE razor a couple of years ago, it came with a pack of Feather blades that I liked quite a bit. A lot of veteran DE shavers will tell you to experiment with blades to find out which one is right for you. This sounded like a good way to do that. The thing is, it&#x27;s WAY too many blades. After trying all of the blades in this pack, I still prefer Feather, granted they&#x27;re among the most expensive but any DE blade is 1/3 of the cost of using disposables or cartridges so I figure I can afford to spoil myself. I use about a blade a week unless I hate a particular blade. This variety pack contains 100 weeks worth of blades! Most of them are not that great so I&#x27;m just forcing myself to keep shaving with inferior blades for the next two years until I can just be a happy Feather customer. My advice - get a smaller sample pack even if it seems like it&#x27;s not as good a value.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent seller, a real asset for Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good kit for beginners.</li>
            <li> Want to rule out 6 brands of safety razors and find your one favorite? Buy this.</li>
            <li> I just started using a Merkur razor so I wanted to try different blades so that I could find one that works best for me.  This set of razor blades is nice. I have not found any that I do not like, they all seem to be quality blades.</li>
            <li> Some good ones mixed in with a bag of sub-par blades.</li>
            <li> This is a sack of 100 blades.  I bought it when I purchased my first safety razor because my husband suggested that I try out a variety of blades.  I would make the same recommendation to anyone else experimenting with their first razor.  Or if you are just looking to see what your options are.</li>
            <li> Definitely lets you see what&#x27;s out there in terms of blades and just how different each one can feel on your face and how different the job can be (I was surprised). One star lower for the ridiculous price though. 100 blade packs (of the non-variety kind) often cost just ten dollars, so someone is making a killing repackaging these.</li>
            <li> For someone just starting out with a safety razor this is a great way to determine which blades you like</li>
            <li> But  isn&#x27;t that why you buy an assortment to begin with?  With this assortment you get at least 10 of each blade.  Some will do well with your razor and face, some won&#x27;t, you get to figure out what will work for you.</li>
            <li> This is probably a good starter kit for someone with fine to mildly thick facial hair.  The Crystal blade, probably a 3.5 on a 5 point scale and by far the sharpest in this batch.  I&#x27;d say that the 7AM (maybe a 3) is next and the rest are basically a 2.5 or below.  A better starter kit for thick facial hair would be:  Sharp, 7AM, Merkur, Crystal and Feather.</li>
            <li> If you just got a safety razor, pick these up instead of the overpriced dull ones at Walgreens. Everybody&#x27;s facial hair is different and this has a very well rounded set of blades. My favorite are the Astra Platinums, pick one and find yours!</li>
            <li> Good selection good razors but I could&#x27;ve done better if I went to Maggard.com first and got there razor blade variety pack.</li>
            <li> The variety is nice. . .but I received only 95 blades, not 100.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, yes, I know it&#x27;s still a good deal.  But frankly. . .I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Moving beyond that, I like the Sharks and Astras the best.  They give a very close shave without nicks.</li>
            <li> This is a little overpriced as far as a razor &amp;#34;grab bag&amp;#34; is concerned. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this. The Israeli blades are awful (and I was looking forward to those) and all the others can be found more cheaply elsewhere. I am a FEATHER razor man and I think I will stick to them. Well made...I was just looking to see if there was something else better out there...there isn&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be a good assortment of blades for the guy (or gal) new to wet shaving to try. You&#x27;ll find some you&#x27;ll love, maybe one to hate, and a lot that are ok. That&#x27;s the point of the pack, so kudos.</li>
            <li> Nice variety. None of the brands are sharp enough to last more than a few sessions</li>
            <li> Cost effective way to try out a variety of blades. My husband recently started using a straight razor and didn&#x27;t know which brand to use, so I got him this.</li>
            <li> Overall a really nice tester pack of razors for someone just starting out wet shaving. The Israeli Crystal blades stood out for me as the superior blades for me.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice quality product at a good price.  I was impressed with the product and the Amazon experience was a fast delivery and a higher standard.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a big collection of blades that will probably last for a year. The ones I&#x27;ve used so far, ASTRA, are sharp and remain so for several shaves. It will take a year to try all of these.</li>
            <li> Hubby hasn&#x27;t gotten through using all these blades yet, but good price for quantity and variety.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a double-edge shaver, this is a great deal. 80% of the blades are fantastic quality (hence only 4 stars). There are a couple brands in the pack that will only give 5-6 decent shaves before needing swapped, but the majority of the brands will last at least twice that before requiring a change.</li>
            <li> My son is wanting to get away from the expensive refillables and is finding electric shavers to be too irritating.  He wants to try shaving with the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; blades.</li>
            <li> Considering the cost of other razor blades in the store for razors that discontinue every five minutes, the double Edge razor and these blades are great.  Some of the brands sent are very low grade but considering you use one blade per week, the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Fantastic variety! This will last me a loooooong time!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used all but so far the shark blades have worked wonders. Shaving has never been as enjoyable as with a safety razor using these blades. This razor pack will be what I purchase from here on out. It will save a great deal of money!</li>
            <li> Many fillers. But good pack overall.</li>
            <li> I purchased a safety razor as well as a straight razor with replaceable blades and this pack has given me a good idea of what works best for my skin and beard. If you&#x27;re unsure as to what blades work for your personal needs, this pack is a great way to assure yourself what blades work best with your skin.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate being able to try several brands with little investment.  I&#x27;ve tried at least 2 or 3 blades so far from each brand.  It&#x27;s funny they all have such nice colorful packaging except these really generic looking Krystal brand blades.  But I have to say those generic looking Krystal brand blades have been my favorite by far.  The shark blades seem decent too.  Both are cheap here on amazon so I look forward to reordering a large quantity of my favorites soon.  Definitely reccomend this variety pack over blindly ordering 100 blades of a single brand that you haven&#x27;t tried before.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the blades , but the purpose anyway was to find a blade I like. this pack of blades should serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> I gave the product five stars because all the packaging was done well and it got here fast. I think this variety pack is cool for when you are trying to figure out which blades to use for the first time. I personally decided to go with the Astra blades, so the rest are just laying there. However, if I had not bought this pack I would have never realized that I like the Astra blades over all the other blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a DE safety razor and wanted a variety of blades. Tried most of the different brands already and all work great. 7 am are my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors 18 months ago and I still have well over 50. Granted, I do not shave everyday. It is a good way for anyone starting to shave with a safety razor to try multiple brands. I personally love the shark brand best.</li>
            <li> There is a large assortment of blades to try. It is hard to find safety blades in most stores in New Jersey.</li>
            <li> Great way to sample different types of blades and see what you like. I got a total of 7 different styles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working my way through this variety pack.  Much to my surprise, I have actually noticed differences in the blades.  In the future, I believe I&#x27;ll be picking up the Astra platinums, if I ever finish this pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got this packet and switched to a safety razor.  Cost savings are huge and, once you get the hang of it, a safety razor works great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used each brand yet, But they are great.</li>
            <li> A great selection of blades for someone new to DE</li>
            <li> BUY ASTRA AND FORGET THE TRIAL.</li>
            <li> Great mix of razors that allows a classic shaver beginner to choose their preference.</li>
            <li> If you get good at shaving with a safety razor, this is an awesome deal. I know it&#x27;s easier and faster to just use a Gillette razor but you&#x27;re getting a lot of shaves with this deal.</li>
            <li> Great variety of blades, I was actually surprised by just how many came, and nowhere near disappointed! They are all in perfect condition and work very well.</li>
            <li> I liked it because there are plenty of blades to try. Every blade works differently for everyone. Some I didn&#x27;t like, but some I did, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a double-edged safety razor a few months ago and bought this variety pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something as simple as a razor blade, there is a surprisingly big difference between some of these. What I have found is pretty much any of them work great the first shave, but some &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; better than others. Personally, the 7AM blades work the best for me, but it sounds like different blades are better or worse for different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, especially south of my jaw line and my neck. The 7AM blades tend to work great for me, even after the second shave (I would not use any blade three times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and the number of shaves you can get out of this pack, it is a really good value and will let you try different brands to see what is best for you. Even though I know my favorite already, I still use the others I just get a single shave out of each blade. Since I shave 3 times per week, I will easily get 6-9 months out of this variety pack for a tiny fraction of the cost of cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect way to try 7 different double edge blades brands and find out which works best for you!!!  I did and found out three of the seven worked really well for me.  Great!!!</li>
            <li> This bundle is OK but I wish they would have traded some of the 7ams for feathers. I&#x27;ve tried a few samplers now and the Feathers are my definite favorite.</li>
            <li> Yes you get several brands of razor blades and you can find out for yourself which you prefer.  But don&#x27;t bother, just buy feather razor blades which give you a closer shave and last longer.</li>
            <li> Came with a nice variety of razors.  I switch them out every 2-3 days, so I&#x27;m going through and finding which ones I like the best, but they all have done a great job so far.</li>
            <li> What more can one say? This variety pack of blades offers you the opportunity to try from a wide selection of blades from around the world.  Find what you like or don&#x27;t like and settle into a lifetime of shaving, knowing you&#x27;ve sampled and chosen from the best.  Item is exactly as advertised, for a reasonable price, delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> All the razors work as designed.  Happy with most I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Thanks for the sampler.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I think this is a good Idea. I bought this along with other safety razor essentials. I started shaving with a safety razor and its far superior to all the cartridge shavers. sample packs like this, help you dial in what blade works best for you, that way you can get the best possible shave.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of quality blades at a fraction of the drug store prices. I&#x27;ll never go back to multiple blade razors.</li>
            <li> I bought these awhile ago and I am currently using the Astra. Can&#x27;t say Ihave noticed a differance in razors but think that is just me. Now i have enough blades to last me awhile,</li>
            <li> Very happy I bought a variety pack. I have only tried three of the different types of blades. I am new to safety razors and its great to try so many different types of blades for a great price. Some of the blades work great, some tend to cut or scrap my skin, each brand cuts differently and this pack lets me find which one I like. Went to the local pharmacy: one brand, 10 blades, about $8. So the price for this many blades and the different brands, great deal.</li>
            <li> Most of the razors in this sampler are bottom of the barrel.  For me the Astra is the only decent blade in the bunch.  When I bought this I was new to DE shaving and a sampler seemed like a good idea.  But I dislike most of these blades and found a big improvement after sampling other blades.  I suggest any newbie start with a sampler with Astra, Gillette Blue, Personna Blue or Med Prep, Rapira, and Voskhod.  Most of the Gillette variants are pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> one year supply for 20 bucks!!!</li>
            <li> There were some decent quality blades in this package. I also received a more than 100 blades. The total count of blades was 120. I don&#x27;t know if that was a mistake in my favor or if the description may have been incorrect. The reason I suspect there might be an error is that In one of the images for this product is shows 2 packages of Wilkinson Sword blades which I really like. When My order arrived I noticed there were no Wilkinsons in the package. I looked again at the product description and found that it never said Wilkinson blades in the description, so the Illustration did not match the written description. I won&#x27;t gripe too much about the discrepancy though since I did get more blades than I bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the blades in this bundle really stood out as great quality though and they are all foreign made blades. The Astra were pretty good and there were both Chrome and Platinum versions included. There was also 6 boxes of Astra in the package so it was nice to see that a third of the total blades consisted of the ones I liked best. But that&#x27;s what a sampler is all about, what I find best you might find horrid.</li>
            <li> I received:&lt;br /&gt;15 Gillette Wilkinson Sword Blades - Gillette Shanghai Limited - China&lt;br /&gt;10 Crystal Double Edge Stainless Steel Blades - Israel&lt;br /&gt;15 Shark Super Chrome - No Country of Origin, Probably Egypt too&lt;br /&gt;15 Shark Super Stainless - Alex, Egypt&lt;br /&gt;15 Astra Superior Platinum - Russia&lt;br /&gt;15 7 a.m. High Platinum Durablade - No Country Listed&lt;br /&gt;20 Sharp Durablade Hi Chromium - Swiss Quality? I don&#x27;t know if they are actually Swiss&lt;br /&gt;Total: 105 Blades, I guess that is good&lt;br /&gt;Two \\&quot;Sharp\\&quot; brand blades.&lt;br /&gt;I think the variety could have been better.  I should have bought a variety pack that included Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to use the Astra Superior Platinum because I have heard good things about them.</li>
            <li> When starting out using a safety razor, I would recommend trying either this pack or a different assortment pack of some kind.  There are definitive differences between the blades, where some just seem to work much better than others.  This may be a difference in quality, face structure, skin type, or possibly a combination of all of the above.  Some blades seem sharp at first but dull quickly, where others seemed to just struggle from the get go, and yet others seemed just right.  My favorite two in this pack were the Shark and the Astra; Shark from Japan, and Astra from Russia.  I did seem to get a few more cuts with the Shark, and the Astra seemed a little more forgiving.  I also noticed that the Stainless blades worked better for me than the Platinum ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I would hesitate recommending this particular pack, and my reason for 4 stars, is that I don&#x27;t think there are enough different blades of equal caliber here to compare to.  It seemed to me that the Astra and Shark were leaps and bounds better than the others, so much so that I ended up just giving the others away.  I know there are other high quality blades out there, such as Merkur and others names that would have been nice to include in this pack.  It would have also been nice to include a blade from the U.S.  While ultimately I would choose the blade that works best for me, I would have at least liked to try putting the U.S in the mix.  It is always nice to support the home country when you can.  Best wishes.</li>
            <li> just order 100 astra blades for $10 &amp; thank me later. they are superior &amp; a fraction of the cost. let my mistake be your lesson with this purchase</li>
            <li> love it and great service.</li>
            <li> I hesitated for long time on buying this sampler pack because I thought I had already found the best DE blades, but I finally decided to pull the trigger and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I found three different blades that I liked more than my previous go to. There were a couple of terrible blades in here, too, but that&#x27;s to be expected, I think, and of course everyone will have a different opinion. Taking away one star because I wish there were less blades for slightly cheaper. I don&#x27;t need to try 10 or 15 blades per style to find out if I like it. Just put one 5 pack of each type in there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of blades -- it&#x27;s probably going to last me a couple of years.  I&#x27;ve definitely found some brands and models that don&#x27;t work so well for me, although none that really seem great.  There are quite a few repeats, you get a packs of blades per brand and model.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack in 2011, and four years later my wife and I are still working through the blades.  It&#x27;s great to have a little variety to figure out which type you like.  My wife is as hairy as a Turkish woman and I must be part Bulgarian but we can fit in normal society with these blades.  My teenage daughter also likes them to express her emotions on her arms.  She hasn&#x27;t quite figured out the &amp;#34;down the road, not across the street&amp;#34; part yet, so I think she&#x27;s just doing it for attention.  We&#x27;ll continue ignoring her though since she can&#x27;t even do that right.</li>
            <li> If you used the blade for just a week and throw it out you could shave for almost 2 years. I have tried the Astra and Sharks so far. The Astra blades will punish you if you move to fast on your first shave with them. The Astras can last around 3 weeks with near daily use. I have a pretty light beard, but I do shave daily. The Sharks don&#x27;t last as long but are more forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion if you are new to safety razor shaving, buy this and test them out.</li>
            <li> Good for getting an idea of what works for you</li>
            <li> These are all decent quality blades and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  100 blades is enough to last me over a year, sure beats Shick and Gilette!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them all yet but so far, very high quality blades. A really good price point for this number of razor blades. Won&#x27;t have to buy blades for at least a year!</li>
            <li> I liked the variety pack and received a couple of different brands than posed here, but it gave me a chance to try out the razors.  I&#x27;m still trying them out to figure out which blades I like best.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety. You get about 5 brands and 10 different types of blades. I prefer Astra Stainless Steel blades.</li>
            <li> This collection of razor blades is a great way to experience different brands and determine which one is best suited for your shaving needs. It&#x27;s a great price and a convenient way to find your favorite blade.</li>
            <li> An excellent way to sample a large number of blades and decide for yourself what you like best.</li>
            <li> Wow! It&#x27;s fun to try out different blades. I was sick of paying so much for Mach 3 blades so I made the switch to old school safety razors. I&#x27;m still trying to find the right blade for me. Shark was okay but I think I like the Astra better. Nice thing about this pack is there are so many to try. And, you get enough of each kind to determine if it is your shaving technique or your blade that is the issue. I&#x27;m bound to find the perfect blade for me, I hope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to wet shaving and was not sure what blades to buy. So far the Astra platinum and 7am blades are working on my thick coarse beard.</li>
            <li> The products in the picture do not match what was delivered. I did not get any shark stainless and got two brands not pictured. I also got 30 razors each of 7 a.m. and astra and 10-15  of 3 others; that&#x27;s a lot the two specific brands not really a sampling.</li>
            <li> Perfect set for people just getting into wet shaving and don&#x27;t know what blade brands work for you. And yes, brand is very important, each manufacturer is a little different.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a really fun extra gift to go along with a new shaving brush and stand. I was interested in finding blades from lots of different places however when the order came, it was a little disappointing to get two packages of &amp;#34;classic wilkinson sword&amp;#34; blades..  Can&#x27;t you get those at any local drug store?  Maybe they are the best blades ever but the variety package looked a little more &amp;#34;global.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> recently went back to the double edge razor- haven&#x27;t used all the different brands yet but so far so good</li>
            <li> This is a great little sample set. I like the idea that i can try different blades and decide which will work best with my shaving kit. The variety is helpful unfortunately if you do not like the blade you may end up throwing/giving some of them away. You get about 5 packs of each.</li>
            <li> Great sampler. Now I have to fill the word count and this is why I don&#x27;t write reviews for  products.</li>
            <li> DE safety razor blades are so much better than those overpriced multi-blade razors. I get so much more life out of a single blade than I do from a Gillette, Schick, etc. blade. Being that I have 100 blades, I won&#x27;t have to purchase blades for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100 blades for like 25$.  If you use a blade a week like me, that means you&#x27;ve just paid for 2 years worth of blades.  A good variety, so far all of them solid blades.  Of course I&#x27;ve only used 2 or 3 so far...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a decent rating because it&#x27;s a nice value, but most of the blades are crap.  If you trust a random internet guy, the astra platinums and the shark platinums are the only prime eligible ones worth putting against your face.  You can get a 100 pack of the Astras for even less, that&#x27;s my recommendation.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this variety pack of razors and suggest it to anyone new to shaving with a double edge safety razor so they can find the type of razor that works best for them.</li>
            <li> Sample pack came with everything I would like to try and I think I even found my favorite blades (Astras!)</li>
            <li> 25 dollars for 100 blades! Can&#x27;t beat that with a stick! trying out different ones to see what gives the best shave, varies for people. Cheapers than the crappy plastic cartridges.</li>
            <li> Great pack of blades if you don&#x27;t know where to start when picking a blade for your safety razor.</li>
            <li> None open or dirty, great selection.</li>
            <li> This was a great way to find the blade for you! I was new to the double edge safety razor and I couldn&#x27;t have made a better starting purchase.</li>
            <li> Still working my way through them, but I&#x27;m definitely getting a sense of which brands I prefer. Of all the variety packs I&#x27;d seen, this was the best value. ($0.25/blade, at my time of purchase)</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face is different, and one blade is not going to work on all face types.&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering going the Double Edge Safety Razor route, or are just not sure which Razor Blade is right for you, then make sure and pick up a Variety pack like this when buying your Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t go out and buy some random blades in bulk, until you find one that works well for you, as you&#x27;ll just be wasting money then. This is a fantastic way to really gauge which blades work well for you, and then buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> 100+ blades will last you quite a while. You&#x27;ll find that some of the blades are amazing while others are actually pretty terrible. I&#x27;m still new to the saftey razor world so this was a good pack for me to learn what works best on my skin.</li>
            <li> I only shave 2 or 3 times a week, so one blade lasts me a few weeks.  At this rate, I won&#x27;t need to buy new blades for a very long time!</li>
            <li> If you are new to the Art of Shaving this is a must have.  The razors last a long time or at least I do, because they are better than disposable.  Plus if you are new to it you can try out the different razors to see which brand you like best.</li>
            <li> This is a good way to find out what razor is going to work for you.</li>
            <li> Variety and quality and quantity. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Great opportunity to try all kinds of blades to see what works for your skin.  Definitely won&#x27;t be buying some of these though haha.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my brother as a christmas gift. He was really happy about it, and was excited to try all the different brands. It&#x27;s a nice way to try some new blades and start to learn what suits each person best.</li>
            <li> Very good razors that all give very close shaves without butchering your face.  Also, they are reasonably priced compared to other razors out there.  It will give you multiple choices to try different blades with different qualities.</li>
            <li> omg I love this, very sheep, not expensive at all, and i love how they all come from different countries, so i could pick and try, thank you very much for this pack great service.</li>
            <li> Ordered this starter kit to figure out which blades I liked best. Ended up ordering a 100 pack of the shark super chromes as a result. I would recommend anyone starting to DE shave to start with a kit like this to get a good feel on the type of blade will work best for their face,</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li> This order came with so many razors. I&#x27;m still trying to use it all and it&#x27;s been forever since I bought these. Definitely last longer than those triple bladed razor at the stores and cheaper too!</li>
            <li> Being new to safety-razor shaving I don&#x27;t know who to trust when it comes to blades, so why not try a few? So far so good and I&#x27;m liking the Shark Chromes the best. A good bet to try a few different brands out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just getting into shaving with double edged blades, this is a great way to try different blades.  They are NOT all the same, and it&#x27;s an easy way to find the one that works for you!</li>
            <li> The price was right, and so far most of the blades are good to great. I will be making a final decision on which blades I will order from now on when this pack is finished.</li>
            <li> Works good, good variety. Best shave out there.</li>
            <li> Nice variety pack that&#x27;s lasted forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super important to try every different blade you can. I found my new favourite in this pack! Highly recommended if you are new to DE shaving or have changed razors.</li>
            <li> I have just started wet shaving with a safety razor so I wanted to try a variety of blades before I settled for one or two blades to use. This is the perfect purchase to do just that. My package arrived with only 95 of 100 blades. GAH! I was miffed. I contacted the seller about being shorted 5 blades and they remedied it immediately. They replaced the 5 missing blades and added 25 more to the package. Now that is customer service. I really like the Crystals blades so far. I got 12 shaves out of one blade. I have a fairly stiff beard and I shave both my face and head with my Merkur 34 C. Today I will try the Astras. You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this for the variety of blades you receive and for the price. It is hard to beat $.23 a blade compared to the $3.00 a blade I was paying for a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> Good variety here - makes it easy to decide what brand you like.  There is a noticeable difference between different brands&#x27; initial cuts and how long they last.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue with this is there are multiples of each brand.  Some brands were good, many were bad, but if you didn&#x27;t  like a certain blade not only do you have the rest of that package to use up, you have multiple packages of that same blade. Ultimately I was better off buying the blades I like, rather than around 50 left over blades that don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Great assortment if you are looking for a good double edge blade. I&#x27;ve tried them all. Some are very good, some are mediocre, and some are just OK. None are so bad that I would throw them out. You can&#x27;t beat the cost per shave.</li>
            <li> Great way to test blades and find what works best for your face.</li>
            <li> Good sampling of different razor brands. It will take you a long time to use all of them too.</li>
            <li> There are so many razors to choose from, I couldn&#x27;t fathom buying a large pack of one type only to discover I don&#x27;t like it. So I bought this variety pack to try them each out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the best ones for me have been:&lt;br /&gt;Shark, Chrome&lt;br /&gt;Durablade Hi Chrome&lt;br /&gt;And, surprisingly, the \\&quot;Made in Israel\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last one surprised me since they are so generically packaged. The above blades handled my 3-5 day rather long stubble with next to no tugging, very few strokes, and with an overall gentle feel. In fact, with the \\&quot;Made in Israel\\&quot; blades, I had neglected shaving for 7 or 8 days on my third use of the blade. It cleaned me up well! Still no tugging, still very few strokes; and still a darn smooth shave with just no irritation to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest that came in my pack are as follows and have not performed as well for me. They each either tug a little more or simply take more strokes to achieve a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Durablade Platinum&lt;br /&gt;Shark Super Stainless&lt;br /&gt;Astra Superior Platinum&lt;br /&gt;Astra  Superior Stainless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a great purchase as I have some experience with some different blades now, and I have good idea of where to put my money next.</li>
            <li> There a few nice blades in this pack, and many that tug at my coarse beard. I did find one of my favorites using this sampler pack. If you are just starting with a DE it is a good way to find a blade that suits you. Everyones face is different.</li>
            <li> I purchased these when I got into DE shaving. It was nice to compare different blades.  Use one brand for a week, then switch.  IMO the Feathers are the sharpest and the 7am&#x27;s were the dullest.</li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving, or been at it awhile using only one type of blade, this is the package for you.&lt;br /&gt;You get to try a wide variety of blades, (a year&#x27;s worth) for less than if you purchased each 5 pack separately.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal, great way to understand how your razor performs with different blades.</li>
            <li> I have to give this 4 stars because it was a good way to use trial and error with a good value to find the perfect blade for me. I&#x27;m partial to the Astra line - The superior stainless seems to be the sharpest of the entire box, and the superior platinum is right behind. 7am, Sharp, and Shark are all garbage - either that or I just have super thick hair.</li>
            <li> Since this is sort of a \\&quot;grab bag\\&quot; product and you don&#x27;t always know exactly what you will get, I thought I&#x27;d let everyone know what was in my bag:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(10) Crystal Platinum Chrome&lt;br /&gt;(15) Astra Platinum&lt;br /&gt;(15) Shark Stainless&lt;br /&gt;(15) Shark Super Chrome&lt;br /&gt;(15) 7am Platinum&lt;br /&gt;(20) Sharp Stainless&lt;br /&gt;(15) Gillette Platinum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;105 total blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not receive the Astra Stainless blades mentioned in the product description, so I presume the Gillette Platinum were substituted for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> I liked the selection of blades for discovering what I like and dislike for blades.  I expect that there are so many variables as to which blades are good for each person (which razor you have, how hard you press, shaving soap, beard type, etc).  So I am not sure recommending any particular blade is helpful (although I like the Astra and Sharks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I thought was great however is that I get to try an assortment of blades and prove to myself that different blades really do have a different feel to them.  I get a better shave with some and not with others.  Also, some last a lot longer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several sample packs out there and I am not sure this one is better than others.  At about $0.25 per blade, when I did not like a type (like the 7 AM&#x27;s) I could just toss out the whole package and not feel like I had lost out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package contained the brands shown and I got 100 blades as promised, so I am happy.  I would recommend this, or other sample packs, to others starting to shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to DE (double edge) blade shaving.  As such, I required a new blade after the blades that came with my razor got old.  This variety pack includes a lot of razors at a reasonable price.  They arrived on time.  I have only used one pack of Astras, but the other ones look promising.  In all, this is a good pack to buy once, find out which blade works best for you and move on to buying only that brand.</li>
            <li> Great for someone starting out, would highly recommend to anyone! Its difficult to find good blades at any local drug stores, all those seem to be crap by comparison. All of the blades seem to be high quality, now all that&#x27;s left is figuring out which is best for him personally.</li>
            <li> I think this was the greatest investment I&#x27;ve ever made. This variety pack is lasting me a lifetime. High quality razors!</li>
            <li> **Review updated for the Sharp Durablades** __________________________________________  This is an interesting group of razor blades.  Overall, the price I paid was fairly cheap for 100 blades, and quality of the blades ranged from fair to good.  With that, I will rate each blade type.  First, I am an experienced shaver - I use these double edge blades systems as a backup to my normal straight edge razor.  A straight edge razor will give one a superior shave, but it will require more skill and some more time than these double edge systems.  Also important to the shaving process is the facial prep, and it has some bearing on how these blades work.  That said, I will rate blades from 5 (the best quality) to 1 (the worst quality) for a shaving experience.  A 5 would indicate a shave as good as my straight razor.  Also, the blades I review here are the ones I received, and it&#x27;s possible when you purchase these blades in the future the seller may have a different mix of manufacturers.  Wilkinson Sword:  Overall, a 3 out of 5 for quality.  The blades were a bit inconsistent, as some were clearly a 4 for performance, but most fell into the 3 category.  These lasted 4-6 shaves on average for me.  If the shave prep was more towards a fair to good level, these blades still performed pretty well.  Better shave prep improved performance somewhat.  7am Durablade:  I&#x27;d rate these 2 out of 5 for average use.  These were the poorest blades in the group, but they are not a terrible blade.  They are, however, more sensitive to a good facial prep - you can&#x27;t skimp on the prep for these blades to perform.  A good prep would give me almost a 3 for shave quality.  Life was 2-4 shaves, so they are not as sharp as the others.  Shark Super Chrome:  These are almost a 3 out of 5.  They are clearly better than the 7am Durablade, but not the highest quality in the group.  Like the Durablade, they are more sensitive to a quality facial prep.  The first 2-3 shaves with a better facial prep givessolid 3 level shaves, but they fall off to 2 quickly after that or if you used only a fair facial prep.  Astra Stainless:  A good 3 out of 5 blade, and consistent in shave quality unlike the Wilkinson Sword.  These will provide a solid shave with good facial prep, and last 4-6 shaves.  I like these blades as a good basic entry level blade for double edge razor users.  Astra Platinum:  Better quality than the Astra Stainless, I&#x27;d rate these about a 4 for a closer shave.  Good quality, consistent shaves, and a life of 4-6 shaves.  An excellent mid-range blade.  Sharp Durablade:  Similar to the Shark Super Chrome or Astra Stainless - about a 3 out of 5.  Decent durability, not exceptionally sharp so you won&#x27;t get the closest of shaves.  The facial prep is again quite important to getting the decent shave from these blades.  Now, for comparison, here are some other blades:  The Feather platinum-coated stainless blades from Japan are the best I&#x27;ve tried for a double edge.  I get 4-5 shaves from one, they are extremely sharp and close shaving blades, and can deliver a solid shave even with fair facial prep.  I&#x27;d rate the Feather blades at 4.5, just below my straight razors at a 5 level of performance.  The closeness of the shave from a Feather blade is what distinguishes it from all the others.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s not a blade for new double edge users, but only experienced people who know how to handle the sharpest blades.  And by way of comparison, I&#x27;ve tried generic drug store blades (CVS).  They are horrible - a 1 at best, and more like 0.5 for shave level.  I&#x27;d avoid them and buy a cheap disposable razor over ever using those blades again.  The drug store blades make the 7am blades in this group look like amazing blades.</li>
            <li> A great way to try different brands of razors and save some money.  In this pack, I enjoyed the Astra blades but the 7 am, the Sharp and the Sharks were a little rough for my liking.</li>
            <li> I just received the multi-pack, and it was as described. Now I just need to spend the next two years working through all of the blades, and figuring out what brand I like the most.</li>
            <li> This is a good variety of razor blades and is nice to rotate with them, so that you can test out which one is best for you.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even ordered this yet, but I did some research into blades and skin sensitively/beard coarseness really determines the best blade. The sharpest blade may be the worst for a particular face. So a variety pack should be ones starter pack until the &#x27;best of the pack&#x27; emerges.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blade selection when I ordered the Parker 96R razor.&lt;br /&gt;Good selection arrived the same time as the razor (which came in handy).  Little packages come in handy.  Blades are very sharp.  Expect a learning curve with these blades, serious close shave.  Overall I like the shark (made in Egypt) blades the best.  Your mileage may vary, try them all &amp; decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> No, boys, I wasn&#x27;t calling you names. This information should still be of use, just know this isn&#x27;t a man&#x27;s review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m addressing the ladies that made it this far, searching like I was, back in Aug of 2012. Gals, safety razors are not just for men and they are better for the earth if you care. Whaddaya know, I&#x27;m a hippie that shaves...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a big heavy antique razor (thanks Gramps!) that I love and was using for a half year with great success. BUT, the weighted handle of higher end razors work better for guys I think. If you are a gal trying to shave your legs and nethers in a gym shower braced like a drunk yoga flamingo with one leg against a wall in such a way that the stream of hot water (or hot water bucket!)is accessible but not splashing soap off your intended target, weighted handles don&#x27;t help, ease of movement does. I posted a similar but modified review for this little guy [[ASIN:B0046DCJ6U MERKUR Bakelite Safety Shaving Razor (Model: MK030)]], I had purchased it as a travel razor but soon found it way easier to use for my purposes and err...delicate target areas. Ahem. It takes some learning but the journey is worth it. And again, this process is WAAAAAY better for the environment. Plus I don&#x27;t like giving WalMart my money. *cough THE DEVIL cough*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s February of 2013 (6 months)and I still have about 40 of the 100 blades I purchased in August. I shave my legs every two days in the heat, here in CA that&#x27;s summer, fall, spring. Every 3-4 days in winter unless I&#x27;m training in the wilderness. A cold water shave in the woods is possible with these blades just not as \\&quot;fun\\&quot; in 30 degrees (EEP).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciated that there were enough different razors in this pack to test, against each other and on different areas of my person...data is still being collected on which I liked best for where, but this package enabled me to try different combos over a length of time that would give me more accurate  testing results (your skin changes with long term use of a particular blade, it&#x27;s cool like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladyfriends and Mancreatures, safety razors are a cheaper, closer shave once you spend some time learning the process, I&#x27;ve learned to love the art and ritual; it&#x27;s not a waste of time, it&#x27;s a personal investment in my awesome frakking legs. The men that are privileged to touch pay compliments, the girls with their overpriced Venus Mach whatevers are jealous and want to learn. Also, while I am tough enough cookie to take the pain of waxing and I love the results, I could still plan an adventure trip for two weeks in Oregon with the money that Brazilian, arms, pitties, and full leg waxing would cost me per year. I feel it&#x27;s too much to pay for the discomfort of someone politely making small talk about my weekend while they are staring quite closely at my oddly positioned body parts and I am having to resist the urge to punch them in the face for ripping my hair off. PASS.  $25 plus the razor cost is going to last me at least 10 months and no one gets to look closely at anything on me until it&#x27;s smooth and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final note, I do not buy the creams and foamy lotions and balms for use with these blades from retail, stuff loaded with nasty chemicals that easily absorb into skin and cause freaking tumors and hormonal unrest. No thanks. I make my own soaps or shaving creams in my kitchen (timesink: a half hour every two months). There, I can load them with stuff that&#x27;s good for my skin and smells fantastic. Tea, honey, rosewood, argon oil, coconut oil, and bentonite clay are just a few items I use, but there are tons of recipes online. My guy friends beg for my soap, they grow weary of chemically dried and fried skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend your time to make soap, I get it; there&#x27;s emails to be read, beer to drink, and naps to be had. You have compromise options out there. I&#x27;ve used this soap [[ASIN:B007HPXU1C A Wild Soap Bar - Black Willow bark shaving soap]]; it works and smells good, it&#x27;s just cheaper and more customizable for me to make&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck and Happy Weedwacking.having soap]]; it works and smells good, it&#x27;s just cheaper and more customizable for me to make&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck and Happy Weedwacking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half a dozen different types of blades. Great way to find out what works for you before committing. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 because it was a great way to decide which blades worked best for my husband. Already decided one was a no go but two others worked wonderfully for him.</li>
            <li> When I bought this assortment, reviews suggested all kinds of great blades (the picture of blades has changed since then, the assortment looks about the same). All are made in the Middle East (Egypt mostly, I think, none from Israel in my pack) except for the Astra, which are Gillette blades made in Russia. Compared with the German blades I had been using, these were, without exception, terrible after the first shave. And I have a beard, so only shave my neck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say on it specifically since I purchased the product for someone else. I would recommend buying it since I have heard no negative reviews on it.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have thought more carefully about the variety in this sampler pack prior to making my purchase.  Seven types of blades seemed like such a good way to explore the variety that is available to double edged shavers.  But you really don&#x27;t need 3 tucks of each type to make a judgement about the blade.  Two blades each would have been sufficient.  What I found very early on was that there were 2 good blades (Astra and Crystal), 3 OK blades (Both Sharks and a Chinese made W&amp;S blade sold in the Indian market), and 2 horrible blades (the Sharp and the 7 a.m.).  Now I&#x27;m left with 10 Sharps and 5 7 A.M. blades that I have little interest in using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically replace blades after three shaves.  The Astra and Crystal blades are great through all three shaves and I could probably stretch and get two more good shaves out of them.  The Sharks and W&amp;S blades aren&#x27;t consistently great.  Day one of shaving with the Sharks is a little rough, they bite just a bit, but after day 1, they shave very well and are comparable to my experience with the Astra and Crystal blades.  The W&amp;S blade has a good day one shave but quickly deteriorates.  I can&#x27;t say anything good about the Sharps or the 7 A.M. blades.</li>
            <li> I received these razors in about 3 days from ordering them and when I finally got the package there were so many razors I ha no idea where to put them all. I highly recommend ordering these these razors are going to last me quite some time and when I&#x27;m out I will order the same razors again</li>
            <li> I havent worked through all of the blades yet, but I can see there are vast differences in DE blades and I am quickly learning my preferences. I dont know of a better way to try all of these options which cover most of the popular brands.</li>
            <li> A variety pack of blades that will last most guys somewhere around a year. Gives a nice opportunity to shave with a variety of blades while figuring out what you really like.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how long these last. I got tired of the disposable razor blade model and shifted to buying a nice set with a few hundred razors replacements. I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now and I&#x27;m never going back to disposable blades.</li>
            <li> Purchased the sampler after converting to DE razor after years of using cartridges.  This was the best way to identify a daily razor blade, some work better with my beard (coarse and fast growing) than others.  Quickly found some were good for 2 uses, and others could make it 4.</li>
            <li> Excellent starter pack, came with 5 extra blades.  I think it comes with just enough that you can discover what razor works best for you without feeling bad about throwing out a pack if it doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> I am brand new to using a safety razor, coming from disposable cartridges so I was a little overwhelmed when trying to figure out what kind of blade to use since I read that one blade may be perfect for one person and a different blade works better for someone else. I did some research and found this variety pack. Other variety packs had people saying that they were shorted and to check upon delivery. I did that and came up with 105. The reason was that the Sharp stainless blades must have been out of stock and they subbed Sharp hi-chromium Durablades which come in 10-packs instead of 5. They tossed 2 of them in, giving me 5 extra blades. Everything else was exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other reviews say that all the blades in this sampler are low quality... Well, this is the cheapest sampler pack out there for a reason. If you decided to start shaving with a safety razor to save money, this is a perfect sampler for you. These blades are all inexpensive in a large pack and you get a nice sized sample of each brand. It is nice to have 7 different brands to sample too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered a higher end sampler, but it was more money for less blades and less selection. This is a fantastic sampler and it is a very good price at 24 cents a blade. I will update when I sample the blades.</li>
            <li> I wonder how long these blades will last? It&#x27;s been a month since my purchase, and I&#x27;m still on the first pack. Switch to the old school safety razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent trial pack. Has enough variety to help you find that blade that truly suits you. Give it a try, theres one brand of blades in this pack that will stand out above the rest for you. Then you can stock up in bulk on that one.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Love these items.</li>
            <li> Selection sent did not match description 110 total received - 15ea Astra Superior Platinum, Astra Superior Stainless, Shark Super Stainless, Gillette 7o&#x27;clock, 20ea Sharp Hi Chromium and Treet Platinum, and 10 Crystal Stainless</li>
            <li> A mixed bag of razor blades. What more to say. this is not a review of the individual razors but they are all high quality and a good assortment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this with my new safety razor. Definitely recommend for any one else first using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I got these to try and find an ideal razor for my face.  I have only gotten through one set so far, but the packaging was nice, and the razors are all separately wrapped.  Very nice to get a variety for such a low price,</li>
            <li> I just started using a double edged safety razor and wanted to be able to try out different blades.  This sampler pack is a good one.  I quickly learned which blades worked for me and which didn&#x27;t, without spending too much money.</li>
            <li> Really wide variety of razors, excellent would definitely recommend for any first time DE razor users. The only bad thing I would ever have to say is that there are way more razors than you actually would need from a sample pack to get to know which one works best, and it could be cheaper by removing the number of razors provided by having one pack of five per type rather than three.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using them</li>
            <li> This is a great sample pack of DE razor blades. I&#x27;ve tried 3 of the 7 brands that arrived at my door way in advance. The Astra SP so far are my favorite. They are very sharp and only require 2 passes to achieve a BBS shave. This is a perfect way to try many brands out without committing to a bulk buy that you may or may not be happy with. I had been using Derby extra blades previous to this shipment. The derby blades were very forgiving and comfortable but lacked the close shave factor. I am very excited to see where the rest of these blades are going to take me in my venture of finding the closest most comfortable shave. This package is very reasonably priced and I&#x27;m sure you get 10 additional blades above the advertised 100. I am a father of two children and my every second day chore of shaving has turned into my every second day ritual Dad time which revitalizes me and gives me my much needed alone time. Its only 15-20 min but most fathers will attest that 15-20 min is heaven if it&#x27;s spent looking after dad. Cheers guys and happy shaving</li>
            <li> This variety pack actually contained 105 blades. For one who has not decided on a favorite razor this is the perfect pack to make your decision. I haven&#x27;t yet found a bad razor in the bunch.</li>
            <li> Bought this kit to test out which brand I like the most... used all the brands and only ended up tossing out a few that sucked (forgot which ones). Top runners were 7am and Astra... but my favorite was Wilkinson so that&#x27;s all I buy now.</li>
            <li> These variety packs are great, they help me pick out my favorite brands! Shark and Lord are so far the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and am very impressed with the variety of blades. I&#x27;ve only recently gotten into the art of shaving (not the brand) and am enjoying the nice clean shaves that I receive from doing it the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; way. These blades have helped me understand the delicacy of shaving and extended my knowledge of how different blades can be from one brand to the other. So far the Astra&#x27;s have been extremely helpful and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have complaints about any of the blades that were sent to me. If I were the seller though, I would probably improve the sale by including information of the blades and what the user should be expecting out of the blades sent over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking to get into true shaving and trying out multiple blades for their uses.</li>
            <li> I purchased this combo pack of different blades in mid-December, 2012 with an average cost per blade of 20 cents.  I do believe there were a few extra blades in my shipment, so my cost per blade was a bit lower.  At 3 shaves per blade, it costs me about 7 cents per shave.  I had been using Gillete Sensor Excel blades ever since they came out, but a recent price increase at Sam&#x27;s Club (to over $1.60 per blade) got me to searching around and I realized just how really not smart it was to continue to purchase multiple blade products. (And Sensor Excels are the CHEAP ones!) I shave in the shower, using glycerine soap and a brush, so I get good shaves from the Gillette Sensor Excel blades.  I also bought a Merkur razor for the double-edged blades.  It is not a mechanical razor, so I have to handle the blades more... cut myself slightly... once.. on the first of the packs of blades, the \\&quot;Super Platinum\\&quot; blades made in Israel.  If I were to do it over, I would purchase a mechanical opening razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marked the razor with a piece of tape so I could shave with one edge one time and the other edge next time to see how long the blades would last.  The \\&quot;Super Platinum\\&quot; blades gave me three shaves before getting too dull.  I used a Gillete Sensor Excel razor to get closer and some spots around my nose that I had a hard time getting to.  I shave 3-4 times a week, with a heavy beard, and found I got 3 shaves from each of these blades with no problems.  I did get re-introduced to a mole that I hadn&#x27;t cut since Gillette Sensor Excel blades came out, but I believe I cut it because I just wasn&#x27;t used to the double edge shaving system.  By the time I got to the end of this pack, I could shave without needing to &#x27;touch-up&#x27; with a Sensor Excel blade.  There&#x27;s a slight learning curve to the use of double edged blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now started using the \\&quot;Gillette Wilkinson Sword\\&quot; pack of blades made in India by Gillette India Limited.  I like these blades slightly better than the \\&quot;Super Platinum\\&quot; blades made in Israel, but have only used 1 blade for 3 shaves so far.  The blades are imprinted &#x27;Stainless&#x27;.  I don&#x27;t know if that means they are without stains or made of stainless steel.  As Gillette is a subsidiary of Proctor &amp; Gamble, I would tend to believe the term is used to mislead consumers, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.  But I like the shave I get from them, so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update other brands as I work my way through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/18/2013  UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I have been using ASTRA blades and getting 7-8 shaves per blade.  So far, I am most pleased with these... but I also believe my face is getting used to double edged blades.  The Gillette Sensor Excel \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; razors I have used to supplement the double-edged blades are lasting over 4 months.  Unless something drastic comes along to change my mind, my next purchase will be Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now opened a pack of 7 A.M. Plus blades and will start on them later.  The packaging is deceptive, touting Swiss technical quality and never mentioning they are actually made in India. (I found this info on the web.)  I generally will not support any company the tries to deceive me.  For future edits, I will only post info if I find a blade I like more than the highly-rated (by me) Astra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/24/2013 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown all 3 packs of the 7 A.M. Plus blades in the trash.  I tried three different blades and none of them gave a me a good shave... too dull.  The boys at Amazon ought to cut these blades out of the combo pack, IMO.  Just not a good product.  The deceptive labeling should have set off an alarm, but shaving did it just as well.  BAD Blades, IMO.</li>
            <li> ended up with an extra 5 razors as there were substitutions.  Not to figure out which blades work best for me. a bit more than buying the same number from one manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a relative newcomer to the double-edge safety razor world.  I picked this pack up about two years ago--around the same time I picked up my first double-edged razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a double-edged razor was a new idea for me.  I was drawn to this product listing because of the variety of razors it offered.  Unlike shaving with cartridge razors, you&#x27;ve got a blade up against your skin.  As I&#x27;ve found, the quality of the blade makes a lot of difference.  My facial hair grows thick and grows quickly, so I go through blades quickly.  In my experience it took several blades for me to get the feel for each type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I liked the Astra platinums a bit, but in the end I&#x27;ve grown to appreciate the Shark chromes.  The Sharks don&#x27;t seem as flimsy as some of the other (cheaper) blades.  They have good edges and stay sharp for longer than some of the other blades as well.</li>
            <li> Great first pack of razors, easy to figure out what works and what doesnt.  Do not regret this at all</li>
            <li> I bought these in July 2012 and its now March 2014 and still have boxes of blades available. I especially like the variety you get to see which blades work best for you. That&#x27;s one thing I was unsure of when I started using a double edge safety razor; which brand blades should I buy? With this package, its helped me decide which blades to buy in the future. If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edge safety razor I highly recommend ordering this pack.</li>
            <li> Great selection of blades at a cheap price!</li>
            <li> Good value pack, they are all pretty much the same, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, you get a lot for what you pay.</li>
            <li> Every face is different.  Razors are different.  .. Blades are different.  The best way to figure out which blade is best for your face and razor..  buy a sample pack like this one.  The price is very low (less than $0.75 per week) and this pack provides Israeli, Swiss, American and German blades.  Very good assortment to start with.</li>
            <li> I really like having different blades to try out as a beginner to DE shaving. Having at least a 5 pack of each variety also helps.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to use Safety Razors rather than the expensive 5 layer razors that are marketed in the big box stores. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this selection!</li>
            <li> I am just now getting into shaving with a double edge safety razor, so I was looking forward to trying many different blade. This package was fairly priced and offered variety, but as stated in the description supplies do vary based on availability. It is a decent starter, I would have liked a little more variety. That would have made this purchase great. There are a lot of duplicates.</li>
            <li> Man, I can&#x27;t get over how much money I have saved since purchasing my straight razor.  I bought it almost three years ago and questioned if the replaceable blade type was the way to go.  Well, I got this variety pack hoping to learn what types I liked, and I definitely have but I STILL HAVE BLADES AFTER ALL THIS TIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will shave maybe two or three times a week and will always replace my blade at the start of the new week.  This is a great value and a good way to find out what blades are worth your time, money, and skin when you buy more.  This is a great variety pack of some not so good and some that are great.  Wonderful deal!</li>
            <li> Perfect for figuring out which one you want to use again or just like to have a variety.  I ended up settling on the Astra razors.</li>
            <li> I get about 12 shaves per blade so with this deal it costs about 2 cents to shave in the morning.  With the popular American multi-blade razor I had been using each cartridge cost about $4 and I also got about 12 good shaves before I had to insert a new one.  Do the math and you&#x27;ll see that that&#x27;s over 30 cents per shave, more than 15 times as expensive.  I&#x27;m not cheap but I&#x27;m not stupid either so I decided to get back to basics.  This DE Variety Pack lets me try blades from around the world and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with any of them.  I have yet to settle on a favorite but I&#x27;m leaning towards the Shark Super Chrome.  Do yourself a favor and start saving some money by not spending it on overpriced, &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; multi-bladed cartridges.  It&#x27;s fun to shave like your father did.  Really!</li>
            <li> Have not used them all yet but a super buy and a great way to try several different brands.  Love every one so far.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome value and a great way to explore other brands. Every brand and type is just a little bit different; and it may take a while before you find a brand or two you really like and stick to. People have different preferences, styles, shaver/grip, skin tone and texture; not every blade is for or will be enjoyable for everyone. Though in principle anyone can use pretty much any blade; the best thing to do is to shop around until you find the right balance of sharpness and flex that fits you and your shaver best.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten just how good a shave you get from these blades, I love them.</li>
            <li> I got the razors quickly and with a nice assortment. I would definitely recommend purchasing through them, and will be sure to get my razors here next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent starter pack for anyone who is new to using a straight razor. My husband bought these and is experimenting with these to find the brand he likes most.</li>
            <li> Good way to try several brands.</li>
            <li> Nice variety pack but when you find the one you like it&#x27;s hard using the others. GREAT VALUE!</li>
            <li> You wanna see something fantastic? These razor blades are superior to any in the universe. The feeling over independence over old cartridge razors is enough to make me want to jump up and down every single moment of every time one of these bad boys touches my face. But I&#x27;m not jumping while I&#x27;m shaving because that would be dangerous. I jump after. With extreme glee and zeal due to the fact that my face is smoother than the very day I was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try these razors out and it will change your life for ever. I&#x27;ve tried one of every variety in the pack so far and they are just wicked awesome. Well most of them are. The shark blades really sucked. But to each their own I guess, you have to buy it to try it! Don&#x27;t be afraid - what&#x27;s the worst that can happen? For this many blades this is a steal of a deal! You know you want to do it! You know deep down inside you want to feel that glee that can be achieved from such a remedial act as shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice - buy this. Stop dreading shaving every day as if you would rather cross a canyon filled with rabid wolves and pit vipers. Turn shaving into a fun experience that is like heaven on a small piece of extremely sharp rectangular shaped metal.</li>
            <li> This was a really great way for me to try out a variety of blades to decide what works best in my skin and hair type. I am a lady with fair skin and thin/sparse hair and found the Sharp blades work well for me. This package of 100 blades is well over a years worth if you don&#x27;t need to shave every day.</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed with the variety of blades.  Had a lot of off brand and no really nice blades.  Not too bad of a deal, but I wish the variety would have been better.  It came with  Shark super blades,  Astra platinum,  Astra stainless, 7Am hi platinum,  Sharp Durablade,  Shark Super Stainless,  Shark Super Chrome, and  Chrystal Stainless Steel.  I guess I needed to pay attention to the brands before I order them.  But the listing is very vague.</li>
            <li> Great variety of blades. Husband can wait to try, although he said it will take a year to get through them.</li>
            <li> Best value for your money</li>
            <li> This is a great way to sample 7 different double edge blades, to find the one brand that works best on your face and beard.</li>
            <li> Sooooo many choices.great quality</li>
            <li> Good sample of several brands of razor blades for someone who wants to try out a few different ones to see what works best on his face, without having to buy a large quantity of each one. 100 blades should last someone about a year, give or take, so it really is quite economical.&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that 5-10 blades should be sufficient to try out a particular blade, and there were 15 of some of these.  Not a big deal, but after using 3 or 4 blades and determining I don&#x27;t like it as much as the others, I still have 12 of them left.  Still, I&#x27;m happy to have had the sampling and after a lot of shaving, found my favorite (Astra.)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good deal and good idea for someone exploring different blades.</li>
            <li> An excellent sampler pack for those that are new to wetshaving or anyone wanting to try out some new blades.</li>
            <li> This selection is just great. You get 10 packs of 10 blades, I think (forgot to count) for a very reasonable price. Count on about 5 to 6 great shaves with these blades and you can see why this is such a great value. I recommend this assortment for anyone who is a &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; shaver like me.</li>
            <li> awesome assortment for price. these give you a chance to sample different ones to find what works best.</li>
            <li> Great pack to try new blades and figure out which ones work best.</li>
            <li> Great way to test blades.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive a large variety of blades, but I found that many of the packaged were Shark blades.  I&#x27;m sure every batch varies a little.</li>
            <li> They sent all the blades pictured, and the cost was OK.  I still haven&#x27;t tried them all yet, but I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this variety pack so I could sample various lades as I was not sure is there was a brand superior to the Merkur blades I had been using. I have been surprised to find how different each of the brands are, I immediately found a brand I like better, and am interested to try the rest to see which will serve me best. If you are new to shaving with a safety razor this is a great, cost effective way to find which blade is right for you.</li>
            <li> I started shaving old school about two years ago after finding my dad&#x27;s old shave kit. Cake soap and brush, single edge razor. My total annual cost for shaving is less than $20 dollars. I highly recommend getting back to basics when it comes to shaving. Single edge razors offer less irritation, fewer ingrown hairs, healthier appearing skin and significantly lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brand gives a slightly different shave, so this multi-pack is a great way to try a variety of blades to determine what brand works best for you. Depending on how picky you are, each blade will last 10 to 14 shaves (about 2 weeks). Given the cost and variety available with this pack, you can change blades a couple times every week. Quite a bargain.</li>
            <li> Great variety pack that let my husband test out which blades he prefers best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years with multi-bladed (3-5 per head) disposable razors, and they don&#x27;t do near as well as these single safety razor blades. And, when comparing price there is no competition. I can have $25 in multi-bladed razors last me 5 weeks (1 head per week shaving daily) or, I can have $25 last me 2 years with better results.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this deal!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my purchase.  I am new to safety razors, and it was nice to purchase a variety of blades to find which ones work best for my skin and hair type.</li>
            <li> After reading review after review on blades, I finally decided that the only way I was truly going to know what works right for me was to try a bunch. Everyone is different and people have different types of hair so choosing a blade on reviews alone isn&#x27;t really reliable. This sampler has a good selection of some of the more popular but doesn&#x27;t include Feather Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned a lot when using these blades. For example, I ended up throwing out the Astra Platinum Blades after the second blade because they were not sharp enough to cut through my thick hair and caused me horrible irritation. I also learned that I prefer the Feather Blades (http://www.amazon.com/Feather-Double-Edge-Blades-Count/dp/B00AGG3MNU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_6?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1370002754&amp;sr&#x3D;1-6&amp;keywords&#x3D;feather+razor+blades) that I had purchased prior to using this sampler. The Feather Blades were much sharper for me and really helped cut down on the irritation I had after shaving. They are a bit more expensive than other options out there but they really did work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each person will have different preferences and this sampler is a good way to try a number of blades to see what works well for you.</li>
            <li> Seems to offer a decent variety of blades to try.  Does not include some popular brands such as Derby or Feather.  Still a nice variety to get my start in shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Almost two years worth of shaving, and you get to figure out which brand and blades work best for you.  Also, the great satisfaction of jumping off the outrageously expensive multi-razor cartridge merry-go-round.  CAVEAT: TSA will take these away from you!  Either take your old razor on the short trip or plan to find some blades at your destination of longer duration.</li>
            <li> This is a really good sample set to try out different blades. When getting started with double edge shaving it&#x27;s good to investigate different blades. You&#x27;ll find all kinds of quality and truth be told every face is different. I recommend a set like this to get the lay of the land before committing to a larger bulk package of a single brand. You&#x27;ll see a lot of variety packs like this, but what&#x27;s especially nice about this one is that it includes Crystal and Astra Platinum, which are in my opinion two of the highest quality blades you can put in your double edge razor.</li>
            <li> I got this as an intro to wet shave kit.&lt;br /&gt;I am still experimenting with different blades.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not know what blade to get, I would recommend getting this first and try them all out!</li>
            <li> Great for verifying which blade works best for you. I found the shark Chrome works best for me in a 60s Gillette adjustable, set on level 4.</li>
            <li> I am trying different safety razors and have to say this is one of the best ways to do it. The variety is well worth the price.</li>
