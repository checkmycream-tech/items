            <li> Excellent pair of scissors. Well made and cut clean and easy. It is very sharp out of the box. Great design too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Need to tell coming from England, takes long time to arrive. Product is very good.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them. He agreed with other reviews that they are VERY sharp but that&#x27;s what makes them so good, according to him. He said that trimming his mustache with these are night and day compared to what he was using. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Scissors are very sharp! Works well in close places!</li>
            <li> These are really nice! These things are very nicely made and are holding up very well. The black finish has a really sleek looking also. They come with with a good sharpening job on them and I think they will have no issue lasting me a long time.</li>

            <li> When quality counts, these scissors are worth every penny.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the quality of the &amp;#34;old world&amp;#34; items coming out of the UK and these scissors keep the tradition by providing a high quality item that can be kept a life time.  So many of us are in the &amp;#34;Throw Away&amp;#34; generation, opting for cheap throw away items rather than expensive quality life time items.  Taking a little extra time in your day to maintain your equipment will yield a lifetime of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are very well made, extremely sharp, and have a solid closing feel when going through thick facial hair.  The sharpness means the hairs will not glide along the length of the blade, they are cut in place without having to chase them.  The scissors have a thumb screw so you can adjust the tightness and/or disassemble them for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine a better pair of scissors for the price.</li>
            <li> These are superb quality scissors.  They include a nice knurled nut for adjusting the tightness the two pieces, a rarity (most have a screw). Otherwise they&#x27;re just as they look.</li>
            <li> Very well made ..super smooth adjustable tension system .. For the price there amazing ..bought for trimming around ears and neckline ..and moustache ..they do a fine job ..worth 2 or 3 times the price</li>
            <li> excellent - great price for this quality - A+++</li>
            <li> Excellent, very sharp and perfect for mustache trimming</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave these scissors a 5 star rating is because Amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me give a 6.  Buy these, don&#x27;t hesitate, don&#x27;t balk at the cost, when you get them and use them you will think you should&#x27;ve paid more.  They are simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Received product and I am extremely happy with it. It&#x27;s exactly what they said it was. Extremely sharp and cuts fantastic. Just wish it came with a case to carry it in but other than that I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One sweet pair of scissors for the price!</li>
            <li> All the other review are spot on!  These scissors should cost way more money.  I am ordering several more pair as we speak to give out as gifts and to put away for myself.  They are that good!  If you are reading this review, do yourself a favor and order your own set.  There is no way you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Exceedingly sharp scissors.  Wonderfully crafted and a joy to use.</li>
            <li> These scissors are amazingly sharp and precise. Just what I needed to keep my unruly mountain man beard in control</li>
            <li> great scissors , fits well in my hand, sharp and light wight. love the style  and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Very precise and sharp. Quality feel, weight and edges.</li>
            <li> Comfortable in the hand. Very sharp. Trims perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and able to catch the smallest hair.</li>
            <li> The scissors tend to pull hairs, not cut them.</li>
            <li> These things are really, really sharp.  The first time I used them, I lightly clipped my right ear lobe - blood quickly poured out of a disturbingly large gash. Had I aimed a little higher, I could have easily and painlessly lopped the whole lobe off.  Now that I have a healthy respect for them, the scissors are a joy to use.  They don&#x27;t pinch the hairs when you trim them and allow for a precise cut.  My mustache and beard have never looked better. Women are glancing at me as I walk down the street. Bartenders are giving me better drinks. Even my dog is showing me a little more respect. But I know this can&#x27;t last forever.  And so I&#x27;m enjoying the moment, knowing that it all ends when I have that inevitable little spasm and cut off my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Great for beards and mustache trimmings. Warning razor sharp clip slowly.</li>
            <li> Better than you could hope for. Very sharp and beautifully made. I am happy.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, but tip is not as narrow as I would like.  Quality product</li>
            <li> Bought these to trim my beard, they were have the price of some others.  I believe they are exactly the same.  Great quality and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how there could possibly be a pair of scissors that could be the slightest bit better than these. These would be an appropriate gift to royalty. These are incredible and are what they say they are and more.</li>
            <li> As promised, very sharp.  Nice shears</li>
            <li> Extremely well made. Extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> Amazing scissors, incredibly sharp. Just don&#x27;t knick your lip haha.</li>
            <li> Great item, but it must have been shipped by boat. The order was placed on Feb 1 and arrived on March 9.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, great scissors</li>
            <li> Some damn fine and sharp scissors.</li>
            <li> Well made, very sharp scissors. If you plan on using these on a short beard or moustache be advised the blade is a little thick, making it difficult to cut individual hairs or cut close to the skin. They would be great for hair styling.</li>
            <li> Love them they cut so great.</li>
            <li> Very sharp very nice quality .</li>
            <li> Outstanding materials and craftsmanship went into making these scissors.  They are ideal for mustache and beard trimming and much better quality than the tweezerman scissors that I was using for years. A nice feature is the tension adjustment on the screw that joins the two blades of the scissors. Although slightly expensive, this is a case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very sharp great for trimming beards and mustaches</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality and sharpness.  Great way to adjust tension.  Nice balance.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em.. Perfect for beard trimming! Super sharp and very reasonably priced as well!</li>
            <li> These scissors are not for mustaches like the name claims. The blades on these scissors are almost as wide as my entire mouth!</li>
            <li> Best scissors on the market. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Unbelievable quick shipping from England.</li>
            <li> These scissors are worth every cent!  Hubby had 3 pair of moustache/beard scissors and they were worthless compared to these!  I can tell these will be sharp and last for a very long time.  They feel perfectly weighted and professional quality.  Love them!  They took about a week longer to arrive than the rest of my amazon order, but I assumed they would and didn&#x27;t mind waiting.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace an aging pair of German scissors given to me by a hair stylist friend. Having become accustomed to the fit and &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the old ones I was a bit concerned that I would be disappointed by these. I am pleased to say that was not the case. They are fitted as well and were sharper than my old ones when new. These are incredibly sharp, think Samurai sharp. Be aware that anything between these blades WILL BE CUT!</li>
            <li> These work great even for a left-hander.</li>
            <li> Awesome scissors, meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> saw some reviews that said not sharp enough--hard to believe, have had beard and have been trimming it for over 40 years--these scissors are the best ---would have to be laser-beam to be any sharper</li>
            <li> Excellent finish and action. Scissors hair popping sharp, with incredibly smooth sliding action. brass knob adjusts tension of scissors with no apparent play.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Super super sharp!&lt;br /&gt;I recently started cultivating my beard and was using a cheap pair of plastic handled scissors that came in some grooming kit I got when I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;It is a night and day difference between what I was using and these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Crazy sharp! Cuts my beard like nothing is there.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;Very ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasing to look at if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was somewhat slow.&lt;br /&gt;Price- Normally I would say this is a con but these convinced me that a good pair of grooming scissors is worth the price these are sold at. I worked with dog groomers and always thought they were crazy when they told me how much they spend on a good pair of scissors but I understand now.</li>
