            <li>, cheap.</li>
            <li>love this razor it really works !</li>
            <li>I had a quick delivery and use.</li>
            <li>worth it for the price.  </li>
            <li>doesnt switch from left to right hand but nice balalnce</li>
            <li>Love this product, does a nice job of laying with an edgy look.</li>
            <li>More gets caught in the comb and ripped out than actually cut.  </li>
            <li>Okay for touch-ups, not for initial shaping.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It really cuts, feathers and layers just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please</li>
            <li>Very well made and packaged.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t slice yourself (or too much hair) at one time.</li>
            <li>It came fast and works better than I expected</li>
            <li>The blade slides out of the comb which then slides out of the handle like most blades that should be changed but the comb sort of overpowers the blade and the blade is sharp but not up to par for trimming hair.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor for anyone looking for a decent razor.</li>
            <li>Cuts decent.  </li>
            <li>It slices through the hair very easily and creates a very precise cut, whether you are layering or cutting at angles.</li>
            <li>Professional is certainly a stretch.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll probably buy a different one rather than get more blades for this one once it dulls.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying such a tool for my new dog.</li>
            <li>Great for getting those hairs that you miss while cutting.</li>
            <li>On a man, the hair must be fringed to look natural.  </li>
            <li>i bought as a professional stylist.</li>
            <li>This is a hair salon quality razor or near hair salon quality razor.</li>
            <li>The handle feels heavy and sturdy and I had high hopes but the comb and blade assembly is kind of shoddy.  </li>
            <li>It thins out my wigs just like I love for them to thin out.  </li>
            <li>As long as you are careful you don&#x27;t damage your hair much.</li>
            <li>I really like the solid feel of it in my hand, the little notched guards</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist nor have I had proper training.</li>
            <li> definatly not good enough to cut real hair with.</li>
            <li> The opening is too wide to hold the blades.</li>
            <li> the blade is always slipping out.</li>
            <li> Cuts through my hair with ease, doesn&#x27;t tear at my hair at all like some other ones I have bought.</li>
            <li> The blade that comes with it, is sharp and has held up well.</li>
            <li> sharp and does its job!</li>
            <li> Hard to use and not clear on how to change the blades.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sound&amp;#34; other reviewers have complained of is just the razor slicing through their hair.</li>
            <li> very heavy duty, and well made...</li>
            <li> but my blade still hasn&#x27;t gone dull.</li>

            <li> But the slot that the blade slips into is poorly done.</li>
            <li> Oh well, at least it wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive.</li>
            <li> Tugs horribly on the hair to the point where it&#x27;s shortening my hair by simply ripping it out by the root.</li>
            <li> ,  you cant go wrong with this one..</li>
            <li> I like to lightly thin my hair framing my face after cutting my hair, I will get years of use from this product!</li>
            <li> I feel this product meets our home&#x27;s needs for hair cutting and styling.</li>
            <li> If you posted a bad review then you don&#x27;t know how to use the product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Tugs horribly on the hair to the point where it&#x27;s shortening my hair by simply ripping it out by the root. Sticking with shears.</li>
            <li> It came fast and works better than I expected</li>
            <li> love this razor it really works !</li>
            <li> Very happy with this razor.  It really cuts, feathers and layers just as advertised.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very please this item it is actually better than I thought thank you.</li>
            <li> If you do hair for a living don&#x27;t buy it did not work well,at all pulled hair is not cut</li>
            <li> not  even close to  what it looks like in the add  real cheap junk</li>
            <li> sharp and does its job!</li>
            <li> This styling razon is perfect for home trims.  I have wavy short hair and it saves me from monthly visits to the salon.  Very well made and packaged.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut well on synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> This is a nice styling razor.  It thins out my wigs just like I love for them to thin out.  I would recommend this razor for anyone looking for a decent razor.</li>
            <li> Works great! I like to lightly thin my hair framing my face after cutting my hair, I will get years of use from this product!</li>
            <li> Bought this to cut mats out of a curly haired dog that has an aversion to scissors.  His coat is very fine and should have been very easy to cut.  The handle feels heavy and sturdy and I had high hopes but the comb and blade assembly is kind of shoddy.  The blade slides out of the comb which then slides out of the handle like most blades that should be changed but the comb sort of overpowers the blade and the blade is sharp but not up to par for trimming hair.  More gets caught in the comb and ripped out than actually cut.  Whether on humans or canines it didn&#x27;t perform well.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Professional is certainly a stretch. Okay for touch-ups, not for initial shaping.</li>
            <li> The blades that are supposed to fit in this razor wiggle around and fall out. The opening is too wide to hold the blades.</li>
            <li> I Loved it...very heavy duty, and well made...great product at a great price,  you cant go wrong with this one..</li>
            <li> Hard to use and not clear on how to change the blades.</li>
            <li> Cuts decent.  Not salon quaility but worth it for the price.  Hope they sell replacement blades. Would recommend for a textured cut.</li>
            <li> I never received this tool. I even inquired about it. Oh well, at least it wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive.</li>
            <li> Great product for price. This styling razor is designed well and is solidly made. The blade that comes with it, is sharp and has held up well. I use this for styling but also shaving the nape of the neck. The blade doesn&#x27;t slide around and is easy to replace. I just push the blade holder out with my finger then use the tip of the handle (where the blade goes in) to push the blade out. I purchased the recommended replacement blades with this but my blade still hasn&#x27;t gone dull. I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist nor have I had proper training. I feel this product meets our home&#x27;s needs for hair cutting and styling.</li>
            <li> Great for getting those hairs that you miss while cutting. Does a very nice job of doing a quick trim! Id recommend these!</li>
            <li> Love it. It slices through the hair very easily and creates a very precise cut, whether you are layering or cutting at angles. I love it.</li>
            <li> As a veteran hairdresser, I&#x27;ve bought this and have some input. It&#x27;s just OK. The blade rattles when you use it but seems to stay still alright. I do not use this to cut hair, just to shave hair off necks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STANDARD BLADES OF THIS STYLE FIT THIS RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is the style you want, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> An excellent finishing tool for the perfect haircut.  On a man, the hair must be fringed to look natural.  With these, I can give him a cut &amp;#34;like Caesar.&amp;#34;  Great.</li>
            <li> I really like the solid feel of it in my hand, the little notched guards so you don&#x27;t slice yourself (or too much hair) at one time. But the slot that the blade slips into is poorly done. the blade is always slipping out. It doesn&#x27;t fall out, but gravity will slip it halfway out it you tip it down.&lt;br /&gt;I work around it for now but I&#x27;ll probably buy a different one rather than get more blades for this one once it dulls.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair great ha. Too bad i only use them once every so months. Hair grows slow</li>
            <li> Too dull, catches and pulls my hair. Doesn&#x27;t cut the style I want.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying such a tool for my new dog. The quality was excellent. However, I cannot use it because it doesn&#x27;t have longer tines, I don&#x27;t want to give our dog an almost bald cut but this was my lack of understanding how this tool works.</li>
            <li> good value, works fine gave 4 star beacuse i dont like handle design doesnt switch from left to right hand but nice balalnce</li>
            <li> blade does slip out, but no big deal. quality is great.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. If you posted a bad review then you don&#x27;t know how to use the product. I had a quick delivery and use.</li>
            <li> Bought this to just trim up the bangs for my son, who wears his hair &amp;#34;high &amp; tight&amp;#34;.  It works perfect and to replace the blades will be simple as well!  I highly suggest this to anyone looking for a great hair trimming or neck trimming razor!</li>
            <li> i bought as a professional stylist. and i use it to cut tinsel hair extensions now. definatly not good enough to cut real hair with. split ends instantly</li>
            <li> This is a hair salon quality razor or near hair salon quality razor. The &amp;#34;sound&amp;#34; other reviewers have complained of is just the razor slicing through their hair. As long as you are careful you don&#x27;t damage your hair much.</li>
            <li> Love this product, does a nice job of laying with an edgy look.</li>
            <li> Used this when I lived in Korea (aka, the land where fashionable hairstyles go to die). Didn&#x27;t rust, worked well, cheap.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but it works great and seems like great quality.  I like that I can buy refil razors.</li>
