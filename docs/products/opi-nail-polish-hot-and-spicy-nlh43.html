            <li>So bright.</li>
            <li>It is orange, but it&#x27;s a perfect, bright shade that just right for spring/summer.  </li>
            <li>I just love the color!</li>
            <li>But i love it dearly!</li>

            <li>arrived quickly, love this color</li>
            <li>glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>When used with vinylux top coat it lasts for about 7 days.</li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish-</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>This is a great color and the OPI quality is great as usual.  </li>
            <li>Several times when I&#x27;m out in company or shopping a perfect stranger will come up to me and say how much they love the color.</li>
            <li>soft yet bright and shiny.</li>
            <li>This nail polish has been great for me so far, i deffinetley got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The seller was fantastic- shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>-what a fun look.</li>
            <li>Hot &amp; Spicy is my current favorite color!</li>
            <li>Over all not bad, fast shipment, decent color, and dries very quickly - within seconds.</li>
            <li>Color was great, but the product itself applied very unevenly.  </li>
            <li>Hot looking.</li>
            <li>I only use OPI nail products and have for many years.  </li>
            <li>Also couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received it!</li>
            <li>i love it and its such a pretty color.</li>
            <li>I love hot n spicy by opi, it definitely lives up to the name.</li>
            <li>feel so pretty on me.</li>
            <li>Use a base-coat and after you have the color on finish with a clear top coat to give it the classy shine look.</li>
            <li>So, kudos to the seller, really fast shipment.</li>
            <li>It does well with retro cloths and modern cloths.</li>
            <li>However, I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for and love how it stays on longer than any other brands I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>in fact I usually bring my own when I go to the salon to get a manicure/pedicure because they don&#x27;t always have a color I like.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>i bought this nail polish months ago and am actually wearing the color right now.</li>
            <li>Like this color - a very coral pink/orange&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other poster&#x27;s that said it takes 3 and 4 coats for full coverage...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rather old-fashioned and not one to use today&#x27;s popular nail polish colors (e.g. blue, green).  </li>
            <li>such a pretty color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll leave the bottle open for a few days to try to dry it up/thicken it because I love the shade.</li>
            <li>not sure how the color comes out, but it is between pink and orange, and tend to orange more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and this particular one has a different brush (smaller) and the polish is super thin and watery leaving streaks and no uniformity like I am used to with OPI.  </li>

            <li> The only thing that I was disappointed with was that the color is a little lighter than a true orange, or even coral as the description suggests; it&#x27;s more of a salmon color but with an orange-ish tint.</li>
            <li> Even a nail technicial had a difficult time applying it smoothly.</li>
            <li> up,,,,there are other colors besides blue, purple, black reds, greens, etc.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to paint 3-4 coats.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is legitimate OPI brand polish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strange, so I don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable wearing it.  </li>
            <li> You can see streaks where the polish is so thin that is dries unevenly.</li>
            <li> This polish is very thin, unlike any bottle of OPI I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed by opi brand polish</li>
            <li> and they did a terrible job with it.</li>

            <li> such a pretty color. soft yet bright and shiny. my nail tech painted tiny white polka dots on it -what a fun look.</li>
            <li> I just love the color! So bright. My only complaint is that I have to paint 3-4 coats. But i love it dearly!</li>
            <li> Always had red on the toes until I discovered this brand and color. Wow!! Hot looking. Use a base-coat and after you have the color on finish with a clear top coat to give it the classy shine look. Eat your heart out Evana Trump!!</li>
            <li> I received this nail polish within four days of ordering. So, kudos to the seller, really fast shipment. Definitely be buying from them again. The only thing that I was disappointed with was that the color is a little lighter than a true orange, or even coral as the description suggests; it&#x27;s more of a salmon color but with an orange-ish tint. Over all not bad, fast shipment, decent color, and dries very quickly - within seconds. I&#x27;d buy again from this seller, probably not this color though.</li>
            <li> I only use OPI nail products and have for many years.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, love this color</li>
            <li> This nail polish has been great for me so far, i deffinetley got my money&#x27;s worth. It&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> My favorite color and great quality polish!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color for the summer!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is legitimate OPI brand polish.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and this particular one has a different brush (smaller) and the polish is super thin and watery leaving streaks and no uniformity like I am used to with OPI.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Color was great, but the product itself applied very unevenly.  Even a nail technicial had a difficult time applying it smoothly.</li>
            <li> Hot &amp; Spicy is my current favorite color! When used with vinylux top coat it lasts for about 7 days. It does well with retro cloths and modern cloths.</li>
            <li> My nail salon does not carry this color. What&#x27;s the problem? Several times when I&#x27;m out in company or shopping a perfect stranger will come up to me and say how much they love the color. Come on nail salons wake up,,,,there are other colors besides blue, purple, black reds, greens, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather old-fashioned and not one to use today&#x27;s popular nail polish colors (e.g. blue, green).  However, I really like this one.  It is orange, but it&#x27;s a perfect, bright shade that just right for spring/summer.  It&#x27;s not too strange, so I don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable wearing it.  If you&#x27;re like me and feel uncomfortable wearing the \\&quot;unusual\\&quot; shades of today, you may be able to handle this one.  It&#x27;s current but not waaaay out there.</li>
            <li> Like this color - a very coral pink/orange&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other poster&#x27;s that said it takes 3 and 4 coats for full coverage...&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like the color, just not the time to apply...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the color!! Was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for and love how it stays on longer than any other brands I&#x27;ve tried! Also couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received it! I will order all my opi nail polish online now!</li>
            <li> i bought this nail polish months ago and am actually wearing the color right now. i love it and its such a pretty color. great price and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I love hot n spicy by opi, it definitely lives up to the name. If you&#x27;re looking for a reddish orange this is the color for you. I have yet to be disappointed by opi brand polish</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish- in fact I usually bring my own when I go to the salon to get a manicure/pedicure because they don&#x27;t always have a color I like.  This is a great color and the OPI quality is great as usual.  The seller was fantastic- shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> This polish is very thin, unlike any bottle of OPI I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I took it with me to the nail salon and they did a terrible job with it. You can see streaks where the polish is so thin that is dries unevenly. I&#x27;ll leave the bottle open for a few days to try to dry it up/thicken it because I love the shade.</li>
            <li> not sure how the color comes out, but it is between pink and orange, and tend to orange more. I love the color. feel so pretty on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful...not the Color at all as it should be Plus not being able to Return SUXS!!!!!</li>
