            <li>AWESOME VALUE PACKAGE!</li>

            <li>They work great.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m using these along with Crest 3D toothpaste, so I&#x27;m hoping paired together I will get some good results.</li>
            <li>and I got a good deal</li>
            <li>Good deal for me because I use them often.</li>
            <li>&quot; whitening strips are a good buy but be weary of the time needed to whiten your teeth.  </li>
            <li>should have bought more as this is the best buy on line and cannot be better else where, be happy here</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but affective an I thought is could be .</li>
            <li>but this is still a great deal - haven&#x27;t found better.  </li>
            <li>Great price...much better than retail.</li>
            <li>The 112 count box is pretty impressive in size and is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love being able to buy it in bulk on Amazon, and for a very fair price.</li>
            <li>They work good, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>AWESOME DEAL, thanks Amazon!</li>

            <li>I was thrilled with the price and the results exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li>They do work well if used as directed and are a good deal with so many (112) in the package.</li>
            <li>a nice one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and over time, very effective.</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips CLASSIC are the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>Everything was very good and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>with a beautiful smile (who am I kidding,</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These are the best as they do not make your teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li>My Harmon store stopped carrying it, in favor of more effective products.</li>
            <li>So happy to have a big box and at a great price .</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and 100% effective.  </li>
            <li>Against my better judgement, I bought the classics instead of the premiums since it has so many strips.</li>
            <li>Why would it cost so much more now?</li>
            <li>I am very happy they actually work!</li>
            <li>I love Crest whitestrips.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying these again for sure.</li>
            <li>Theese are better than the dentist according to my wife who says they do better than what the dentist was doing.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, and its low price is just a bonus.    </li>
            <li>i love it and my teeth are white &lt;3</li>
            <li>but my god i love soda and juices</li>
            <li>and I just forget to use them most days.  </li>
            <li>Great product, fast service from seller.</li>
            <li>The strips are ok.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and spend another 5 dollars on the better ones.  </li>
            <li>I have used a whitening pen before,but the results were better with Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>These strips have many issues.  </li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>100% More Pack Whitestrips, 112-Count]]</li>
            <li>I was extremely satisfied with all aspects of my experience.</li>
            <li>Pros: excellent value, gentle, easy to apply and clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest Whitestrips are one of my favorite ways to whiten my teeth for 3 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>Love these strips.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure they could be even whiter.</li>
            <li>They leave a lot of \\&quot;gu\\&quot; (for lack of a better word) on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love the size of this box....</li>
            <li>u have to look for more stronger one ^^</li>
            <li>so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Keeping my fingers crossed :)</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s okay to wipe it off.</li>
            <li>not 100% sure it works, but it might have...</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on 11/30 they got to my house on 12/02 loved the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I loved the price and felt that I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I love the original Whitestrips so much better than all the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; strips Crest has come out with now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these are still available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>The ordering process was easy, the product arrived very quickly and was everything that was advertised by the company.</li>
            <li>Hassle to use every day, and strips don&#x27;t always go on so easily.  </li>
            <li>They easily slide off your teeth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother paying more for the 3D premium product, this works great in only 4 days.</li>
            <li>However, it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>this is an easy to use product.</li>
            <li>the really strong \\&quot;professional\\&quot; strips make my teeth</li>
            <li>and they were fine.   </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dissolve which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>These work just fine.    </li>
            <li>but now they feel fine.</li>
            <li>And these are at a more afforable price too if you dont feel the need to super rush into whiter teeth in 3-5 days</li>
            <li>Arrived quick and I will be reordering more.</li>
            <li>They provided much better results, delivered them more quickly, and were more gentle on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>After a week of using these, I could tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>so getting the 100% more strips is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The difference between these and the 3D or sealed types are the fit on your teeth.</li>
            <li>These whitestrips are gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>Free shipping.  </li>
            <li>My advice, go with the Advanced Seal or another brand.  </li>
            <li>Crest White Strips were recommended by my dental hygienist and they worked great.  </li>
            <li>and it surely is cheap</li>
            <li>i will buy one more next time , good</li>
            <li>People remark frequently about my great teeth and smile.  </li>
            <li>Better to pay your dentist to do it right.</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips have improved their formulas throughout the years, but while the newer strips adhere better, I find the Classic strips do a better and faster job of whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is great that Crest offers 100% more strips (112 instead of 56) in the Crest Classic pack because I have always used twice as many to keep my teeth nice, white, and shining.</li>
            <li>My teeth looked much better after the first use.</li>
            <li>But once white, this is a great product to maintain your smile.  </li>
            <li>I have loved these and had fantastic success with them for quite some time but the last time I shopped for them they were no where to be found ....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll look a lot whiter if I use the whole damn box</li>
            <li>:) i dont really remember anything else, it was a while ago:</li>
            <li>So far so good, they seem to stay on pretty well</li>
            <li>These strips are great but remember avoid drinking coffee or other staining liquids n food.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix to stained teeth, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>You will have 100% satisfaction with the Crest Whitestrips Classic set :)</li>
            <li>These white strips work better (better whitening) than newer Crest strips I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Love Crest Whitestrips Classic.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly I could notice the difference.  </li>
            <li>I use the CLASSIC strips more often than indicated on the directions.  </li>
            <li>They may not work as quickly as one would like but patience is rewarded.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend getting it with free prime shipping!</li>
            <li>My teeth were noticeably whiter after the first week!</li>
            <li>For me, the end result is worth having to fuss with keeping the strips in place.</li>
            <li>I am a non-smoker and rare coffee drinker and can see a substantially whiter smile in about 5-days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to reduce the frequency I use in the end, and as expected, the results weren&#x27;t as good without the frequency required.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find this particular product in any local stores - they all seem to sell the more potent whitening products which my sensitive teeth cannot tolerate.  </li>
            <li>Every time i leave my house and smile people say you have a lovely smile and perfect white teeth, i love this product i usually buy every year to renew my whiteness ,but after a couple days of using this product my teeth always appeared whiter and stay white for up to a year</li>
            <li>right?)</li>
            <li>They recommend not to brush your teeth right before using</li>
            <li>i have used several different teeth-whitening products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m wearing my first strips right now.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how easy they were to use.  </li>
            <li>Plain and simple, THESE WORK REALLY GREAT!!</li>
            <li>I like it very much .  </li>
            <li>Teeth got sensitive after a week, I took a day off and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I love Crest Whitestrips Classic, as I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to whiten your teeth 10 shades in two weeks for an event, I&#x27;d go with a more fast acting strip, but if you&#x27;re simply doing for yourself to brighten your smile, go ahead and order right away. :)</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing whitestrips.  </li>
            <li>The price is now more than double the amount.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my first try on whitestrips.</li>
            <li>You will see a difference after the first couple of uses and it only gets better.     </li>
            <li>Product was not as effective as I had expected.</li>
            <li>Overall, the strips work well but not as well as the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; more pricey strips.  </li>
            <li>, higher peroxide level shorter wait</li>
            <li>First of all, they don&#x27;t stay in place.  </li>
            <li>is that the addhesieve is better in the latter.</li>
            <li>I love the classic-pack cuz its the same result just cheaper package...</li>
            <li>My favorite white strip which gave me movie star teeth.</li>
            <li>I only wish they were a bit longer to cover more of the sides of your teeth</li>
            <li>but none the less they work just fine as you don&#x27;t smile that wide to show the sides of your teeth anyway LOL.</li>
            <li>I use these often &amp; they&#x27;re quite expensive in the stores so this is a great price for the amount you get!</li>
            <li>It took some getting use to it at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a dentist or an expert by any means, but I&#x27;m not blind...</li>
            <li>, haven&#x27;t used it consistently.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first 3 times.</li>
            <li>Nothing ages a person more than yellow teeth</li>
            <li>I used these when they first came out with no problems.</li>
            <li>, I have wine occasionally, and I love blueberries.</li>
            <li>I did not think they would work at first, but as the days passed by, I realized it works.</li>
            <li>These are the first strips I ever used</li>
            <li>This product come with 3 times as many strips as any regular teeth whitening product you find in the stores and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It is the first time I used something like this</li>
            <li>They need to make that one just as long as the top one.  </li>
            <li>Fast service and product was exactly as had been described.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product, barely get to use and already I can see the difference in whitening my teeth</li>
            <li>It made my teeth whiter with the whole box the first time</li>
            <li>a good teeth brushing usually gets rid of it though.</li>
            <li>They are easy to open (I recommened using scizzors to avoid tearing).</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so easy to forget applying the strips twice a day, so the second time</li>
            <li>I used every single strip that came in this pack and by the end, my teeth never looked better.  </li>
            <li>The Crest Classic Whitestrips are the first ones I&#x27;ve tried and the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in using a gentle whitening product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on using this whole package,</li>
            <li>My teeth really become whiter than before.</li>
            <li>Once box lasts a whole year.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a health hazard to my knowledge, however one may want to avoid the discomfort by skipping a day after 2-3 straight days of use.</li>
            <li>it really works i recommend it to all the people who don&#x27;t believe it works.</li>
            <li>For the price though I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>These strips really work.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product if you are looking for the same results as the more expensive  strips-takes longer</li>
            <li>it was fast.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really get the result I want.</li>
            <li>56 days, but in the end my teeth went from light brown to white.</li>
            <li>, these ones made my teeth hurt just as much AND didn&#x27;t do any whitening at all.  </li>
            <li>The newer types of Crest strips stick much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are basically the original white strips.</li>
            <li>They are better than the other Crest Whitestrips versions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and had more sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>These work great and slowly enough that they cause very little sensitivity to the teeth .</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product because I don&#x27;t have a pool of salvia in my mouth, they stay put, no slipping, and after only one application I could see drastic results.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and get whiter teeth for much, much longer with Crest Classic.</li>
            <li>I only use them every other day and in two weeks people were already telling me I had a beautiful white teeth.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product,only you have to be very patient for 2 times for 30 min per day.</li>
            <li>I love the Crest Classic whitestrips and having 100% more for half the price of store brand whitening systems was an extreme bonus.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a whole lot of white strips when you can just pay 5 dollars more and only</li>
            <li>The strip you put on top is nice, it&#x27;s long, but my complaint is the bottom one!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have less whitening and more comfort, i guess.</li>
            <li>I used to use the classic system and was upset when I could no longer find them in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the newer more expensive systems claiming to give better results.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, Crest should not have fiddled with the Classic formula.</li>
            <li>I have used Crest Whitestrips before with decent results.  </li>
            <li>B0030HSD40 Crest Classic</li>
            <li>This product is simple, relatively quick and painless.</li>
            <li>I tried Crest Classic Whitestrips and I am amazed at the results.</li>
            <li>As a social smoker (who am I kidding, right?)</li>
            <li>People, even strangers, always comment on how white my teeth are, particularly since I naturally smile a lot.  </li>
            <li>At least when I use the strong strips they do whiten my teeth quickly</li>
            <li>I rather use these than pay the high price at the dentist office for pretty much the same results.  </li>
            <li>Cleared my coffee stained teeth a bit after a few applications and this put more comfort when smiling, maybe will try again some time.</li>
            <li>(I used the Crest Whitestrips Vivid before and the peroxide content was too high)</li>
            <li>Had to back off to once a day use because it will make sensitive teeth MORE sensitive; but, they definitely whitened up my 55+ yr old teeth!</li>
            <li>The new versions just do not whiten as well as the classics.</li>
            <li>I always have a hard time finding a good deal on the Crest White Strips and use them faithfully.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant because my teeth are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you get 112 strips, and I personally think that they work better than the more expensive crest strips being sold in stores.</li>
            <li>My only gripe about this product is that if you have sensitive teeth or if this is your first time it may start to hurt.</li>
            <li>After I built up the courage, I was surprised that my teeth weren&#x27;t as sensitive as I thought!</li>
            <li>, on the box Crest supposedly offers a money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the product and request a refund within a certain time period.  </li>
            <li>I switched to the Crest Whitestrips after I developed sensitive teeth and gums from my old Rembrandt duo.</li>
            <li>But I prefer this since my gums are so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and have never whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Works very well even with occasional use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent tea drinker and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>but teeth might become sensitive.</li>
            <li>(My old</li>
            <li>I use these about twice a year to keep my teeth white and they really do work</li>
            <li>But I had just finished a box of \\&quot;classic\\&quot; strips that left my teeth cleaner and ready to go to work.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have no complaints with this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought these because I have sensitive teeth and</li>
            <li>I received numerous compliments on my smile and my friends definitely noticed a difference in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking around for Whitestrips Classic in local drugstores and superstores, but could not find this type of whitening system anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I smoke, drink red wine and coffee, so I used these for about two weeks and got my teeth pretty white already</li>
            <li>if not slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;3.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Classic Model of Crest Whsitestrips for several years now and swear by them.  </li>
            <li>I recommend these white strips highly.</li>
            <li>I could think of locally and then resorted to checking out the reviews on the new version of creststrips .</li>
            <li>I would rather use these than the new 3D White Strips.</li>
            <li>I feel that they work fairly good and have made my teeth a bit whiter, but I can&#x27;t wear them everyday because they start making my tooth roots feel some very sharp pain, and this is only after ten or so minutes when the recommended use time is thirty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but not terribly effective.</li>
            <li>I have only used the product twice so far and my surface stains are virtually gone!</li>
            <li>I have used the crest 3d vivid white strips before.  </li>
            <li>I think that other strips may also have this problem but it is pretty</li>
            <li>The gel inside the strips can be kinda a weird feeling but other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I generally apply 1 strip per day after a meal, and leave it on for about an hour or two.</li>
            <li>I did not see much improvement, even though I am not a coffee nor alcohol drinker and usually don&#x27;t eat much of food that stain your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have such sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>These are really inexpensive but much harder to use.</li>
            <li>I was initially scared to use this, because of all the \\&quot;sensitive teeth\\&quot; comments.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s worth having achy teeth for a few days because I got some</li>
            <li>Not great, need to use way more than necessary</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ordering off of Amazon is generally cheaper than your local Wal Mart or Target.</li>
            <li>While I obtained some initial noticeable results, after the first days they made little difference.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and they aren&#x27;t irritating to have in your mouth, like some strips can be.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slow working, and yes it makes your teeth a bit sensitive if you over use it, but when I&#x27;m looking to whiten my teeth, I choose this exact product every time.</li>
            <li>Once removed, there is a terrible \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; on your teeth, but luckily it rinses off pretty easily.  </li>

            <li> and I got a good deal</li>
            <li> Good deal for me because I use them often.</li>
            <li> &quot; whitening strips are a good buy but be weary of the time needed to whiten your teeth.  </li>
            <li> should have bought more as this is the best buy on line and cannot be better else where, be happy here</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but affective an I thought is could be .</li>
            <li> but this is still a great deal - haven&#x27;t found better.  </li>
            <li> Great price...much better than retail.</li>

            <li> a nice one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and over time, very effective.</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips CLASSIC are the best on the market.  </li>
            <li> Everything was very good and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> with a beautiful smile (who am I kidding,</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> These are the best as they do not make your teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li> My Harmon store stopped carrying it, in favor of more effective products.</li>
            <li> So happy to have a big box and at a great price .</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and 100% effective.  </li>
            <li> Against my better judgement, I bought the classics instead of the premiums since it has so many strips.</li>
            <li> Why would it cost so much more now?</li>
            <li> I am very happy they actually work!</li>
            <li> I love Crest whitestrips.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying these again for sure.</li>
            <li> Theese are better than the dentist according to my wife who says they do better than what the dentist was doing.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, and its low price is just a bonus.    </li>
            <li> i love it and my teeth are white &lt;3</li>
            <li> but my god i love soda and juices</li>
            <li> and I just forget to use them most days.  </li>
            <li> Great product, fast service from seller.</li>
            <li> The strips are ok.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend another 5 dollars on the better ones.  </li>
            <li> I have used a whitening pen before,but the results were better with Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> These strips have many issues.  </li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> 100% More Pack Whitestrips, 112-Count]]</li>
            <li> I was extremely satisfied with all aspects of my experience.</li>
            <li> Pros: excellent value, gentle, easy to apply and clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest Whitestrips are one of my favorite ways to whiten my teeth for 3 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> Love these strips.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure they could be even whiter.</li>
            <li> They leave a lot of \\&quot;gu\\&quot; (for lack of a better word) on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this box....</li>
            <li> u have to look for more stronger one ^^</li>
            <li> so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Keeping my fingers crossed :)</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s okay to wipe it off.</li>
            <li> not 100% sure it works, but it might have...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on 11/30 they got to my house on 12/02 loved the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I loved the price and felt that I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I love the original Whitestrips so much better than all the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; strips Crest has come out with now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad these are still available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> The ordering process was easy, the product arrived very quickly and was everything that was advertised by the company.</li>
            <li> Hassle to use every day, and strips don&#x27;t always go on so easily.  </li>
            <li> They easily slide off your teeth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother paying more for the 3D premium product, this works great in only 4 days.</li>
            <li> However, it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> this is an easy to use product.</li>
            <li> the really strong \\&quot;professional\\&quot; strips make my teeth</li>
            <li> and they were fine.   </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dissolve which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> These work just fine.    </li>
            <li> but now they feel fine.</li>
            <li> And these are at a more afforable price too if you dont feel the need to super rush into whiter teeth in 3-5 days</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and I will be reordering more.</li>
            <li> They provided much better results, delivered them more quickly, and were more gentle on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using these, I could tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> so getting the 100% more strips is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The difference between these and the 3D or sealed types are the fit on your teeth.</li>
            <li> These whitestrips are gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> Free shipping.  </li>
            <li> My advice, go with the Advanced Seal or another brand.  </li>
            <li> Crest White Strips were recommended by my dental hygienist and they worked great.  </li>
            <li> and it surely is cheap</li>
            <li> i will buy one more next time , good</li>
            <li> People remark frequently about my great teeth and smile.  </li>
            <li> Better to pay your dentist to do it right.</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips have improved their formulas throughout the years, but while the newer strips adhere better, I find the Classic strips do a better and faster job of whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is great that Crest offers 100% more strips (112 instead of 56) in the Crest Classic pack because I have always used twice as many to keep my teeth nice, white, and shining.</li>
            <li> My teeth looked much better after the first use.</li>
            <li> But once white, this is a great product to maintain your smile.  </li>
            <li> I have loved these and had fantastic success with them for quite some time but the last time I shopped for them they were no where to be found ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll look a lot whiter if I use the whole damn box</li>
            <li> :) i dont really remember anything else, it was a while ago:</li>
            <li> So far so good, they seem to stay on pretty well</li>
            <li> These strips are great but remember avoid drinking coffee or other staining liquids n food.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix to stained teeth, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> You will have 100% satisfaction with the Crest Whitestrips Classic set :)</li>
            <li> These white strips work better (better whitening) than newer Crest strips I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love Crest Whitestrips Classic.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly I could notice the difference.  </li>
            <li> I use the CLASSIC strips more often than indicated on the directions.  </li>
            <li> They may not work as quickly as one would like but patience is rewarded.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend getting it with free prime shipping!</li>
            <li> My teeth were noticeably whiter after the first week!</li>
            <li> For me, the end result is worth having to fuss with keeping the strips in place.</li>
            <li> I am a non-smoker and rare coffee drinker and can see a substantially whiter smile in about 5-days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to reduce the frequency I use in the end, and as expected, the results weren&#x27;t as good without the frequency required.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find this particular product in any local stores - they all seem to sell the more potent whitening products which my sensitive teeth cannot tolerate.  </li>
            <li> Every time i leave my house and smile people say you have a lovely smile and perfect white teeth, i love this product i usually buy every year to renew my whiteness ,but after a couple days of using this product my teeth always appeared whiter and stay white for up to a year</li>
            <li> right?)</li>
            <li> They recommend not to brush your teeth right before using</li>
            <li> i have used several different teeth-whitening products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wearing my first strips right now.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how easy they were to use.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple, THESE WORK REALLY GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I like it very much .  </li>
            <li> Teeth got sensitive after a week, I took a day off and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I love Crest Whitestrips Classic, as I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to whiten your teeth 10 shades in two weeks for an event, I&#x27;d go with a more fast acting strip, but if you&#x27;re simply doing for yourself to brighten your smile, go ahead and order right away. :)</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing whitestrips.  </li>
            <li> The price is now more than double the amount.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my first try on whitestrips.</li>
            <li> You will see a difference after the first couple of uses and it only gets better.     </li>
            <li> Product was not as effective as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Overall, the strips work well but not as well as the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; more pricey strips.  </li>
            <li> , higher peroxide level shorter wait</li>
            <li> First of all, they don&#x27;t stay in place.  </li>
            <li> is that the addhesieve is better in the latter.</li>
            <li> I love the classic-pack cuz its the same result just cheaper package...</li>
            <li> My favorite white strip which gave me movie star teeth.</li>
            <li> I only wish they were a bit longer to cover more of the sides of your teeth</li>
            <li> but none the less they work just fine as you don&#x27;t smile that wide to show the sides of your teeth anyway LOL.</li>
            <li> I use these often &amp; they&#x27;re quite expensive in the stores so this is a great price for the amount you get!</li>
            <li> It took some getting use to it at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a dentist or an expert by any means, but I&#x27;m not blind...</li>
            <li> , haven&#x27;t used it consistently.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first 3 times.</li>
            <li> Nothing ages a person more than yellow teeth</li>
            <li> I used these when they first came out with no problems.</li>
            <li> , I have wine occasionally, and I love blueberries.</li>
            <li> I did not think they would work at first, but as the days passed by, I realized it works.</li>
            <li> These are the first strips I ever used</li>
            <li> This product come with 3 times as many strips as any regular teeth whitening product you find in the stores and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I used something like this</li>
            <li> They need to make that one just as long as the top one.  </li>
            <li> Fast service and product was exactly as had been described.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product, barely get to use and already I can see the difference in whitening my teeth</li>
            <li> It made my teeth whiter with the whole box the first time</li>
            <li> a good teeth brushing usually gets rid of it though.</li>
            <li> They are easy to open (I recommened using scizzors to avoid tearing).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so easy to forget applying the strips twice a day, so the second time</li>
            <li> I used every single strip that came in this pack and by the end, my teeth never looked better.  </li>
            <li> The Crest Classic Whitestrips are the first ones I&#x27;ve tried and the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in using a gentle whitening product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on using this whole package,</li>
            <li> My teeth really become whiter than before.</li>
            <li> Once box lasts a whole year.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a health hazard to my knowledge, however one may want to avoid the discomfort by skipping a day after 2-3 straight days of use.</li>
            <li> it really works i recommend it to all the people who don&#x27;t believe it works.</li>
            <li> For the price though I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> These strips really work.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product if you are looking for the same results as the more expensive  strips-takes longer</li>
            <li> it was fast.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really get the result I want.</li>
            <li> 56 days, but in the end my teeth went from light brown to white.</li>
            <li> , these ones made my teeth hurt just as much AND didn&#x27;t do any whitening at all.  </li>
            <li> The newer types of Crest strips stick much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are basically the original white strips.</li>
            <li> They are better than the other Crest Whitestrips versions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and had more sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> These work great and slowly enough that they cause very little sensitivity to the teeth .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product because I don&#x27;t have a pool of salvia in my mouth, they stay put, no slipping, and after only one application I could see drastic results.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and get whiter teeth for much, much longer with Crest Classic.</li>
            <li> I only use them every other day and in two weeks people were already telling me I had a beautiful white teeth.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this product,only you have to be very patient for 2 times for 30 min per day.</li>
            <li> I love the Crest Classic whitestrips and having 100% more for half the price of store brand whitening systems was an extreme bonus.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a whole lot of white strips when you can just pay 5 dollars more and only</li>
            <li> The strip you put on top is nice, it&#x27;s long, but my complaint is the bottom one!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have less whitening and more comfort, i guess.</li>
            <li> I used to use the classic system and was upset when I could no longer find them in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the newer more expensive systems claiming to give better results.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Crest should not have fiddled with the Classic formula.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips before with decent results.  </li>
            <li> B0030HSD40 Crest Classic</li>
            <li> This product is simple, relatively quick and painless.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Classic Whitestrips and I am amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> As a social smoker (who am I kidding, right?)</li>
            <li> People, even strangers, always comment on how white my teeth are, particularly since I naturally smile a lot.  </li>
            <li> At least when I use the strong strips they do whiten my teeth quickly</li>
            <li> I rather use these than pay the high price at the dentist office for pretty much the same results.  </li>
            <li> Cleared my coffee stained teeth a bit after a few applications and this put more comfort when smiling, maybe will try again some time.</li>
            <li> (I used the Crest Whitestrips Vivid before and the peroxide content was too high)</li>
            <li> Had to back off to once a day use because it will make sensitive teeth MORE sensitive; but, they definitely whitened up my 55+ yr old teeth!</li>
            <li> The new versions just do not whiten as well as the classics.</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time finding a good deal on the Crest White Strips and use them faithfully.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant because my teeth are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you get 112 strips, and I personally think that they work better than the more expensive crest strips being sold in stores.</li>
            <li> My only gripe about this product is that if you have sensitive teeth or if this is your first time it may start to hurt.</li>
            <li> After I built up the courage, I was surprised that my teeth weren&#x27;t as sensitive as I thought!</li>
            <li> , on the box Crest supposedly offers a money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the product and request a refund within a certain time period.  </li>
            <li> I switched to the Crest Whitestrips after I developed sensitive teeth and gums from my old Rembrandt duo.</li>
            <li> But I prefer this since my gums are so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have never whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Works very well even with occasional use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent tea drinker and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> but teeth might become sensitive.</li>
            <li> (My old</li>
            <li> I use these about twice a year to keep my teeth white and they really do work</li>
            <li> But I had just finished a box of \\&quot;classic\\&quot; strips that left my teeth cleaner and ready to go to work.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have no complaints with this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because I have sensitive teeth and</li>
            <li> I received numerous compliments on my smile and my friends definitely noticed a difference in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking around for Whitestrips Classic in local drugstores and superstores, but could not find this type of whitening system anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I smoke, drink red wine and coffee, so I used these for about two weeks and got my teeth pretty white already</li>
            <li> if not slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;3.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Classic Model of Crest Whsitestrips for several years now and swear by them.  </li>
            <li> I recommend these white strips highly.</li>
            <li> I could think of locally and then resorted to checking out the reviews on the new version of creststrips .</li>
            <li> I would rather use these than the new 3D White Strips.</li>
            <li> I feel that they work fairly good and have made my teeth a bit whiter, but I can&#x27;t wear them everyday because they start making my tooth roots feel some very sharp pain, and this is only after ten or so minutes when the recommended use time is thirty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but not terribly effective.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product twice so far and my surface stains are virtually gone!</li>
            <li> I have used the crest 3d vivid white strips before.  </li>
            <li> I think that other strips may also have this problem but it is pretty</li>
            <li> The gel inside the strips can be kinda a weird feeling but other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I generally apply 1 strip per day after a meal, and leave it on for about an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I did not see much improvement, even though I am not a coffee nor alcohol drinker and usually don&#x27;t eat much of food that stain your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> These are really inexpensive but much harder to use.</li>
            <li> I was initially scared to use this, because of all the \\&quot;sensitive teeth\\&quot; comments.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s worth having achy teeth for a few days because I got some</li>
            <li> Not great, need to use way more than necessary</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ordering off of Amazon is generally cheaper than your local Wal Mart or Target.</li>
            <li> While I obtained some initial noticeable results, after the first days they made little difference.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply and they aren&#x27;t irritating to have in your mouth, like some strips can be.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow working, and yes it makes your teeth a bit sensitive if you over use it, but when I&#x27;m looking to whiten my teeth, I choose this exact product every time.</li>
            <li> Once removed, there is a terrible \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; on your teeth, but luckily it rinses off pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> While my old routine was certainly easier (brushing and using mouthwash as opposed to sitting for 20 minutes with a thin layer of plastic on my teeth), the results were the same,</li>
            <li> At least use these for ongoing touch-ups if you choose to use the newer strips first.  </li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews on the other types of Crest White Strips, I think it all come down to how well you&#x27;ll tolerate the product , how badly stained are your teeth, and how long you are willing to use the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other whitening products before, including the expensive salon style treatments.    </li>
            <li> I have not tried sleeping with the product in, but am anxious to try it in the near future.    </li>
            <li> it talk long time but still safey</li>
            <li> the others may not take as long but they also don&#x27;t whiten as well.</li>
            <li> Personally, I often have trouble continuing things like this over time, but my teeth are still as white as they were when I was using it (six months later).</li>
            <li> Problem is, I&#x27;ve gone through half the pack (a whole regular pack) and have seen very little difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They also are made of a thin plastic sheet that slips right off your teeth if you move your mouth or try to talk.  </li>
            <li> They are relatively inexpensive compared to other treatments.</li>
            <li> My teeth were whiter in a week&#x27;s time and I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on the product, especially compared to the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> but they do get &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t stick on teeth very long</li>
            <li> The box with 112 strips cost much less than 3D with only 28 strips.</li>
            <li> I thought that the 112 strips did multiple whitenings, however half are upper strips and the other half are lower.  </li>
            <li> I had always brushed at least twice daily.  </li>
            <li> The Delivery was faster then I expected.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s hard to not mess with them, with my tongue.</li>
            <li> I have used other products and they make my teeth sensitive to hot and cold for a few days after applying the treatment.</li>
            <li> Theese do the same without the pain and a whole lot less expensive.  </li>
            <li> This product is less expensive than the new products and it only takes a few days longer to do the same job.</li>
            <li> if your teeth are sensitive; you might want to wait at least a half hour before you apply.  </li>
            <li> I tried other brand names and other Crest systems that did not seem to whiten my teeth</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> and I never needed to use any other means of whitening.  </li>
            <li> You might also feel a burning sensation due to the peroxide in the strips.  </li>
            <li> I would not  suggest it product to other consumers at this time.</li>
            <li> 112 strips so my teeth can stay white for a few years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few strips (maybe 15-21 days total) and my teeth look maybe a little bit whiter.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Crest can put a product like this out on the shelves in good conscience, when there will be a group of people who will weaken their teeth and run the risk of chipping them, horrible.     </li>
            <li> I threw them away after a few tries.</li>
            <li> cuz these take a little longer than other crest whitestrips products.</li>
            <li> My husband I are both ex smokers, so we had slightly discolored teeth.</li>
            <li> When you put them on the solution can sometimes migrate around from movment of the strip slightly so you have to refrain form talking or moving your mouth for that 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be the typical gimmick.  </li>
            <li> Using hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and toothpaste mixture would work just as well and cost much less.</li>
            <li> If these are symptoms of normal white strips, then these strips are not that bad.</li>
            <li> Product did not significantly whiten teeth.  </li>
            <li> They were sold through a magazine article which had a little \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; that could show you your before and after look.    </li>
            <li> I suggest using these strips because they are just cheaper even if it takes a little longer than the newer strips.    </li>
            <li> cause its not smooth where it broke off.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are messy to put on.  </li>
            <li> You will see a difference after just a few applications.  </li>
            <li> These are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth getting whiter after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I even missed putting the strips on a few times</li>
            <li> I seen results within a few days without any pain or problems.</li>
            <li> I used for about a month and even skipped a few days</li>
            <li> Despite the inconvenience and slight difficulties, it does deliver whiter teeth and a lot less expensive than the gouging you&#x27;ll get from paying a dentist to do basically the same thing.</li>
            <li> and they tear up my teeth pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find Classics in the stores anymore and read bad reviews about the other Crest Whitestrips (vivid)</li>
            <li> If you have tried Crest Whitestrips in the past and found that they were not for you, then there is nothing that my review can do for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are wondering if you should try them but have never done so in the past, then read on!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read a lot of feedback on this product before purchasing, I discounted the negative feedback that claimed this product weakens your tooth where some people will chip their tooth from using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended that you keep the strips on for at least 30 minutes</li>
            <li> These were less expensive than the ones in the store</li>
            <li> I bought two boxes and will have plenty for at least two months!</li>
            <li> Can I sue Crest? irritating.</li>
            <li> This is the least expensive product I could find.</li>
            <li> I have used the classics before and have seen a dramatic improvement using one pack.      </li>
            <li> and I was a little disappointed with the lack of instructions.  </li>
            <li> It should be noted that continual use may cause gum discomfort (a slight pain at the base of a tooth).</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> You actually can&#x27;t go wrong with two lots for the price of one    </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong, i do not smoke at all</li>
            <li> This leaves you at 56 strips/two treatments a day, and it will take you 4 weeks to get mediocre results.  </li>
            <li> These are the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; crest strips, which I have had a difficult time finding in the store.  </li>
            <li> A very expensive treatment for mediocre results.</li>
            <li> What they don&#x27;t tell you is that you will salivate like crazy and that after taking off the strips you will have goo everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was time!  </li>
            <li> Lame!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t tastes bad and</li>
            <li> My teeth were stained badly from my smoking at one time and coffee.    </li>
            <li> &amp; with 112 strips at that price, cant be too bad.</li>
            <li> But disappointed on the bottom strip.</li>
            <li> The reviews were just awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> inexpesive to use but they do get &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t stick on teeth very long</li>
            <li> I read a lot of feedback on this product before purchasing, I discounted the negative feedback that claimed this product weakens your tooth where some people will chip their tooth from using this product. In 28 years, not one chipped tooth, til now anyway, now I have a chipped tooth from using this product, I&#x27;ve crunched on crab claws to just break apart the shell, and now all it took was one bite on a fork and wham.. chipped tooth.    I don&#x27;t know how Crest can put a product like this out on the shelves in good conscience, when there will be a group of people who will weaken their teeth and run the risk of chipping them, horrible.     Stay away from this product, life is stressful enough, you don&#x27;t want the risk of a chipped tooth, drives me nuts whenever I run my tongue on the tooth now cause its not smooth where it broke off.    Can I sue Crest? irritating.</li>
            <li> I was looking around for Whitestrips Classic in local drugstores and superstores, but could not find this type of whitening system anywhere.  I tried other brand names and other Crest systems that did not seem to whiten my teeth this well.  I used to use the classic system and was upset when I could no longer find them in the stores.  I absolutely love this product because I don&#x27;t have a pool of salvia in my mouth, they stay put, no slipping, and after only one application I could see drastic results.  I love the Crest Classic whitestrips and having 100% more for half the price of store brand whitening systems was an extreme bonus.  I bought two boxes and will have plenty for at least two months! It&#x27;s awesome! Don&#x27;t hesitate buy this whitening system!!! Don&#x27;t be fooled by the newer more expensive systems claiming to give better results. The price on these are great, the box has more in it,  and the results are amazing!!</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today and I&#x27;m wearing my first strips right now. So far so good, they seem to stay on pretty well although it&#x27;s hard to not mess with them, with my tongue. They are easy to open (I recommened using scizzors to avoid tearing). I&#x27;m using these along with Crest 3D toothpaste, so I&#x27;m hoping paired together I will get some good results. I&#x27;m planning on using this whole package, Yes all 112 of them! I will update my review after I use them all, I also will post my before and after photos..stay tuned!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix to stained teeth, this isn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s slow working, and yes it makes your teeth a bit sensitive if you over use it, but when I&#x27;m looking to whiten my teeth, I choose this exact product every time. It&#x27;s cheap, and over time, very effective. I smoke and drink soda as well as coffee and these strips eliminate these stains. If you&#x27;re looking to whiten your teeth 10 shades in two weeks for an event, I&#x27;d go with a more fast acting strip, but if you&#x27;re simply doing for yourself to brighten your smile, go ahead and order right away. :)</li>
            <li> Against my better judgement, I bought the classics instead of the premiums since it has so many strips. I&#x27;ve used quite a few strips (maybe 15-21 days total) and my teeth look maybe a little bit whiter. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll look a lot whiter if I use the whole damn box but that&#x27;s a whole lot of white strips when you can just pay 5 dollars more and only have to use the whitestrips for 14 days tops.</li>
            <li> They work good, very easy to use. I don&#x27;t think they are messy to put on.  The strip you put on top is nice, it&#x27;s long, but my complaint is the bottom one!  It&#x27;s shorter in length &amp; it always crumples &amp; then I got to go &amp; fix it several times! They need to make that one just as long as the top one.  Its nice to get 112 in the box for the price.  But disappointed on the bottom strip. (Maybe they all are like that?)  I don&#x27;t know?  This is my first time purchasing whitestrips.  I won&#x27;t buy this one again.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> This item was $24.99 in the summer!!!! The price is now more than double the amount. Why would it cost so much more now?</li>
            <li> I bought these for my first try on whitestrips. And I started to see results after 10 days. My teeth really become whiter than before. I am very happy they actually work! And these are at a more afforable price too if you dont feel the need to super rush into whiter teeth in 3-5 days cuz these take a little longer than other crest whitestrips products. I now still have 1/3 of the box and my teeth are white enough already.</li>
            <li> You actually can&#x27;t go wrong with two lots for the price of one    I love Crest whitestrips.    You will see a difference after the first couple of uses and it only gets better.     They are easy to apply and they aren&#x27;t irritating to have in your mouth, like some strips can be.     Definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> My husband I are both ex smokers, so we had slightly discolored teeth. After a week of using these, I could tell a huge difference. Almost all the stains were gone! And after two weeks, our teeth were white again.   The gel inside the strips can be kinda a weird feeling but other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> To all of those skeptics out there...this product goes 100% above and beyond my expectations!!!! I have such sensitive teeth and I was so nervous to use a teeth whitening product again (I used the Crest Whitestrips Vivid before and the peroxide content was too high) but I am very pleased!  I have only used the product twice so far and my surface stains are virtually gone! I have gotten compliments all day at work on how my teeth look like I went to the dentist last night!!!!  Definitely a GREAT buy! You will have 100% satisfaction with the Crest Whitestrips Classic set :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. My Harmon store stopped carrying it, in favor of more effective products. But I prefer this since my gums are so sensitive. I&#x27;d rather have less whitening and more comfort, i guess.</li>
            <li> My only gripe about this product is that if you have sensitive teeth or if this is your first time it may start to hurt. Other than that, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I got a good deal so getting the 100% more strips is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> You may want to use a faster product to initially whiten yellowed teeth.  But once white, this is a great product to maintain your smile.  I use it once a week to keep my teeth looking great.  Once box lasts a whole year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; version to work as wel as they did. I was thrilled with the price and the results exceeded my expectation. I&#x27;ll be buying these again for sure.</li>
            <li> These take 30 mins 2x a day for 28 days so you get 2 treatments. For $20, these were a steal</li>
            <li> I smoke, drink red wine and coffee, so I used these for about two weeks and got my teeth pretty white already and now I just use them once in a while to maintain the whiteness. Just works.</li>
            <li> Theese are better than the dentist according to my wife who says they do better than what the dentist was doing.  The dentist mixture seems to burn your mouth she says and Theese do the same without the pain and a whole lot less expensive.  And you can tell the results as soon as you take them off.</li>
            <li> Good deal for me because I use them often. My enamel is damaged and it seems like food always gets stuck to my teeth but if I use the strips it doesn&#x27;t happen plus the whitening.</li>
            <li> Great value and does the job!  Teeth got sensitive after a week, I took a day off and it was fine.</li>
            <li> These are basically the original white strips. The difference between these and the 3D or sealed types are the fit on your teeth. When you put them on the solution can sometimes migrate around from movment of the strip slightly so you have to refrain form talking or moving your mouth for that 30 minutes. They do work well if used as directed and are a good deal with so many (112) in the package.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, and its low price is just a bonus.    As a social smoker (who am I kidding, right?) with a beautiful smile (who am I kidding, right?), I care about my pearly whites.     When ever I feel the need to brighten my teeth, I use these strips for 2 weeks to 1 month.     I generally apply 1 strip per day after a meal, and leave it on for about an hour or two. The results are great!    It should be noted that continual use may cause gum discomfort (a slight pain at the base of a tooth). This isn&#x27;t a health hazard to my knowledge, however one may want to avoid the discomfort by skipping a day after 2-3 straight days of use.</li>
            <li> I used this product a couple months before my wedding.  The results were amazing!  I received numerous compliments on my smile and my friends definitely noticed a difference in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used them once a day, since I already have some sensitivity.  I didn&#x27;t notice any increase in sensitivity, although it did take longer.</li>
            <li> it really works i recommend it to all the people who don&#x27;t believe it works. doesn&#x27;t tastes bad and it only 30 min. twice on a day. i love it and my teeth are white &lt;3</li>
            <li> I must say even though i can not for the sake of my use these twice a day i can still notice the lightening color of my teeth. don&#x27;t get me wrong, i do not smoke at all but my god i love soda and juices and they tear up my teeth pretty bad. but these things work. i definitely notice the discoloration going away. The taste the gel peroxide leaves in your mouth is enough to make you want take them off and spit the taste out. a good teeth brushing usually gets rid of it though. recomend you brush them after anyway, the gel sticks like glue (figuratively)</li>
            <li> This takes a lot of time and I just forget to use them most days.  I would look for a diffrent solution unless you are commited to these.  For the price though I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Product was not as effective as I had expected. Product did not significantly whiten teeth.  It was as described, but I would not repurchase product.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Crest should not have fiddled with the Classic formula. These white strips work better (better whitening) than newer Crest strips I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest 3D whitening toothpaste and it burned my throat and mouth. These whitestrips are gentle and effective.  You will see a difference after just a few applications.  This product with 112 strips is a great value. I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in using a gentle whitening product.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have never whitened my teeth.  Needless to say, it was time!  I was hesitant because my teeth are very sensitive.  But I used these once a day and they were fine.   I wasn&#x27;t able to find this particular product in any local stores - they all seem to sell the more potent whitening products which my sensitive teeth cannot tolerate.  Even &#x27;tho the process took longer (being as I only used them once a day) I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the best whitestrips. AWESOME VALUE PACKAGE! I used for several years and then they were gone!! I looked on Amazon and here they were! Im so thankful. I get sooo mny compliments on my white teeth!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast service from seller. Love Crest Whitestrips Classic. Couldn&#x27;t find Classics in the stores anymore and read bad reviews about the other Crest Whitestrips (vivid) so I found the Classics on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is actually 56 packets of an upper and lower strip but this is still a great deal - haven&#x27;t found better.  Works very well even with occasional use.  I&#x27;m a frequent tea drinker and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have been using white strips for about 2 years now and I never needed to use any other means of whitening.  This is the perfect whitening solution because you get 112 strips for the price of what you would pay for 30 strips in a brick and mortar store!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Crest Classic\\&quot; whitening strips are a good buy but be weary of the time needed to whiten your teeth.  The instructions tell you to not brush before applying the strips so if your teeth are sensitive; you might want to wait at least a half hour before you apply.  You might also feel a burning sensation due to the peroxide in the strips.  It&#x27;s recommended that you keep the strips on for at least 30 minutes so during that time, your mouth might produce lots of saliva.  Overall, the strips work well but not as well as the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; more pricey strips.  If you want your teeth as white as quickly as possible, do not buy this product.  It&#x27;s a simple equation, low peroxide longer wait, higher peroxide level shorter wait but teeth might become sensitive.</li>
            <li> The strips are ok.  I have used the crest 3d vivid white strips before.  They provided much better results, delivered them more quickly, and were more gentle on my teeth.  I thought that the 112 strips did multiple whitenings, however half are upper strips and the other half are lower.  This leaves you at 56 strips/two treatments a day, and it will take you 4 weeks to get mediocre results.  Do yourself a favor and spend another 5 dollars on the better ones.  You will save yourself a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Not great, need to use way more than necessary</li>
            <li> This is the least expensive product I could find. They have an upper and lower in each packet.  They don&#x27;t dissolve which is fine with me.  They work.  Free shipping.  I like them.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.The Delivery was faster then I expected.I have used a whitening pen before,but the results were better with Crest Whitestrips.I saw results after 8-9 days.I will highly recommend this product,only you have to be very patient for 2 times for 30 min per day.</li>
            <li> Thought this was a great deal, basically two for the price of one.  Problem is, I&#x27;ve gone through half the pack (a whole regular pack) and have seen very little difference.  I have used the classics before and have seen a dramatic improvement using one pack.      Not the deal I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I bought these for $55.00 before they even hit the stores years ago.  They were sold through a magazine article which had a little \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; that could show you your before and after look.    My teeth were stained badly from my smoking at one time and coffee.    They work great.  I suggest using these strips because they are just cheaper even if it takes a little longer than the newer strips.    At least use these for ongoing touch-ups if you choose to use the newer strips first.  These work just fine.    Also, the area around the actual strip you can cut up and use for the side/rear teeth and backs of teeth (which actually can show through to the front if stained) and do the eye teeth again after using the initial strip.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips before with decent results.  These were less expensive than the ones in the store so I gave them a try.  These strips have many issues.  First of all, they don&#x27;t stay in place.  Once the bleach starts to \\&quot;bubble\\&quot; they slide around on your teeth.  Once removed, there is a terrible \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; on your teeth, but luckily it rinses off pretty easily.  And then after going through this for 2 weeks, I see no noticeable difference in the color of my teeth.  There is a guarantee on the box so I will be contacting Crest for a refund.  My advice, go with the Advanced Seal or another brand.  These are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Within a couple/2/3 days I saw big improvement. Had to back off to once a day use because it will make sensitive teeth MORE sensitive; but, they definitely whitened up my 55+ yr old teeth!</li>
            <li> I ordered the White Strips when they were one of the daily deals.  These strips really work.  I was amazed at how quickly I could notice the difference.  I will definitely recommend these to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Crest White Strips were recommended by my dental hygienist and they worked great.  My teeth looked much better after the first use.</li>
            <li> This product does a very good job and I am satisfied with the results. I used their more expensive ones and the only difference that I can notice is that the addhesieve is better in the latter. Whitestrips are a very good product and I would recomend anyone to try them.[[ASIN:B0030HSD40 Crest Classic 100% More Pack Whitestrips, 112-Count]]</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Fast service and product was exactly as had been described.  Arrived quick and I will be reordering more.</li>
            <li> Everything was very good and exactly as described. I love the classic-pack cuz its the same result just cheaper package...</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, barely get to use and already I can see the difference in whitening my teeth, inacrediv√©l seems to be very good.</li>
            <li> The ordering process was easy, the product arrived very quickly and was everything that was advertised by the company. I was extremely satisfied with all aspects of my experience.</li>
            <li> Hassle to use every day, and strips don&#x27;t always go on so easily.  Despite the inconvenience and slight difficulties, it does deliver whiter teeth and a lot less expensive than the gouging you&#x27;ll get from paying a dentist to do basically the same thing.</li>
            <li> should have bought more as this is the best buy on line and cannot be better else where, be happy here</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips CLASSIC are the best on the market.  They are better than the other Crest Whitestrips versions.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I use the CLASSIC strips more often than indicated on the directions.  My teeth are brilliantly white.  People, even strangers, always comment on how white my teeth are, particularly since I naturally smile a lot.  It is great that Crest offers 100% more strips (112 instead of 56) in the Crest Classic pack because I have always used twice as many to keep my teeth nice, white, and shining.</li>
            <li> I have loved these and had fantastic success with them for quite some time but the last time I shopped for them they were no where to be found ....I looked everywhere I could think of locally and then resorted to checking out the reviews on the new version of creststrips . The reviews were just awful and I feared that I would never get my hands on the stupendous originals . My husband suggsted that I try Amazon and there they were ! So happy to have a big box and at a great price . These work great and slowly enough that they cause very little sensitivity to the teeth . I will always try to have these on hand by stocking up through Amazon now!</li>
            <li> My favorite white strip which gave me movie star teeth. The new versions just do not whiten as well as the classics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad these are still available at Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried these and the newer versions. Crest Whitestrips have improved their formulas throughout the years, but while the newer strips adhere better, I find the Classic strips do a better and faster job of whitening my teeth. For me, the end result is worth having to fuss with keeping the strips in place. Great value! ***</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but affective an I thought is could be . I would not  suggest it product to other consumers at this time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other whitening products before, including the expensive salon style treatments.    This product is simple, relatively quick and painless. I have used other products and they make my teeth sensitive to hot and cold for a few days after applying the treatment. This is not so with Crest Whitestrips.    I have used this product for about a week now and am noticing results. I have not tried sleeping with the product in, but am anxious to try it in the near future.    Pros: excellent value, gentle, easy to apply and clean up afterwards.  Cons: none!</li>
            <li> If you have tried Crest Whitestrips in the past and found that they were not for you, then there is nothing that my review can do for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering if you should try them but have never done so in the past, then read on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Whitestrips are one of my favorite ways to whiten my teeth for 3 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Price- They are relatively inexpensive compared to other treatments. A fraction of the cost at your local dentist and comparable with the Rembrandt whitening toothpaste/mouthwash combo. (My old favorites.)&lt;br /&gt;2.) No Irritation- I switched to the Crest Whitestrips after I developed sensitive teeth and gums from my old Rembrandt duo. While my old routine was certainly easier (brushing and using mouthwash as opposed to sitting for 20 minutes with a thin layer of plastic on my teeth), the results were the same, if not slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Results- If you stick with them and use them correctly, you will see results. I am a non-smoker and rare coffee drinker and can see a substantially whiter smile in about 5-days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering off of Amazon is generally cheaper than your local Wal Mart or Target. Highly recommend getting it with free prime shipping!</li>
            <li> These are really inexpensive but much harder to use. They easily slide off your teeth. I&#x27;d recommend the advance seal version instead.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchase this product.  Whitestrips works!!!  I drink coffee and wine and my teeth display stains.  I use a strip once a week and it is perfect and the price was Great!</li>
            <li> excellent item, solved my problem</li>
            <li> Up until I was 40, I had conceeded that I would always have yellow teeth.  I had always brushed at least twice daily.  I had routine cleanings at the dentist twice a year.  But still yellow.  I have never used tobacco products.  And, I don&#x27;t drink coffee.  Still yellow.  I tried these stips on a whim.  I thought they would be the typical gimmick.  THEY WORK.  I even get comments from the dentist!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the strips. The result is rather visible. My teeth got whiter visibly after about a week of use. But the edge of my gums were red and it hurts when I brush my teeth. I tried avoiding my gums when I use the strips, but the same thing occurred. I had to reduce the frequency I use in the end, and as expected, the results weren&#x27;t as good without the frequency required.</li>
            <li> Cleared my coffee stained teeth a bit after a few applications and this put more comfort when smiling, maybe will try again some time.</li>
            <li> I use these about twice a year to keep my teeth white and they really do work I rather use these than pay the high price at the dentist office for pretty much the same results.  I only wish they were a bit longer to cover more of the sides of your teeth but none the less they work just fine as you don&#x27;t smile that wide to show the sides of your teeth anyway LOL.</li>
            <li> very good . I like it very much .  a nice one.  i will buy one more next time , good</li>
            <li> I use these often &amp; they&#x27;re quite expensive in the stores so this is a great price for the amount you get!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I like the convenience of receiving the white strips monthly. I recommend these white strips highly.</li>
            <li> Love these strips. I have been using them for almost 10 years now, and they work so well. Even my dentist compliments my white teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth getting whiter after a few uses. I even missed putting the strips on a few times so I&#x27;m sure they could be even whiter. It took some getting use to it at first but now they feel fine.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how easy they were to use.  I think I have noticed a difference already in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Classic Whitestrips and I am amazed at the results. Don&#x27;t bother paying more for the 3D premium product, this works great in only 4 days. The box with 112 strips cost much less than 3D with only 28 strips. Save your money and get whiter teeth for much, much longer with Crest Classic. I&#x27;m not a dentist or an expert by any means, but I&#x27;m not blind...</li>
            <li> I was initially scared to use this, because of all the \\&quot;sensitive teeth\\&quot; comments. After I built up the courage, I was surprised that my teeth weren&#x27;t as sensitive as I thought! I can&#x27;t say now well this product works though, haven&#x27;t used it consistently.</li>
            <li> These are not the same as the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; strips that were on the shelves 6 months ago.  They leave a lot of \\&quot;gu\\&quot; (for lack of a better word) on my teeth. Of course if wipes off.  But I had just finished a box of \\&quot;classic\\&quot; strips that left my teeth cleaner and ready to go to work.  But the box of 112 is a BARGAIN!</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time finding a good deal on the Crest White Strips and use them faithfully.  I can spend over $40 dollars and get about 20 strips in a box.  I would have never thought about Amazon for this, and thought I would take a chance.  I was so happy to have found this deal, I bought one box for me and for my daughter.  112 Crest White Strips in a box unheard of.  AWESOME DEAL, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> These definitely work. I noticed a difference after the first 3 times. And the box says 112 strips, but it&#x27;s actually 112 sets of tops and bottoms. So 112 applications total. Again, great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Classic Model of Crest Whsitestrips for several years now and swear by them.  They are easy to use and 100% effective.  They have made my teeth very, very white which has taken years off my age.  People remark frequently about my great teeth and smile.  Nothing ages a person more than yellow teeth so give them a try.  They are great!</li>
            <li> this is a great product if you are looking for the same results as the more expensive  strips-takes longer but it works well.</li>
            <li> I love Crest Whitestrips Classic, as I have sensitive teeth. These do the job beautifully and do NOT leave my teeth or gums in pain. I love the size of this box....112 strips so my teeth can stay white for a few years! Great price too. I just bought a second box!</li>
            <li> These are the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; crest strips, which I have had a difficult time finding in the store.  For the price, you get 112 strips, and I personally think that they work better than the more expensive crest strips being sold in stores.</li>
            <li> I used these when they first came out with no problems. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and had more sensitivity issues. I read most of the reviews on the other types of Crest White Strips, I think it all come down to how well you&#x27;ll tolerate the product , how badly stained are your teeth, and how long you are willing to use the product. These work for me!  I don&#x27;t drink a lot of coffee, I have wine occasionally, and I love blueberries. These strips are the best bang for the buck. My teeth whitened up after 3 days of using these.No sensitivity and  I had a lot of complements on how white my teeth are. I recommend these for the price and how well they do work.</li>
            <li> I have tried them for 2 weeks, twice a day (some days only once) and I can say they work. I did not think they would work at first, but as the days passed by, I realized it works. It takes some time to see some improvements, so you have to be patient. My teeth now are whiter and I am a happy customer. Will use the remaining strips in 5 months and give some to my family.</li>
            <li> it was fast. and it surely is cheap:) i dont really remember anything else, it was a while ago:p i forgot to leave a feedback</li>
            <li> It made my teeth whiter with the whole box the first time but it&#x27;s so easy to forget applying the strips twice a day, so the second time, I didn&#x27;t really get the result I want.</li>
            <li> actually, I use this strips 2 weeks and i see different .. it talk long time but still safey cuz i have sentsetive teeth ..&lt;br /&gt;I like and recommand othen .. Note: u have to patient to see the different but if you are on hurry u have to look for more stronger one ^^</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, THESE WORK REALLY GREAT!! They may not work as quickly as one would like but patience is rewarded. I noticed the colour of my teeth in a photograph where I was next to someone with white teeth, mine looked brown in comparison. I had to use two of these packs (224 in total) 56 days, but in the end my teeth went from light brown to white.</li>
            <li> I used the Crest strips for three months. While I obtained some initial noticeable results, after the first days they made little difference. A very expensive treatment for mediocre results. Better to pay your dentist to do it right.</li>
            <li> i have used several different teeth-whitening products and this is by far the best. the others may not take as long but they also don&#x27;t whiten as well.</li>
            <li> I seen results within a few days without any pain or problems.I used them twice a day for 30 minutes...sometimes back to back. They recommend not to brush your teeth right before using but I gently brushed. These are the first strips I ever used and since I had great results I decided to stay with this product...so glad that I did. Great price...much better than retail.</li>
            <li> This product come with 3 times as many strips as any regular teeth whitening product you find in the stores and for a fraction of the price. And it&#x27;s effective! I used for about a month and even skipped a few days and I could definitely see a difference in my teeth. I definitely would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Every time i leave my house and smile people say you have a lovely smile and perfect white teeth, i love this product i usually buy every year to renew my whiteness ,but after a couple days of using this product my teeth always appeared whiter and stay white for up to a year</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on 11/30 they got to my house on 12/02 loved the fast shipping! I have only used it once so far but I will say these strips are gooey. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to taste yummy but it does have a funky taste to it. Hoping to see results! &amp; with 112 strips at that price, cant be too bad. Keeping my fingers crossed :)</li>
            <li> So far, I have no complaints with this product.  It is the first time I used something like this and I was a little disappointed with the lack of instructions.  However, it is easy to use.  What they don&#x27;t tell you is that you will salivate like crazy and that after taking off the strips you will have goo everywhere.  From what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s okay to wipe it off.</li>
            <li> If these are symptoms of normal white strips, then these strips are not that bad. The Crest Classic Whitestrips are the first ones I&#x27;ve tried and the price cannot be beat. I feel that they work fairly good and have made my teeth a bit whiter, but I can&#x27;t wear them everyday because they start making my tooth roots feel some very sharp pain, and this is only after ten or so minutes when the recommended use time is thirty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to constantly spit in the sink to release the extra saliva caused by these strips. I think that other strips may also have this problem but it is pretty annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would probably go with these than a more expensive version, because I feel that they all must have the same disadvantages. The 112 count box is pretty impressive in size and is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Ken Flemming&lt;br /&gt;Author, How to Get a Job in Video Games</li>
            <li> I love the original Whitestrips so much better than all the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; strips Crest has come out with now. These produce results and stay in place well for me. My teeth were noticeably whiter after the first week!</li>
            <li> These are so great. I would rather use these than the new 3D White Strips. It says to use twice a day for 30 minutes. I only use them every other day and in two weeks people were already telling me I had a beautiful white teeth. Even my close family noticed. SO imagine what it would of have done if I had used it twice a day. This product is less expensive than the new products and it only takes a few days longer to do the same job. I use this about once every two years. Great product!!</li>
            <li> These strips are great but remember avoid drinking coffee or other staining liquids n food. If u do just brush afterwards!!!!!</li>
            <li> My teeth were whiter in a week&#x27;s time and I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on the product, especially compared to the other products on the market. Personally, I often have trouble continuing things like this over time, but my teeth are still as white as they were when I was using it (six months later).</li>
            <li> I used them for a while (2-3 times a week) trying to bleach my teeth, till my teeth started to hurt from the peroxide in these strips. I did not see much improvement, even though I am not a coffee nor alcohol drinker and usually don&#x27;t eat much of food that stain your teeth. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but not terribly effective. Using hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and toothpaste mixture would work just as well and cost much less.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have sensitive teeth and the really strong \\&quot;professional\\&quot; strips make my teeth hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, these ones made my teeth hurt just as much AND didn&#x27;t do any whitening at all.  At least when I use the strong strips they do whiten my teeth quickly and then it&#x27;s worth having achy teeth for a few days because I got some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also are made of a thin plastic sheet that slips right off your teeth if you move your mouth or try to talk.  The newer types of Crest strips stick much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on the box Crest supposedly offers a money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the product and request a refund within a certain time period.  So I called the number on the box and got the instructions.  I cut out the proof of purchase and mailed it with my receipt to the refund address within that time period, but never received a refund.  That was over a year ago.  Still never heard from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up just giving the strips away. I wouldn&#x27;t bother if I were you.</li>
            <li> I used every single strip that came in this pack and by the end, my teeth never looked better.  I loved the price and felt that I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> These are the best as they do not make your teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li> this is an easy to use product. i love being able to buy it in bulk on Amazon, and for a very fair price. not 100% sure it works, but it might have...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. They don&#x27;t even stick to your teeth. I threw them away after a few tries. Lame!</li>
