            <li>Fair  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very glad with the result</li>
            <li>i am very satisfied</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and plan to use it for longer.</li>
            <li>I like the good price, and found both very strong clips.</li>
            <li>Just be you and love your features!</li>
            <li>This is more like a joke!</li>
            <li>The cloth pin work better than this!</li>
            <li>Lol it was cheap</li>
            <li>so idk how effective that one is</li>
            <li>Honest seller.</li>
            <li>I will say that it made me question my own intelligence for even thinking it had any possibility of working.</li>
            <li>but it kind of hurts after a while.</li>
            <li>Received it fast.looks nice</li>
            <li>Works pretty good! ...</li>
            <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t wait to see what my nose will look like after longer use. :)</li>
            <li>kind of feel like my nose is more swollen</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick too!</li>
            <li>I can always clean it really good.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a great buy and the price is great.</li>
            <li>I first found out about this item on YouTube and saw a lady that had great results.</li>
            <li>Since it is very comfortable, I will then move on to sleeping with it over night and also record my two week progress.</li>
            <li>Since it is very comfortable, I will then move on to sleeping with it over night and also record my two week progress.</li>
            <li>great very fast shipping :)</li>
            <li>but its okay it was too good to be true uk plus</li>
            <li>Great product really works.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even wear it for more than a minute.</li>
            <li>it seems like it works better</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li>My wife has given me many compliments.</li>
            <li>I guess I bought it more like a gag gift.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>The purple one is okay, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>and perhaps my arch is getting better.</li>
            <li>but I do feel better about my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d have more luck with it if you have a fleshier nose as opposed to a bony one, as the product is meant to shape cartilage.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I got the authentic</li>
            <li>but I like it :)</li>
            <li>No way that ur going to be able to sleep with this thing on ..</li>
            <li>Found out I love my nose, they kinda helped me find that out</li>
            <li>See top pictures.</li>
            <li>so it is not like I had kept it safe with angelic care at all,</li>
            <li>It working okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;See if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m soooo glad</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t have it on for more than 10 mins without feeling pain.</li>
            <li>My nose looks slimmer (so I&#x27;ve been told!! :) ).</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it, I tried this just for kicks, but I am glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I got this more out of humor and curiosity...</li>
            <li>I love both</li>
            <li>it will work better..</li>
            <li>Ok you put this on your nose for awhile</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet, but then again, I can never stand to keep either one clamped on my nose for more than a couple of minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;only squeezing the tip cartridge, if you go more up where your nostrils and folds are, it will cause it to collapse and change shape,&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
            <li>You spend more on candy (stop complaining).</li>
            <li>Kind of cheap quality</li>
            <li>but it works okay on my nose</li>
            <li>its ok...</li>
            <li>Not???  :-)  </li>
            <li>mentioning----who are ALSO *satisfied* with the nose clip:  </li>
            <li>Now, to be truthful.  </li>
            <li>Even when I put paper on my nose to add a better grip it still slipped.</li>
            <li>Interesting gadget.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s an interesting gadget.</li>
            <li>that work ok.</li>
            <li>But when i keep looking at the picture of the instruction, it looks like we could adjust it, so after i adjust it it felt so much better.</li>
            <li>The nose right is kind of nice.</li>
            <li>Plastic is very cheap and easy to break.</li>
            <li>Pretty good feels like its working</li>
            <li>the blue is a perfect fit...</li>
            <li>the idea is fantastic, as for the product i am not so sure.</li>
            <li>Glad that this product is cheap because it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li>/&gt; great people to do business with  and love the product!&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this to anyone that wants to change the apperance of your nose without having surgery it really works!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I should just save up for a nose job now...  or try the original  called  nose  magic  from Japan.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the original size of my nose</li>
            <li>For $2 I was impressed it worked well but be very careful</li>
            <li>But still easy to fall.</li>
            <li>it works maybe， and it is nkt easy to break though，</li>
            <li>I like the product and it is easy to wear</li>
            <li>Easy to use, it works</li>
            <li>It slips off your nose to easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t set my expectations too high.  </li>
            <li>I liked it at first.</li>
            <li>The purple clip works absolutely fine for me.</li>
            <li>These two work fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purple one works fine</li>
            <li>Even if I try my best to put it on, i have to take it off after 1 min because its too tight and it start to hurting my nose.</li>
            <li>it is a really great deal to get both types for such a cheap price</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy wasting money and time then this will do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to use and</li>
            <li>cheap... doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap, so</li>
            <li>taller，anyway，it ia cheap</li>
            <li>I can still breathe comfortably.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with a wider nose it wont fit</li>
            <li>but these were cheap items to buy.</li>
            <li>* as IMPORTANT as the *PATIENCE* aspect regarding the nose clip and its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>I liked the products, but one thing really bugged me.</li>
            <li>its light</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works if you use it consistently to make your nose higher or narrower, but it&#x27;s a good tool to have and try if you&#x27;re determined.</li>
            <li>It actually feels kind of nice...</li>
            <li>Really hurt!!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it works fine too.</li>
            <li>When I ordered it I knew it probably wouldn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>and I can already see a significant difference in the width of my nose.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve notices a significant difference in size,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Especially when it kind of hurts!</li>
            <li>If used consistently, will not change the shape of the nose for more than an hour at a time.</li>
            <li>i was actually excited to purchase this item</li>
            <li>think about something we&#x27;re ALL familiar with:  BRACES (on teeth).  </li>
            <li>im satisfied so far!!!!</li>
            <li>its super cheap</li>
            <li>But on the bright side I could use the blue one to  close chip bags!</li>
            <li>After all it was a good price for two different nose clip.</li>
            <li>THATS COOL,</li>
            <li>I put it on and I couldn&#x27;t leave it on for more than 2-3 minutes because it was really hurting my nose:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying any of these things are good, but reshaping your body is possible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying any of these things are good, but reshaping your body is possible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear them as often because I have glasses I plan on using them more when I get contacts.</li>
            <li>The blue clip fits better on my nose and is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>OKAY, HAVENT REALLY NOTICED A CHANGE</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything more that squeeze your nose and leave a mark on your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman with a very nice bridge, I don&#x27;t see how these would stay on a flat bridge if they pop right off of my nose.</li>
            <li>The butterfly shaped one doesn&#x27;t seem strong as first</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try and worth the money!</li>
            <li>They are a little cheap (although very well-made for the price), and since this is a long-term commitment to a more beautiful nose, you&#x27;ll want to have backups for whenever your first pair breaks (shipping is from China?</li>
            <li>received it quickly and have used it a couple times..</li>
            <li>Buy the nose clip, and----***EVENTUALLY***-----you&#x27;ll be a HAPPY camper (with a CUTE, sexy, smaller, little nose)!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>Buy the nose clip, and----***EVENTUALLY***-----you&#x27;ll be a HAPPY camper (with a CUTE, sexy, smaller, little nose)!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why i bought them in the first place!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit very well at all</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to be part of the few people that saw great results but guess not.</li>
            <li>short of any kind of surgery</li>
            <li>but it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>but it is worth a try for this price.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth a try at this price to see if it will work for you.</li>
            <li>The blue one is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>for the price it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>but so far it seems to work like magic.</li>
            <li>also this item does  cause some pain  but its all worth it in the end</li>
            <li>Ok so let me make this clear:</li>
            <li>I have a friend whose nose became skinnier over the years because she wore glasses since elementary school.</li>
            <li>I have a friend whose nose became skinnier over the years because she wore glasses since elementary school.</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s just fun to do</li>
            <li>For $1 its worth a shot.</li>
            <li>It was nice to experiment with, but I do not know how it would actually work.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been having fun playing with them.</li>
            <li>These clamps are not a miracle cure, but they&#x27;re worth a shot for $2.</li>
            <li>NOTHING* worth</li>
            <li>I threw away the pink one since I heard it leaves bruises and all on the nose , but the blue one works great!</li>
            <li>useful if your clipping your nose to keep odors at bay.</li>
            <li>it is fun to buy</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, so not disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is not approved by doctor but nose right is....</li>
            <li>Left a nice slice making my nose with a new fabulous scar.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and cheap in general.  </li>
            <li>so i think its a decent item for cheap.</li>
            <li>Since then the changes seem to be more apparent and permanent.</li>
            <li>However, the instructions on the package are hilarious, as they barely make sense.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure if they work or if they just pin the nose right for a short while but isn&#x27;t the gift of confidence worth giving.</li>
            <li>Remember a long time ago in China, the cultural custom used to be for women to BIND their feet----in order to be more attractive to a mate or potential mate??</li>
            <li>You have to stay very disciplined and wear them as directed but definitely are effective.</li>
            <li>but good luck leaving it on for half an hour.</li>
            <li>works wonderfully for slight fixes and minor dorsal humps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>she doesn&#x27;t seem to use it very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just very gentle pressure</li>
            <li>This nose clip will NOT help you because you don&#x27;t have very much cartilage to shape.</li>
            <li>The blue is ok.</li>
            <li>first off, it hurts to wear it even for a medium amount of time.</li>
            <li>Works temporarily at first but over time I see results.</li>
            <li>it is okay and might work if used properly</li>
            <li>The blue one is okay, Im still using it, but i guess it works, cause I can see a difference, not drastic though.</li>
            <li>I saw changes immediately, but they were temporary at first.</li>
            <li>pink one, however, was already opened, so before I wear the pink one, I&#x27;m going to make sure I disinfect it really good.</li>
            <li>This is pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;Since it sent two, I gave my mom one.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY.</li>
            <li>4 REAL DOG!</li>
            <li>Maybe works better on Asian noses?</li>
            <li>, it definitely would have become more distinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love that you can place the blue one anywhere</li>
            <li>I think it would be better if you could get different sizes.</li>
            <li>This is my first review to anything; however, I hope this review helps someone purchase this product</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, doing research, and considering the price I decided to finally purchase this item.</li>
            <li>Shipping took quite a whole, but for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought one of the pink straightening bridges from Chine before and really liked it.</li>
            <li>My nose is smaller now and shaped better.</li>
            <li>If you are considering plastic surgery or rhinoplasty, I recommend you to try this first.</li>
            <li>Even if there&#x27;s no difference at first keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is not expensive.</li>
            <li>(I had to buy two, the first one broke.)</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t help your nose get higher.</li>
            <li>As for this device actually working to mold a better nose I am uncertain of, but I will try it out and report my results.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well</li>
            <li>I was bummed about the 17-28 business days, but it came in more than a week earlier than the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>This thing really works!</li>
            <li>waste of money, might be good nose plugs?</li>
            <li>I had given them to my daughters and they snapped right in front of my very eyes.</li>
            <li>The tension should be loosened a little to make them more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Seriously don&#x27;t bother lol</li>
            <li>I like it so much and will looking for more in the future</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like your nose, you most likely need a surgical nose job -- which I&#x27;m going to be getting very soon.</li>
            <li>To those reviewers who stated all of the negatives about probably have noses that aren&#x27;t compatible with this device, which means your nose is most likely too big to fit into it.  </li>
            <li>This is an ok product but will give you a headache if you wear it too long on your nose.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I received them quickly</li>
            <li>The blue thing is so easy to put</li>
            <li>My nose isn&#x27;t large to begin with</li>
            <li>It does not work for certain nose shapes.it just kept sliping off my nose</li>
            <li>Broke very easily after using it twice, not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I give it two stars because it didn&#x27;t do anything for me but it might have the potential to be better if I was a little more patient.</li>
            <li>The beauty clip is very brittle</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;ve already ordered it don&#x27;t worry, it makes an intense nose plug for the pool.</li>
            <li>Now I really like the nose up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these really help make your nose look taller</li>
            <li>The blue clip broke, cheaply made</li>
            <li>fast shipping, items received as described.</li>
            <li>This product functions and works very well.</li>
            <li>They both hurt way too much.</li>
            <li>but i dont know if it really works permanently.</li>
            <li>you get two items for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to see what the fuss was about, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to really reshape my schnozz.  </li>
            <li>DONT REALLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>i really like this</li>
            <li>Who wants a lego nose?</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel much pain at all.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect much..</li>
            <li>Works well but break fast.</li>
            <li>so much money, but it works&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>really does work!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really works</li>
            <li>though if you really think it&#x27;s going to correct your nose</li>
            <li>Since i got it today i havent really taken time to try it out too much, so i do not know if it works yet.</li>
            <li>I wear it for 15-40 minutes a day, depending on how much time I have alone</li>
            <li>Too much pain, gave up.</li>
            <li>and I know see a difference so much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice too much change</li>
            <li>if you really want to change it go get rhinoplasty...</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>these were probably made very poorly,haha..)</li>
            <li>The pink one leaves marks on your nose and the purple one broke because the spring is so cheap!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really does anything.</li>
            <li>I can t really tell ???</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>They pinched my nose too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a temporary &#x27;treatment&#x27; but it does work and lasts me the whole day if I put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li>I gave it a three because of the price, speed of delivery and they are REALLY sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an honest waste of money</li>
            <li>but it does it for a couple of seconds then back to original nose</li>
            <li>The pink one has less padding and seems to apply more pressure, so it hurts more.</li>
            <li>actual work is very good, but the pink plastic is waste lift, it is always like four weeks time to send two items, but it is still worth buying.</li>
            <li>but i was not gonna give it my full trust since it was only about $5</li>
            <li>The pink work well, but it break too easy.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I as I have gotten older, the bridge of my nose has gotten wider.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve a normal nose not picky or downsized or some sort of just normal straight nose</li>
            <li>the pink one i tried, leaves nice lego pattern on your nose but does not help to make it smaller</li>
            <li>You have to be realistic.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t particularly care for them.</li>
            <li>She has a flat Asian type nose with a little bridge, so the blue nose thing fit great and felt comfortable for her, but the pink one kept falling since the bridge of her nose wasn&#x27;t big.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend it👍</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a high rating because the seller delivered on time and everything was included.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that maybe this would work</li>
            <li>The pink hurt too much at first, but as my nose got smaller the pink got more comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I feel like these gave me a little more of a ski slope nose which I</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the pink little nosey, as I feel it is more useful than the blue device.</li>
            <li>The purple one slips off and the pink one does not even fit around my nose.</li>
            <li>The pink bridge straightening  didn&#x27;t fit on my nose shape</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works, but I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fun to have for this price, especially if you want to get an idea on how your nose would look thinner after a nose job.</li>
            <li>I thought it would eventually go away, and my nose would return to normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a hard squeeze...</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have a big nose and it has thinned my nose soooo much that i am constantly getting compliments on it, and the bridge straightening clip ( pink one)</li>
            <li>I could only wear it for about 10-15 min for the first few days, but have been able to wear it longer now(30 min-1hr).</li>
            <li>I think, so if they break and you don&#x27;t have a backup, you&#x27;ll lose a lot of progress by sitting around for a month waiting for the new ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>so I decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li>After using the product for 30 mins, you will notice that once you remove the shapers that your nose will hold the form for a good 30 mins to an hour before cartilage and lymphatic fluid re-positions itself back and your previous shape of your nose returns.</li>
            <li>wear it over night and FYI, it comes off pretty easy when you&#x27;re sleeping, so you might have a hard time looking for it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Very surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t fall apart or anything (which I&#x27;m very surprised about considering</li>
            <li>The blue one is ok for my nose, but it seems like you should use the pink one first than the blue one.</li>
            <li>I wore it on the slightly bulbous end of my nose for about 45 mins and when I took it off, the end of my nose stayed slimmed down for a good while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I kept the pink one, it fits nicely with my taller and bigger Asian nose.</li>
            <li>Along with facial excersizes, my nose is a lot more toned, but proper lymphatic massage and yoga to tone your face is necessary.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not a small nose.</li>
            <li>Also, some people may not be aware of this, but some african diaspora people &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; their baby&#x27;s nose</li>
            <li>Also, some people may not be aware of this, but some african diaspora people &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; their baby&#x27;s nose</li>
            <li>I used the blue clip first to straighten the nose bridge.</li>
            <li>The only person winning at this game is the person who probably runs a sweatshop in order to mass produce these things for cheap.</li>
            <li>Never has a product been so low in quality that it bent and misshaped on the first use.</li>
            <li>your nose will look smaller right after you unclip it, and red but will get back to normal size after, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently, but depending on your nose shape and condition it might give you a hint of sculpting result.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty flat nose</li>
            <li>I have been using the blue one only for less than a month, and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT LEFT LARGE PERMANENT DENTS IN NOSE.</li>
            <li>Unable to go back to China to buy one, I found one on Amazon and was very pleased!</li>
            <li>so to clear everything up.</li>
            <li>The pink thing doesn&#x27;t even fit unless you have a tiny button nose</li>
            <li>and i can clearly see the difference.</li>
            <li>The purple is way better than the pink one, the pink one just crashes your noise</li>
            <li>I wear the clip daily for about 15 mins in the morning while getting ready for work</li>
            <li>I much prefer the blue one.</li>
            <li>I bought two and so far</li>
            <li>I bought two and so far</li>
            <li>but so far both of the clips work,</li>
            <li>I bought this for someone who are conscious about their nose.</li>
            <li>They come from so far</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference, but that&#x27;s only because I haven&#x27;t been keeping up with it like every day....</li>
            <li>I know I don&#x27;t have the same nose as everyone else, but the pink nose clip fits perfectly on my nose and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all to be frank  </li>
            <li>the purple one especially, just instantly threw it away, not even worth the plastic</li>
            <li>The pink one broke super easily and the blue one is kind of painful</li>
            <li>It is an okay item, I am still using the nose lifting shaping (blue) but the pink one is so tight that it broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are complaining that it hurts, it&#x27;s most likely because you have very little cartilage on the bridge of your nose and the clip is pressing against the bone.</li>
            <li>The clear rubbery plastic on the pink nose clip hurts my nose, so instead, i took the clear plastic off and placed the blue nose shaping thing on top of the pink clip.</li>
            <li>I think it would not really make your nose bridge higher completely</li>
            <li>it in the same places every time, if you often move it to different spots higher or lower there&#x27;s no progress being made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I thought it was working as my nose seems smaller, but the blue piece broke after 3 months, although the pink piece is still going strong.</li>
            <li>The pink straightening bridge was in a package identical to my previous one, and I was pleasantly surprised that the knobby white part of the straightening clip was a nice reddish-pink color instead, since my old one was white</li>
            <li>Also for the pink one, the instruction really need to be translated into english, because in the beginning when i was wearing it, it hurted my nose so much.</li>
            <li>It hurt at first as it softened up my cartilage, but after the first few days, it was relatively painless.</li>
            <li>And when you take them off, your nose goes back to normal.</li>
            <li>And remember, for hundreds of years, Chinese women bandaged their feet to make them smaller, and certain indigenous tribes use wedges and rings to make their necks longer.</li>
            <li>And remember, for hundreds of years, Chinese women bandaged their feet to make them smaller, and certain indigenous tribes use wedges and rings to make their necks longer.</li>
            <li>If this product was not so cheap I would be more incline to anger than I am now.</li>
            <li>If you want a smaller nose, your only real option is rhinoplasty.  </li>
            <li>People often buy these items because they are cheap and they think what the hey, it&#x27;s only a few bucks.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really work for me just left my nose red</li>
            <li>Many of the negative reviews were due to high expectations, lack of patients, and improper use.</li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s working since I got this only about 3 days ago, but it was cheap and it never hurts to try.</li>
            <li>I enjoy breathing out of my nose and the pinching is pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>These shaping clips are clearly for someone with a smaller nose.</li>
            <li>I just barely opened it too.</li>
            <li>So I barely got it today</li>
            <li>I could barely keep it on for 15 minutes, but I managed.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far</li>
            <li>, I felt my nose looked slimmer, but not significantly, be careful when you place the clip, that</li>
            <li>The pink clip really hurts, I guess i have to get used to it.</li>
            <li>it is uncomfortable at first but the results are real if you are consistent with wearing it.</li>
            <li>the items were ok,though it may take like forever for my nose to improve coz unlike surgery,it&#x27;s actually exercising the nose,but it will just go back to its normal look once you stop using the item</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a major perfectionist and height critical and this the little clips are worth a shot</li>
            <li>The pink was a tight fit for me</li>
            <li>Actually, the blue one is ok, but not good as I bought it before.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The  pink one hurts so much but the blue one doesnt</li>
            <li>and my friends said, which seems to be more thin, blue clamp</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind pain if it will benefit me but these not only hurt, they barely stay on.</li>
            <li>The Blue Nose Clip just barely fits.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package I was actually surprised by how small the pink nose clip was, and that the reviews of it were partially true.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t  really say if its working but the pink one hurts so bad can&#x27;t use it blue ones good</li>
            <li>Since I ordered it new, I expected it to be in a sealed package for safety.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just be clear that it takes a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just be clear that it takes a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plastic on my old one was starting to feel loose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty tide, but it&#x27;s little bit hurt when you use it for long time.</li>

            <li> I will say that it made me question my own intelligence for even thinking it had any possibility of working.</li>

            <li> Great product really works.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even wear it for more than a minute.</li>
            <li> it seems like it works better</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li> My wife has given me many compliments.</li>

            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> The purple one is okay, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> and perhaps my arch is getting better.</li>
            <li> but I do feel better about my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d have more luck with it if you have a fleshier nose as opposed to a bony one, as the product is meant to shape cartilage.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I got the authentic</li>
            <li> but I like it :)</li>

            <li> See top pictures.</li>
            <li> so it is not like I had kept it safe with angelic care at all,</li>
            <li> It working okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;See if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m soooo glad</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have it on for more than 10 mins without feeling pain.</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it, I tried this just for kicks, but I am glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I got this more out of humor and curiosity...</li>
            <li> I love both</li>
            <li> it will work better..</li>
            <li> Ok you put this on your nose for awhile</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet, but then again, I can never stand to keep either one clamped on my nose for more than a couple of minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;only squeezing the tip cartridge, if you go more up where your nostrils and folds are, it will cause it to collapse and change shape,&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
            <li> You spend more on candy (stop complaining).</li>
            <li> Kind of cheap quality</li>
            <li> but it works okay on my nose</li>
            <li> its ok...</li>
            <li> Not???  :-)  </li>
            <li> mentioning----who are ALSO *satisfied* with the nose clip:  </li>
            <li> Now, to be truthful.  </li>
            <li> Even when I put paper on my nose to add a better grip it still slipped.</li>
            <li> Interesting gadget.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s an interesting gadget.</li>
            <li> that work ok.</li>
            <li> But when i keep looking at the picture of the instruction, it looks like we could adjust it, so after i adjust it it felt so much better.</li>
            <li> The nose right is kind of nice.</li>
            <li> Plastic is very cheap and easy to break.</li>
            <li> Pretty good feels like its working</li>
            <li> the blue is a perfect fit...</li>
            <li> the idea is fantastic, as for the product i am not so sure.</li>
            <li> Glad that this product is cheap because it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> /&gt; great people to do business with  and love the product!&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this to anyone that wants to change the apperance of your nose without having surgery it really works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I should just save up for a nose job now...  or try the original  called  nose  magic  from Japan.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the original size of my nose</li>
            <li> For $2 I was impressed it worked well but be very careful</li>
            <li> But still easy to fall.</li>
            <li> it works maybe， and it is nkt easy to break though，</li>
            <li> I like the product and it is easy to wear</li>
            <li> Easy to use, it works</li>
            <li> It slips off your nose to easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t set my expectations too high.  </li>
            <li> I liked it at first.</li>
            <li> The purple clip works absolutely fine for me.</li>
            <li> These two work fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purple one works fine</li>
            <li> Even if I try my best to put it on, i have to take it off after 1 min because its too tight and it start to hurting my nose.</li>
            <li> it is a really great deal to get both types for such a cheap price</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy wasting money and time then this will do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to use and</li>
            <li> cheap... doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap, so</li>
            <li> taller，anyway，it ia cheap</li>
            <li> I can still breathe comfortably.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with a wider nose it wont fit</li>
            <li> but these were cheap items to buy.</li>
            <li> * as IMPORTANT as the *PATIENCE* aspect regarding the nose clip and its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> I liked the products, but one thing really bugged me.</li>
            <li> its light</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works if you use it consistently to make your nose higher or narrower, but it&#x27;s a good tool to have and try if you&#x27;re determined.</li>
            <li> It actually feels kind of nice...</li>
            <li> Really hurt!!!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure it works fine too.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it I knew it probably wouldn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> and I can already see a significant difference in the width of my nose.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve notices a significant difference in size,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Especially when it kind of hurts!</li>
            <li> If used consistently, will not change the shape of the nose for more than an hour at a time.</li>
            <li> i was actually excited to purchase this item</li>
            <li> think about something we&#x27;re ALL familiar with:  BRACES (on teeth).  </li>
            <li> im satisfied so far!!!!</li>
            <li> its super cheap</li>
            <li> But on the bright side I could use the blue one to  close chip bags!</li>
            <li> After all it was a good price for two different nose clip.</li>
            <li> THATS COOL,</li>
            <li> I put it on and I couldn&#x27;t leave it on for more than 2-3 minutes because it was really hurting my nose:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying any of these things are good, but reshaping your body is possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying any of these things are good, but reshaping your body is possible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear them as often because I have glasses I plan on using them more when I get contacts.</li>
            <li> The blue clip fits better on my nose and is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> OKAY, HAVENT REALLY NOTICED A CHANGE</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything more that squeeze your nose and leave a mark on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman with a very nice bridge, I don&#x27;t see how these would stay on a flat bridge if they pop right off of my nose.</li>
            <li> The butterfly shaped one doesn&#x27;t seem strong as first</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try and worth the money!</li>
            <li> They are a little cheap (although very well-made for the price), and since this is a long-term commitment to a more beautiful nose, you&#x27;ll want to have backups for whenever your first pair breaks (shipping is from China?</li>
            <li> received it quickly and have used it a couple times..</li>
            <li> Buy the nose clip, and----***EVENTUALLY***-----you&#x27;ll be a HAPPY camper (with a CUTE, sexy, smaller, little nose)!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> Buy the nose clip, and----***EVENTUALLY***-----you&#x27;ll be a HAPPY camper (with a CUTE, sexy, smaller, little nose)!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why i bought them in the first place!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit very well at all</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to be part of the few people that saw great results but guess not.</li>
            <li> short of any kind of surgery</li>
            <li> but it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> but it is worth a try for this price.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth a try at this price to see if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> The blue one is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> for the price it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> but so far it seems to work like magic.</li>
            <li> also this item does  cause some pain  but its all worth it in the end</li>
            <li> Ok so let me make this clear:</li>
            <li> I have a friend whose nose became skinnier over the years because she wore glasses since elementary school.</li>
            <li> I have a friend whose nose became skinnier over the years because she wore glasses since elementary school.</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s just fun to do</li>
            <li> For $1 its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> It was nice to experiment with, but I do not know how it would actually work.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been having fun playing with them.</li>
            <li> These clamps are not a miracle cure, but they&#x27;re worth a shot for $2.</li>
            <li> NOTHING* worth</li>
            <li> I threw away the pink one since I heard it leaves bruises and all on the nose , but the blue one works great!</li>
            <li> useful if your clipping your nose to keep odors at bay.</li>
            <li> it is fun to buy</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, so not disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is not approved by doctor but nose right is....</li>
            <li> Left a nice slice making my nose with a new fabulous scar.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and cheap in general.  </li>
            <li> so i think its a decent item for cheap.</li>
            <li> Since then the changes seem to be more apparent and permanent.</li>
            <li> However, the instructions on the package are hilarious, as they barely make sense.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure if they work or if they just pin the nose right for a short while but isn&#x27;t the gift of confidence worth giving.</li>
            <li> Remember a long time ago in China, the cultural custom used to be for women to BIND their feet----in order to be more attractive to a mate or potential mate??</li>
            <li> You have to stay very disciplined and wear them as directed but definitely are effective.</li>
            <li> but good luck leaving it on for half an hour.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully for slight fixes and minor dorsal humps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> she doesn&#x27;t seem to use it very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just very gentle pressure</li>
            <li> This nose clip will NOT help you because you don&#x27;t have very much cartilage to shape.</li>
            <li> The blue is ok.</li>
            <li> first off, it hurts to wear it even for a medium amount of time.</li>
            <li> Works temporarily at first but over time I see results.</li>
            <li> it is okay and might work if used properly</li>
            <li> The blue one is okay, Im still using it, but i guess it works, cause I can see a difference, not drastic though.</li>
            <li> I saw changes immediately, but they were temporary at first.</li>
            <li> pink one, however, was already opened, so before I wear the pink one, I&#x27;m going to make sure I disinfect it really good.</li>
            <li> This is pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;Since it sent two, I gave my mom one.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY.</li>
            <li> 4 REAL DOG!</li>
            <li> Maybe works better on Asian noses?</li>
            <li> , it definitely would have become more distinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love that you can place the blue one anywhere</li>
            <li> I think it would be better if you could get different sizes.</li>
            <li> This is my first review to anything; however, I hope this review helps someone purchase this product</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, doing research, and considering the price I decided to finally purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Shipping took quite a whole, but for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of the pink straightening bridges from Chine before and really liked it.</li>
            <li> My nose is smaller now and shaped better.</li>
            <li> If you are considering plastic surgery or rhinoplasty, I recommend you to try this first.</li>
            <li> Even if there&#x27;s no difference at first keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is not expensive.</li>
            <li> (I had to buy two, the first one broke.)</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t help your nose get higher.</li>
            <li> As for this device actually working to mold a better nose I am uncertain of, but I will try it out and report my results.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well</li>
            <li> I was bummed about the 17-28 business days, but it came in more than a week earlier than the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> This thing really works!</li>
            <li> waste of money, might be good nose plugs?</li>
            <li> I had given them to my daughters and they snapped right in front of my very eyes.</li>
            <li> The tension should be loosened a little to make them more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Seriously don&#x27;t bother lol</li>
            <li> I like it so much and will looking for more in the future</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like your nose, you most likely need a surgical nose job -- which I&#x27;m going to be getting very soon.</li>
            <li> To those reviewers who stated all of the negatives about probably have noses that aren&#x27;t compatible with this device, which means your nose is most likely too big to fit into it.  </li>
            <li> This is an ok product but will give you a headache if you wear it too long on your nose.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I received them quickly</li>
            <li> The blue thing is so easy to put</li>
            <li> My nose isn&#x27;t large to begin with</li>
            <li> It does not work for certain nose shapes.it just kept sliping off my nose</li>
            <li> Broke very easily after using it twice, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I give it two stars because it didn&#x27;t do anything for me but it might have the potential to be better if I was a little more patient.</li>
            <li> The beauty clip is very brittle</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;ve already ordered it don&#x27;t worry, it makes an intense nose plug for the pool.</li>
            <li> Now I really like the nose up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these really help make your nose look taller</li>
            <li> The blue clip broke, cheaply made</li>
            <li> fast shipping, items received as described.</li>
            <li> This product functions and works very well.</li>
            <li> They both hurt way too much.</li>
            <li> but i dont know if it really works permanently.</li>
            <li> you get two items for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to see what the fuss was about, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to really reshape my schnozz.  </li>
            <li> DONT REALLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> i really like this</li>
            <li> Who wants a lego nose?</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel much pain at all.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect much..</li>
            <li> Works well but break fast.</li>
            <li> so much money, but it works&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li> really does work!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really works</li>
            <li> though if you really think it&#x27;s going to correct your nose</li>
            <li> Since i got it today i havent really taken time to try it out too much, so i do not know if it works yet.</li>
            <li> I wear it for 15-40 minutes a day, depending on how much time I have alone</li>
            <li> Too much pain, gave up.</li>
            <li> and I know see a difference so much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice too much change</li>
            <li> if you really want to change it go get rhinoplasty...</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> these were probably made very poorly,haha..)</li>
            <li> The pink one leaves marks on your nose and the purple one broke because the spring is so cheap!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really does anything.</li>
            <li> I can t really tell ???</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They pinched my nose too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a temporary &#x27;treatment&#x27; but it does work and lasts me the whole day if I put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li> I gave it a three because of the price, speed of delivery and they are REALLY sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an honest waste of money</li>
            <li> but it does it for a couple of seconds then back to original nose</li>
            <li> The pink one has less padding and seems to apply more pressure, so it hurts more.</li>
            <li> actual work is very good, but the pink plastic is waste lift, it is always like four weeks time to send two items, but it is still worth buying.</li>
            <li> but i was not gonna give it my full trust since it was only about $5</li>
            <li> The pink work well, but it break too easy.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I as I have gotten older, the bridge of my nose has gotten wider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a normal nose not picky or downsized or some sort of just normal straight nose</li>
            <li> the pink one i tried, leaves nice lego pattern on your nose but does not help to make it smaller</li>
            <li> You have to be realistic.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t particularly care for them.</li>
            <li> She has a flat Asian type nose with a little bridge, so the blue nose thing fit great and felt comfortable for her, but the pink one kept falling since the bridge of her nose wasn&#x27;t big.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend it👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a high rating because the seller delivered on time and everything was included.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that maybe this would work</li>
            <li> The pink hurt too much at first, but as my nose got smaller the pink got more comfortable.</li>
            <li> and I feel like these gave me a little more of a ski slope nose which I</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the pink little nosey, as I feel it is more useful than the blue device.</li>
            <li> The purple one slips off and the pink one does not even fit around my nose.</li>
            <li> The pink bridge straightening  didn&#x27;t fit on my nose shape</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works, but I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fun to have for this price, especially if you want to get an idea on how your nose would look thinner after a nose job.</li>
            <li> I thought it would eventually go away, and my nose would return to normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a hard squeeze...</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have a big nose and it has thinned my nose soooo much that i am constantly getting compliments on it, and the bridge straightening clip ( pink one)</li>
            <li> I could only wear it for about 10-15 min for the first few days, but have been able to wear it longer now(30 min-1hr).</li>
            <li> I think, so if they break and you don&#x27;t have a backup, you&#x27;ll lose a lot of progress by sitting around for a month waiting for the new ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> so I decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li> After using the product for 30 mins, you will notice that once you remove the shapers that your nose will hold the form for a good 30 mins to an hour before cartilage and lymphatic fluid re-positions itself back and your previous shape of your nose returns.</li>
            <li> wear it over night and FYI, it comes off pretty easy when you&#x27;re sleeping, so you might have a hard time looking for it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Very surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t fall apart or anything (which I&#x27;m very surprised about considering</li>
            <li> The blue one is ok for my nose, but it seems like you should use the pink one first than the blue one.</li>
            <li> I wore it on the slightly bulbous end of my nose for about 45 mins and when I took it off, the end of my nose stayed slimmed down for a good while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I kept the pink one, it fits nicely with my taller and bigger Asian nose.</li>
            <li> Along with facial excersizes, my nose is a lot more toned, but proper lymphatic massage and yoga to tone your face is necessary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not a small nose.</li>
            <li> Also, some people may not be aware of this, but some african diaspora people &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; their baby&#x27;s nose</li>

            <li> I used the blue clip first to straighten the nose bridge.</li>
            <li> The only person winning at this game is the person who probably runs a sweatshop in order to mass produce these things for cheap.</li>
            <li> Never has a product been so low in quality that it bent and misshaped on the first use.</li>
            <li> your nose will look smaller right after you unclip it, and red but will get back to normal size after, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently, but depending on your nose shape and condition it might give you a hint of sculpting result.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty flat nose</li>
            <li> I have been using the blue one only for less than a month, and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT LEFT LARGE PERMANENT DENTS IN NOSE.</li>
            <li> Unable to go back to China to buy one, I found one on Amazon and was very pleased!</li>
            <li> so to clear everything up.</li>
            <li> The pink thing doesn&#x27;t even fit unless you have a tiny button nose</li>
            <li> and i can clearly see the difference.</li>
            <li> The purple is way better than the pink one, the pink one just crashes your noise</li>
            <li> I wear the clip daily for about 15 mins in the morning while getting ready for work</li>
            <li> I much prefer the blue one.</li>
            <li> I bought two and so far</li>
            <li> I bought two and so far</li>
            <li> but so far both of the clips work,</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone who are conscious about their nose.</li>
            <li> They come from so far</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference, but that&#x27;s only because I haven&#x27;t been keeping up with it like every day....</li>
            <li> I know I don&#x27;t have the same nose as everyone else, but the pink nose clip fits perfectly on my nose and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all to be frank  </li>
            <li> the purple one especially, just instantly threw it away, not even worth the plastic</li>
            <li> The pink one broke super easily and the blue one is kind of painful</li>
            <li> It is an okay item, I am still using the nose lifting shaping (blue) but the pink one is so tight that it broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are complaining that it hurts, it&#x27;s most likely because you have very little cartilage on the bridge of your nose and the clip is pressing against the bone.</li>
            <li> The clear rubbery plastic on the pink nose clip hurts my nose, so instead, i took the clear plastic off and placed the blue nose shaping thing on top of the pink clip.</li>
            <li> I think it would not really make your nose bridge higher completely</li>
            <li> it in the same places every time, if you often move it to different spots higher or lower there&#x27;s no progress being made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I thought it was working as my nose seems smaller, but the blue piece broke after 3 months, although the pink piece is still going strong.</li>
            <li> The pink straightening bridge was in a package identical to my previous one, and I was pleasantly surprised that the knobby white part of the straightening clip was a nice reddish-pink color instead, since my old one was white</li>
            <li> Also for the pink one, the instruction really need to be translated into english, because in the beginning when i was wearing it, it hurted my nose so much.</li>
            <li> It hurt at first as it softened up my cartilage, but after the first few days, it was relatively painless.</li>
            <li> And when you take them off, your nose goes back to normal.</li>
            <li> And remember, for hundreds of years, Chinese women bandaged their feet to make them smaller, and certain indigenous tribes use wedges and rings to make their necks longer.</li>

            <li> If this product was not so cheap I would be more incline to anger than I am now.</li>
            <li> If you want a smaller nose, your only real option is rhinoplasty.  </li>
            <li> People often buy these items because they are cheap and they think what the hey, it&#x27;s only a few bucks.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really work for me just left my nose red</li>
            <li> Many of the negative reviews were due to high expectations, lack of patients, and improper use.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s working since I got this only about 3 days ago, but it was cheap and it never hurts to try.</li>
            <li> I enjoy breathing out of my nose and the pinching is pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These shaping clips are clearly for someone with a smaller nose.</li>
            <li> I just barely opened it too.</li>
            <li> So I barely got it today</li>
            <li> I could barely keep it on for 15 minutes, but I managed.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> , I felt my nose looked slimmer, but not significantly, be careful when you place the clip, that</li>
            <li> The pink clip really hurts, I guess i have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> it is uncomfortable at first but the results are real if you are consistent with wearing it.</li>
            <li> the items were ok,though it may take like forever for my nose to improve coz unlike surgery,it&#x27;s actually exercising the nose,but it will just go back to its normal look once you stop using the item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a major perfectionist and height critical and this the little clips are worth a shot</li>
            <li> The pink was a tight fit for me</li>
            <li> Actually, the blue one is ok, but not good as I bought it before.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The  pink one hurts so much but the blue one doesnt</li>
            <li> and my friends said, which seems to be more thin, blue clamp</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind pain if it will benefit me but these not only hurt, they barely stay on.</li>
            <li> The Blue Nose Clip just barely fits.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was actually surprised by how small the pink nose clip was, and that the reviews of it were partially true.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t  really say if its working but the pink one hurts so bad can&#x27;t use it blue ones good</li>
            <li> Since I ordered it new, I expected it to be in a sealed package for safety.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just be clear that it takes a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just be clear that it takes a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic on my old one was starting to feel loose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty tide, but it&#x27;s little bit hurt when you use it for long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s short and flat against your face.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t handle using this long enough to test whether it actually made a difference or not.</li>
            <li> But after a few days it went back to normal...</li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that the instructions are all in chinese, and anything written in english is in such BROKEN english that it makes you laugh...</li>
            <li> The instructions that are included are pretty hard to understand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the blue piece, but the pink piece is the real deal!</li>
            <li> but I can see that the results will come from long term use, consistency and proper positioning.</li>
            <li> but I can see that the results will come from long term use, consistency and proper positioning.</li>
            <li> These clamps are not going to change the shape of your nose, or create a long lasting effect, but they might work if you want your nose to look a teensy bit slimmer/straighter for a photo.</li>
            <li> I am an african american female with a wide nose.</li>
            <li> you tied your fingers together EVERY DAY for a long time, , , your fingers would change too and become a different, deformed shape.&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY,</li>
            <li> , however I could see them working if I could stand the pain and leave them on long enough for them to work.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> then your nose goes back to in its regular shape almost like how dough slowly falls after you roll it in a ball haha</li>
            <li> This device works only with wide tip only.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge nose just a small dorsal hump and a little wide nose.</li>
            <li> As far as people saying there&#x27;s no way to change the shape of your nose, that is NOT true.</li>
            <li> As far as people saying there&#x27;s no way to change the shape of your nose, that is NOT true.</li>
            <li> Afterwords I felt like my nose was bigger, IDK if it&#x27;s because I read the other reviews and it was a placebo affect, or if it actually happened.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews say that the nose up(pink clip) hurts bad, but honestly for me</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s crazy to me of having provoked more defined nose</li>
            <li> , i actually lost the pink one &amp;#34;/</li>
            <li> even if you wore it often, it&#x27;d take a long a time for the nose cartilage to adjust.</li>
            <li> My problem is having the patience to keep them on for as long as I need to.</li>
            <li> The blue ones work as described but all the pink ones broke within a week.</li>
            <li> Strange item.</li>
            <li> Also, DO NOT use these for too long at a time.</li>
            <li> from the side view my nose is long.</li>
            <li> but because I&#x27;m just pinching the bridge with the clip, my nostrils are completely unaffected.</li>
            <li> For those who are saying they can&#x27;t breathe, it&#x27;s probably because your nose isn&#x27;t long</li>
            <li> Your nose is probably too short and wide and the clip doesn&#x27;t have anything to hold on to.</li>
            <li> I only used the blue one and it does not fit on big noses</li>
            <li> All those marks everyone is talking about is literally nothing, its like those marks your skin would get after laying on an object or something with texture for too long, doesnt seem permanent.</li>
            <li> well I have not been using it that long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any results but haven&#x27;t been using it for that long yet.</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS you are FAITHFUL with your usage of the nose clip.  </li>
            <li> AND, braces are on for a LONG TIME too,  </li>
            <li> I just got this product today, which is about two or three weeks earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> My nose fits my face but it long, hooked at the end</li>
            <li> If you wear it too long it will cause bruising.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s weird, it looked like my nose was smaller RIGHT after using the clip, but then it got bigger and wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hurts, it is impossible to have it on your nose for more than 1 minute, besides if you use it, it does not let you breath properly.</li>
            <li> I bought this nose clip and the delivery was fast, but I only used once cos they are very hard and it hurts my nose too</li>
            <li> It is a little uncomfortable, but so is surgery :-)</li>
            <li> Other people already have told me I look different as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say it has returned to its original shape and size now that I have stopped.</li>
            <li> Nose SURGERY---on the other hand---is several thousand dollars.  </li>
            <li> My nose was very wide and I am only 13 and don&#x27;t want plastic surgery or rhinoplasty.</li>
            <li> It hurts and you have to breath through mouth which becomes dry.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price if the pink ones hadn&#x27;t broken</li>
            <li> it on the next day, stretched it and snap, it broke in half.  </li>
            <li> Too small for adult.</li>
            <li> only gave it three stars because its the average of 5 and 1... 5 for the purple  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very patient with having something on my face for that long.</li>
            <li> After the first use it looked like my nose got worse and became a bit droopier</li>
            <li> It helps but I only have a minor issue with my nose (that is is small and photographs flat).</li>
            <li> My nose is not very large.</li>
            <li> On the second try it snapped in half.</li>
            <li> your desired shape is achieved, you only need to use one of these maybe 2-3 times a week for about a half hour for maintenance.</li>
            <li> ex broke my nose awhile back, it gave me a slight hump.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have been using the blue clip for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> As for me, as previously stated, it fits well on my nose, and no, I&#x27;m not Asian.  </li>
            <li> The Pink Nose Clip is far too small for anyone.</li>
            <li> This actually managed to mess up my nose cartilage</li>
            <li> In fact it doesn&#x27;t squeeze tight enough.</li>
            <li> she says that it doesn&#x27;t hold tight enough.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing but the blue nose piece was much more easier to use.</li>
            <li> Took a little white to arrive, what do you expect....</li>
            <li> when I opened it, I found it was too loose on my nose!</li>
            <li> The pink clip is more painful.</li>
            <li> but you can see a change not sure how long the results last.</li>
            <li> I applied the pink one on my nose bridge and believe it or not saw signs of change in just one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pink one doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I put it on once and the plastic started getting wide.</li>
            <li> It arrived faster then I expected.</li>
            <li> The blue one works for me - noticed a difference after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Eh.. Not what I expected to be...</li>
            <li> it does work, but you definitely need to wear it everyday to see results.</li>
            <li> I used the pink one, every day, for three days and it ended up bruising my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this everyday since August 5, noticed a change about 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li> I used it for 30 minutes and when trying to place the pink one, it broke.</li>
            <li> I think I had 4 pink ones in all.  </li>
            <li> The pink one can leave temporary indents, but on me they did seem to go away.</li>
            <li> I have been using the blue one for quite a few days</li>
            <li> REALLY USEFUL, MADE ALL WRONG.</li>
            <li> The pink one hurts a lot</li>
            <li> The biggest issue for me is the pink clip.</li>
            <li> The pink piece is trash because of the circular ridges.</li>
            <li> and I dont even see how the pink one could</li>
            <li> i was not at all careful with these</li>
            <li> but the pink thing...</li>
            <li> and if i could, none for the pink.</li>
            <li> it really does help with some straightening issues i had from having a broken nose.</li>
            <li> kept slipping off nose.</li>
            <li> I received two of the pink nose bridges.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product for people who have wide noses</li>
            <li> it do what it is expected</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the pink part which I think straightens the nose...  </li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me, kept slipping off my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So now my nose is permanently uneven and I lost ten dollars</li>
            <li> it it kept slipping off</li>
            <li> Have been using for a month and still no change and it hurts when left on for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> The purple one is not comfortable, slides of the nose constantly.</li>
            <li> I didnt like the pink thing it hurt</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might damage your cartilage so be careful.</li>
            <li> and wide.</li>
            <li> The pink one?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even put on the pink one</li>
            <li> It might just be because I am used to a very tight clip like the pink one, but I did not really like how loose the blue clip was.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> the pink one really works just a little painful at first and leaves marks</li>
            <li> This is mean for people with small noses, so if you have a big nose, steer clear.</li>
            <li> It is subtle so far, but it IS working.</li>
            <li> It was slight, but over the next few months (had I continued using it)</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it actually works</li>
            <li> I have brought other other nose products and they did not work for me.</li>
            <li> device is NOT for people with big noses trying to achieve a small nose.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I seller never the other piece that was suppose to come with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other reviewers saying it had a point.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;m using them properly.</li>
            <li> I usually wear the clip for 30 minutes and then allow my nose to rest and wear it later in the day.</li>
            <li> In other words, this product *DID* work for me----and *CONTINUES* to work.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the past two months and my nose tip still the same.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is though, pinks a bit tight but it hasn&#x27;t snapped or left dents in my nose like other reviews, however the blue has trouble staying on</li>
            <li> The hard plastic diggs into the side of my nostril.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way I can use this product; this is a complete waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the two pink nose pieces broke instantly (plus they hurt when you put them on, pinched too hard)</li>
            <li> and I was always afraid of tearing the white pads off if I forced it too much (never happened, but seems likely over time).</li>
            <li> pink one was much to tight for the average nose.</li>
            <li> the pink one hurts a little but after a while</li>
            <li> , I think I pressed it in the wrong place at first as I didn&#x27;t have any directions on where to apply it, so I narrowed the breathing path a little.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always been a little uncomfortable with my nose, especially because I broke it when I was about 16 years old.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try for fun....but is not worth it...</li>
            <li> not worth 1 penny.</li>
            <li> This is so not worth even .2 cents.</li>
            <li> I have trouble using the pink one</li>
            <li> The pink one did not fit well</li>
            <li> the blue one ALWAYS slowly, eases off of my nose.</li>
            <li> The pink little nose squeezer was extremely tight to the point</li>
            <li> I have the option to slim my nose down without surgery though.</li>
            <li> I can tell that one fits a little tighter than the other.</li>
            <li> I can tell that one fits a little tighter than the other.</li>
            <li> Eh, I&#x27;m giving this a 3 due to the missing parts.</li>
            <li> It really works but is a little bit uncomfortable</li>
            <li> As for it being tight, uncomfortable, and too small actually wear is completely untrue for me.  </li>
            <li> I wanted slight slimming, so I thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li> I used each one every day for about a half hour each, one for the morning and one for the evening.</li>
            <li> They said my nose looked less wider</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the springs which might vary slightly between each clip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the springs which might vary slightly between each clip.</li>
            <li> All in all, I believe it made my nose thinner and possibly slightly longer with the way I had used it.</li>
            <li> This slightly irked me, but since it does nothing and did not affect the usage of the product, I let it slide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering it again because I lost the one I previously ordered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work or at least not if you do not wear it on a regular basis (everyday for 15 minutes).</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, I can see my nose is slightly taller.</li>
            <li> I have not used this much, I have had it for a while, but it is very painful, and that&#x27;s why I have not used it much</li>
            <li> but the workman ship was not good and the product was sub standard.</li>
            <li> So lets narrow down the factors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its really tight</li>
            <li> SCRATCHY, HARSH PINCHING, ODD ANGLE, NOT</li>
            <li> The nose up it did makes it goes up a little but takes times</li>
            <li> And the plastic does not seem fragile or weak</li>
            <li> so how could this little product fix my nose.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waster your time and money on this little thing.</li>
            <li> it actually work, but very slowly..</li>
            <li> The blue think was so uncomfortable, and it broke, the pink thing just didn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably write a review in a few months and see if there&#x27;s progress.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money for nothing.</li>
            <li> I know this seems &#x27;gimmicky&#x27;...</li>
            <li> I bought it out of curiosity, it was like a dollar, but still wasted money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference immediately and a few hours after</li>
            <li> Will do an update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money ppl even if its a dollar</li>
            <li> They went away after a few days of not wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine is round around the tip</li>
            <li> Her nose isn&#x27;t thin, but it has a shape that no one else in her family has because her mother did that to her only.</li>
            <li> Her nose isn&#x27;t thin, but it has a shape that no one else in her family has because her mother did that to her only.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money in my life.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked my nose, but plastic surgery has never been an option.</li>
            <li> Waste my money</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestions: You have to continuously use it everyday over 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s slightly uneven now.</li>
            <li> after a few days of wearing this, I ended up getting sinus infection.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday, about 1 hour each time.</li>
            <li> The nose clip is a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> Well I gave up for few months until I met my friend that i didnt see for over one year who asked  me if i had nose surgery.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> I have lost a pink one almost immediately, so can&#x27;t rate, but at least it sat on the nose easier.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing a slight result !</li>
            <li> and my bump is very slight</li>
            <li> little small.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m SORRY for all you who want a &amp;#34;QUICK FIX&amp;#34;; the nose clip is not a quick fix!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a  *similar*  process is involved here with the &amp;#34;nose clips&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Waist training with tight corsets has created some of the tiniest waists in the world!</li>
            <li> Waist training with tight corsets has created some of the tiniest waists in the world!</li>
            <li> But one of the little knobs on the outside, however was broken!</li>
            <li> This is a copy of the Nose Right, feel like i got ripped off :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least slightly.</li>
            <li> At least slightly.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t mind a little (bareable) pain (don&#x27;t be babies now!)  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on something that WILL NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so stupid that, when you&#x27;ll put it on you will laugh at yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to use this product.</li>
            <li> When I used each one every day for about 45 mins-1hr, I ended up getting small scabs on the sides of my nose where the Nose Up sits.</li>
            <li> however they do make a small difference on my nose.</li>
            <li> If you use this it will feel weird to swallow and your ears will pop occasionally.</li>
            <li> for small adjustments</li>
            <li> My nose was broken years ago was never reset ( not very noticeable though)</li>
            <li> but it is possible to put on but its quite difficult.</li>
            <li> :/ I&#x27;ve been using for 4 days.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to use it on the upper part where be bone</li>
            <li> Seems useless to send back and wait for another one</li>
            <li> I bought these after getting obsessed with how big my nose is on my face.</li>
            <li> The bridge straighnening was not able to stay on my nose</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too small.</li>
            <li> i prefer using the pink one as it&#x27;s not as painful as the blue clip.</li>
            <li> but  I have tried to sleep with this thing on and it is just hard...</li>
            <li> the inside, which makes it hard to breathe</li>
            <li> so I had a hard time</li>
            <li> Hard to clip on</li>
            <li> BUT THIS LITTLE BABY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> Both of these items were shoddy.  </li>
            <li> i think the pink one is useless as for the purple</li>
            <li> pink one is worse!</li>
            <li> If you dedicate at least 15 minutes each night for about 2- 4 weeks you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li> The product does not own up to its expectations and it arrived a month late.</li>
            <li> The pink one is useless unless you have a tiiiny nose</li>
            <li> I try to wear at least 30 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> But again,  I have been----sometimes painfully-----wearing the nose clip EVERY night for at least 15 minutes (regardless of the time it advised me),  </li>
            <li> but alas, money wasted.</li>
            <li> But the work SLOWLY by, eventually, changing the position of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not only one of them were broken abut also these are very poor quality products.</li>
            <li> stupid - did just what they said with no results other than larger pores on my nose from the pressure</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly small that I can&#x27;t breath through it!</li>
            <li> and I already see a small difference!</li>
            <li> And although using these products isn&#x27;t downright painful, it IS uncomfortable (especially the pink one).</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s not :(</li>
            <li> and she has a very small nose</li>
            <li> I seriously did not gave time to wait.</li>
            <li> seriously, it looks like my nose went up a size.</li>
            <li> thing you have to keep in mind when purchasing this is that it is a long and tedious process!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with a bit of hesitation because of all the bad reviews such as &amp;#34;it messed up my nose&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it broke&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;ll just take forever for such a small stupid thing</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste time with fake 5 star reviews, this doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> There is no way one could possibly sleep with this thing on, way too painful.</li>
            <li> it was just not good.</li>
            <li> After wearing it for at least 5 minutes, your nose starts to numb a little, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> you plan on buying these, buy at least 2 sets!</li>
            <li> Therefore, I have plenty of useless meatiness on the bridge of my nose that has very few nerves</li>
            <li> I mean it!</li>
            <li> the pink one hurts like hell, they both leave bad marks on your nose.</li>
            <li> The pink one works but its painful and leaves marks from were it was at.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s irritating so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> probably worse than you started off with.</li>
            <li> the product is difficult to use -- very uncomfortable and not really worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> A bit annoying when you are trying to breath with it on especially in a very dry room.</li>
            <li> It pinches a little, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> You get a thin looking nose from the beginning (when it&#x27;s on) and you get a weird shaped nose from the side.</li>
            <li> Silly poor construction didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Both clips are poorly packaged with useless instructions, so I had to look online.</li>
            <li> I would not advise buying a product useless</li>
            <li> Be wary that this may not work on all nose types though.</li>
            <li> sorry..</li>
            <li> It slides off and is useless.</li>
            <li> but sadly I give it three stars.</li>
            <li> and if you catch the skin wrong it cuts you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless</li>
            <li> The pink one is impossible to use!!!</li>
            <li> Unless your nose is extremely wide you have no need for this awful product.</li>
            <li> This product is stupid and has no real purpose but to make you feel just as stupid as the product itself.  </li>
            <li> useless, painful products, they were purchased on a whim.</li>
            <li> Is uncomfortable and even painful.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable  to wear, you  have to numb your nose to use this product.</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable and noticed no change</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> i just think its alot of pressure, its not too bad.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t get it and deal with your ugly nose or get rhinoplasty.</li>
            <li> if you want to go ahead do it, but it&#x27;s a bit painful.</li>
            <li> painful but worked</li>
            <li> it works, too painful and kept sliding off my nose,</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Looks dirty, and when you use it, would feel hurt!</li>
            <li> Just get a job and work for a nose job if you&#x27;re very unhappy with your nose.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t slide around which is very inconvenient).</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy</li>
            <li> CORRECTING WHAT THIS STUPID $1.50 PRODUCT HAS DONE.</li>
            <li> its just stupid to put on.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> and I got to say I hate the nose</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> I hate the fact taht</li>
            <li> Another piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> So take the money you were going to spend on this worthless piece of plastic and put it in your &amp;#34;nose job fund&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable and does not work!  </li>
            <li> it hurts so bad!</li>
            <li> Both are very bad products.</li>
            <li> Is also very painful.</li>
            <li> Very painful to wear , I don&#x27;t recommend it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really awful</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>
            <li> I had an awful headache after using these.  </li>
            <li> Horrible won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s putting that into your nose profile, making it look horrible and</li>
            <li> These are the worst things on the market!</li>
            <li> Terrible, just utterly terrible.</li>
            <li> JUST TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It seems to be working. I wear the clip daily for about 15 mins in the morning while getting ready for work and I LUV THE RESULTS!</li>
            <li> It does work kinda but i think my nose goes back to its regular shape after i take it off, i actually lost the pink one &amp;#34;/ so idk how effective that one is but the blue was ehhh...</li>
            <li> I liked it at first. I applied the pink one on my nose bridge and believe it or not saw signs of change in just one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it on the next day, stretched it and snap, it broke in half.  For $2 I was impressed it worked well but be very careful so it doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the nose up lifting and bridge straightening a while back now. I was surprised that I received them quickly that it said but they were used. Disappointed</li>
            <li> useless, painful products, they were purchased on a whim. short of any kind of surgery I doubt any sort of items like these could assist any sort of reshaping.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work, just leaves a dent which goes away in 2 minutes. No results.</li>
            <li> It took a month I received it. It comes with two type. The size is pretty small. But I brought these for my nine month daughter to build up a good shape nose. The pink one doesn&#x27;t work at all. Can&#x27;t even put on the baby nose. The blue is ok. But still easy to fall. If you buy this for yourself, think about it again. Too small for adult.</li>
            <li> The nose right is kind of nice. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. In fact it doesn&#x27;t squeeze tight enough. The beauty clip is very brittle I put it on once and the plastic started getting wide. On the second try it snapped in half. I just barely opened it too.</li>
            <li> hi&lt;br /&gt; great people to do business with  and love the product!&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this to anyone that wants to change the apperance of your nose without having surgery it really works!</li>
            <li> Great product really works.  Honest seller.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty flat nose so I bought this product, it comes with the two different clips. I like the good price, and found both very strong clips. The butterfly shaped one doesn&#x27;t seem strong as first but after you have it on for awhile you feel the pressure on your nostrils. You can adjust the pads but I didn&#x27;t bother to. I don&#x27;t know if it works if you use it consistently to make your nose higher or narrower, but it&#x27;s a good tool to have and try if you&#x27;re determined.</li>
            <li> the items were ok,though it may take like forever for my nose to improve coz unlike surgery,it&#x27;s actually exercising the nose,but it will just go back to its normal look once you stop using the item</li>
            <li> Both of these items were shoddy.  For the price, I guess I cannot complain. The pink little nose squeezer was extremely tight to the point I couldn&#x27;t even wear it for more than a minute. The blue nasal squeezer broke after the second attempt to use. The spring broke.  Products were delivered under the estimated amount of time.</li>
            <li> Looooove this product!! I have been using the blue one only for less than a month, and it is amazing. It does not make a big change but it does make change. I&#x27;m very glad with the result and I will continue using it. I would highly recomend it👍</li>
            <li> dont&#x27; get it. i bought it even though i read the reviews because i thought they were just whiny but alas, money wasted. first off, it hurts to wear it even for a medium amount of time. even if you wore it often, it&#x27;d take a long a time for the nose cartilage to adjust. just don&#x27;t get it and deal with your ugly nose or get rhinoplasty. i threw these away after a week.</li>
            <li> Works temporarily at first but over time I see results.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy wasting money and time then this will do. It does nothing, let&#x27;s admit that it&#x27;s just a gimmick. Accept it. I will say that it made me question my own intelligence for even thinking it had any possibility of working. But if you&#x27;ve already ordered it don&#x27;t worry, it makes an intense nose plug for the pool.</li>
            <li> So I barely got it today and I got to say I hate the nose huggie it hurts so bad! A lot of reviews say that the nose up(pink clip) hurts bad, but honestly for me it&#x27;s the nose huggie. I could barely keep it on for 15 minutes, but I managed. Now I really like the nose up it seems like it works better and it&#x27;s painless (for me atleast) I&#x27;ll probably write a review in a few months and see if there&#x27;s progress.</li>
            <li> This product shouldn&#x27;t be on the market.</li>
            <li> Who knows if this product will actually work. When I ordered it I knew it probably wouldn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s worth a try! I&#x27;m giving it a high rating because the seller delivered on time and everything was included. I feel like you must wear this device for an hour every day to see results. It was only a couple of dollars so why not give it a try! It&#x27;s comfortable to use and something I&#x27;ve always wanted to try. I&#x27;ll keep you updated in a month and let everyone know if it worked or not!</li>
            <li> It arrived faster then I expected. I don&#x27;t know if these really help make your nose look taller but it is worth a try. After all it was a good price for two different nose clip. I think it would not really make your nose bridge higher completely but it does it for a couple of seconds then back to original nose, maybe you have to clip it longer but it kind of hurts after a while. I don&#x27;t think this product works but it is worth a try for this price.</li>
            <li> Great value. Glad I ordered them. The blue one works for me - noticed a difference after just a few uses. It is subtle so far, but it IS working. The pink was a tight fit for me so I haven&#x27;t used it - yet. I think both have their place. I think it is worth a try at this price to see if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> Eh.. Not what I expected to be... I wasted my money for nothing. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all. -.-</li>
            <li> I would not advise buying a product useless</li>
            <li> The blue clip broke, cheaply made</li>
            <li> No package for the pieces</li>
            <li> It straightened my penis. My wife has given me many compliments. It no longer looks like a saggy question mark.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom she doesn&#x27;t seem to use it very much she says that it doesn&#x27;t hold tight enough. I guess I bought it more like a gag gift.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even receive it yet. it&#x27;s been a month ...this is a scam ... Don&#x27;t buy ... rate 0/5 don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> It works! A bit annoying when you are trying to breath with it on especially in a very dry room.</li>
            <li> cheap... doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> the idea is fantastic, as for the product i am not so sure. received it quickly and have used it a couple times.. i think the pink one is useless as for the purple it is okay and might work if used properly</li>
            <li> The pink one is impossible to use!!! Even if I try my best to put it on, i have to take it off after 1 min because its too tight and it start to hurting my nose. The blue one is okay, Im still using it, but i guess it works, cause I can see a difference, not drastic though.</li>
            <li> I got this item faster that estimated time, which is very good deal, I am happy with it, it&#x27;s acceptable materials presented. I like it so much and will looking for more in the future</li>
            <li> fast shipping, items received as described. I&#x27;ve used this now for two weeks and it works. I saw changes immediately, but they were temporary at first. The blue one is more comfortable.I could only wear it for about 10-15 min for the first few days, but have been able to wear it longer now(30 min-1hr). Since then the changes seem to be more apparent and permanent. I believe as I continue to use it, the changes will be permanent. The pink one has less padding and seems to apply more pressure, so it hurts more. it does work, but you definitely need to wear it everyday to see results. It is a little uncomfortable, but so is surgery :-)</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it actually works but I use it to prevent myself from smelling anything gross! My nose feels slightly different after usage, my cartilage is shifting.</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail and have been wearing the blue one for 20 minutes or so. It hurts, but it&#x27;s something I can get used to. I believe it can work to an extent, but in order for results to be permanent, I&#x27;ll have to wear it several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink one, however, was already opened, so before I wear the pink one, I&#x27;m going to make sure I disinfect it really good. Was anyone else&#x27;s open? Since I ordered it new, I expected it to be in a sealed package for safety. Oh well, I guess. I can always clean it really good.</li>
            <li> reallyworks I sometimes use them together</li>
            <li> This product functions and works very well.</li>
            <li> I know this seems &#x27;gimmicky&#x27;... But it&#x27;s a GREAT product! I noticed that I as I have gotten older, the bridge of my nose has gotten wider. It was visible in pictures... To me. I started contouring with contouring powder which helped, but by the end of the day it had worn off... BUT THIS LITTLE BABY WORKS!! I use the purple one, my mom likes the red one. I just place on the area that bothers me and leave it in for maybe 5 minutes and it&#x27;s like it simply realigns the cartridge that tends to move as we age. It&#x27;s not a hard squeeze... It&#x27;s just very gentle pressure and it&#x27;s passed. I truly thought II was wasting my money, and am happy to say, IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> This is pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;Since it sent two, I gave my mom one. She has a flat Asian type nose with a little bridge, so the blue nose thing fit great and felt comfortable for her, but the pink one kept falling since the bridge of her nose wasn&#x27;t big.&lt;br /&gt;I kept the pink one, it fits nicely with my taller and bigger Asian nose. After wearing it for at least 5 minutes, your nose starts to numb a little, but I don&#x27;t mind. And when you take it off, you&#x27;ve got red circles on your nose and it looks tiny for 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it over night and FYI, it comes off pretty easy when you&#x27;re sleeping, so you might have a hard time looking for it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working since I got this only about 3 days ago, but it was cheap and it never hurts to try.</li>
            <li> They both hurt way too much.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try for fun....but is not worth it...it&#x27;s cheap, so if you want to go ahead do it, but it&#x27;s a bit painful.</li>
            <li> waste of money, might be good nose plugs?</li>
            <li> Friends do notice difference too. I am satisfied. You have to stay very disciplined and wear them as directed but definitely are effective.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t buy it.It&#x27;s really awful</li>
            <li> I can see how these would actually work over time. My problem is having the patience to keep them on for as long as I need to. You could sleep with it on, but you might snore! :) They aren&#x27;t uncomfortable to wear, it&#x27;s just getting used to breathing differently while you wear it.</li>
            <li> dislike, it does not work. it does not stay on your nose, it keeps falling off of the nose. it hurts too</li>
            <li> The blue think was so uncomfortable, and it broke, the pink thing just didn&#x27;t stay put. I bought it out of curiosity, it was like a dollar, but still wasted money. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> This product hurts and swells nasal tissue.I wanted slight slimming, so I thought I&#x27;d try this. Waste of money. My nose is not bent, crooked or deformed. Glad that this product is cheap because it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I used the pink one, every day, for three days and it ended up bruising my nose. So, I stopped using it. The purple one is okay, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> It hurts and you have to breath through mouth which becomes dry.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference immediately and a few hours after but i dont know if it really works permanently. for the price it is worth a try. and perhaps my arch is getting better.</li>
            <li> I used the  purple  one.  As I used it for 15  minutes a  day  it seemed to have gotten smaller..... just alittle. I stopped  using it  and now looking at photos of before I started using it  and after  it is much bigger! I don&#x27;t know if I should just save up for a nose job now...  or try the original  called  nose  magic  from Japan.</li>
            <li> Only gave it four stars because I just received it but so far it seems to work like magic. Even if it&#x27;s temporary I can definitely see the difference in just a couple minutes use. It does hurt but it&#x27;s not so bad. Will do an update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste time with fake 5 star reviews, this doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to use this product. Before I managed to use it, the item broke.</li>
            <li> painful but worked n u know what they say pain is beauty</li>
            <li> Yeah, don&#x27;t know what I was thinking.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with a bit of hesitation because of all the bad reviews such as &amp;#34;it messed up my nose&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it broke&amp;#34;. Honestly, I have a big nose and it has thinned my nose soooo much that i am constantly getting compliments on it, and the bridge straightening clip ( pink one) i have not tried because i gave it to my best friend but i look forward to using it because it has given my bestfriends nose alittle lift.</li>
            <li> Does work. May be the placebo affect but I do feel better about my nose. Hurts a lot to wear, and I can&#x27;t wear for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li> Received it fast.looks nice</li>
            <li> Not only one of them were broken abut also these are very poor quality products. I would never buy these.</li>
            <li> It hurts, it is impossible to have it on your nose for more than 1 minute, besides if you use it, it does not let you breath properly.</li>
            <li> stupid - did just what they said with no results other than larger pores on my nose from the pressure</li>
            <li> Actually, the blue one is ok, but not good as I bought it before.&lt;br /&gt;This pink one is worse! I hate it! Looks dirty, and when you use it, would feel hurt! Really hurt!!!</li>
            <li> I like that you get two items for such a cheap price. I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d work, but with time I saw a difference in the shape of my nose. I first found out about this item on YouTube and saw a lady that had great results. I ordered it immediately, it took over 2 weeks for shipping. I used the beauty clip for 30 minutes and the straightening bridge for 15, it hurts so thats what I can stand. I&#x27;ve done this everyday since August 5, noticed a change about 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li> I though you can breathe with it, but no!!!</li>
            <li> I hate it.. wish I could get my money back butt I can&#x27;t thru it in the trash don&#x27;t waste your time or money ppl even if its a dollar</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable and noticed no change</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far but you can see a change not sure how long the results last.</li>
            <li> I used it for 30 minutes and when trying to place the pink one, it broke. Afterwords I felt like my nose was bigger, IDK if it&#x27;s because I read the other reviews and it was a placebo affect, or if it actually happened. But after a few days it went back to normal...I think...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just not worth 1 penny.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! THIS PRODUCT LEFT LARGE PERMANENT DENTS IN NOSE. I&#x27;M GOING TO HAVE T SPEND $7, 000.00 CORRECTING WHAT THIS STUPID $1.50 PRODUCT HAS DONE. MY NOSE HAS CAVED IN ON THE INSIDE AND OUT.</li>
            <li> It took forever. I seriously did not gave time to wait. Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;ll just take forever for such a small stupid thing</li>
            <li> I like the purple clip. It slims the nose and feels like an actual massage. The pink clip is more painful. My purple clip broke after a month of as directed use. I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> Got my order in a timely manner. The blue ones work as described but all the pink ones broke within a week. I think I had 4 pink ones in all.  The blues ones are good</li>
            <li> The pink one can leave temporary indents, but on me they did seem to go away. I have been using the blue one for quite a few days and I can already see a significant difference in the width of my nose. it is a really great deal to get both types for such a cheap price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so stupid that, when you&#x27;ll put it on you will laugh at yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so to clear everything up. I&#x27;ve a normal nose not picky or downsized or some sort of just normal straight nose i wanted to pull the bottom line a bit up so i thought this lifting shaping thing would help. WELL NO IT DOESN&#x27;T.&lt;br /&gt;1. it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;2. its just stupid to put on.&lt;br /&gt;3. doesn&#x27;t stay on nose it falls off.&lt;br /&gt;4. it&#x27;s irritating so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So save your money trust me on this.</li>
            <li> If you want a smaller nose, your only real option is rhinoplasty.  I ordered this to see what the fuss was about, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to really reshape my schnozz.  It&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t set my expectations too high.  I had an awful headache after using these.  However, the instructions on the package are hilarious, as they barely make sense.</li>
            <li> Along with facial excersizes, my nose is a lot more toned, but proper lymphatic massage and yoga to tone your face is necessary. After using the product for 30 mins, you will notice that once you remove the shapers that your nose will hold the form for a good 30 mins to an hour before cartilage and lymphatic fluid re-positions itself back and your previous shape of your nose returns. Following this procedure every day would take quite a while to train your cartilage and lymphatic fluid to rest in a toned manner for the desired shape. So my advice is to either leave the product on for longer periods of time or if your doing short periods this must be accompanied with massage and face yoga so that you are reshaping the cartilage of your nose and draining the lymphatic fluid in and around your nose.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of the product since there were more 1 star reviews than 5 star. But it&#x27;s great for the price and does what you&#x27;d expect. Be wary that this may not work on all nose types though. I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d have more luck with it if you have a fleshier nose as opposed to a bony one, as the product is meant to shape cartilage.&lt;br /&gt;One thing you have to keep in mind when purchasing this is that it is a long and tedious process! Don&#x27;t expect to wear it all day when it arrives and have a changed nose by the end of the day! As another reviewer said, retraining parts of your body can take months or years! And although using these products isn&#x27;t downright painful, it IS uncomfortable (especially the pink one). Patience is key when using products like these.</li>
            <li> it works maybe， and it is nkt easy to break though， i use it and feel my nose bit taller，anyway，it ia cheap</li>
            <li> The purple one slips off and the pink one does not even fit around my nose. Horrible won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> SCRATCHY, HARSH PINCHING, ODD ANGLE, NOT REALLY USEFUL, MADE ALL WRONG. WHAT DID I EXPECT? EXACTLY. I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR , JUST HAD TO TRY IT FOR A BUCK OR TWO. DONT REALLY RECOMMEND BUT WHO KNOWS YOU MIGHT WANT YOUR NOSE TO BE ALL PINCHED AND HURTING, THATS COOL, I AINT JUDGIN YA. 4 REAL DOG! I FEEL U ISS ALL GOO.</li>
            <li> The purple clip works absolutely fine for me. I&#x27;ve been seeing that the shape of my nostrils have actually changed. The pink one hurts a lot but I&#x27;m pretty sure it works fine too. But i&#x27;ve only tried the purple one.</li>
            <li> I have brought other other nose products and they did not work for me. These two work fine. They have the best fit.</li>
            <li> Hurts. can&#x27;t breathe. Not the seller&#x27;s fault. Strange item. Maybe works better on Asian noses? Can use to clip my mail together. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, so not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this nose clip and the delivery was fast, but I only used once cos they are very hard and it hurts my nose too and I could not breath properly  with it on</li>
            <li> Ok, I know people are going to be skeptical, but the Nose Up DOES work. I used each one every day for about a half hour each, one for the morning and one for the evening. It hurt at first as it softened up my cartilage, but after the first few days, it was relatively painless. I had planned on taking progress pics, but ended up not wanting to change my nose after about a month of use. Still, within that one month, there WAS a noticeable change in the shape of my nose! It was slight, but over the next few months (had I continued using it), it definitely would have become more distinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that you can place the blue one anywhere you have a problem spot and it will take care of it. I wore it on the slightly bulbous end of my nose for about 45 mins and when I took it off, the end of my nose stayed slimmed down for a good while. Over time, the results would have stuck even longer after taking them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problems with it was that the blue clip tends to stick together and I was always afraid of tearing the white pads off if I forced it too much (never happened, but seems likely over time). Also, DO NOT use these for too long at a time. This is a gradual process, so please treat it as such! When I used each one every day for about 45 mins-1hr, I ended up getting small scabs on the sides of my nose where the Nose Up sits. They went away after a few days of not wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on buying these, buy at least 2 sets! They are a little cheap (although very well-made for the price), and since this is a long-term commitment to a more beautiful nose, you&#x27;ll want to have backups for whenever your first pair breaks (shipping is from China? I think, so if they break and you don&#x27;t have a backup, you&#x27;ll lose a lot of progress by sitting around for a month waiting for the new ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once your desired shape is achieved, you only need to use one of these maybe 2-3 times a week for about a half hour for maintenance. In case anyone&#x27;s wondering.</li>
            <li> i really like this , i love it because is very good quality, the color is bright, i recommend it, but its painfull</li>
            <li> it did what it was decribed by the seller, very good!</li>
            <li> My nose isn&#x27;t large to begin with so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve notices a significant difference in size,&lt;br /&gt;but I have button nose and I feel like these gave me a little more of a ski slope nose which I&lt;br /&gt;think is cuter on me. So if you have a nose similar to mine and you want a littler nose it&#x27;ll probably&lt;br /&gt;work for you.</li>
            <li> i prefer using the pink one as it&#x27;s not as painful as the blue clip. after using the clips, does not leave any red marks on the nose. i think it might help shape the nose.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue for me is the pink clip. I put it on and I couldn&#x27;t leave it on for more than 2-3 minutes because it was really hurting my nose:( but I kept using it for a week and people noticed a difference! They said my nose looked less wider and I recommend it but good luck leaving it on for half an hour. I say just try leaving it on for 2-3 minutes every day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I got the authentic piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was too crappy for me to put it on my skin</li>
            <li> The nose up it did makes it goes up a little but takes times but I like it :)</li>
            <li> This product works. Fair  it takes  sometime  to work also. .. just to let u know  theres. No way that ur going to be able to sleep with this thing on .. it causes distraction and plus im not a verry good mouth breather  but  I have tried to sleep with this thing on and it is just hard... also this item does  cause some pain  but its all worth it in the end</li>
            <li> I like the product and it is easy to wear and i got it before i was expecting it i am very satisfied</li>
            <li> the pink one hurts like hell, they both leave bad marks on your nose. But hey, I don&#x27;t use either one anymore. Found out I love my nose, they kinda helped me find that out so yep</li>
            <li> Ok so let me make this clear: IT DEPENDS ON THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF YOUR NOSE AND YOUR GOALS. The pink piece is trash because of the circular ridges. They make imprints on the skin. Who wants a lego nose? I much prefer the blue one. And for MY NOSE it doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit. It actually feels kind of nice...like a nose massage or something. But then again, that&#x27;s because of the shape of my nose. So lets narrow down the factors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) NOSE SHAPE: See top pictures. Mine is round around the tip and I have no nostril definition, yet from the side view my nose is long. Therefore, I have plenty of useless meatiness on the bridge of my nose that has very few nerves so I don&#x27;t feel much pain at all. Not only that but because I&#x27;m just pinching the bridge with the clip, my nostrils are completely unaffected. I can still breathe comfortably. For those of you who are complaining that it hurts, it&#x27;s most likely because you have very little cartilage on the bridge of your nose and the clip is pressing against the bone. For those who are saying they can&#x27;t breathe, it&#x27;s probably because your nose isn&#x27;t long and it&#x27;s short and flat against your face. This nose clip will NOT help you because you don&#x27;t have very much cartilage to shape. This also goes for people who say the clip is falling off. Your nose is probably too short and wide and the clip doesn&#x27;t have anything to hold on to. This clip cannot lengthen your nose. It can only compress whatever cartilage is already there. If you want those kinds of results, get surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) NOSE SIZE: My nose is not very large. It&#x27;s definitely not a small nose. But it fits my face and it&#x27;s proportionate to my eyes and lips. I am completely satisfied with the original size of my nose and I&#x27;m not trying to change it. If you you want to use this clip to reduce the size of your nose, it will NOT work. Again, this clip only compresses the cartilage that is already there. It can&#x27;t actually shrink your nose size and bone structure. If you want to actually make your nose smaller, see a plastic surgeon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) CLIP USE: I&#x27;m just starting out but I can see that the results will come from long term use, consistency and proper positioning. I bought two and so far I can tell that one fits a little tighter than the other. It&#x27;s probably the springs which might vary slightly between each clip. Keep this in mind as well. As far as people saying there&#x27;s no way to change the shape of your nose, that is NOT true. You can change the shape. The degree to which you can change it depends on the initial shape and size, but it can be done. At least slightly. I know this for a fact. I have a friend whose nose became skinnier over the years because she wore glasses since elementary school. So that just gives you an idea of the dedication this requires. Also, some people may not be aware of this, but some african diaspora people &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; their baby&#x27;s nose so they will grow up with a thinner nose. I know a Haitian woman whose mother did this to her when she was a baby. Her nose isn&#x27;t thin, but it has a shape that no one else in her family has because her mother did that to her only. And remember, for hundreds of years, Chinese women bandaged their feet to make them smaller, and certain indigenous tribes use wedges and rings to make their necks longer. Waist training with tight corsets has created some of the tiniest waists in the world! I&#x27;m not saying any of these things are good, but reshaping your body is possible. Let&#x27;s just be clear that it takes a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. I will use this clip for 20 minutes a day for two weeks and record my progress. Since it is very comfortable, I will then move on to sleeping with it over night and also record my two week progress. After that, I&#x27;ll do a three and six month progress check. Stay tuned.want to actually make your nose smaller, see a plastic surgeon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) CLIP USE: I&#x27;m just starting out but I can see that the results will come from long term use, consistency and proper positioning. I bought two and so far I can tell that one fits a little tighter than the other. It&#x27;s probably the springs which might vary slightly between each clip. Keep this in mind as well.

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with a wider nose it wont fit and I dont even see how the pink one could &amp;#34;slightly&amp;#34; fix the nose bridge ..But it was only a dollar &amp; some change so I didn&#x27;t expect much..But on the bright side I could use the blue one to  close chip bags!</li>
            <li> It does what it does. It pinches the nose. You get a thin looking nose from the beginning (when it&#x27;s on) and you get a weird shaped nose from the side. You&#x27;re squeezing the nose tip fat so it&#x27;s putting that into your nose profile, making it look horrible and probably worse than you started off with. I can&#x27;t describe it. It&#x27;s like a quarter of a circle&#x27;s curve. Both of these do that. And when you take them off, your nose goes back to normal. Just get a job and work for a nose job if you&#x27;re very unhappy with your nose. This won&#x27;t do anything..</li>
            <li> Well, I thought it was working as my nose seems smaller, but the blue piece broke after 3 months, although the pink piece is still going strong. Keep in mind i was not at all careful with these (i never am with anything) so it is not like I had kept it safe with angelic care at all, so I don&#x27;t understand these nightmarish reviews. All in all, I believe it made my nose thinner and possibly slightly longer with the way I had used it.</li>
            <li> Works well but break fast.</li>
            <li> It working okay. Both of them off side and unbalance.</li>
            <li> I have trouble using the pink one however they do make a small difference on my nose. I don&#x27;t really wear them as often because I have glasses I plan on using them more when I get contacts.</li>
            <li> As advertised. fourth one I´ve bought. VG Amazon seller.</li>
            <li> It does shape the nose within time of continued use. If you use this it will feel weird to swallow and your ears will pop occasionally.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, it works</li>
            <li> the purple one works! and its awesome!!! but the pink thing... well... it has two settings, hurts and hurts like a donkey kick in the face. and it does nothing but leave huuuuge circle indents on my nose after 15 minutes. only gave it three stars because its the average of 5 and 1... 5 for the purple  and if i could, none for the pink.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t handle using this long enough to test whether it actually made a difference or not. There is no way one could possibly sleep with this thing on, way too painful.</li>
            <li> I like this it really does help with some straightening issues i had from having a broken nose. this is a great item.</li>
            <li> If you buy&lt;br /&gt;I say, why people do not consume work&lt;br /&gt;Nose so much money, but it works&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for money products work try&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect it to change the shape of the nose permanently, it is not. But it helps temporarily my nose look smaller, finer me!</li>
            <li> This is so not worth even .2 cents. Both broke after only two days. This is a $1.00 money scam.</li>
            <li> For all the people that say this doesn&#x27;t work:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not trying to offend anyone..&lt;br /&gt;But..&lt;br /&gt;This device is NOT for people with big noses trying to achieve a small nose.&lt;br /&gt;You need Surgery if that is the case..&lt;br /&gt;This is not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; fix.&lt;br /&gt;This works wonderfully for slight fixes and minor dorsal humps.&lt;br /&gt;My ex broke my nose awhile back, it gave me a slight hump.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the blue clip for about a week and a half and I already see a difference! Other people already have told me I look different as well!&lt;br /&gt;My nose looks amazing!&lt;br /&gt;This really does work!&lt;br /&gt;You just have to give it time though, I wear it for an hour everyday.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s a couple bucks..&lt;br /&gt;Try it.&lt;br /&gt;See if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m soooo glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I actually ordered 2 more!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> These are the worst things on the market! I don&#x27;t mind pain if it will benefit me but these not only hurt, they barely stay on. I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman with a very nice bridge, I don&#x27;t see how these would stay on a flat bridge if they pop right off of my nose. Biggest waste of money in my life.</li>
            <li> great for noses that are malleable - ie the cartilage part.&lt;br /&gt;but remember this cant change bone structure&lt;br /&gt;good for small adjustments</li>
            <li> It slips off your nose to easily.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good! ...</li>
            <li> My nose was broken years ago was never reset ( not very noticeable though) I got this in hopes of putting this on the bump to make my nose smaller. Didn&#x27;t fit very well at all and my bump is very slight ( I have to hold it in place so it doesn&#x27;t slide around which is very inconvenient). Is also very painful. I think it would be better if you could get different sizes.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why i bought them in the first place! lol</li>
            <li> kept slipping off nose. it was just not good. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Has no effect whatsoever on your nose. Is uncomfortable and even painful. You won&#x27;t have it on for more than 10 mins without feeling pain. I do not recommend at all. It&#x27;s an honest waste of money</li>
            <li> The blue nose clip won&#x27;t even stay on my nose. It slides off and is useless. The pink one works but its painful and leaves marks from were it was at. I would say pass on these and try something else. I do like that I have the option to slim my nose down without surgery though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really works but I guess it&#x27;s just fun to do</li>
            <li> Pretty good feels like its working not sure if it is though, pinks a bit tight but it hasn&#x27;t snapped or left dents in my nose like other reviews, however the blue has trouble staying on</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t see results</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the blue one but the pink one really works just a little painful at first and leaves marks so I just put something under it like a bandaid</li>
            <li> Seriously don&#x27;t bother lol it just hurts and then when you take it off you just have a mark and red nose. The pink thing doesn&#x27;t even fit unless you have a tiny button nose</li>
            <li> My nose looks slimmer (so I&#x27;ve been told!! :) ). After just two weeks of using them for 20 minutes each. I am very pleased and plan to use it for longer. This is my first review to anything; however, I hope this review helps someone purchase this product and hopefully they&#x27;ll see the same results I have. I&#x27;ve always disliked my nose, but plastic surgery has never been an option. After reading many reviews, doing research, and considering the price I decided to finally purchase this item. Many of the negative reviews were due to high expectations, lack of patients, and improper use. If you dedicate at least 15 minutes each night for about 2- 4 weeks you&#x27;ll see results. This is similar to working out. It takes time and dedication. Honestly I can&#x27;t wait to see what my nose will look like after longer use. :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. For $1 its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I received two of the pink nose bridges. I seller never the other piece that was suppose to come with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly small that I can&#x27;t breath through it! The hard plastic diggs into the side of my nostril.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way I can use this product; this is a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;If I could give it zero stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I only used the blue one and it does not fit on big noses so how will the nose get smaller! The other reviewers saying it had a point.Unless your nose is already pretty small don&#x27;t use this. You have to hold it to keep it on your nose.</li>
            <li> The instructions that are included are pretty hard to understand. It was nice to experiment with, but I do not know how it would actually work. It feels like it would do the opposite of what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> love it. it made my nose smaller and i can clearly see the difference. i recommend this product for people who have wide noses</li>
            <li> It did not work don&#x27;t waist your money on this garbage don&#x27;t bother to try it or your wasting your time and money!</li>
            <li> I used the blue clip first to straighten the nose bridge. The pink hurt too much at first, but as my nose got smaller the pink got more comfortable. Now I&#x27;m using that to reshape the tip. Very surprised at the results. It works, but you have to wear it every day and be disciplined about it. I took before pictures and my nose is much smaller and straighter. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it, I tried this just for kicks, but I am glad I bought this product. My friends can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s different about me, but they all say I look prettier, so it did make a difference.</li>
            <li> These were packaged well and came on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theyre are as described and I&#x27;ve been having fun playing with them.</li>
            <li> I got this more out of humor and curiosity... I don&#x27;t recommend getting this though if you really think it&#x27;s going to correct your nose</li>
            <li> Waste my money this is foolishness</li>
            <li> I love both it work if use as told, I will recommend it to nay one  and to family and friends</li>
            <li> it do what it is expected</li>
            <li> I fell for it. I wore it for twenty- thirty minutes for three days until I realized that my nose was swollen! Needless to say it has returned to its original shape and size now that I have stopped. I can&#x27;t imagine the damage that this would have done if I wore it for a longer period of time. People often buy these items because they are cheap and they think what the hey, it&#x27;s only a few bucks. The only person winning at this game is the person who probably runs a sweatshop in order to mass produce these things for cheap.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear it longer than 5 minutes so I don&#x27;t know if I wear it longer it will work better.. I&#x27;m not very patient with having something on my face for that long. Especially when it kind of hurts! I give it two stars because it didn&#x27;t do anything for me but it might have the potential to be better if I was a little more patient.</li>
            <li> I ordered this about 20 days ago, but no complaints there because it did ship from china, and the estimated delivery date would be 1-2 weeks from today. Everyones complaining about about it hurting, and i just think its alot of pressure, its not too bad. Since i got it today i havent really taken time to try it out too much, so i do not know if it works yet. The pink one did not fit well but it is possible to put on but its quite difficult. All those marks everyone is talking about is literally nothing, its like those marks your skin would get after laying on an object or something with texture for too long, doesnt seem permanent. And the plastic does not seem fragile or weak so i think its a decent item for cheap.</li>
            <li> Pffff! I don&#x27;t like it not work at all! For me that it don&#x27;t work at all disapointed by this</li>
            <li> This is a copy of the Nose Right, feel like i got ripped off :(&lt;br /&gt;this is not approved by doctor but nose right is....</li>
            <li> Eh, I&#x27;m giving this a 3 due to the missing parts. I didn&#x27;t get the pink part which I think straightens the nose...  Based on the blue part that hugs my nose,&lt;br /&gt;I kind of feel like my nose is more swollen :/ I&#x27;ve been using for 4 days. Let&#x27;s see if this does make it smaller. So far it&#x27;s not :(</li>
            <li> Ok you put this on your nose for awhile then you take it off and your nose is somewhat skinny for like a couple of seconds then your nose goes back to in its regular shape almost like how dough slowly falls after you roll it in a ball haha</li>
            <li> Ugh! Why did I think for a second this would ever work???! Lol it was cheap so no harm done, oh well</li>
            <li> Its really tight but I haven&#x27;t seen no improvements</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the pink little nosey, as I feel it is more useful than the blue device. Thank you for your service, as I will recommend your services to others.</li>
            <li> The product broke and I&#x27;m not too happy about that. I&#x27;m sure it works, but I didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough.</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t believe that this will make my nose up or pointed. The reason I bought this is that to control my sneeze in the middle of the night coz I&#x27;m so sneezy that I can&#x27;t control it unless pinching my nose. It helps that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for TWO DAYS and I already see a small difference! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Broke very easily after using it twice, not worth the money. Not sure if it works or not but the workman ship was not good and the product was sub standard.</li>
            <li> Terrible, just utterly terrible. The product does not own up to its expectations and it arrived a month late. JUST TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Shipping took quite a whole, but for the price it was worth it. I bought one of the pink straightening bridges from Chine before and really liked it. My nose was very wide and I am only 13 and don&#x27;t want plastic surgery or rhinoplasty. I wear it for 15-40 minutes a day, depending on how much time I have alone (you wouldn&#x27;t want to wear one of these in front of your friends! :P) and was seeing good results! My nose is smaller now and shaped better. The plastic on my old one was starting to feel loose so I decided to get a new one. Unable to go back to China to buy one, I found one on Amazon and was very pleased! The pink straightening bridge was in a package identical to my previous one, and I was pleasantly surprised that the knobby white part of the straightening clip was a nice reddish-pink color instead, since my old one was white I can now tell the difference between them. But one of the little knobs on the outside, however was broken! This slightly irked me, but since it does nothing and did not affect the usage of the product, I let it slide. But the blue clip, I had never used before, so when I opened it, I found it was too loose on my nose! It might just be because I am used to a very tight clip like the pink one, but I did not really like how loose the blue clip was. Overall, it was a great buy and the price is great. If you are considering plastic surgery or rhinoplasty, I recommend you to try this first.</li>
            <li> These clamps are not going to change the shape of your nose, or create a long lasting effect, but they might work if you want your nose to look a teensy bit slimmer/straighter for a photo. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet, but then again, I can never stand to keep either one clamped on my nose for more than a couple of minutes at a time. I enjoy breathing out of my nose and the pinching is pretty uncomfortable. These clamps are not a miracle cure, but they&#x27;re worth a shot for $2.</li>
            <li> You get what you buy. Results are temporary. If used consistently, will not change the shape of the nose for more than an hour at a time.</li>
            <li> Too much pain, gave up. Just be you and love your features!</li>
            <li> The pink bridge straightening  didn&#x27;t fit on my nose shape, I think it&#x27;s designed for Asian type noses, it kept popping off !&lt;br /&gt;The blue clip works in a way, I felt my nose looked slimmer, but not significantly, be careful when you place the clip, that it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;only squeezing the tip cartridge, if you go more up where your nostrils and folds are, it will cause it to collapse and change shape,&lt;br /&gt;from the inside, which makes it hard to breathe, I think I pressed it in the wrong place at first as I didn&#x27;t have any directions on where to apply it, so I narrowed the breathing path a little. but it&#x27;s fun to have for this price, especially if you want to get an idea on how your nose would look thinner after a nose job. your nose will look smaller right after you unclip it, and red but will get back to normal size after, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently, but depending on your nose shape and condition it might give you a hint of sculpting result.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family has a big nose, my nose wasn&#x27;t as big but I&#x27;ve always been a little uncomfortable with my nose, especially because I broke it when I was about 16 years old. I bought this product about a year ago and used it for about 6 months and I know see a difference so much the I&#x27;m ordering it again because I lost the one I previously ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions: You have to continuously use it everyday over 15 minutes. Even if there&#x27;s no difference at first keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it in the same places every time, if you often move it to different spots higher or lower there&#x27;s no progress being made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s difficult to use it on the upper part where be bone is, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for that plus you can&#x27;t reshape bone anyways with out surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I&#x27;ve only tried the blue one so that&#x27;s what my review is about.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really work for me just left my nose red but its okay it was too good to be true uk plus its super cheap so what do u expect lol the shipping took a while tho but i have patience so that didn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> I hate the fact taht it hurts my nose but i&#x27;ll keep up useing it tell i get my result.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me, kept slipping off my nose.&lt;br /&gt;The pink one was much to tight for the average nose.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work but it&#x27;s obviously only temporarily.</li>
            <li> well I have not been using it that long so I can&#x27;t  really say if its working but the pink one hurts so bad can&#x27;t use it blue ones good so i&#x27;ll be back with an update.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice too much change and I think my nose got puffier... if you really want to change it go get rhinoplasty... this thing doesn&#x27;t seem to help</li>
            <li> It worked on my nose and I only used it for 2 days, but its flimsy and broke on the 3 day. Seems useless to send back and wait for another one</li>
            <li> Please! Please don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on something that WILL NOT WORK. Talk about 100% guaranteed not to work, this is one. I mean it!</li>
            <li> It is an okay item, I am still using the nose lifting shaping (blue) but the pink one is so tight that it broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> Silly poor construction didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I bought these after getting obsessed with how big my nose is on my face. I&#x27;d read reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Both clips are poorly packaged with useless instructions, so I had to look online. The pink one is useless unless you have a tiiiny nose and it hurts like heck. After about a week I noticed my nose was actually getting bigger. seriously, it looks like my nose went up a size. I&#x27;ve stopped using the clips and I hope my nose is just swollen temporarily. :P&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weird, it looked like my nose was smaller RIGHT after using the clip, but then it got bigger and wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to work on my self esteem, because I can&#x27;t afford a nose job and I&#x27;ll be danged if I spend $6,000 on my nose instead of living my goddarn life.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;m using them properly. Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It helps but I only have a minor issue with my nose (that is is small and photographs flat). This is mean for people with small noses, so if you have a big nose, steer clear.</li>
            <li> So a girlfriend of mine injured her nose awhile ago and I recently got her these. They seem to be working since I&#x27;ve noticed she&#x27;s stopped contouring her nose. Can&#x27;t say for sure if they work or if they just pin the nose right for a short while but isn&#x27;t the gift of confidence worth giving. And if they don&#x27;t work out for her she can move along to that which might.</li>
            <li> Took a little white to arrive, what do you expect....it&#x27;s coming from China.  I&#x27;m at day two and I can already see a difference.  It hurts a tiny bit, nothing you can&#x27;t handle.  How are you supposed to get rid of a dorsal bump without pressure?? I don&#x27;t have a huge nose just a small dorsal hump and a little wide nose. The product is not expensive. You spend more on candy (stop complaining). People want results asap. Look at is as trying.  I will keep using this and I&#x27;ll add a weekly nose progress photo. ...</li>
            <li> It took a month to get here but so far both of the clips work,</li>
            <li> it is too pain ihave ring in my noes so it did not work for me but it is good idea</li>
            <li> Can just in time and works perfect</li>
            <li> Kind of cheap quality but these were cheap items to buy. I don&#x27;t see any results but haven&#x27;t been using it for that long yet.</li>
            <li> does nothing. the purple one especially, just instantly threw it away, not even worth the plastic its made of. the pink one i tried, leaves nice lego pattern on your nose but does not help to make it smaller</li>
            <li> It really works but is a little bit uncomfortable</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work or at least not if you do not wear it on a regular basis (everyday for 15 minutes).</li>
            <li> If this product was not so cheap I would be more incline to anger than I am now. Never has a product been so low in quality that it bent and misshaped on the first use. Unless your nose is extremely wide you have no need for this awful product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I just wanted a good nose plug and these don&#x27;t work for that...or for anything except making the company some money.  Keep your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone who are conscious about their nose. But, I do hope that it works for them.</li>
            <li> The  pink one hurts so much but the blue one doesnt and I can see a change in my nose</li>
            <li> They come from so far so i wait for it like a month, but do not exceed the promised shipping time. For the low price that i paid for them ($1.60) its like a gift anyways. I just started using it ,so i hope it works. Nice service!</li>
            <li> This actually managed to mess up my nose cartilage so it&#x27;s slightly uneven now. I thought it would eventually go away, and my nose would return to normal. No. It&#x27;s been two years now and it&#x27;s still messed up. So now my nose is permanently uneven and I lost ten dollars (I had to buy two, the first one broke.) Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> i was actually excited to purchase this item but i was not gonna give it my full trust since it was only about $5 so how could this little product fix my nose. The bridge straighnening was not able to stay on my nose it would fall off as soon as i put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty tide, but it&#x27;s little bit hurt when you use it for long time. You need to massage after this.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t fall apart or anything (which I&#x27;m very surprised about considering these were probably made very poorly,haha..) but it works okay on my nose I guess.. didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference, but that&#x27;s only because I haven&#x27;t been keeping up with it like every day....So if you want to see results, you should do it every day (for like 10 or 15 min max).</li>
            <li> The pink one leaves marks on your nose and the purple one broke because the spring is so cheap! It doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> This is something my ex boyfriend decided to try for kicks because he has a crooked nose. I don&#x27;t think it really does anything. If anything it may just stretch the tissue and in some cases temporarily mold the nose but not permanently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and i see a difference. My nose is thinner and straighter. I will continue using this until I want the results and then doing sometimes in order that keep it that way.</li>
            <li> after a few days of wearing this, I ended up getting sinus infection.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week. The blue clip fits better on my nose and is more comfortable. The pink clip really hurts, I guess i have to get used to it. I am an african american female with a wide nose. I have seen some changes within the week. I try to wear at least 30 minutes a day. I usually wear the clip for 30 minutes and then allow my nose to rest and wear it later in the day. So far..so good!!!</li>
            <li> im starting to notice a change in my nose...even friends are asking me what is going on that it looks different....the pink one hurts a little but after a while its ok...the blue is a perfect fit...im satisfied so far!!!!</li>
            <li> This is more like a joke! Very uncomfortable and does not work!  The cloth pin work better than this!</li>
            <li> It does not work for certain nose shapes.it just kept sliping off my nose&lt;br /&gt;I even let my daughter try it and she has a very small nose it it kept slipping off</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s crazy to me of having provoked more defined nose and my friends said, which seems to be more thin, blue clamp actual work is very good, but the pink plastic is waste lift, it is always like four weeks time to send two items, but it is still worth buying.</li>
            <li> Both are very bad products. They HURT as hell.&lt;br /&gt;They do not work AT ALL. Do not buy this products.</li>
            <li> the product is difficult to use -- very uncomfortable and not really worth the effort.  I also wish that instructions had been included -- preferably pictorial instructions.  It might prompt the product use.</li>
            <li> The pink one broke super easily and the blue one is kind of painful maybe working I can t really tell ???</li>
            <li> it actually work, but very slowly.. I used it everyday, about 1 hour each time. After 3 weeks, I can see my nose is slightly taller.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waster your time and money on this little thing. It won&#x27;t help your nose get higher. Nothing will except the plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> Greetings everyone!  I just wanted to tell you all what you ALREADY know:  *NOTHING* worth while comes EASY!!!  In other words, this product *DID* work for me----and *CONTINUES* to work.  However, what people DON&#x27;T like is  --WAITING--.  And, although it DOES work, , , IT TAKES *TIME*.  For a REALLY simple explanation---and/or comparison----  Remember a long time ago in China, the cultural custom used to be for women to BIND their feet----in order to be more attractive to a mate or potential mate?? Remember hearing about that on Ripley&#x27;s Believe It Or Not???  :-)  Their feet DID, *indeed*, change and get MUCH smaller; but it did *NOT* happen over night!!! (I&#x27;m SORRY for all you who want a &amp;#34;QUICK FIX&amp;#34;; the nose clip is not a quick fix!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a  *similar*  process is involved here with the &amp;#34;nose clips&amp;#34;.  It takes TIME;  *HOWEVER*, you&#x27;re nose structure WILL CHANGE (or get smaller) AS LONG AS you are FAITHFUL with your usage of the nose clip.  The FAITHFULNESS is *JUST* as IMPORTANT as the *PATIENCE* aspect regarding the nose clip and its effectiveness.  But again,  I have been----sometimes painfully-----wearing the nose clip EVERY night for at least 15 minutes (regardless of the time it advised me),  and  ***I  DO***  see a difference in my nose size.  My nose IS getting smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Just think about something we&#x27;re ALL familiar with:  BRACES (on teeth).  They WORK, don&#x27;t they???  But the work SLOWLY by, eventually, changing the position of your teeth.  AND, braces are on for a LONG TIME too,  aren&#x27;t they???&lt;br /&gt;If you tied your fingers together EVERY DAY for a long time, , , your fingers would change too and become a different, deformed shape.&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY, I *think* you get my point.  And I must mention what *others* are mentioning----who are ALSO *satisfied* with the nose clip:  The nose clip is a few bucks.  Nose SURGERY---on the other hand---is several thousand dollars.  So if you don&#x27;t mind a little (bareable) pain (don&#x27;t be babies now!)  and some time at night (when you&#x27;re just reading, watching TV, or on your laptop anyway), , , then GO FOR IT!!! Buy the nose clip, and----***EVENTUALLY***-----you&#x27;ll be a HAPPY camper (with a CUTE, sexy, smaller, little nose)!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps!  Blessings to you all!!!&lt;br /&gt;Moonsstarrand some time at night (when you&#x27;re just reading, watching TV, or on your laptop anyway), , , then GO FOR IT!!!

            <li> I bought this back in January of 2014, I had bought two of the sets and the two pink nose pieces broke instantly (plus they hurt when you put them on, pinched too hard) I had given them to my daughters and they snapped right in front of my very eyes. Very disappointing but the blue nose piece was much more easier to use. The cushion inside the blue pieces fell out though so I had to put them back in and place a sheet of paper to prevent it form sticking and falling out again. It was worth the price if the pink ones hadn&#x27;t broken but sadly I give it three stars. But I have seen visible results from the blue nose piece and my nose is straighter and thinner. I should&#x27;ve just bought the blue ones.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Does not work whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a month and still no change and it hurts when left on for a few minutes hopefully I will find change in my nose</li>
            <li> I threw away the pink one since I heard it leaves bruises and all on the nose , but the blue one works great! I seen YouTube reviews about it...so I decided to try it to. And I&#x27;m stArting to use it and I&#x27;m already seeing a slight result !</li>
            <li> 11/14 This device is not working at all. I used it for the past two months and my nose tip still the same. I put the presure same place for 30 minutes like it was told but no change. Only surgery can change nose shape but I will never do it coz it is so risky and ppl are always unpleased with the result.  04/15 Now that I applied the device for another 3 months I start noticing that my nose tip is getting pointier. I am amazed. Well I gave up for few months until I met my friend that i didnt see for over one year who asked  me if i had nose surgery. I was very happy to know that all patience and consistency  paid off. This device works only with wide tip only. It doesn&#x27;t reshape the bone . You have to be realistic.</li>
            <li> I dont speak chinese so I had a hard time figuro it out!</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.  I just got this product today, which is about two or three weeks earlier than expected.  So, kudos to overfeel.  Now, to be truthful.  When I opened the package I was actually surprised by how small the pink nose clip was, and that the reviews of it were partially true.  As for it being tight, uncomfortable, and too small actually wear is completely untrue for me.  I know I don&#x27;t have the same nose as everyone else, but the pink nose clip fits perfectly on my nose and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all to be frank  (I&#x27;m actually wearing it as I type this).  To those reviewers who stated all of the negatives about probably have noses that aren&#x27;t compatible with this device, which means your nose is most likely too big to fit into it.  As for me, as previously stated, it fits well on my nose, and no, I&#x27;m not Asian.  As for this device actually working to mold a better nose I am uncertain of, but I will try it out and report my results.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know it it works, too painful and kept sliding off my nose,</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that maybe this would work but it really didn&#x27;t. It kept sliding off. Even when I put paper on my nose to add a better grip it still slipped. After the first use it looked like my nose got worse and became a bit droopier which is why I stopped using it. I thought I was going to be part of the few people that saw great results but guess not. Maybe if it stayed in place I could&#x27;ve seen results.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product but will give you a headache if you wear it too long on your nose.</li>
            <li> my daughter ordered this.. what a joke</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well</li>
            <li> Very painful to wear , I don&#x27;t recommend it .</li>
            <li> Item was as described, but one star to let you guys know they don&#x27;t work.  My nose is still humongous.  Saving up for plastic surgery now~</li>
            <li> Great price, perfect product, fast shipping!!! Excellent transaction!</li>
            <li> I used it for one day and it broke. Plastic is very cheap and easy to break. I am very unhappy</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected. Interesting gadget. useful if your clipping your nose to keep odors at bay. Hard to clip on and if you catch the skin wrong it cuts you. Left a nice slice making my nose with a new fabulous scar. However it&#x27;s an interesting gadget. I&#x27;ve not used again. For the price, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Havent tried these just yet but they look as in the picture and i hope they work!</li>
            <li> I have not used this much, I have had it for a while, but it is very painful, and that&#x27;s why I have not used it much, my daughter likes to play with them though lol, however I could see them working if I could stand the pain and leave them on long enough for them to work. if you can handle some pain, these may work for you, however if you don&#x27;t want to sit in pain, then don&#x27;t order these!</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable  to wear, you  have to numb your nose to use this product. In fact that&#x27;s what I had to do.I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see any results. I&#x27;ll  try it again, and see what happens</li>
            <li> I GUESS ITS OKAY, HAVENT REALLY NOTICED A CHANGE</li>
            <li> Another piece of crap.  Cheaply made and cheap in general.  Does not work at all.  Should not be on the market.  Rather than returning it, I threw it in the thrash where it belongs.</li>
            <li> Another made in china trash</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gag gift. Are you kidding me, this product is such a joke. Don&#x27;t order unless its a gag gift.</li>
            <li> The purple is way better than the pink one, the pink one just crashes your noise</li>
            <li> Changes your nose for like 10 minutes, but eventually it&#x27;ll fall back into place.</li>
            <li> This works temporarily and it hurts the nose.  I use both at the same time.  Regardless I like the product.  Definitely worth a try and worth the money!</li>
            <li> These arrived on time but I didn&#x27;t particularly care for them. They pinched my nose too much. The tension should be loosened a little to make them more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works, but if you are looking for a permanent nose job, this won&#x27;t do the job. It&#x27;s a temporary &#x27;treatment&#x27; but it does work and lasts me the whole day if I put it on in the morning. The shipping was very quick too! I was bummed about the 17-28 business days, but it came in more than a week earlier than the estimated delivery date. No complaints about this product!  Great price too!</li>
            <li> little small. but it&#x27;s work</li>
            <li> that work ok. well buy form them sometime.i like them to work on for time. it is fun to buy</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty quick. Very happy with that. I liked the products, but one thing really bugged me. The clear rubbery plastic on the pink nose clip hurts my nose, so instead, i took the clear plastic off and placed the blue nose shaping thing on top of the pink clip. I can definitely seen the difference. (:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe there is any help from those devices. The purple one is not comfortable, slides of the nose constantly. I have lost a pink one almost immediately, so can&#x27;t rate, but at least it sat on the nose easier.</li>
            <li> great very fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> The Pink Nose Clip is far too small for anyone. Absolutely useless and I would not recommend it to anyone. The Blue Nose Clip just barely fits. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The pink work well, but it break too easy. so now I got to buy another one. Also for the pink one, the instruction really need to be translated into english, because in the beginning when i was wearing it, it hurted my nose so much. But when i keep looking at the picture of the instruction, it looks like we could adjust it, so after i adjust it it felt so much better. The blue one is ok for my nose, but it seems like you should use the pink one first than the blue one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but does it make your nose pointier over time?</li>
            <li> It came yesterday and I tried it out, I don&#x27;t know the result yet since I only had it on for 10 minutes but one thing that I knew immediately was that you can&#x27;t breathe with so ever. The only way you can breathe is from your mouth.</li>
            <li> The blue thing is so easy to put and i didnt feel any pain, its light and i think it might work. This is my third day i apply it 15mins morning or when i watch tv and then another 15mins at night. I didnt like the pink thing it hurt</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like, it hurt my nose.&lt;br /&gt;If you have an imperfection on the bone it wont fix it.&lt;br /&gt;It might damage your cartilage so be careful.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do a thing. Don&#x27;t waste your money. If you don&#x27;t like your nose, you most likely need a surgical nose job -- which I&#x27;m going to be getting very soon. So take the money you were going to spend on this worthless piece of plastic and put it in your &amp;#34;nose job fund&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The nose bridge clip worked wonderfully for me. Day six I noticed a huge change. I wear the clip throughout the day and will continue to for the next two months. This beats rhinoplasty. I&#x27;m a major perfectionist and height critical and this the little clips are worth a shot</li>
            <li> it is uncomfortable at first but the results are real if you are consistent with wearing it. y ou look like a freak with it on lol but its worthh it!! great product</li>
            <li> My nose fits my face but it long, hooked at the end (it&#x27;s easy on the eyes though, Lol!) and wide. I&#x27;m AA if that makes any difference...it shouldn&#x27;t but for those who are wondering. Nevertheless, I paid under two bucks for both of these. No shipping and handling, no tax just under two dollars. It came quicker, weeks quicker, than it was supposed to. I give them a rating of five for that. These shaping clips are clearly for someone with a smaller nose. the blue one ALWAYS slowly, eases off of my nose. The pink one? Too tiny, can&#x27;t do anything with it. They don&#x27;t seem like they will break and will work for someone else, not for me. also, the directions are not in English...it&#x27;s Asian. I gave it a three because of the price, speed of delivery and they are REALLY sturdy.</li>
            <li> This product is stupid and has no real purpose but to make you feel just as stupid as the product itself.  Not to mention the fact that the instructions are all in chinese, and anything written in english is in such BROKEN english that it makes you laugh... OH WELL...YOU TRULY GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ON THSI ONE!!!! lol</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even put on the pink one cause it&#x27;s just too small. I think it&#x27;s for like a 6 year-old.&lt;br /&gt;Purple one works fine but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything more that squeeze your nose and leave a mark on your skin.</li>
            <li> This thing really works! I&#x27;m not sure about the blue piece, but the pink piece is the real deal! It&#x27;s like a braces retainer for your nose. My crooked bridge was gone within 4 days (40mins a day usage) &amp; I can feel the shrinkage as well. It pinches a little, but it&#x27;s not too bad. If you wear it too long it will cause bruising.</li>
            <li> They do help, but I would say for a short period of time. But then again, I&#x27;ve been using it for only a day, so we&#x27;ll see!</li>
