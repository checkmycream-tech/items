            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, but the shade didn&#x27;t blend well into my hair.</li>
            <li>Root Touch-Up and found the Brown to have better coverage.  </li>
            <li>Love the color buy felt like glue in my hair</li>
            <li>Love the product, but never received.</li>
            <li>I got the &amp;#34;Style Edit Conceal&amp;#34; in light brown</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I used to make my own, with different eye shadows.</li>
            <li>They named it as &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; product, and they were right.  </li>
            <li>Initially purchased at the salon for quite a bit more $.  </li>
            <li>The blonde tone is not the best for me, however, I had run out of my usual stuff(Keratin fibers).</li>
            <li>Its very light and the grey roots show through.</li>
            <li>The blonde is way too light and comes out too fast.  </li>
            <li>The Blonde is too light and comes out looking like baby powder.</li>
            <li>The applicator for this provides too much range.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>Looks a little bit more natural and blends in.</li>
            <li>If they had a light brown I might have tried it but the brown here looks too dark for me.  </li>
            <li>The loose brush allows it to get all over the place when what is needed is a more sharply aimed applicator.</li>
            <li>This powder really does help cover pink spots that show through on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally an ashy blonde, but I have it colored/</li>

            <li> and I cough and cough for a long time making it necessary to use my emergency inhaler.  </li>
            <li> The stuff, when applied, simply makes you look as if you&#x27;ve lost a battle with your container of loose powder.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t cover my grey hair.</li>
            <li> The even bigger problem I have with this product is that I have allergies and asthma and when I try to apply the touch-up very carefully, cover my mouth,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazing, it did work just like it should, made my dark / gray roots simply invisible, and it didn&#x27;t make my hair sticky, or go where I didn&#x27;t want it to go,  </li>
            <li> So when opened you loose a substantial amount.</li>
            <li> It also looks like white blobs of powdery stuff and anyone with half a brain cell can look and see what you&#x27;ve done.  </li>
            <li> Just not much in it.</li>
            <li> I had to make my hair wet to get it</li>
            <li> Because my hair color was toward an ashy blonde tone, I added a pale olive green shadow to my mix.</li>
            <li> Powder is loose and not easily controlled.</li>
            <li> Needs to have a little color to it.</li>
            <li> A waste of my money</li>
            <li> As an artist that paints, I  wish I knew where to buy plain mineral powder that I could custom tint for myself.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover the gray at all and it made my hair feel stiff - would not recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> unable to open brush without breaking plastic</li>
            <li> Terrible unless you have pure white hair.</li>
            <li> Really helped cover up my darker roots until I could get to the salon to get my base lightened.</li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product</li>
            <li> It makes your gray roots look WORSE.  </li>
            <li> tried to brush it through and it looked even worse.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use, don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> If you are blonde, this product is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i didn&#x27;t even get any color out.</li>
            <li> , I thought about returning it, but was so annoyed I didn&#x27;t even want to pay shipping to return it!</li>
            <li> guess this was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nasty.</li>

            <li> I like the product the color is perfect. Just not much in it.</li>
            <li> Looks a little bit more natural and blends in.</li>
            <li> Initially purchased at the salon for quite a bit more $.  Love it! Will continue to purchase it.  great quality</li>
            <li> Needs to have a little color to it. It states for blonde but it turned my hair white. Powder is loose and not easily controlled. Not happy with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Brown and the Blonde Jonathan Product Root Touch-Up and found the Brown to have better coverage.  The Blonde is too light and comes out looking like baby powder.</li>
            <li> If you are blonde, this product is horrible.  It makes your gray roots look WORSE.  I can&#x27;t speak for the brunette etc, but don&#x27;t get the blonde in this item.  If they had a light brown I might have tried it but the brown here looks too dark for me.  I got the &amp;#34;Style Edit Conceal&amp;#34; in light brown and it is fantastic.  Blondes - try this instead.</li>
            <li> The stuff, when applied, simply makes you look as if you&#x27;ve lost a battle with your container of loose powder.  It also looks like white blobs of powdery stuff and anyone with half a brain cell can look and see what you&#x27;ve done.  The even bigger problem I have with this product is that I have allergies and asthma and when I try to apply the touch-up very carefully, cover my mouth, etc., it makes no difference and I cough and cough for a long time making it necessary to use my emergency inhaler.  This stuff has, after two attempts at use, gone in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Terrible unless you have pure white hair. A waste of my money</li>
            <li> The blonde is way too light and comes out too fast.  Looks like baby powder.  Ugh!</li>
            <li> The blonde tone is not the best for me, however, I had run out of my usual stuff(Keratin fibers). This application was way faster and easier than the shakers. It would be so great if there were more color choices. I used to make my own, with different eye shadows. Because my hair color was toward an ashy blonde tone, I added a pale olive green shadow to my mix. It was perfect...but L,Oreal doesn&#x27;t make the color anymore. As an artist that paints, I  wish I knew where to buy plain mineral powder that I could custom tint for myself.</li>
            <li> This powder really does help cover pink spots that show through on my scalp.  I was amazed.</li>
            <li> Really helped cover up my darker roots until I could get to the salon to get my base lightened.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Touch-up Blonde thinking it would buy me some time between hair appointments. My hair is naturally an ashy blonde, but I have it colored/highlighted.&lt;br /&gt;This product is either way too light/white for me or its just baby powder in disguise.&lt;br /&gt;It made my roots look powdery whitish/gray.. not blonde. (And I have no grays!)&lt;br /&gt;I tried to brush it through and it looked even worse. I had to make my hair wet to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;I guess this was a bad idea. Calling my stylist!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i didn&#x27;t even get any color out. The applicator didn&#x27;t release any product. Very difficult to use, don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> They named it as &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; product, and they were right.  Great product, great seller, the product came just in time, and it was absoluely just as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, it did work just like it should, made my dark / gray roots simply invisible, and it didn&#x27;t make my hair sticky, or go where I didn&#x27;t want it to go,  Perfect</li>
            <li> unable to open brush without breaking plastic</li>
            <li> Not only does it not help hide roots, but it leaves your hair feeling sticky. It&#x27;s nasty. Threw it out.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, but the shade didn&#x27;t blend well into my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the color buy felt like glue in my hair</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this but it didn&#x27;t cover my grey hair. Its very light and the grey roots show through. Also, its got a chalky texture that makes my hair feel gritty and unclean.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but never received.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover the gray at all and it made my hair feel stiff - would not recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> For blondes, this product looks like baby powder on your hair!  Not good, I thought about returning it, but was so annoyed I didn&#x27;t even want to pay shipping to return it!</li>
            <li> Like this product but if you leave it in your makeup purse the juggling from movement makes all the product fill the cap. So when opened you loose a substantial amount.</li>
            <li> The applicator for this provides too much range. The powder itself works well but they need to improve the way in which you apply it. The loose brush allows it to get all over the place when what is needed is a more sharply aimed applicator. I don&#x27;t regret buying it, but it can be labor intensive getting it on your hair without getting it on your face.</li>
