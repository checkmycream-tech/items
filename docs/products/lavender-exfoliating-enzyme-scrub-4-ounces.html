            <li>Great exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>It takes the make up off at night just great.</li>
            <li>smells great and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>I love these and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I think it would be a good scrub without the battery-powered brush as well.</li>
            <li>stores sell this for much more than this Amazon price, so this is a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this this face scrub!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Safe to use yet effective!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it feels nice.</li>
            <li>The lavender smell is not too strong to stir up allergies and it&#x27;s relaxing!</li>
            <li>Ingredients are nice and it RINSES CLEAN! :)</li>
            <li>I generally love most Avalon Organics products for this reason.</li>
            <li>It is not smelly, but the lack of scent could be called a scent  as well, which is not one of my favorite scents because i prefer Grapefruit scented face washes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li>While not a &amp;#34;holistic&amp;#34; product such as Dr. Haushka, it still contains good quality ingredients and is a good compromise price-wise.</li>
            <li>Not too abrasive and washes of easily</li>
            <li>It really keeps my skin clear and the scrub smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is also wonderful and not overpowering at all (the smell of too much lavender can make me nauseous, so I&#x27;m pretty particular about the strength of scents).</li>
            <li>Nice gentle scrub, cleans my face up well.</li>
            <li>Does a good job as far as i can toll.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and bright for the first time in a while.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the product as it left an oily residue on my face , but after some more uses I found the oil actually keeps my skin from drying out, and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li>The seller was also quick and the material was well packaged.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, isn&#x27;t overly harsh, and is a good consistency.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, have used it every other day at night, impressed...</li>
            <li>I love it so far and use it almost every day.</li>
            <li>What I have run out and tried other kinds, nothing is ever is good.</li>
            <li>Skin is left clean , fresh and smooth  with no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel very clean and hydrated especially when you apply a moisturizing cream</li>
            <li>I use it once a day in the shower and it leaves my skin SO soft and clean after use.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product is great at not irritating my skin and getting rid of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the finer grain of the exfoliating substance.</li>
            <li>This is just enough abrasion, and not too much, no bad stuff in there, and I can buy 10 of these for the price of the fancy name products.</li>
            <li>I have three skin conditions that primarily bother my face and scalp, it is very rare to buy products that dont irritate at least ONE of them.</li>
            <li>Not overdrying in anyway as my skin does dry impeccably fast which is one main issue I have, it is rare to find products that will not exacerbate it and this one does not.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend also uses it and he has normal skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive blemished skin and the face wash</li>
            <li>is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate it as well as being exfoliating enough to leave you with fresh skin.</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old with normal skin.</li>
            <li>There are many many very expensive scrubs out there, but the &amp;#34;active ingredient&amp;#34; is after all the abrasive in the scrub.  </li>
            <li>It just smells like musty old wood chips.  </li>
            <li>The product does what it is supposed to do as far as exfoliating, but it caused my skin to breakout.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I only need to use a little of it and my face feels so soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>This cleans and softens skin and works well for sensitive skin such as mine without causing redness if you use it gently and  only using it in small  amounts.</li>

            <li> I have three skin conditions that primarily bother my face and scalp, it is very rare to buy products that dont irritate at least ONE of them.

            <li> Great exfoliation.  I like it.  It takes the make up off at night just great.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it feels nice. The graininess of the product is perfect. I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this this face scrub! smells great and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I use it once a day in the shower and it leaves my skin SO soft and clean after use.

            <li> Love it! The lavender smell is not too strong to stir up allergies and it&#x27;s relaxing! Perfect to use b4 bed. Ingredients are nice and it RINSES CLEAN! :)</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel very clean and hydrated especially when you apply a moisturizing cream afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> best stuff I have used!</li>
            <li> Safe to use yet effective!  I was looking for something that can get rid of dead skin cells and bring up the new ones without harsh chemicals and without salicylic acid.  This is the perfect product for my needs!</li>
            <li> Skin feels GREAT after and smells good too!</li>
            <li> The scrub does what a scrub is supposed to to, maybe a bit too vigorously if you aren&#x27;t careful but my complaint is with the scent.  I can&#x27;t smell any lavender here.  It just smells like musty old wood chips.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Its stinky and falls short of my expectations. Was hoping to replace a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; lavender facial scrub I purchased on a family-owned Maui Lavender Farm last year. Will not be buying Avalon Exfoliating Scrub in future..</li>
            <li> I use this enzyme scrub with my Olay Pro-X facial scrubbing brush.  It really helps the brush slough off the dead skin cells.  You can feel the enzymes working, but it doesn&#x27;t sting in any way.  I think it would be a good scrub without the battery-powered brush as well.</li>
            <li> There are many many very expensive scrubs out there, but the &amp;#34;active ingredient&amp;#34; is after all the abrasive in the scrub.  This is just enough abrasion, and not too much, no bad stuff in there, and I can buy 10 of these for the price of the fancy name products.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is great at not irritating my skin and getting rid of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I cant rave enough about this product! I have both this and the cleanser and I will keep repurchasing. My skin is clear and bright for the first time in a while. I do this scrub around 3x a week and use the cleanser the rest of the time. I love these and the smell is wonderful. You get a burst of lavender as you wash your face its soothing and efficient at the same time! I absolutely recommend this product. The seller was also quick and the material was well packaged.</li>
            <li> This cleans and softens skin and works well for sensitive skin such as mine without causing redness if you use it gently and  only using it in small  amounts. It is not smelly, but the lack of scent could be called a scent  as well, which is not one of my favorite scents because i prefer Grapefruit scented face washes. If you like low-odor lavender, then you ,ay not mind this one. It also works well without water to remove wax left from home wax kits,  or sticky things your kids might get into that you can work out with in a hand wash- combo . I have used this product for over 3 years and as other reviews have said, they did change the consistency, and this is indeed a creamier version, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this face wash, or the price! I have very sensitive blemished skin and the face wash is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate it as well as being exfoliating enough to leave you with fresh skin. My boyfriend also uses it and he has normal skin and he finds it moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most stores sell this for much more than this Amazon price, so this is a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li> Used it for years. Stopped chronic zits with daily use.</li>
            <li> I really like the finer grain of the exfoliating substance. It smells lovely, isn&#x27;t overly harsh, and is a good consistency. I love it so far and use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, have used it every other day at night, impressed...</li>
            <li> Great facewash! I have used it for years.  It really keeps my skin clear and the scrub smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this scrub. I like that the particles in it are so small and sand-like, in contrast to the large chunky pieces of apricot pits found in products like St. Ives. I only need to use a little of it and my face feels so soft, and clean. The lavender scent is also wonderful and not overpowering at all (the smell of too much lavender can make me nauseous, so I&#x27;m pretty particular about the strength of scents). This one is not offensive at all. While not a &amp;#34;holistic&amp;#34; product such as Dr. Haushka, it still contains good quality ingredients and is a good compromise price-wise. Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> excellent, received in the time frame stated when I ordered.</li>
            <li> I always come back to this and have for several years. I usually order two or three at a time because I don&#x27;t want to run out. What I have run out and tried other kinds, nothing is ever is good. This doesn&#x27;t leave any waxy residue on my face and it isn&#x27;t over abrasive. I am 45 years old with normal skin.</li>
            <li> The product does what it is supposed to do as far as exfoliating, but it caused my skin to breakout. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out but cleans the pores!</li>
