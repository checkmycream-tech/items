    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>excellent partner for Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>So, we felt we were the perfect people to try out the Sonicare Airfloss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So here I get a chance to try the Sonicare Airfloss Pro and come away impressed.</li>
            <li>So the Sonicare Airfloss Pro is perfect for someone like me - it isn&#x27;t a water pick, it is gentler and easier on your gums and won&#x27;t force air pockets into your gums.</li>
            <li>However, using this at night before bed is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>are very good.  </li>
            <li>It made my mouth feel great.</li>
            <li>a great freshness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I have to say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>, so this provides a great opportunity to compare/</li>
            <li>I can testify it is very effective.</li>
            <li>The head is at the perfect angle to work it&#x27;s magic between teeth and also cleanse under bridges.</li>
            <li>good, and some not so good here.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a water flosser for about a year.</li>
            <li>This is a shame as I really liked the unit and saw great results.</li>
            <li>But what good is a Airfloss Pro</li>
            <li>It does a fair job of blasting air and mouthwash or water between your teeth, but I found myself still having to floss afterwards.</li>
            <li>So, to be fair to Philips</li>
            <li>they work, they are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>nice one, but</li>
            <li>I liked it while it worked.</li>
            <li>I just want you to know that for the price this is a nice unit.  </li>
            <li>I liked flossing with it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>This unit fits nicely in a suitcase or carrying pouch and does not leak.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reality is that if you don&#x27;t floss, something is better than nothing, so even if this isn&#x27;t quite as good as flossing, it is better than not doing anything at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice idea that is working ok, but not as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>pressure bursts aren&#x27;t very strong in my opinion, but they do an ok job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My gums never felt better.  </li>
            <li>just under a $100 (at time of writing this review) I also think there are better options out there.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this device.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact you can use mouthwash with it to give your mouth</li>
            <li>You would think adding one more option of turning it off would not have been a problem.</li>
            <li>You would think adding one more option of turning it off would not have been a problem.</li>
            <li>ok,</li>
            <li>I personally found that the two burst setting was the best for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this is even better.  </li>
            <li>Because of the wider hole on the nozzle, more mouthwash shoots through with every squirt</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps using an airflosser is an acquired skill and takes some time to get better at.</li>
            <li>Ok, we thought...</li>
            <li>Love flossing now.  </li>
            <li>For now, I absolutely love this flosser.</li>
            <li>Now that I am using this Sonicare, I love how it feels and works.</li>
            <li>I found debris come from between my teeth that I am sure</li>
            <li>For me, I think I will mostly just use floss.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I loved the Airfloss Pro.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had a fair amount of bleeding which has diminished with each use until tonight there was none.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have its original package!</li>
            <li>This tool is easy to use and leaves your mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li>The attachment that flosses the teeth was easily put in place, but, unfortunatley, did not stay in place.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to charge and hold.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I was able to return it to Amazon for a full refund, and I then purchased the Sonicare Airploss (NOT the Pro) as a replacement.</li>
            <li>(this comes with a sample of Sonicare mouthwash, but I prefer and use ACT) and the air pop easily pops and pumps mouthwash between my teeth and gums (which makes my rinsing far more effective than swishing alone).</li>
            <li>huge advantage of this unit over a Waterpik is the portability factor.  </li>
            <li>It makes a click-clacking sound as it both bursts air and squirts solution  </li>
            <li>This is a review of a free product from the Amazon Vine program, and after testing is NOT something I would go out and buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>Overall I have to say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I snapped on the water pick head and filled the reservoir with the provided mouthwash.</li>
            <li>One problem he is having is the tip doesn&#x27;t fit well between teeth</li>
            <li>but so far almost everything has been good.</li>
            <li>but I do prefer my waterpik instead because it really has more pressure and gets in between my teeth and gums a lot better.</li>
            <li>At the same time, my dentist warned me away from water pick-type gadgets because they can often do more harm than good.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s super easy to use, just as easy as brushing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My main question was just how effective it truly was.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that my face was minty fresh afterwards!</li>
            <li>the cover seems to stay in place better than the first generation.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, he is using it, which means his teeth are getting cleaner; a much better alternative than not flossing at all.</li>
            <li>IS good for travel, fully charged it has lasted me a week with daily use, but it does go through a lot of mouthwash unless you dilute</li>
            <li>This device is good for those who do not like to floss or who do not floss as often as they should, but it can&#x27;t replace regular flossing.</li>
            <li>But right now, even with the one issue I have I&#x27;m comfortable rating it at five stars.hit</li>
            <li>But right now, even with the one issue I have I&#x27;m comfortable rating it at five stars.</li>
            <li>It gets some if not all food debris out, and does leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Then, the charger quick working.</li>
            <li>three goes through the mouthwash (or water if you choose) too quickly.  </li>
            <li>a quick note on sturdiness</li>
            <li>feel like that the Waterpik provides a better overall clean, as it fit all around your mouth, around your tongue, and can be used to clean the gum area.  </li>
            <li>And it is fun and quick to use.</li>
            <li>It gives my mouth a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I also use a Philips Sonicare toothbrush, so I figured it was worth a shot to try this air flosser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find mouth almost bursting with mouthwash at the end of a complete cycle through all my teeth with the Pro, much more than with the standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if I didn&#x27;t already own the Airfloss standard then I probably would have rated this 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>, if I didn&#x27;t already own the Airfloss standard then I probably would have rated this 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying for those who can&#x27;t use string floss.</li>
            <li>On the up side, the bursts are powerful to knock stuff out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t start using it right after I received it</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t do as good of a job as normal floss, although it does help to remove larger debris between the teeth, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only the dentist will be able to tell for sure, but my gums feel healthier, less irritated and look healthier already.</li>
            <li>It is less effective than my older Waterpik too, though a bit more portable.</li>
            <li>It is pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>Please feel free to ask me anything, as I regularly monitor my reviews for questions.esn&#x27;t sound quite right.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced by the air + water combination, I don&#x27;t think my mouth feels as clean as with the other model, but at the end of the day it is far superior to not flossing, or just using floss thread.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li>If you look at the picture graphics on each product, it actually portrays the tip very accurately when shooting mouthwash between the teeth</li>
            <li>I like to make sure the blue liquid it comes with moves through my gaps between teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have a first generation Air Flosser and like it a lot</li>
            <li>I love the Airfloss and its ability to replace traditional flossing.  </li>
            <li>If I were to compare it to something, imagine running a standard water hose and putting your thumb at the end to create more pressure -- this is comparable to the Pro.  </li>
            <li>What could be better than to take a portable flosser on vacation instead of the much larger Water Pik?  </li>
            <li>When the flosser arrived, I plugged it in for the required twenty-four hours and then prepared to try the machine for the first time.  </li>
            <li>But as I have been using it consistently for over a week now, I have seen no problems.</li>
            <li>There are enough pluses to make it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just not been consistent pretty much my whole life.</li>
            <li>It is not as easy to use around the teeth and gum-line as the larger model I have with the flexible wand.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>My dentist and hygienist have both commented on how improved my teeth and gum health are, so I would would certainly recommend this type of cleaning to supplement brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days of use, both the husband and I got the hang of the Airfloss and began to love it!</li>
            <li>The whole thing stopped working after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if your ears aren&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;t picky!</li>
            <li>I have used both Listerine and water in the unit and they both work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please feel free to ask me anything, as I regularly monitor my reviews for questions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read, I wouldn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the longevity of a replacement unit.</li>
            <li>The next day #3 started making the tell-tale sound that said it was on</li>
            <li>I am not an incredibly patient person, particularly when it comes to something that makes me uncomfortable like flossing.  </li>
            <li>first I was glad that the reservoir was 2x bigger, thinking that I could put enough in there to last a full day.  </li>
            <li>The main reason is that the tip of the nozzle fits very well between any two teeth where they intersect the gumline.  </li>
            <li>The Tips for this and the first generation are not interchangeable, the bases have different shapes, so buy the right tip for your particular air flosser.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like that the Pro uses about 4-6x more mouthwash than the standard, making me feel like it&#x27;s being less efficient, wasting more mouthwash while performing the same job.  </li>
            <li>: the Pro makes a loud clicking sound when pulsing that the standard does not.  </li>
            <li>main flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>main flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not a large device and it is easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this flossing device.  </li>
            <li>It also gave my mouth a cleaner, fresher feel than our normal mouthwash.</li>
            <li>He finds floss of any kind difficult to use and has given up despite being told it really is necessary for healthy gums.</li>
            <li>However, because this is advertised as a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model, yet does not live up to what I would expect a \\&quot;version two\\&quot; or a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model to be as compared to \\&quot;version one\\&quot; or \\&quot;standard\\&quot;, then I knock off a star because there is a better value in the Standard version.  </li>
            <li>However, because this is advertised as a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model, yet does not live up to what I would expect a \\&quot;version two\\&quot; or a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model to be as compared to \\&quot;version one\\&quot; or \\&quot;standard\\&quot;, then I knock off a star because there is a better value in the Standard version.  </li>
            <li>Economics reports that the use of Airfloss removes nearly twice as much plaque as brushing, and that the compliance rate (people actually using it) is much higher than dental</li>
            <li>I just need a new charger.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s new technology.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, when the new model came out, we bought 3,</li>
            <li>This was fairly easy to do by feel after a little practice.</li>
            <li>I actually find this fun to use and am using it twice daily now when I normally brush my teeth</li>
            <li>The Waterpik  has a constant flow of water, while this has a certain number of bursts based upon the setting.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s fast and simple, it&#x27;s probably an easier habit to keep up than using dental</li>
            <li>715500 ORTHOgami Starter Kit, Flossing for Braces]] to help with this problem, but it&#x27;s still akward and hurts my hands (I&#x27;m in the early stages of arthritis, too).  </li>
            <li>initial charge, it was ready to go.</li>
            <li>so I know my mouth is far healthier.</li>
            <li>Many people write that the machine simply does not work after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>A full charge lasts about 2 weeks with typical use, in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reservoir is noticeably bigger (about 3x), but other than that, the two are pretty much identical.  </li>
            <li>First of all, this is not really a flosser.</li>
            <li>On the down side (for me anyway), the bursts are so powerful they bother my teeth</li>
            <li>I like this new flosser, and it is quite different than the Oral B one I have.  </li>
            <li>As I do not floss regularly, I think adding it to my daily tooth cleaning routine is very helpful.</li>
            <li>It makes your mouth so clean; and for me it is better because I have bridges which contribute to bad breath.  </li>
            <li>It takes about half as much time as flossing does, and though I don&#x27;t think it does QUITE as well as traditional flossing, particularly in between your teeth away from your gums, it does make a difference at the gumline -</li>
            <li>The Pro nozzle is bigger at the tip where mouthwash comes out, perhaps they intended more liquid to get through the pro as to create less back-pressure due to a smaller tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Taking into account the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I wouldn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the longevity of a replacement unit.</li>
            <li>The Pro nozzle, being about 3-4x bigger in diameter, feels awkward as it doesn&#x27;t quite fit snuggly between the teeth, and really doesn&#x27;t seem to burst with as much pressure as the standard, leaving me with that feeling like there could still be something in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done it will stay active and ready to use until it falls asleep.</li>
            <li>The tank holds enough liquid for a stop at each space between teeth and maybe a couple of extra stops for problem areas, but its capacity is limited and need to be refilled if you want a real thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li>first attempt at using it was messy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no big deal, it only takes a few seconds, but it is worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my other  plug in model has a large reservoir tank, and that&#x27;s my first gripe - the tank on this, albeit portable is too small to do a thorough clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is a shame because Philips has a decent, if slightly flawed, product here that can fit</li>
            <li>That is a shame because Philips has a decent, if slightly flawed, product here that can fit a niche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, my gums bled the first few times I used it, but since then I have not seen the same impact</li>
            <li>— it&#x27;s just a little too large.</li>
            <li>and I appreciated the less burny feel than the Listerine we currently use.</li>

            <li> The first time I used it I had a fair amount of bleeding which has diminished with each use until tonight there was none.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have its original package!</li>
            <li> This tool is easy to use and leaves your mouth refreshed.</li>
            <li> The attachment that flosses the teeth was easily put in place, but, unfortunatley, did not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to charge and hold.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I was able to return it to Amazon for a full refund, and I then purchased the Sonicare Airploss (NOT the Pro) as a replacement.</li>
            <li> (this comes with a sample of Sonicare mouthwash, but I prefer and use ACT) and the air pop easily pops and pumps mouthwash between my teeth and gums (which makes my rinsing far more effective than swishing alone).</li>
            <li> huge advantage of this unit over a Waterpik is the portability factor.  </li>
            <li> It makes a click-clacking sound as it both bursts air and squirts solution  </li>
            <li> This is a review of a free product from the Amazon Vine program, and after testing is NOT something I would go out and buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> Overall I have to say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I snapped on the water pick head and filled the reservoir with the provided mouthwash.</li>
            <li> One problem he is having is the tip doesn&#x27;t fit well between teeth</li>
            <li> but so far almost everything has been good.</li>
            <li> but I do prefer my waterpik instead because it really has more pressure and gets in between my teeth and gums a lot better.</li>
            <li> At the same time, my dentist warned me away from water pick-type gadgets because they can often do more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s super easy to use, just as easy as brushing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My main question was just how effective it truly was.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that my face was minty fresh afterwards!</li>
            <li> the cover seems to stay in place better than the first generation.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, he is using it, which means his teeth are getting cleaner; a much better alternative than not flossing at all.</li>
            <li> IS good for travel, fully charged it has lasted me a week with daily use, but it does go through a lot of mouthwash unless you dilute</li>
            <li> This device is good for those who do not like to floss or who do not floss as often as they should, but it can&#x27;t replace regular flossing.</li>
            <li> But right now, even with the one issue I have I&#x27;m comfortable rating it at five stars.hit</li>
            <li> But right now, even with the one issue I have I&#x27;m comfortable rating it at five stars.</li>
            <li> It gets some if not all food debris out, and does leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Then, the charger quick working.</li>
            <li> three goes through the mouthwash (or water if you choose) too quickly.  </li>
            <li> a quick note on sturdiness</li>
            <li> feel like that the Waterpik provides a better overall clean, as it fit all around your mouth, around your tongue, and can be used to clean the gum area.  </li>
            <li> And it is fun and quick to use.</li>
            <li> It gives my mouth a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I also use a Philips Sonicare toothbrush, so I figured it was worth a shot to try this air flosser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find mouth almost bursting with mouthwash at the end of a complete cycle through all my teeth with the Pro, much more than with the standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if I didn&#x27;t already own the Airfloss standard then I probably would have rated this 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> , if I didn&#x27;t already own the Airfloss standard then I probably would have rated this 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying for those who can&#x27;t use string floss.</li>
            <li> On the up side, the bursts are powerful to knock stuff out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start using it right after I received it</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t do as good of a job as normal floss, although it does help to remove larger debris between the teeth, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only the dentist will be able to tell for sure, but my gums feel healthier, less irritated and look healthier already.</li>
            <li> It is less effective than my older Waterpik too, though a bit more portable.</li>
            <li> It is pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> Please feel free to ask me anything, as I regularly monitor my reviews for questions.esn&#x27;t sound quite right.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced by the air + water combination, I don&#x27;t think my mouth feels as clean as with the other model, but at the end of the day it is far superior to not flossing, or just using floss thread.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li> If you look at the picture graphics on each product, it actually portrays the tip very accurately when shooting mouthwash between the teeth</li>
            <li> I like to make sure the blue liquid it comes with moves through my gaps between teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have a first generation Air Flosser and like it a lot</li>
            <li> I love the Airfloss and its ability to replace traditional flossing.  </li>
            <li> If I were to compare it to something, imagine running a standard water hose and putting your thumb at the end to create more pressure -- this is comparable to the Pro.  </li>
            <li> What could be better than to take a portable flosser on vacation instead of the much larger Water Pik?  </li>
            <li> When the flosser arrived, I plugged it in for the required twenty-four hours and then prepared to try the machine for the first time.  </li>
            <li> But as I have been using it consistently for over a week now, I have seen no problems.</li>
            <li> There are enough pluses to make it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just not been consistent pretty much my whole life.</li>
            <li> It is not as easy to use around the teeth and gum-line as the larger model I have with the flexible wand.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> My dentist and hygienist have both commented on how improved my teeth and gum health are, so I would would certainly recommend this type of cleaning to supplement brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days of use, both the husband and I got the hang of the Airfloss and began to love it!</li>
            <li> The whole thing stopped working after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if your ears aren&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;t picky!</li>
            <li> I have used both Listerine and water in the unit and they both work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please feel free to ask me anything, as I regularly monitor my reviews for questions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read, I wouldn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the longevity of a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> The next day #3 started making the tell-tale sound that said it was on</li>
            <li> I am not an incredibly patient person, particularly when it comes to something that makes me uncomfortable like flossing.  </li>
            <li> first I was glad that the reservoir was 2x bigger, thinking that I could put enough in there to last a full day.  </li>
            <li> The main reason is that the tip of the nozzle fits very well between any two teeth where they intersect the gumline.  </li>
            <li> The Tips for this and the first generation are not interchangeable, the bases have different shapes, so buy the right tip for your particular air flosser.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like that the Pro uses about 4-6x more mouthwash than the standard, making me feel like it&#x27;s being less efficient, wasting more mouthwash while performing the same job.  </li>
            <li> : the Pro makes a loud clicking sound when pulsing that the standard does not.  </li>
            <li> main flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> main flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a large device and it is easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this flossing device.  </li>
            <li> It also gave my mouth a cleaner, fresher feel than our normal mouthwash.</li>
            <li> He finds floss of any kind difficult to use and has given up despite being told it really is necessary for healthy gums.</li>
            <li> However, because this is advertised as a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model, yet does not live up to what I would expect a \\&quot;version two\\&quot; or a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model to be as compared to \\&quot;version one\\&quot; or \\&quot;standard\\&quot;, then I knock off a star because there is a better value in the Standard version.  </li>

            <li> Economics reports that the use of Airfloss removes nearly twice as much plaque as brushing, and that the compliance rate (people actually using it) is much higher than dental</li>
            <li> I just need a new charger.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s new technology.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, when the new model came out, we bought 3,</li>
            <li> This was fairly easy to do by feel after a little practice.</li>
            <li> I actually find this fun to use and am using it twice daily now when I normally brush my teeth</li>
            <li> The Waterpik  has a constant flow of water, while this has a certain number of bursts based upon the setting.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s fast and simple, it&#x27;s probably an easier habit to keep up than using dental</li>
            <li> 715500 ORTHOgami Starter Kit, Flossing for Braces]] to help with this problem, but it&#x27;s still akward and hurts my hands (I&#x27;m in the early stages of arthritis, too).  </li>
            <li> initial charge, it was ready to go.</li>
            <li> so I know my mouth is far healthier.</li>
            <li> Many people write that the machine simply does not work after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> A full charge lasts about 2 weeks with typical use, in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reservoir is noticeably bigger (about 3x), but other than that, the two are pretty much identical.  </li>
            <li> First of all, this is not really a flosser.</li>
            <li> On the down side (for me anyway), the bursts are so powerful they bother my teeth</li>
            <li> I like this new flosser, and it is quite different than the Oral B one I have.  </li>
            <li> As I do not floss regularly, I think adding it to my daily tooth cleaning routine is very helpful.</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth so clean; and for me it is better because I have bridges which contribute to bad breath.  </li>
            <li> It takes about half as much time as flossing does, and though I don&#x27;t think it does QUITE as well as traditional flossing, particularly in between your teeth away from your gums, it does make a difference at the gumline -</li>
            <li> The Pro nozzle is bigger at the tip where mouthwash comes out, perhaps they intended more liquid to get through the pro as to create less back-pressure due to a smaller tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Taking into account the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I wouldn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the longevity of a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> The Pro nozzle, being about 3-4x bigger in diameter, feels awkward as it doesn&#x27;t quite fit snuggly between the teeth, and really doesn&#x27;t seem to burst with as much pressure as the standard, leaving me with that feeling like there could still be something in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done it will stay active and ready to use until it falls asleep.</li>
            <li> The tank holds enough liquid for a stop at each space between teeth and maybe a couple of extra stops for problem areas, but its capacity is limited and need to be refilled if you want a real thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li> first attempt at using it was messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no big deal, it only takes a few seconds, but it is worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my other  plug in model has a large reservoir tank, and that&#x27;s my first gripe - the tank on this, albeit portable is too small to do a thorough clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is a shame because Philips has a decent, if slightly flawed, product here that can fit</li>
            <li> That is a shame because Philips has a decent, if slightly flawed, product here that can fit a niche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, my gums bled the first few times I used it, but since then I have not seen the same impact</li>
            <li> — it&#x27;s just a little too large.</li>
            <li> and I appreciated the less burny feel than the Listerine we currently use.</li>
            <li> far, it has held a charge for two weeks without needing a charge, with use every other day.</li>
            <li> I am an avid flosser, but sometimes it is hard to get in the back.</li>
            <li> I could do without the click clacking (I just realized how funny that sounds), but at least you know it is working.  </li>
            <li> There is a small switch at the bottom that you push to awaken the unit when you&#x27;re ready to use it, and to toggle through whether you want it to spray once, twice, or three times per time you hit the button.</li>

            <li> but thanks to Philips is there no more.</li>
            <li> It takes a little care to position the tip correctly AND keep your mouth closed to avoid messes, but my mouth and teeth felt much, much cleaner than brushing and swishing mouthwash alone (for which we both use electric toothbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product while it works but frustrating when it fails so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a little bit of figuring out how do keep the liquid in my mouth and how to get the right position, it takes just a few moments to squirt the liquid between each tooth, rinse, spit and voila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those that don&#x27;t know, the Pro has up to three (3) bursts per click, while the standard Airfloss is limited to one burst per click.</li>
            <li> biggest feature difference with the pro is the option to set it to single, double, or triple pulse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying and doesn&#x27;t sound quite right.  </li>
            <li> Pro is bigger than the standard, taller by about 1/2 inch and just slightly fatter.  </li>
            <li> I can change it to single-pulse which will save on the mouthwash, but then it&#x27;s basically the same as the standard, but with less</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether it is a new one or a refurbished one.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I would estimate that you use almost 6x the amount of mouthwash with a single use.  </li>
            <li> I had to keep my lips shut and head tilted back, or mouthwash would squirt out and drip down my chin.</li>
            <li> It takes a little patience but overall he likes the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So be careful where you aim the thing.</li>
            <li> So be careful where you aim the thing.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use standard Airfloss nozzles with the Pro or vice versa, they just don&#x27;t fit because the form-factor at the base is different.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nice that it us rechargeable because that means you don&#x27;t have to have the base on the counter all the time...</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers mine didn&#x27;t get stuck in a firing mode until the battery dies.</li>

            <li> After reading other lower rated reviews out here, I hesitated giving this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I hate it as I can&#x27;t get my hands far enough back in my mouth to do the molars, and my teeth are crooked</li>
            <li> They send for a new flosser and the new arrival is as bad as the one sent back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a little adjustment going from the Waterpik to the air flosser, but the learning curve was minimal.  </li>

            <li> You can pick1-3 burst for each tooth and just hold the button down for burst every few seconds as you move tooth to tooth.  </li>
            <li> It stopped working a little over a month after purchasing it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The flosser came with the flosser, the charger, and a little thing of mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a small door on the side that allows you to put in water, mouthwash, or other liquids.  </li>
            <li> (yes the bottom lights came on when on the charging stand), but when I went to use it again, the unit was dead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have not experienced the failures that some of the reviewers have discussed after a few weeks of daily usage.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is fairly small and I typically refill a few times before I feel done with &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and what a mess!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Airfloss Pro was purchased on 03.04.2015, and failed less that three weeks later.</li>
            <li> I hate using it as it tends, in my opinion, not do the job adequately unless I spend a lot of time doing it.</li>
            <li> I checked other reviews and found that this is an all too common complaint for this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if we should be ashamed or not, but the hubby and I aren&#x27;t flossers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a small, compact size so he can conveniently leave it out on the vanity shelf.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because of the small size, it doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of mouthwash and sometimes runs out of liquid before finishing, especially on the triple pulse setting.</li>
            <li> I am usually a random (not regular) flosser and use floss.</li>
            <li> While a portable all-in-one design, it was still a bit clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> then checked the reviews of this flosser on Amazon and found that problems with this flosser are common..  </li>
            <li> not great at all, stopped working in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Not worth the one star due to bad engineering.  </li>
            <li> Update 9/11/2015: After less than three weeks the unit failed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a little skeptical about quality.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Sadly, this flosser was broken on arrival.  </li>
            <li> testing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate</li>
            <li> If anything changes where this unit fails, I will edit and update my review and rating.</li>
            <li> , if you accidentally have it at the wrong angle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying, time consuming if you&#x27;re doing it correctly, and just plain slimy.</li>
            <li> I want SO badly to use this product, but they should not be on the market yet.</li>
            <li> This product is badly manufactured.  </li>
            <li> I just hate using dental floss or dental tape.</li>
            <li> you can just use the base as needed to charge.</li>

            <li> This item is unpacked! It doesn&#x27;t have its original package! I am not sure whether it is a new one or a refurbished one.</li>
            <li> nice one, but what is the different between this pro with the 8211one?</li>
            <li> It stopped working a little over a month after purchasing it. I liked it while it worked.</li>
            <li> The on/off button stopped working in a week. The whole thing stopped working after 3 weeks. I didn&#x27;t start using it right after I received it so it has passed the return period-I&#x27;m stuck with this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> not great at all, stopped working in just a few days. had to call the philips people and had to have it replaced. and that took almost 3 weeks just to get the replacement.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I loved the Airfloss Pro. Then, the charger quick working. I&#x27;ve procrastinated sending it back, but will do it soon. I just need a new charger.</li>
            <li> It gives my mouth a fresh feeling. I don&#x27;t think this is a replacement for flossing. As I do not floss regularly, I think adding it to my daily tooth cleaning routine is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I like this new flosser, and it is quite different than the Oral B one I have.  I definitely crank it up!  I like to make sure the blue liquid it comes with moves through my gaps between teeth.  It makes a click-clacking sound as it both bursts air and squirts solution  The solution is like mouthwash.  It makes your mouth so clean; and for me it is better because I have bridges which contribute to bad breath.  I could do without the click clacking (I just realized how funny that sounds), but at least you know it is working.  My gums never felt better.  What a treat for this anti-flosser.  I just want you to know that for the price this is a nice unit.  It does hold a charge and results are very good.  I highly recommend it if your ears aren&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;t picky!</li>
            <li> Not worth the one star due to bad engineering.  I liked flossing with it for a couple of weeks then it stopped working.  It is a device that sprays liquid but you can not get the handle set because it  allows fluid into the circuitry.  When this happens it breaks and you no longer have a device that works.</li>
            <li> This is a review of a free product from the Amazon Vine program, and after testing is NOT something I would go out and buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some good, and some not so good here.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a water flosser for about a year. My dentist and hygienist have both commented on how improved my teeth and gum health are, so I would would certainly recommend this type of cleaning to supplement brushing.&lt;br /&gt;However, my other  plug in model has a large reservoir tank, and that&#x27;s my first gripe - the tank on this, albeit portable is too small to do a thorough clean.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I didn&#x27;t think this made that well, or ergonomically designed. It is not as easy to use around the teeth and gum-line as the larger model I have with the flexible wand.&lt;br /&gt;It IS good for travel, fully charged it has lasted me a week with daily use, but it does go through a lot of mouthwash unless you dilute it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced by the air + water combination, I don&#x27;t think my mouth feels as clean as with the other model, but at the end of the day it is far superior to not flossing, or just using floss thread.&lt;br /&gt;Having read the number of reviews her about the product breaking or not working I&#x27;m also a little skeptical about quality.&lt;br /&gt;At just under a $100 (at time of writing this review) I also think there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> This tool is easy to use and leaves your mouth refreshed. It sends jets of air, water, and/or mouthwash between your teeth as an alternative to flossing for those who are not regular flossers. Since it&#x27;s fast and simple, it&#x27;s probably an easier habit to keep up than using dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dental Economics reports that the use of Airfloss removes nearly twice as much plaque as brushing, and that the compliance rate (people actually using it) is much higher than dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent partner for Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this device. It made my mouth feel great. But, as others have mentioned, it got stuck in auto-fire mode and eventually stopped working as of this morning. I&#x27;m trying to communicate with Philips, we&#x27;ll see how it goes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if we should be ashamed or not, but the hubby and I aren&#x27;t flossers. In fact, there isn&#x27;t even a container of floss in the medicine cabinet. So, we felt we were the perfect people to try out the Sonicare Airfloss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first attempt at using it was messy. As I was trying to position the tip in my mouth, I accidentally bumped the &#x27;fire&#x27; button. The default spray is 3 bursts...and what a mess! Mouthwash was everywhere in the bathroom! All I can say is that my face was minty fresh afterwards! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of use, both the husband and I got the hang of the Airfloss and began to love it! It takes a little care to position the tip correctly AND keep your mouth closed to avoid messes, but my mouth and teeth felt much, much cleaner than brushing and swishing mouthwash alone (for which we both use electric toothbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Airfloss came with a sample of mouthwash, BreathRX. It does not contain alcohol and I appreciated the less burny feel than the Listerine we currently use. It also gave my mouth a cleaner, fresher feel than our normal mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Update 9/11/2015: After less than three weeks the unit failed. Unlike other reviewers mine didn&#x27;t get stuck in a firing mode until the battery dies. No, mine just stopped working. When I push the button all I get is a short three-second whine, then nothing. I thought maybe the battery needed recharging so I plugged it in over night. In the morning, same result. This is a shame as I really liked the unit and saw great results. But what good is a Airfloss Pro is it dies in less than three weeks. I am so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final recommendation...stay away from this. Great product while it works but frustrating when it fails so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a few other reviews I&#x27;ve been concerned with and waiting for the unit to get stuck in pulse mode and just keep spraying but so far almost everything has been good. Almost everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I&#x27;ve been hoping something like this would come along. I am a horrible flosser. I just hate using dental floss or dental tape. It&#x27;s annoying, time consuming if you&#x27;re doing it correctly, and just plain slimy. I&#x27;ve just not been consistent pretty much my whole life. So here I get a chance to try the Sonicare Airfloss Pro and come away impressed. My main question was just how effective it truly was. I can testify it is very effective. The first time I used it I had a fair amount of bleeding which has diminished with each use until tonight there was none. The head is at the perfect angle to work it&#x27;s magic between teeth and also cleanse under bridges. I also love the fact you can use mouthwash with it to give your mouth a great freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what, you may ask, is my one issue? There is no off button. When you&#x27;re done it will stay active and ready to use until it falls asleep. The problem with that is if you wipe it off or just mishandle it you can accidentally hit the pulse button and spray whatever is in it&#x27;s way. I have managed to spray myself in the face once and the bathroom mirror twice. There is a small switch at the bottom that you push to awaken the unit when you&#x27;re ready to use it, and to toggle through whether you want it to spray once, twice, or three times per time you hit the button. You would think adding one more option of turning it off would not have been a problem. But no. So be careful where you aim the thing. By the way, I have it set for two pulses as I find three goes through the mouthwash (or water if you choose) too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have to say it&#x27;s great. If I have the issues other reviews mention then I&#x27;ll update my review and revise my rating. But right now, even with the one issue I have I&#x27;m comfortable rating it at five stars.hit the pulse button and spray whatever is in it&#x27;s way.

            <li> This device is good for those who do not like to floss or who do not floss as often as they should, but it can&#x27;t replace regular flossing. It can&#x27;t do as good of a job as normal floss, although it does help to remove larger debris between the teeth, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a large device and it is easy to handle and use. The reservoir is fairly small and I typically refill a few times before I feel done with &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure bursts aren&#x27;t very strong in my opinion, but they do an ok job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice that it us rechargeable because that means you don&#x27;t have to have the base on the counter all the time... you can just use the base as needed to charge. A full charge lasts about 2 weeks with typical use, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok, but I do prefer my waterpik instead because it really has more pressure and gets in between my teeth and gums a lot better.</li>
            <li> This was a piece of junk. The Sonicare Airfloss Pro was purchased on 03.04.2015, and failed less that three weeks later. Thankfully, I was able to return it to Amazon for a full refund, and I then purchased the Sonicare Airploss (NOT the Pro) as a replacement. For those that don&#x27;t know, the Pro has up to three (3) bursts per click, while the standard Airfloss is limited to one burst per click.</li>
            <li> I have used a Waterpik for the last four years, as I wore braces for two years and then had to deal with tighter teeth when the braces were removed.  I also use a Philips Sonicare toothbrush, so I figured it was worth a shot to try this air flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser came with the flosser, the charger, and a little thing of mouthwash.  I am Listerine fan, so I have not tried the mouthwash.  The unit came with about 2/3 charge, though the instructions tell you to charge it fully before using, so I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a small door on the side that allows you to put in water, mouthwash, or other liquids.  I have used both Listerine and water in the unit and they both work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a little adjustment going from the Waterpik to the air flosser, but the learning curve was minimal.  The Waterpik  has a constant flow of water, while this has a certain number of bursts based upon the setting.  I personally found that the two burst setting was the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like that the Waterpik provides a better overall clean, as it fit all around your mouth, around your tongue, and can be used to clean the gum area.  However, this unit is meant to be a flosser and it is well at doing that by cleaning between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One huge advantage of this unit over a Waterpik is the portability factor.  I have taken Waterpiks on vacation, but they are bulky and can leak if you do not drain them.  This unit fits nicely in a suitcase or carrying pouch and does not leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not experienced the failures that some of the reviewers have discussed after a few weeks of daily usage.</li>
            <li> I have a first generation Air Flosser and like it a lot but this is even better.  You can pick1-3 burst for each tooth and just hold the button down for burst every few seconds as you move tooth to tooth.  Larger reservoir and the cover seems to stay in place better than the first generation.  The Tips for this and the first generation are not interchangeable, the bases have different shapes, so buy the right tip for your particular air flosser.</li>
            <li> I am an inconsistent brusher (don&#x27;t tell my dentist), but I get the importance of flossing. At the same time, my dentist warned me away from water pick-type gadgets because they can often do more harm than good. So the Sonicare Airfloss Pro is perfect for someone like me - it isn&#x27;t a water pick, it is gentler and easier on your gums and won&#x27;t force air pockets into your gums. It takes about half as much time as flossing does, and though I don&#x27;t think it does QUITE as well as traditional flossing, particularly in between your teeth away from your gums, it does make a difference at the gumline - I can already tell that my gums are looking and feeling healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how it works: fill the reservoir with water/mouthwash/a blend of the two, choose whether you want one, two or three bursts of liquid and position it between your teeth. After a little bit of figuring out how do keep the liquid in my mouth and how to get the right position, it takes just a few moments to squirt the liquid between each tooth, rinse, spit and voila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it has held a charge for two weeks without needing a charge, with use every other day. It charges quickly and is easy to use and clean. I do find that the reservoir has to be refilled daily if I am using the 3 burst setting. It&#x27;s no big deal, it only takes a few seconds, but it is worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the dentist will be able to tell for sure, but my gums feel healthier, less irritated and look healthier already. The reality is that if you don&#x27;t floss, something is better than nothing, so even if this isn&#x27;t quite as good as flossing, it is better than not doing anything at all. And it is fun and quick to use. Win/win.</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying I never floss.  I hate it as I can&#x27;t get my hands far enough back in my mouth to do the molars, and my teeth are crooked so they get catch/trap the floss often.  I got the [[ASIN:B00J5BM03A Gumchucks 715500 ORTHOgami Starter Kit, Flossing for Braces]] to help with this problem, but it&#x27;s still akward and hurts my hands (I&#x27;m in the early stages of arthritis, too).  I am not an incredibly patient person, particularly when it comes to something that makes me uncomfortable like flossing.  I love the Airfloss and its ability to replace traditional flossing.  My dental hygiene has skyrocketed, and my dentist visits no longer result in cavities!!  Plus, it&#x27;s super easy to use, just as easy as brushing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already had the [[ASIN:B00CUG270S Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser]], so this provides a great opportunity to compare/contrast the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro is bigger than the standard, taller by about 1/2 inch and just slightly fatter.  The reservoir is noticeably bigger (about 3x), but other than that, the two are pretty much identical.  Here are the functional differences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replaceable nozzles are not the same.  You can&#x27;t use standard Airfloss nozzles with the Pro or vice versa, they just don&#x27;t fit because the form-factor at the base is different.  The Pro nozzle is bigger at the tip where mouthwash comes out, perhaps they intended more liquid to get through the pro as to create less back-pressure due to a smaller tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was glad that the reservoir was 2x bigger, thinking that I could put enough in there to last a full day.  With the standard version, I would have to refill every time I flossed, which means once at night and once in the morning.  I was hoping that with this version I could fill it up only once per day.  Not the case.  Because of the wider hole on the nozzle, more mouthwash shoots through with every squirt (I would estimate about 2x the amount of maouthwash per pulse is used with the Pro than with the standard).  If I were to compare it to something, imagine running a standard water hose and putting your thumb at the end to create more pressure -- this is comparable to the Pro.  Now imagine a pressure washer.  This is comparable to the Standard.  That is how I compare these two models when it comes to the pressure output at the nozzle.  If you look at the picture graphics on each product, it actually portrays the tip very accurately when shooting mouthwash between the teeth/gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest feature difference with the pro is the option to set it to single, double, or triple pulse.  There is only one button, but it has 3 LEDs that indicate single/double/triple pulse (each press cycles through).  I have it set to triple pulse.  Therefore, I would estimate that you use almost 6x the amount of mouthwash with a single use.  I find mouth almost bursting with mouthwash at the end of a complete cycle through all my teeth with the Pro, much more than with the standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I do like the triple pulse, I must say that I prefer my Airfloss standard.  The main reason is that the tip of the nozzle fits very well between any two teeth where they intersect the gumline.  The Pro nozzle, being about 3-4x bigger in diameter, feels awkward as it doesn&#x27;t quite fit snuggly between the teeth, and really doesn&#x27;t seem to burst with as much pressure as the standard, leaving me with that feeling like there could still be something in between my teeth.  I also don&#x27;t like that the Pro uses about 4-6x more mouthwash than the standard, making me feel like it&#x27;s being less efficient, wasting more mouthwash while performing the same job.  I can change it to single-pulse which will save on the mouthwash, but then it&#x27;s basically the same as the standard, but with less pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick note on sturdiness: the Pro makes a loud clicking sound when pulsing that the standard does not.  It&#x27;s annoying and doesn&#x27;t sound quite right.  I may have got a product that is slightly defective.  Still, this has no effect on the size of the nozzle at the tip, which I believe to be this products main flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if I didn&#x27;t already own the Airfloss standard then I probably would have rated this 4 stars.  However, because this is advertised as a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model, yet does not live up to what I would expect a \\&quot;version two\\&quot; or a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; model to be as compared to \\&quot;version one\\&quot; or \\&quot;standard\\&quot;, then I knock off a star because there is a better value in the Standard version.  I hope this helped you choose between the two in case you were stuck wondering which one to get!  Please feel free to ask me anything, as I regularly monitor my reviews for questions.esn&#x27;t sound quite right.  I may have got a product that is slightly defective.

            <li> First of all, this is not really a flosser. It is less effective than my older Waterpik too, though a bit more portable. It does a fair job of blasting air and mouthwash or water between your teeth, but I found myself still having to floss afterwards. I am not a big fan of flossing, and was hoping Philips&#x27; Airfloss Pro would be the answer. That brings me my second point. It died in about a week after arriving in the mail. It won&#x27;t work, even after charging. I checked other reviews and found that this is an all too common complaint for this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it did work, I perhaps would give it three stars. After a 24 hour (!) initial charge, it was ready to go. I snapped on the water pick head and filled the reservoir with the provided mouthwash. I pressed the bottom button until I got 3-burst mode and went to work. Nestle the tip at the gum line at the spaces between teeth. This was fairly easy to do by feel after a little practice. It blasts the air and liquid between the teeth. It gets some if not all food debris out, and does leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean. While a portable all-in-one design, it was still a bit clumsy to use. I had to keep my lips shut and head tilted back, or mouthwash would squirt out and drip down my chin. The tank holds enough liquid for a stop at each space between teeth and maybe a couple of extra stops for problem areas, but its capacity is limited and need to be refilled if you want a real thorough cleansing. I also didn&#x27;t overly care for the flavor of the mouthwash, so use my purple Listerine mixed with equal parts water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Sonicare HX8331/30 is also a bit noisy, so don&#x27;t use this in the morning if you don&#x27;t want to wake up someone in the room outside the bathroom. The charge last for about 30 minutes of use, and after my initial charge ran out, I charge it again (yes the bottom lights came on when on the charging stand), but when I went to use it again, the unit was dead. Taking into account the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I wouldn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the longevity of a replacement unit. That is a shame because Philips has a decent, if slightly flawed, product here that can fit a niche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kortreviews I&#x27;ve read, I wouldn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the longevity of a replacement unit.

            <li> I am a routine flosser; my husband is not. He finds floss of any kind difficult to use and has given up despite being told it really is necessary for healthy gums. So I jumped at the chance to try the Sonicare Airflosser for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice idea that is working ok, but not as well as I had hoped. It is simple enough to use, but the actual implementation is a bit clunky. It takes a little patience but overall he likes the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a small, compact size so he can conveniently leave it out on the vanity shelf. Unfortunately, because of the small size, it doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of mouthwash and sometimes runs out of liquid before finishing, especially on the triple pulse setting. One problem he is having is the tip doesn&#x27;t fit well between teeth — it&#x27;s just a little too large. Also, the tip is not flexible, which makes it more difficult to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps using an airflosser is an acquired skill and takes some time to get better at. On a positive note, he is using it, which means his teeth are getting cleaner; a much better alternative than not flossing at all. Definitely worth trying for those who can&#x27;t use string floss.</li>
            <li> We bought an AirFloss 1 year ago, it dies within 3 months. Ok, we thought...it&#x27;s new technology. We will wait until they update it.&lt;br /&gt;So, when the new model came out, we bought 3, one for every member of our family.&lt;br /&gt;#1 died in week. We exchanged it at the store.&lt;br /&gt;#2 died a week later. The next day #3 started making the tell-tale sound that said it was on it&#x27;s last legs.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement for #1? It died a week later.&lt;br /&gt;Now, all of them have been returned for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;When they work, they are amazing. I want SO badly to use this product, but they should not be on the market yet. Phillips obviously rushed to market without proper testing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate because my trust in the brand has been eroded. I have been a sonicare user for 15 years and have always been a vocal evangelist of them. However, it&#x27;s going to take a lot to convince me to ever buy an airfloss again.</li>
            <li> i have had 2 of these that stooped working.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Love flossing now.  Still need toothpick flossing during the day.  However, using this at night before bed is amazing!!! Get the Antibacterial Sonicare Mouthwash.Its designed for the prodcut and less chance of buildup.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this flossing device.  What could be better than to take a portable flosser on vacation instead of the much larger Water Pik?  When the flosser arrived, I plugged it in for the required twenty-four hours and then prepared to try the machine for the first time.  Sadly, this flosser was broken on arrival.  The attachment that flosses the teeth was easily put in place, but, unfortunatley, did not stay in place.  When I tried to use the flosser, it exploded off of the machine like a champagne cork!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then checked the reviews of this flosser on Amazon and found that problems with this flosser are common..  Many people write that the machine simply does not work after a few uses.  They send for a new flosser and the new arrival is as bad as the one sent back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry.  Save your money.  This product is badly manufactured.  One star.</li>
            <li> After reading other lower rated reviews out here, I hesitated giving this 5 stars. But as I have been using it consistently for over a week now, I have seen no problems. So, to be fair to Philips I am rating this as I see it currently. If anything changes where this unit fails, I will edit and update my review and rating. For now, I absolutely love this flosser. I am usually a random (not regular) flosser and use floss. I hate using it as it tends, in my opinion, not do the job adequately unless I spend a lot of time doing it. Now that I am using this Sonicare, I love how it feels and works. I fill the reservoir with mouthwash (this comes with a sample of Sonicare mouthwash, but I prefer and use ACT) and the air pop easily pops and pumps mouthwash between my teeth and gums (which makes my rinsing far more effective than swishing alone). I found debris come from between my teeth that I am sure has been there for a while but thanks to Philips is there no more. I actually find this fun to use and am using it twice daily now when I normally brush my teeth (something I never did when flossing manually). Yes, my gums bled the first few times I used it, but since then I have not seen the same impact so I know my mouth is far healthier.</li>
            <li> I am an avid flosser, but sometimes it is hard to get in the back. I thought this would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to charge and hold. It has 3 basic settings (1, 2, or 3 spurts at a time). You simply fill the reservoir with water or mouthwash. When you push the button it squirts. It is pretty powerful. On the up side, the bursts are powerful to knock stuff out. On the down side (for me anyway), the bursts are so powerful they bother my teeth (sensitivity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you accidentally have it at the wrong angle it squirts everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like to floss the traditional way, this will be for you. There are enough pluses to make it worthwhile. For me, I think I will mostly just use floss.</li>
