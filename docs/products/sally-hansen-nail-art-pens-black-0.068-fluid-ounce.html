    <ol>
            <li>Best of luck on all of your nail art excursions,elizabeth  :D</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all</li>
            <li>When I try and put a top coat on, it smears!!</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s good for designs</li>
            <li>It is great for outlining, better than trying to use the brush.</li>
            <li>a week!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, folks, if you (or someone you love) want to try your hand at nail art, just spend your money on brushes, dotting tools, and all the good stuff.</li>
            <li>It stains your skin very easily and rubs off the nails before you can even put a top coat on!</li>
            <li>Fun for girls to practice and play around at a great price.</li>
            <li>this product compared to a striper brush has its pros and cons, for instance, the pen has better control</li>
            <li>but, the striper brush is more opaque.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Oh and for the record, even if you put on a top coat, your design will still start to smear within hours.</li>
            <li>you must apply a top coat for it not to rub off.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff i use it with all my clients.</li>
            <li>it took a really short time to get to me which is totally awesome.</li>
            <li>Nail Art polish works MUCH MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gong to get more colors.</li>
            <li>Now if they made it to where it wouldn&#x27;t rub off and be more like real polish, I would love them!!</li>
            <li>the pens absolutely wont work on top of those!!</li>
            <li>are much more accurate than using the brushes.</li>
            <li>The pen came fast which is good</li>
            <li>I think that the liquid is easy to maneuver once its on the nail.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well for this, kind of fading out after I added my topcoat.</li>
            <li>also a lot cheaper... wasn&#x27;t impressed quite a let down</li>
            <li>It looks great when it goes on, but after only a couple of hours it had smudged off!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much to get use to.  </li>
            <li>and I was really excited about using them.</li>
            <li>But after you draw, if you take your finger and rub your nail, it comes right off!</li>
            <li>I was able to make a very intricate design - including curves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it really does require a top coat.</li>
            <li>A top coat is ABSOLUTELY required.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had some that came with an assortment I bought a while ago.</li>
            <li>But I ignored the very clear instructions on the bottle to use a top coat.</li>
            <li>Like i said save it, rubs right off.</li>
            <li>If I had wanted clean perfect lines and strong color, I&#x27;d be extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li>I did not buy 4 of these pens from here; Walgreens to be exact.</li>
            <li>I love Sally Hansen a lot, and hopefully they will take these pens off the market and not make this same mistake again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually use these with my gel polishes as well, between two gel top coats.</li>
            <li>First of all, don&#x27;t ever shake it with the cap off...</li>
            <li>And second of all, the color seems too opaque to write on top of anything.</li>
            <li>I generally skip a top coat as I don&#x27;t care that much about chipping</li>
            <li>Meanwhile my nails are pretty smudged</li>
            <li>but you have to follow the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>The pen was watery at first</li>
            <li>Only one of the pens I was able to get ink an use...</li>
            <li>and I waited for all nails to dry again before applying the top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty anal about how things have to be VERY neat and not sloppy, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me so much that I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>it was something else that didn&#x27;t have a fine tip like in the picture, completely different packaging, was a watery pen</li>
            <li>but i would much rather prefer a striper over this nailart pen.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying these again, maybe if they make it to where it is real nail polish I will buy..</li>
            <li>It makes my nail art so much easier to do.  </li>
            <li>The pen I bought was much nicer than a striper in terms of control.</li>
            <li>and I always thought it was too much hassle.</li>
            <li>I would be careful when applying the top coat as well, as some of the smudging seemed to occur while I was applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only beef with this product is how it looks when I draw a shape and fill it in completely: the formula dries and almost shrinks (for lack of a better term) in a way that you can see micro-lines (almost like crackle paint) of the basecoat through the color.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to experiment with other nail art brushes or paint brands, but I really just honestly love these pens a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its no big deal unless you are looking at the nail SUPER close up.</li>
            <li>its a terrific detail pen i would buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>It was easy enough to work with and looked fine initially, though as a nail would dry I would see that the black became foggy and needed more coverage.</li>
            <li>but I used it on a paper towel until it produced normal color and consistency.</li>
            <li>A few pen lines smeared, many cracked [like a crackle finish], and the rest became translucent.</li>
            <li>You can draw anything, you have great control, and I have shaky hands!!</li>
            <li>a note: you ABSOLUTELY must must use a base and top coat, AND if you are using any kind of instant-dry coats (its an oily liquid, not a paint)</li>
            <li>the pen so far is cool, i cant find the black in the store</li>
            <li>huge mess!</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t even last a whole 1/8ths of an entire day, let alone</li>
            <li>i noticed that a lot of people are dragging this product down, saying that it washes right off and it smudges,but i didn&#x27;t find that to be the case when you are going to use it</li>
            <li>Being a total beginner in nail art in about 9th or 10th grade and wanting to experiment and have a little fun while doing my nails, I had the notion that these nail art pens would be worth the money spent on them.</li>
            <li>To be more specific, I purchased black, white, navy blue, and red.</li>
            <li>Its seriously barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>its the first time you use it, take the cap off and get a piece of paper and push the tip down, the liquid will cover the tip).</li>
            <li>I can draw really fine lines on top of a base coat color.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this and those other pens.</li>
            <li>But after using this pen once it&#x27;s clear that the pen is not really nail polish</li>

            <li> I really wanted to like this and those other pens.</li>
            <li> But after using this pen once it&#x27;s clear that the pen is not really nail polish</li>
            <li> When I tested it on a waxed style paper plate prior to using it on my nail it seemed sort of like the bulk of the polish constricted back towards the middle leaving the watery grey line in its&#x27; place.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s basically nail polish dripping off instead of an ACTUAL PEN, the color is very off and doesn&#x27;t look like black at all, the brush was bent and not straight so using it is a pain....</li>
            <li> I tried this twice with different nail polish and top coat -- same disappointing outcome.</li>
            <li> i have left it dry for over 1 hour</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money -- I&#x27;ll have to practice with a brush and regular polish as this shortcut just isn&#x27;t a viable option.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done with the design you have to wait for it dry then put on a generous amount of topcoat to seal in the design.</li>
            <li> - the pen doesn&#x27;t want to dry and it rubs off</li>
            <li> I have no idea why other reviews have had problems with this product; I purchased mine over a year ago and have used it every once in a while with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get why they can&#x27;t make these pens with nail polish, and those other pens that you squeeze, they have air in them, bubbles</li>
            <li> Thank the Lord i only ordered one to try out and not many.</li>
            <li> this stuff does not wanna dry!!!</li>
            <li> The paint doesn&#x27;t flow well, it comes out spottily, and even if you let it dry completely, it easily smears and comes off the base coat colour.</li>
            <li> NOT!&lt;br /&gt;Attempting to draw smiley faces on my yellow-painted nails, I thought that they would last at least a week.</li>
            <li> This product is not useful.</li>
            <li> Black Patch all over my Finger ....&lt;</li>
            <li> Eventually the lines were opaque black</li>
            <li> $32 down the drain!</li>
            <li> after one use this pen dried up on me and started scraping off my nail polish when trying to use it...</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> No fine line for me...</li>
            <li> also its very messy and its hard to mess with.</li>
            <li> but I am way too lazy to redo.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...rubs off in 20 minutes or less!!!  </li>
            <li> Well, I thought wrong, the design started rubbing off not even 3 hours after I had finished them and let them dry!!</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my local Walgreens, and was extremely disappointed so came here looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper with this product.</li>
            <li> like honestly i&#x27;m disappointed considering the amount of money i spent on it</li>
            <li> I applied a base coat and color, and allowed nails to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially disappointing that these originated from a big name nail company...</li>
            <li> and they shipped the wrong thing to me.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t like those either... :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> However, it bleeds HORRIBLY.</li>
            <li> Horrible, always smudged a all over my nails</li>
            <li> i would have terribly regretted it by now.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Faced with the reviews -after- I bought this, I attempted to use it for a &amp;#34;faded&amp;#34; look on a nail art. It worked pretty well for this, kind of fading out after I added my topcoat. If I had wanted clean perfect lines and strong color, I&#x27;d be extremely disappointed. When I tested it on a waxed style paper plate prior to using it on my nail it seemed sort of like the bulk of the polish constricted back towards the middle leaving the watery grey line in its&#x27; place.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my local Walgreens, and was extremely disappointed so came here looking for an alternative. When I saw these for sale here as well, I decided I could not just ignore it and move on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this pen as instructed -- shook it well, applied to polished nails. However, it bleeds HORRIBLY. No fine line for me...I had to remove the polish and start over entirely.  Complete waste of money -- I&#x27;ll have to practice with a brush and regular polish as this shortcut just isn&#x27;t a viable option.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...rubs off in 20 minutes or less!!!  Go for nail polish instead.  Not a happy camper with this product.</li>
            <li> i noticed that a lot of people are dragging this product down, saying that it washes right off and it smudges,but i didn&#x27;t find that to be the case when you are going to use it you have to shake it first,(if its the first time you use it, take the cap off and get a piece of paper and push the tip down, the liquid will cover the tip). I think that the liquid is easy to maneuver once its on the nail. When you&#x27;re done with the design you have to wait for it dry then put on a generous amount of topcoat to seal in the design. this product compared to a striper brush has its pros and cons, for instance, the pen has better control but, the striper brush is more opaque.Overall, this product is in my nailbox but i would much rather prefer a striper over this nailart pen. Best of luck on all of your nail art excursions,elizabeth  :D</li>
            <li> I used this Product Yesterday Before Bath... And its Totally washed away After Bath .... The i again re applied it in the evening and Now Today .. It totally messed UP in my Nails .. Black Patch all over my Finger ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please dont Buy this</li>
            <li> I did not buy 4 of these pens from here; Walgreens to be exact. To be more specific, I purchased black, white, navy blue, and red. Being a total beginner in nail art in about 9th or 10th grade and wanting to experiment and have a little fun while doing my nails, I had the notion that these nail art pens would be worth the money spent on them. NOT!&lt;br /&gt;Attempting to draw smiley faces on my yellow-painted nails, I thought that they would last at least a week.

It can&#x27;t even last a whole 1/8ths of an entire day, let alone a week!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, folks, if you (or someone you love) want to try your hand at nail art, just spend your money on brushes, dotting tools, and all the good stuff. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did...$32 down the drain! SMH! It&#x27;s especially disappointing that these originated from a big name nail company...I love Sally Hansen a lot, and hopefully they will take these pens off the market and not make this same mistake again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Oh and for the record, even if you put on a top coat, your design will still start to smear within hours.</li>
            <li> this stuff does not wanna dry!!! i have left it dry for over 1 hour and it immedietly rubbed off when i rubbed my finger over it. also its very messy and its hard to mess with. i ususally prefer the nail art brushes you can buy at the drug stores.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It looks great when it goes on, but after only a couple of hours it had smudged off! Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why other reviews have had problems with this product; I purchased mine over a year ago and have used it every once in a while with no problems at all. I like that I can draw really fine lines on top of a base coat color. I actually use these with my gel polishes as well, between two gel top coats. My only beef with this product is how it looks when I draw a shape and fill it in completely: the formula dries and almost shrinks (for lack of a better term) in a way that you can see micro-lines (almost like crackle paint) of the basecoat through the color. Its no big deal unless you are looking at the nail SUPER close up. Its seriously barely noticeable. I&#x27;m pretty anal about how things have to be VERY neat and not sloppy, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me so much that I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I feel like the lines I create with this pen are much more accurate than using the brushes. Maybe I need to experiment with other nail art brushes or paint brands, but I really just honestly love these pens a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: you ABSOLUTELY must must use a base and top coat, AND if you are using any kind of instant-dry coats (its an oily liquid, not a paint) the pens absolutely wont work on top of those!!</li>
            <li> you must apply a top coat for it not to rub off. i love this stuff i use it with all my clients.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these! Now if they made it to where it wouldn&#x27;t rub off and be more like real polish, I would love them!! You can draw anything, you have great control, and I have shaky hands!! But after you draw, if you take your finger and rub your nail, it comes right off! When I try and put a top coat on, it smears!! And it stains your nails !! I won&#x27;t be buying these again, maybe if they make it to where it is real nail polish I will buy.. Don&#x27;t get why they can&#x27;t make these pens with nail polish, and those other pens that you squeeze, they have air in them, bubbles, I don&#x27;t like those either... :( I really wanted to like this and those other pens.</li>
            <li> after one use this pen dried up on me and started scraping off my nail polish when trying to use it...wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all</li>
            <li> it took a really short time to get to me which is totally awesome. the pen so far is cool, i cant find the black in the store so i had to order it online. its like a permanent marker which i guess could be used as a substitute but this is actual nail polish and it does NOT produce any fumes at all. its a terrific detail pen i would buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Like i said save it, rubs right off. Nail Art polish works MUCH MUCH better. also a lot cheaper... wasn&#x27;t impressed quite a let down</li>
            <li> I was exited to try these after someone recommenced them. I ordered a couple and as soon as they got here I had to try them! First of all, don&#x27;t ever shake it with the cap off...huge mess! And second of all, the color seems too opaque to write on top of anything. When it dries it fades. So nah...I do not like!</li>
            <li> Horrible, always smudged a all over my nails</li>
            <li> The pen came fast which is good BUT, it wasn&#x27;t what was on the picture here on amazon. it was something else that didn&#x27;t have a fine tip like in the picture, completely different packaging, was a watery pen that&#x27;s basically nail polish dripping off instead of an ACTUAL PEN, the color is very off and doesn&#x27;t look like black at all, the brush was bent and not straight so using it is a pain....like honestly i&#x27;m disappointed considering the amount of money i spent on it and they shipped the wrong thing to me. Thank the Lord i only ordered one to try out and not many. i would have terribly regretted it by now. i would advise getting it from the company site itself. You can&#x27;t trust these retailers.</li>
            <li> So watery that it just runs all over the nail. I couldn&#x27;t use it all. It was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I luv this pen.  It makes my nail art so much easier to do.  It is great for outlining, better than trying to use the brush. I&#x27;m gong to get more colors.</li>
            <li> The pen I bought was much nicer than a striper in terms of control. I was able to make a very intricate design - including curves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to second a lot of the complaints - the pen doesn&#x27;t want to dry and it rubs off (I actually managed to get a lot of it on my face). But I ignored the very clear instructions on the bottle to use a top coat. I generally skip a top coat as I don&#x27;t care that much about chipping and I always thought it was too much hassle. But after using this pen once it&#x27;s clear that the pen is not really nail polish and it really does require a top coat. Luckily I had some that came with an assortment I bought a while ago. Meanwhile my nails are pretty smudged but I am way too lazy to redo. I would be careful when applying the top coat as well, as some of the smudging seemed to occur while I was applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: it&#x27;s good for designs but you have to follow the instructions exactly. A top coat is ABSOLUTELY required.</li>
            <li> The paint doesn&#x27;t flow well, it comes out spottily, and even if you let it dry completely, it easily smears and comes off the base coat colour.</li>
            <li> I am going to return this product! It doesn&#x27;t draw like they say it does but instead pools  and drips. It stains your skin very easily and rubs off the nails before you can even put a top coat on!</li>
            <li> I applied a base coat and color, and allowed nails to dry. The pen was watery at first but I used it on a paper towel until it produced normal color and consistency. It was easy enough to work with and looked fine initially, though as a nail would dry I would see that the black became foggy and needed more coverage. Eventually the lines were opaque black and I waited for all nails to dry again before applying the top coat. A few pen lines smeared, many cracked [like a crackle finish], and the rest became translucent. I tried this twice with different nail polish and top coat -- same disappointing outcome. This product is not useful.</li>
            <li> I got a set of five colors and I was really excited about using them. Only one of the pens I was able to get ink an use... I am going to try to get the others to work.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much to get use to.  Fun for girls to practice and play around at a great price.</li>
