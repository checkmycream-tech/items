            <li>This diffuser is so pretty and works great.  </li>
            <li>I also really liked that I could change the light settings/colors.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Our beloved dog is 15 and doesn&#x27;t smell so good in spite of frequent bathing.</li>
            <li>I bought another because I love the &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; feel and smell it provides.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and holds a good amount of water.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more oil to use with it.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers have expressed difficulty in taking the cover off.  </li>
            <li>There are so many diffusers to choose from, but now I want these in every room of the house.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it up and running without having to read the directions.</li>
            <li>I like to be able to set it up in the morning and not have to worry about it for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing to grab on to, you must pry apart the top from the bottom and hope that excess water doesn&#x27;t spill.</li>
            <li>I love diffusing oils in my bedroom.  </li>
            <li>Love this diffuser..does run 12 hrs.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give it more stars!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a stylish diffuser that works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Other great feature is the auto shutoff when the water runs low/dry!</li>
            <li>is it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I really liked this!  </li>
            <li>The first one works wonderfully- all night, quietly.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty unit!</li>
            <li>You can also turn the light off if you prefer.</li>
            <li>and you can turn the light on and off if you like.</li>
            <li>Instantly filled my room with fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you choose to not use the light with this one you can use the off mode.</li>
            <li>The unit is so light that I can have it in the living room all day to fill the room then move it into my bedroom at night to enjoy some relaxing scents as we sleep.</li>
            <li>You also have the opinion of turning off all LED light if you wish.</li>
            <li>The light is not over powering, so it won&#x27;t bother you while you are sleeping.</li>
            <li>Works well with my oils and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The construction of the device is cheap and to plug it in and not have it operate is unexceptable.</li>
            <li>I love it and have a dedicated table where I start running about 30 minutes before I go to bed, and I sleep very well.</li>
            <li>The diffuser continues to run for hours and hours which is making it basically a cool mist humidifier.</li>
            <li>The way it changes colors is also really cool.  </li>
            <li>I own a number of small diffusers that we have placed in the bedrooms and when I had the chance to get a larger one I was very happy.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is my favorite new toy!</li>
            <li>The light was actually an added bonus for me, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>For the record, I also purchased several different oils and the Woolzie&#x27;s lavendar is the best.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>This diffuser is made very well and easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>This unit provides a pleasant fragrance for the large room he occupies, but is not overpowering and short lived like some sprays can be.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, the instructions were clear and accurate.  </li>
            <li>You can though kind of pull it a little bit away from the top cover in order to drain the water out</li>
            <li>I liked that it runs for more than a few hours, and the 1 year warranty is the&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>Another amazing quality is that it will literally fill the entire room with the smell.</li>
            <li>So far this one is my favorite out of them all.</li>
            <li>Even on the higher of 2 settings, this unit does not disperse an adequate amount of product.  </li>
            <li>I also wasn&#x27;t sure how much water I need to put in and how long it will be able to run.</li>
            <li>The quality of this infuser is awesome its durable and made of plastic material &amp; has a dark wooden appearance which goes together well with any room you put it in!!</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my worn out DoTERRA diffuser, and selected this one because of the good reviews and slightly lower price.  </li>
            <li>and the instructions are very clear, detailed and have pictures.</li>
            <li>The light feature is great and very subtle, creating  relaxing ambience look to it.</li>
            <li>since it is not only easy to use but very pretty and matches the decor in my living room and dinning room.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a much better way to use essential oils than burning them.</li>
            <li>Note that this is the first diffuser I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve researched, it seems most diffusers only have the capacity</li>
            <li>to last 4-6 hours which would make more sense.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a white plastic piece that fits inside the top cover.</li>
            <li>Overall though, I&#x27;m satisfied with the unit.</li>
            <li>more oil does not equal a longer diffusion of scent.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that I have a choice with the lights: I can opt for changing colors, one color only, or no lights at all.  </li>
            <li>You open the top and use the measuring cup that comes with it to fill with water.</li>
            <li>Oh &amp; yes even your favorite citrus oils can be used in this essential oil diffuser unlike some diffuser where they say not to use citrus oils</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this diffuser &amp; definitely recommend it to anyone &amp; everyone!!</li>
            <li>So elegant and being that we used to live in Hawaii completely goes with our decor.</li>
            <li>I have several diffusers in my home and this one is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I like that it has just a strip of light around the side and a little circle on the top.</li>
            <li>I happened to have had an essential oil on hand to use for my first try with this, and now I&#x27;m ready to go stock up on more</li>
            <li>My unit runs for a full 9-11 hours on the high setting which I really like.</li>
            <li>Adding more oil only makes the initial diffusion scent unbearably strong....</li>
            <li>This oil diffuser is extremely easy to use all you need to do is open up the top use the included measuring cup &amp; fill it with water then add your preferred essential oil or oils to the infuser close it</li>
            <li>You can have it on low where the vapor dances along the top of the diffuser and out or you can use the high setting and</li>
            <li>You do not find very many with that long of a warranty, and it seems like several brands die just after the few months that the warranty is good.  </li>
            <li>made it extra easy</li>
            <li>Works just fine and was very quiet.</li>
            <li>The design, if you care, is smooth and like a river rock, so it is not obvious.</li>
            <li>I do really like about this diffuser</li>
            <li>This can make like so much easier when I can just take something out of the box and know how to use it.</li>
            <li>It keeps the scent of my choice going through the room the whole day.</li>
            <li>Absolute junk.</li>
            <li>The other thing that really has me in love with this is the 12 hour run time.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this essential oil diffuser in the mail!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the dark bamboo color.</li>
            <li>It disperses the essential oil scents very well throughout my room and love that it is quiet!  </li>
            <li>First off I have to say WOW</li>
            <li>When turned on the unit makes pretty much no noise at all except for a very subtle trickling of water sound that I enjoy a lot personally, there is no beep or &amp;#34;shut off&amp;#34; sound when it automatically turns off either.</li>
            <li>One of the main reasons I bought it was for the looks.</li>
            <li>I mean you can never have too many of these around, especially when you own a big house.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I usually do not mention the packaging in my reviews but this seller gets 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li>I am a regular essential oil user and own several diffusers.</li>
            <li>If you are like me, you will become addicted to essential oils and aromatherapy and start using your beautiful diffuser to help with your family&#x27;s ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it the vapor will shoot out a few inches from the top.</li>
            <li>Assuming I must have received a dud, but I spent way too much money for something to break this quick.  </li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t so bright that I find it hard to fall asleep, especially if I have my eyes closed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the light over powering like some of the other diffusers.</li>
            <li>Mine definitely makes a low whirring sound.</li>
            <li>At first I could not tell if it had a light, it does, but it is much more subtle than my other diffuser which is what I needed in my bedroom!  </li>
            <li>, they are very soft and calming I think.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is not difficult but you need to maintain it as you would a regular humidifier.</li>
            <li>I have a very hyperactive toddler and it does seem to help to calm him down.</li>
            <li>While it has a little bit of a sound while running, it is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>It does what it promises and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it so far.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t anything I have found so far that I don&#x27;t like about this diffuser</li>
            <li>Really does last 12 hours or longer.</li>
            <li>The LED lights are soothing and soft.</li>
            <li>I add about 8 drops of essential oil (I do more because this diffuser is bigger than the other ones I have).</li>
            <li>very small, but love it</li>
            <li>There 2 mist levels, high &amp; low</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between the high and low settings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to big or heavy which makes it easy to go from room to room.  </li>
            <li>An oil floating on the surface of the water will only last a certain amount of time....</li>
            <li>Is anyone else noticing that a good amt of the positive, glowing reviews are from people who were given the item free or at a discount to review.... while the negative reviews are from people who were not..and who were disappointed in the product?</li>
            <li>you can barely tell it is on.</li>
            <li>Unlike my DoTERRA diffuser, I could barely smell the essential oil, and received no therapeutic benefit.  </li>

            <li> The first one works wonderfully- all night, quietly.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty unit!</li>
            <li> You can also turn the light off if you prefer.</li>
            <li> and you can turn the light on and off if you like.</li>
            <li> Instantly filled my room with fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you choose to not use the light with this one you can use the off mode.</li>
            <li> The unit is so light that I can have it in the living room all day to fill the room then move it into my bedroom at night to enjoy some relaxing scents as we sleep.</li>
            <li> You also have the opinion of turning off all LED light if you wish.</li>
            <li> The light is not over powering, so it won&#x27;t bother you while you are sleeping.</li>
            <li> Works well with my oils and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The construction of the device is cheap and to plug it in and not have it operate is unexceptable.</li>
            <li> I love it and have a dedicated table where I start running about 30 minutes before I go to bed, and I sleep very well.</li>
            <li> The diffuser continues to run for hours and hours which is making it basically a cool mist humidifier.</li>
            <li> The way it changes colors is also really cool.  </li>
            <li> I own a number of small diffusers that we have placed in the bedrooms and when I had the chance to get a larger one I was very happy.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is my favorite new toy!</li>
            <li> The light was actually an added bonus for me, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> For the record, I also purchased several different oils and the Woolzie&#x27;s lavendar is the best.</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> This diffuser is made very well and easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li> This unit provides a pleasant fragrance for the large room he occupies, but is not overpowering and short lived like some sprays can be.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, the instructions were clear and accurate.  </li>
            <li> You can though kind of pull it a little bit away from the top cover in order to drain the water out</li>
            <li> I liked that it runs for more than a few hours, and the 1 year warranty is the&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> Another amazing quality is that it will literally fill the entire room with the smell.</li>
            <li> So far this one is my favorite out of them all.</li>
            <li> Even on the higher of 2 settings, this unit does not disperse an adequate amount of product.  </li>
            <li> I also wasn&#x27;t sure how much water I need to put in and how long it will be able to run.</li>
            <li> The quality of this infuser is awesome its durable and made of plastic material &amp; has a dark wooden appearance which goes together well with any room you put it in!!</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my worn out DoTERRA diffuser, and selected this one because of the good reviews and slightly lower price.  </li>
            <li> and the instructions are very clear, detailed and have pictures.</li>
            <li> The light feature is great and very subtle, creating  relaxing ambience look to it.</li>
            <li> since it is not only easy to use but very pretty and matches the decor in my living room and dinning room.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a much better way to use essential oils than burning them.</li>
            <li> Note that this is the first diffuser I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve researched, it seems most diffusers only have the capacity</li>
            <li> to last 4-6 hours which would make more sense.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a white plastic piece that fits inside the top cover.</li>
            <li> Overall though, I&#x27;m satisfied with the unit.</li>
            <li> more oil does not equal a longer diffusion of scent.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that I have a choice with the lights: I can opt for changing colors, one color only, or no lights at all.  </li>
            <li> You open the top and use the measuring cup that comes with it to fill with water.</li>
            <li> Oh &amp; yes even your favorite citrus oils can be used in this essential oil diffuser unlike some diffuser where they say not to use citrus oils</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this diffuser &amp; definitely recommend it to anyone &amp; everyone!!</li>
            <li> So elegant and being that we used to live in Hawaii completely goes with our decor.</li>
            <li> I have several diffusers in my home and this one is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I like that it has just a strip of light around the side and a little circle on the top.</li>
            <li> I happened to have had an essential oil on hand to use for my first try with this, and now I&#x27;m ready to go stock up on more</li>
            <li> My unit runs for a full 9-11 hours on the high setting which I really like.</li>
            <li> Adding more oil only makes the initial diffusion scent unbearably strong....</li>
            <li> This oil diffuser is extremely easy to use all you need to do is open up the top use the included measuring cup &amp; fill it with water then add your preferred essential oil or oils to the infuser close it</li>
            <li> You can have it on low where the vapor dances along the top of the diffuser and out or you can use the high setting and</li>
            <li> You do not find very many with that long of a warranty, and it seems like several brands die just after the few months that the warranty is good.  </li>
            <li> made it extra easy</li>
            <li> Works just fine and was very quiet.</li>
            <li> The design, if you care, is smooth and like a river rock, so it is not obvious.</li>
            <li> I do really like about this diffuser</li>
            <li> This can make like so much easier when I can just take something out of the box and know how to use it.</li>
            <li> It keeps the scent of my choice going through the room the whole day.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.</li>
            <li> The other thing that really has me in love with this is the 12 hour run time.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this essential oil diffuser in the mail!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the dark bamboo color.</li>
            <li> It disperses the essential oil scents very well throughout my room and love that it is quiet!  </li>
            <li> First off I have to say WOW</li>
            <li> When turned on the unit makes pretty much no noise at all except for a very subtle trickling of water sound that I enjoy a lot personally, there is no beep or &amp;#34;shut off&amp;#34; sound when it automatically turns off either.</li>
            <li> One of the main reasons I bought it was for the looks.</li>
            <li> I mean you can never have too many of these around, especially when you own a big house.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I usually do not mention the packaging in my reviews but this seller gets 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I am a regular essential oil user and own several diffusers.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you will become addicted to essential oils and aromatherapy and start using your beautiful diffuser to help with your family&#x27;s ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it the vapor will shoot out a few inches from the top.</li>
            <li> Assuming I must have received a dud, but I spent way too much money for something to break this quick.  </li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t so bright that I find it hard to fall asleep, especially if I have my eyes closed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the light over powering like some of the other diffusers.</li>
            <li> Mine definitely makes a low whirring sound.</li>
            <li> At first I could not tell if it had a light, it does, but it is much more subtle than my other diffuser which is what I needed in my bedroom!  </li>
            <li> , they are very soft and calming I think.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is not difficult but you need to maintain it as you would a regular humidifier.</li>
            <li> I have a very hyperactive toddler and it does seem to help to calm him down.</li>
            <li> While it has a little bit of a sound while running, it is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything I have found so far that I don&#x27;t like about this diffuser</li>
            <li> Really does last 12 hours or longer.</li>
            <li> The LED lights are soothing and soft.</li>
            <li> I add about 8 drops of essential oil (I do more because this diffuser is bigger than the other ones I have).</li>
            <li> very small, but love it</li>
            <li> There 2 mist levels, high &amp; low</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between the high and low settings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to big or heavy which makes it easy to go from room to room.  </li>
            <li> An oil floating on the surface of the water will only last a certain amount of time....</li>
            <li> Is anyone else noticing that a good amt of the positive, glowing reviews are from people who were given the item free or at a discount to review.... while the negative reviews are from people who were not..and who were disappointed in the product?</li>
            <li> you can barely tell it is on.</li>
            <li> Unlike my DoTERRA diffuser, I could barely smell the essential oil, and received no therapeutic benefit.  </li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that when I put it on my dresser across the bedroom, you couldn&#x27;t smell the essential oils while in bed (which is why I moved it to a small table near my bed).</li>
            <li> The quality and/or types of oils you use will determine how long the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> After only about 5 hours or so (depending on the oil), I can only detect a faint scent if I&#x27;m right by the diffuser.</li>
            <li> It can run for 12 hours which is a really long time!</li>
            <li> Some of the other diffusers I have gotten you have to sit next to it but not this one.</li>
            <li> We are a military family and move a lot.</li>
            <li> This diffuser&#x27;s cold mister runs up to 8 hours in high mode, and up to 12 hours on low mode.</li>
            <li> This Ultrasonic Oil diffuser by BellaSentials definitely works wonders &amp; being someone that is obsessed with diffusers &amp; essential oils</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of the bamboo colored ones previously.</li>
            <li> Its wide shape also does not allow placement in small spaces.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened there, but will investigate.  </li>
            <li> but I usually can&#x27;t get it all out.</li>
            <li> I usually throw the boxes away</li>
            <li> Very awkward to open, which is why only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this white piece is removable and I&#x27;ve been afraid to force it for fear of breaking it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it hard</li>
            <li> In addition, I found it difficult to open the unit because of it&#x27;s shallow, wide base, the slippery plastic exterior, and the lack of any grip on the unit.  </li>
            <li> However, I discovered that an 8 or 12 hour run time is completely ridiculous and unnecessary with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> so well there is no way it could be broken in shipping.</li>
            <li> The colored lights are very subtle.</li>
            <li> Some random thoughts.</li>
            <li> Awful, have had this for one week, and it broke already.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am in love with this diffuser! For starters I want to tell you it is a great size and beautifully made, super stylish and blends in with any d&amp;eacute;cor. I did order it though a great promotion to try it and share my honest opinion. I like the simplicity of how it works , I find great that it comes with a measuring cup and the instructions are very clear, detailed and have pictures. Other great feature is the auto shutoff when the water runs low/dry! So to me this is a 5 start diffuser all around! The light feature is great and very subtle, creating  relaxing ambience look to it. I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an Essential Oil Diffuser, I usually use wax melts.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I really liked this!  It was easy to use, the instructions were clear and accurate.  The included measuring cup made it extra easy - I didn&#x27;t have to go looking through my kitchen to find one of mine.  The light was actually an added bonus for me, I really liked it.  I also really liked that I could change the light settings/colors.  Overall, very happy with this product.  I happened to have had an essential oil on hand to use for my first try with this, and now I&#x27;m ready to go stock up on more so I can continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and I do like the colors that rotate, they are very soft and calming I think. When turned on the unit makes pretty much no noise at all except for a very subtle trickling of water sound that I enjoy a lot personally, there is no beep or &amp;#34;shut off&amp;#34; sound when it automatically turns off either. My unit runs for a full 9-11 hours on the high setting which I really like.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second BellaSentials Diffuser. The first one works wonderfully- all night, quietly. For the record, I also purchased several different oils and the Woolzie&#x27;s lavendar is the best. Our beloved dog is 15 and doesn&#x27;t smell so good in spite of frequent bathing. This unit provides a pleasant fragrance for the large room he occupies, but is not overpowering and short lived like some sprays can be. I bought another because I love the &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; feel and smell it provides. The design, if you care, is smooth and like a river rock, so it is not obvious.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is my favorite new toy! Works great and fills the room quickly with the pleasant scents I add. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I left this running for an hour and the room never did have the fragrance of the oil placed in the diffuser.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Really big diffuser. Too big for my taste. Sent it back</li>
            <li> Is anyone else noticing that a good amt of the positive, glowing reviews are from people who were given the item free or at a discount to review.... while the negative reviews are from people who were not..and who were disappointed in the product? Not purchasing based on this.</li>
            <li> I am a regular essential oil user and own several diffusers. So far this one is my favorite out of them all. It can run for 12 hours which is a really long time! I placed it on my nightstand as I like diffusing lavender essential oil during the night while we sleep. I have a very hyperactive toddler and it does seem to help to calm him down. The light changes color and isn&#x27;t too bright which is really pleasant as a night light. You can also turn the light off if you prefer. You can use citrus essential oils in this, which is a big plus as with some diffusers you can&#x27;t because it dissolves the plastic. It has a very nice wooden design and creates the perfect spa ambiance. BellaSentials also has an awesome 100% refund guarantee if you are unsatisfied with your product. So give it a try, you have nothing to lose. If you are like me, you will become addicted to essential oils and aromatherapy and start using your beautiful diffuser to help with your family&#x27;s ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product at a discount so I could write an honest and unbiased review. My opinion is 100% my own :)</li>
            <li> Just i wanted. Worth the money and looks great</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty unit! I love it and have a dedicated table where I start running about 30 minutes before I go to bed, and I sleep very well. While it has a little bit of a sound while running, it is not a problem for me. My only issue with it is that when I put it on my dresser across the bedroom, you couldn&#x27;t smell the essential oils while in bed (which is why I moved it to a small table near my bed).</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best diffuser I have ever used. Easy to clean and holds a good amount of water. Lasts all night and is very quiet. Sleek design and is a great in either color. The colored lights are very subtle.</li>
            <li> I was looking at this diffuser for some time, and finally purchased it.  I liked that it runs for more than a few hours, and the 1 year warranty is the&lt;br /&gt;the best selling point  You do not find very many with that long of a warranty, and it seems like several brands die just after the few months that the warranty is good.  I did receive a discount coupon, but I would have purchased this item without it.  Thank you BellaSentials!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good diffuser for months now. I really loved the design of this one and it matches my bedroom furniture perfectly, it looks like real wood and its fabulous. Its quite and you can turn the light on and off if you like. There 2 mist levels, high &amp; low and I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference between them two. I also wasn&#x27;t sure how much water I need to put in and how long it will be able to run. But overall its a beautiful product, works perfectly and I love it. I received the product at the discounted price for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Product appeared just as pictured. Instantly filled my room with fragrance. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more oil to use with it. This is a much better way to use essential oils than burning them. Very very pleased.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is very attractive and does run for 12 hours as described. The reason for the 4 stars is I don&#x27;t know why but after a couple hours of running I can no longer smell the oils. This is after leaving and coming home. I&#x27;m using the NOW brand cheer up and as the instructions state, using about 7 drops AFTER water is in the unit. Any tips??</li>
            <li> Awful, have had this for one week, and it broke already.  Assuming I must have received a dud, but I spent way too much money for something to break this quick.  Will be asking for a refund and won&#x27;t be ordering one of these again.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my worn out DoTERRA diffuser, and selected this one because of the good reviews and slightly lower price.  It arrived over a week later, even with Amazon Prime.  Not sure what happened there, but will investigate.  Even on the higher of 2 settings, this unit does not disperse an adequate amount of product.  Unlike my DoTERRA diffuser, I could barely smell the essential oil, and received no therapeutic benefit.  In addition, I found it difficult to open the unit because of it&#x27;s shallow, wide base, the slippery plastic exterior, and the lack of any grip on the unit.  Its wide shape also does not allow placement in small spaces.</li>
            <li> Some random thoughts. Note that this is the first diffuser I&#x27;ve ever bought.  1. Some reviewers claim this diffuser is virtually silent while others say it is &amp;#34;whisper quiet&amp;#34;. Mine definitely makes a low whirring sound. It&#x27;s very low but I can see how it might bother some people in a quiet room. 2. The quality and/or types of oils you use will determine how long the scent lasts. That said, I can&#x27;t imagine how any diffuser can fill a room with a scent for 8-12 hours as the oil would be used up before then. After only about 5 hours or so (depending on the oil), I can only detect a faint scent if I&#x27;m right by the diffuser. From what I&#x27;ve researched, it seems most diffusers only have the capacity to last 4-6 hours which would make more sense. 3. Many reviewers have expressed difficulty in taking the cover off.  I don&#x27;t find it hard but it&#x27;s a good idea to do it by a sink as you&#x27;ll end up dripping some water in the process. 4. The light isn&#x27;t so bright that I find it hard to fall asleep, especially if I have my eyes closed. 5. Cleaning is not difficult but you need to maintain it as you would a regular humidifier. 6. There&#x27;s a white plastic piece that fits inside the top cover. What I&#x27;ve noticed is that water accumulates in between this piece and the cover. I&#x27;m not sure if this white piece is removable and I&#x27;ve been afraid to force it for fear of breaking it. You can though kind of pull it a little bit away from the top cover in order to drain the water out but I usually can&#x27;t get it all out. Since it&#x27;s all plastic though, I don&#x27;t think it will be an issue. 7. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between the high and low settings. The output seems the same.  Overall though, I&#x27;m satisfied with the unit. One of the main reasons I bought it was for the looks. It does what it promises and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> This is a stylish diffuser that works perfectly fine. However, I discovered that an 8 or 12 hour run time is completely ridiculous and unnecessary with a diffuser. An oil floating on the surface of the water will only last a certain amount of time....and then it is diffused and gone. The diffuser continues to run for hours and hours which is making it basically a cool mist humidifier. Adding more oil only makes the initial diffusion scent unbearably strong....more oil does not equal a longer diffusion of scent. I bought another diffuser that runs one hour or four hours then shuts off.</li>
            <li> I Am so very impressed with this diffuser.  At first I could not tell if it had a light, it does, but it is much more subtle than my other diffuser which is what I needed in my bedroom!  There are so many diffusers to choose from, but now I want these in every room of the house. The plastic cones with the larger lights can go to the kids&#x27; rooms.</li>
            <li> I own a number of small diffusers that we have placed in the bedrooms and when I had the chance to get a larger one I was very happy. I mean you can never have too many of these around, especially when you own a big house.&lt;br /&gt;What I do really like about this diffuser is it is easy to use. I was able to get it up and running without having to read the directions. This can make like so much easier when I can just take something out of the box and know how to use it. The other thing that really has me in love with this is the 12 hour run time. I like to be able to set it up in the morning and not have to worry about it for the rest of the day. It keeps the scent of my choice going through the room the whole day. There isn&#x27;t anything I have found so far that I don&#x27;t like about this diffuser and I can see myself purchasing another 1 in the future since the since it is not only easy to use but very pretty and matches the decor in my living room and dinning room.&lt;br /&gt;I received this diffuser at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Works great, and lasts 8-10 hours, if needed. Very awkward to open, which is why only 3 stars. There&#x27;s nothing to grab on to, you must pry apart the top from the bottom and hope that excess water doesn&#x27;t spill.</li>
            <li> Love it! Really does last 12 hours or longer. Puts out avoid amount of mist with great smell!</li>
            <li> Awesome - I love coming home to the lovely smells!</li>
            <li> Works just fine and was very quiet.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is so pretty and works great.  I love diffusing oils in my bedroom.  I might get another one for the rest of the house.</li>
            <li> It is attractive and works perfectly.  I have no issues whatever with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser..does run 12 hrs. Diffuses all liquid rather than 2/3 like others.</li>
            <li> Returned it, because it was too big. I bought it because I wanted one with lights I could turn off.</li>
            <li> Simple, elegant, beautifully made, virtually soundless, and it does a great job of putting out a mist - and best of all, it runs all night and I can trust that it will quietly shut itself off when the water finally runs out. I also love the fact that I have a choice with the lights: I can opt for changing colors, one color only, or no lights at all.  What a truly EXCELLENT product.</li>
            <li> I have several diffusers in my home and this one is by far my favorite! I absolutely love the dark bamboo color. It looks gorgeous! So elegant and being that we used to live in Hawaii completely goes with our decor. It is so easy to use. You open the top and use the measuring cup that comes with it to fill with water. I add about 8 drops of essential oil (I do more because this diffuser is bigger than the other ones I have). After it is plugged in I just press the button on the front and that is it. I will let it run all night. It is very quiet you can barely tell it is on. The LED lights are soothing and soft. I like that it has just a strip of light around the side and a little circle on the top. It doesn&#x27;t make the light over powering like some of the other diffusers. If you choose to not use the light with this one you can use the off mode. Another amazing quality is that it will literally fill the entire room with the smell. There are 2 settings for the vapor. You can have it on low where the vapor dances along the top of the diffuser and out or you can use the high setting and it the vapor will shoot out a few inches from the top. The unit is so light that I can have it in the living room all day to fill the room then move it into my bedroom at night to enjoy some relaxing scents as we sleep. Some of the other diffusers I have gotten you have to sit next to it but not this one. The first thing that I was impressed with when I opened the box was the packaging. I usually do not mention the packaging in my reviews but this seller gets 2 thumbs up! It is packaged so well there is no way it could be broken in shipping. We are a military family and move a lot. I usually throw the boxes away but this one I am keeping because it will keep my diffuser safe.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I cannot rave enough about this diffuser. I wish I could give it more stars!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. This review in unbiased and 100% my own opinion.opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this Oil Diffuser!  This diffuser is made very well and easily cleaned.  It&#x27;s not to big or heavy which makes it easy to go from room to room.  It doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of water, but still turns off when the water is out.  It disperses the essential oil scents very well throughout my room and love that it is quiet!  The way it changes colors is also really cool.  It adds the perfect touch of color to our room!</li>
            <li> First off I have to say WOW This diffuser is beyond amazing!!! I was so excited to receive this essential oil diffuser in the mail!! After trying this infuser out for myself I feel in love with it!! The quality of this infuser is awesome its durable and made of plastic material &amp; has a dark wooden appearance which goes together well with any room you put it in!! It has LED lights that add a touch of ambiance!! This feature is a plus for me when picking out an essential oil diffuser as the LED makes for a relaxing atmosphere!! The LED lights in this diffuser rotate from 7 soothing colors or you can stop the rotation &amp; leave it on whatever color you choice!! You also have the opinion of turning off all LED light if you wish. This oil diffuser is extremely easy to use all you need to do is open up the top use the included measuring cup &amp; fill it with water then add your preferred essential oil or oils to the infuser close it oil diffuser &amp; turn it on the wait as your amazing aroma of fragrance fills the air around you hugging you with pure aroma happiness!! Oh &amp; yes even your favorite citrus oils can be used in this essential oil diffuser unlike some diffuser where they say not to use citrus oils this essential oil diffuser says citrus oils can be used!! This is a plus for me, as I love my citrus oils!! Wait I almost forgot one of the best things about this diffuser is the amount of time it runs for!! This diffuser&#x27;s cold mister runs up to 8 hours in high mode, and up to 12 hours on low mode. It also automatically shuts of when the water runs out!!! This Ultrasonic Oil diffuser by BellaSentials definitely works wonders &amp; being someone that is obsessed with diffusers &amp; essential oils I absolutely love this diffuser &amp; definitely recommend it to anyone &amp; everyone!!</li>
            <li> I love my Bellasentials diffuser!</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase. I have purchased 2 of the bamboo colored ones previously. This color ring changes several colors or you can keep it to one color you like.  They work great for a night light for my grandkids and guests. The light is not over powering, so it won&#x27;t bother you while you are sleeping. Works well with my oils and it is easy to clean.  This one I&#x27;ve kept in our family room .. Great service and a great product.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk. Out of the box didnt work. $59.00 is overpriced to begin with. The construction of the device is cheap and to plug it in and not have it operate is unexceptable. Thank you Amazon for allowing me to share this.</li>
            <li> very small, but love it</li>
