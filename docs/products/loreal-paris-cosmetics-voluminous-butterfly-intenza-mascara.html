    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best drugstore mascara I have ever brought!!</li>
            <li>Great product!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>gave it two stars because the color is nice, and there is something satisfying about the shape of the tube, and maybe those who still have luxurious lashes will find it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing mascara.</li>
            <li>It is really a nice mascra</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product as I saw the positive reviews and, with a coupon, the price was fantastic so it seemed the perfect time to try</li>
            <li>but when I found this one it does the magic all by itself.</li>
            <li>It would be exponentially better, if it was waterproof.</li>
            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>You had better hope you do not cry or sweat while wearing it, and heaven forbid you not remove every speck of it at night, or you will wake up wondering how you got</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both use this product and was pleased to keep it coming with an Amazon subscription.</li>
            <li>and I probably don&#x27;t need to reapply, it&#x27;s just more of a make-up routine.</li>
            <li>If they had flipped one of the combs so that the &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; meant for the outer corner lashes was put it at the top, you wouldn&#x27;t have to switch hands to get full use of the brush.</li>
            <li>In my life long quest to find the perfect mascara, this comes pretty darn close!  </li>
            <li>and it is exactly light the commercials .</li>
            <li>or so it dried alittle and now it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>And the brush really is unique; I think that&#x27;s what makes the difference.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, no smudging, brilliant length and thickness added to lashes!</li>
            <li>This happens rarely</li>
            <li>The mascara was delivered early and in package new, Nice find.</li>
            <li>It gives me nice, long lashes.</li>
            <li>It gives me the exact length and volume that I am looking for.</li>
            <li>An inexpensive mascara that does EXACTLY what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I have seen the commercials and really wanted this</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes really curl and stand out.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>The formula is good, it isn&#x27;t too dry or too wet straight away.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is just me, but I find the brush tends to make application more difficult and leads to clumps and lashes that just look darker, not longer or more voluminous.  </li>
            <li>A decent mascara.  </li>
            <li>As I have aged, I have noticed my lashes growing thinner and shorter, and I had high hopes that this would give me back the appearance of nice, fanned lashes, but it just didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Lengthening without fibers or clumps, helps to individualize my lashes, very black (that&#x27;s a good thing), &amp; has definite staying power!  </li>
            <li>It was alittle to wet at first but after a week</li>
    </ol>

            <li> top of this, this mascara runs like crazy.  </li>
            <li> There also is minimal flaking.</li>
            <li> Usually use two different mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Almost out of my usual mascara, I decided to try something different.  </li>

            <li> Ooh, my lashes are so long and thick- buy now before they quit making this.</li>
            <li> It is thick, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but my lashes appear thin, IMO.  </li>
            <li> This is my fave mascara, it gives me the dramatic length and volume I prefer.</li>
            <li> I have played around with the applicator, curled my lashes prior to application, and fanned them with my fingers just after application, and I still see pathetic lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I am quite disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Amazing mascara. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice. It does what it says and I would buy it again.  The mascara was delivered early and in package new, Nice find.</li>
            <li> Best drugstore mascara I have ever brought!! It gives me the exact length and volume that I am looking for. Amazing!!</li>
            <li> Almost out of my usual mascara, I decided to try something different.

You had better hope you do not cry or sweat while wearing it, and heaven forbid you not remove every speck of it at night, or you will wake up wondering how you got a black eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because the color is nice, and there is something satisfying about the shape of the tube, and maybe those who still have luxurious lashes will find it works wonderfully.  If, like me, you are hoping this will be the inexpensive mascara that gives you model-worthy lashes, keep searching.  This is not our Holy Grail of mascara.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this product and was pleased to keep it coming with an Amazon subscription.</li>
            <li> I like the length but my lashes appear thin, IMO.  I go over with another mascara after and all is well.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes really curl and stand out.  I apply twice a day if I am going out again at night.  This happens rarely and I probably don&#x27;t need to reapply, it&#x27;s just more of a make-up routine.</li>
            <li> A decent mascara.  The trick is to twirl it against your lashes, as opposed to other mascaras you can just brush on.  It is thick, so a little goes a long way.  Will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> Did not help my lashes look longer, fuller, or darker .</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. It was alittle to wet at first but after a week or so it dried alittle and now it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The formula is good, it isn&#x27;t too dry or too wet straight away. There also is minimal flaking. However, I wish that they had made a change to the wand. If they had flipped one of the combs so that the &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; meant for the outer corner lashes was put it at the top, you wouldn&#x27;t have to switch hands to get full use of the brush. Overall a good product.</li>

            <li> This is my fave mascara, it gives me the dramatic length and volume I prefer.</li>
            <li> Finally! An inexpensive mascara that does EXACTLY what it says it will do. My lashes look gorgeous. And the brush really is unique; I think that&#x27;s what makes the difference. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Long lasting, no smudging, brilliant length and thickness added to lashes!</li>
            <li> In my life long quest to find the perfect mascara, this comes pretty darn close!  Lengthening without fibers or clumps, helps to individualize my lashes, very black (that&#x27;s a good thing), &amp; has definite staying power!  Very pleased!</li>
