            <li>I love this brand of sunblock.</li>
            <li>I even sprayed it on my part so the top of my head wouldn&#x27;t burn and it wasn&#x27;t too greasy.  </li>
            <li>I did not burn and we were out on the water most of the day.</li>

            <li>There&#x27;s no need to rub it in - yes, we do use a light rub after spraying to even the distribution</li>
            <li>Easy spray sunblock, perfect for the pasty lazy</li>
            <li>Friendly to my skin - I tend to be allergic to things on my skin that contain perfumes</li>
            <li>I tried several spray sunblock and Neutrogena is really good and what I prefer to use.</li>
            <li>Amazon sent Neutrogena Cool Mist Sunblock to my home quickly after I</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly, before it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>but, even if you spray it in a room, the smell goes away rather quickly and while it stays it&#x27;s not</li>
            <li>easy to apply, feels great, does the job--perfect product for lazily applying lotion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has SPF 70 or not, but it did make my skin shinny, and screened the hot sun light.</li>
            <li>have very fair skin and tend to burn easily and spent the weekend outdoors sitting in the sun with no major burn except a spot where the spray must have been too light on my foot.  </li>
            <li>It runs out quickly, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It is very good and skin friendly, I like it very much, while the shipping is slow as I waited for two weeks to get it.</li>
            <li>Effective for several hours - even after swimming.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and dries instantly.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I stood outside my car and sprayed--after making sure the wind was blowing in the right direction.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, stay on the skin and does cool your skin if you have been outside in the sun and forgot to reapply sunscreen.</li>
            <li>When I use this, I never burn and it is so easy to put on..and no mess.</li>
            <li>But it really hard to clean up which resisted to water and good for swimmers</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s speedy delivery, I have two containers!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s probably worth noting that this is a Helioplex-based sunblock, which is the main ingredient.</li>
            <li>My only caveat is that there is a pretty strong smell from the aerosol agent so one must be careful when using the product near anyone sensitive to scents (make sure you are spraying downwind, even if there are very mild breezes).  </li>
            <li>We normally use the SPF 45 version at home by the pool and this one at the beach - and it&#x27;s been good enough in places such as Florida or Mexico.</li>
            <li>And it indeed refreshes you and protects very well.</li>
            <li>I have sun sensitivity and the sun protection works really well.  </li>
            <li>Nothing much to say.</li>
            <li>Did very well for a trip to Thailand.</li>
            <li>i liked how this is a spray and is easy for applying and reapplying, unfortunately it leaves a oily shine.</li>
            <li>We - as in the entire family - have been using Neutrogena&#x27;s sunblock spray for at least 3 years and we&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
            <li>I probably should have renewed the spray on the second day since I was in the sun for more than 6 hours but used the spray that morning but still only had the mildest reddening of the skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended over applying sun screen lotions.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Less oily and messy than traditional sunblocks, and the best of the spray-on ones that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as oily as other products and find it&#x27;s easy to re-apply while out and about, because it doesn&#x27;t need to be rubbed on.</li>
            <li>Besides helping us avoid sunburns, and it does, there are a few more reasons that made this product our favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dry, cool mist that doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t strong or typical of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>(although beware of the wind if you apply on the beach) or if you have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This one does not have a very strong smell like some other spray bottle from other brands or</li>
            <li>but I would NOT have this applied anywhere near my eyes because if it does run into your eyes it WILL hurt.</li>
            <li>That smell is just initial and to be a substitute for the more harsh smell.</li>
            <li>Swimming pool friendly (see above) - not much oil in it, which allows our entire family to use the pool with the sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call applying sunblock &#x27;fun&#x27; but spraying is less of a chore than rubbing it</li>
            <li>We are having a very early summer, so I couldn&#x27;t find this product in our local drugstores.</li>
            <li>it a little more sticky than other brand.</li>

            <li> This arrived quickly, before it was supposed to. It smells amazing. It is my go to sunscreen. It runs out quickly, but it&#x27;s worth it.

            <li> It was almost out of date product and they did not inform me in advance.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  I use it on the Harley, mowing the yard, fishing, whatever....It goes on nice and cool and NOT sticky.  I think it must do it&#x27;s SPF job...I seem to last longer before I feel anything.  I do try to cover up a lot with sun shirts and hats...but when I don&#x27;t I feel this does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year I ordered a 2 pack with Prime shipping for what I paid for one this year....but I do think it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I use sunscreen year &#x27;round, but it&#x27;s essential in summer. We are having a very early summer, so I couldn&#x27;t find this product in our local drugstores. Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s speedy delivery, I have two containers! I prefer this product for application to my neck, chest, upper back, arms and legs. It&#x27;s not as oily as other products and find it&#x27;s easy to re-apply while out and about, because it doesn&#x27;t need to be rubbed on. Yesterday I stood outside my car and sprayed--after making sure the wind was blowing in the right direction. Another plus: This product has never stained my clothing. Also, I don&#x27;t mind the shine that others have mentioned, because I don&#x27;t use it on my face. I use an oil-free product specifically formulated for the face. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received Suncreen, instead of Sunblock. The cans were also dent.</li>
            <li> Bought several bottles of this sunblock for a vacation for my wife. She breaks out when tanning if she uses any other brand. Hard to beat what works, no sun burns or break out with this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say. Easy to use and carry. Did very well for a trip to Thailand. Will recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I tried several spray sunblock and Neutrogena is really good and what I prefer to use. Easy to apply, stay on the skin and does cool your skin if you have been outside in the sun and forgot to reapply sunscreen. I would recommend this index (SFP 70) for the beach (although beware of the wind if you apply on the beach) or if you have a very sensitive skin. It exist in lower index that I have used in the past as well. This one does not have a very strong smell like some other spray bottle from other brands or Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Never got a sunburn again!</li>
            <li> Easy spray sunblock, perfect for the pasty lazy outdoorsman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick one up today, or suffer the wrath of the evil burning ball in the sky.</li>
            <li> I hate sunscreen. I find this one tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t feel like rubbing yourself with crisco.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a beach trip in 1993.&lt;br /&gt;4. No one has to touch you to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;5. It keeps sunburn at bay.</li>
            <li> This product truly works to prevent sunburn.  It soothes the face and body from over exposure.  Definitely worth the price. Amazon sent Neutrogena Cool Mist Sunblock to my home quickly after I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you, Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  JWS</li>
            <li> Less oily and messy than traditional sunblocks, and the best of the spray-on ones that I&#x27;ve tried. Though, it really IS cooling so be warned if you spray it on in a cold room.</li>
